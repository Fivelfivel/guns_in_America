msnbc10,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/army-veteran-its-time-vets-speak-about-guns,"Every member of the United States military swears an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For most service members, that oath doesn’t expire when they take off their uniforms and become veterans. Army veteran Christopher Mintz demonstrated as much last month when he charged—unarmed—toward a gunman at an Oregon community college. However, Mintz’s laudable actions overshadowed the story of a different veteran also on campus that day.

John Parker, an Air Force veteran, was in another location on the Umpqua campus when he learned of the active shooter. Parker was carrying a concealed firearm but chose to not engage the shooter. Parker later explained that “not knowing where SWAT was on their response time, they wouldn’t know who we were, and if we had our guns ready to shoot, they’d think we were the bad guys.”

Firearms have the ability to take life, and in the military we take that seriously. Unfortunately, many of our lawmakers don’t.

The discipline Parker exercised didn’t come part and parcel with being a gun owner. Rather, Parker did the right thing because of his military training. Like every member of the military, Parker was trained on how to properly carry, clear, disassemble, clean, reassemble, load, aim, discharge, and safely store any firearm for which he was accountable. Because of his tactical training, Parker knew that, oftentimes, proper use of a firearm means not shooting.

The military asks this much of anyone allowed to possess a firearm, because firearms are lethal. Firearms have the ability to take life, and in the military we take that seriously. Unfortunately, many of our lawmakers don’t, and it’s time that veterans step forward and have our voices heard on the matter.

I too swore an oath to defend this country. Now, I am asking my fellow veterans help protect our citizens against firearm-related fatalities and injuries. Veterans – especially those who are gun owners – must speak up. Veterans must speak as voters, advocates, safety trainers, and examples of responsible gun owners. When it comes to firearms, people trust us because we’ve been trained extensively on how to use a lethal weapon responsibly.

Veterans should think back on how much training it took to earn the right to carry a weapon in the military. We should at least promote similar common-sense measures for the people who are allowed to carry guns in the neighborhoods where our kids play. Veterans know what common sense gun laws are, because they look a lot like the rules we used in the military to keep ourselves safe.

view photo essay Honoring those who serve Scenes from Veterans Day events around the country.

In the military, weapons do not get lost or stolen. Losing track of your weapon in an unthinkable scenario with consequences to match. As veterans, we need to tell lawmakers to make sure all that gun owners maintain accountability or face consequences for lost guns.

More Americans have been killed by firearms in the last half century than all fatalities in all of our country’s wars, combined. If veterans are not holding all gun owners to some of the basic gun safety standards that we learned in the military, then we are failing to uphold our oath. Many of us fought for our country overseas; now veterans have a chance to speak up and start fighting to save lives here at home.

msnbc11,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/was-gun-used-crime,"On Sunday in New Orleans, Laderika Smith, 28, returned from the store to find her five-year-old daughter bloodied and lying on the bedroom floor with a gunshot wound to her head. The girl soon died. Her mother has been charged with Relative Cruelty to a Juvenile. She has not yet entered a plea.

“It is all too common,” Doctor Gary A. Smith, president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance, told msnbc. “Children are curious. They watch TV cartoons and a make-believe world,” he added. When kids see guns, “they don’t recognize the danger.”

Smith’s daughter fatally shot herself with a .38 revolver that her mother kept in the home, as Smith admitted to New Orleans police. For decades, a .38 revolver was the firearm most commonly used in crimes, according to ATF studies including a July 2000 report, which is the last time that the ATF issued any comprehensive report. Instead, for more than 12 years– since the first inauguration of President George W. Bush in 2001–the ATF has provided little or no such national data to the public.

“Why was it stopped for over 10 years?” ATF Acting Deputy Chief of Public Affairs Donna Sellers told msnbc. “I cannot really answer why a decision was made to stop publishing that information,” she added. “The decision was made this year to increase transparency and provide the public with more thorough information on crime guns.”

On June 19, the ATF published its findings for Firearms Trace Data for 2012. Data for previous years posted on the ATF website’s statistics page include no more than very general information for each state along with the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands, making in difficult to discern national trends of the types of firearms used in crimes, or where they were bought.

The data for 2012 includes nationally aggregated summaries including “Firearms Types” and “Top Calibers” of weapons “Recovered and Traced” in crimes, along with data on where the weapons used in crimes were purchased and where they ended up, and how long they have been in circulation.

“Tracing crime guns provides critical information that assists domestic and international law enforcement,” Sellers told msnbc.

Most “crime guns,” as ATF officials call them, end up in circulation for just over 11 years. Another trend that emerges from the data is that a .38 caliber handgun has become only the fifth most common caliber of firearm used in crimes (19,425) in 2012, after the 9 millimeter (42,560) of roughly the same size, the smaller .22 caliber handgun (34,130) long ago dubbed as a “Saturday night special,” and the far more powerful .40 caliber handgun (20,674), and the 12-gauge shotgun (20,606), according to ATF statistics now available online.

The ATF’s change to release firearms tracing information is consistent with White House policies since the Newtown tragedy. In January, President Obama signed a 23-point gun control order involving various U.S. agencies to expand their reporting and other activities involving firearms and violence.

Another new trend is that pistols were the most common type of weapon used in crimes in 2012, consistent with the rising use of 9 millimeter handguns in crimes (the overwhelming majority of which are pistols), and the increasingly commercial popularity of 9 millimeter pistols like Austrian-made Glock. U.S. authorities seized a total of 119,273 pistols and 46,037 revolvers from crime scenes in 2012, according to ATF figures published last week.

The common reason given by authorities for seizing firearms from suspects was for illegal possession of a weapon at 61,501 cases, the ATF statistics show. A total of 17,239 firearms were seized for an offense involving a weapon. The average age of the suspect from which a firearm was seized was lowest in the two U.S. territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands at 28, and the District of Columbia at 29, and highest in South Dakota at 45, and Hawaii at 47.

But the flow of firearms across state lines may be the most important statistic to emerge at a time when Congress is continuing to discuss the possibility of increased gun regulations including anti-trafficking legislation. Some states supplied a great many guns used in crimes across the nation. West Virginia was the source of 1,330 crime guns in 2012, nearly half of which were used in crimes in other states.

Other states supplied few guns but ended up being the place where many guns were used in crimes. New York supplied 2,153 guns used in crimes across the nation, and ended up having more than twice as many firearms, 4,850, recovered in crimes inside the state."
msnbc12,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/cruz-acknowledges-dismisses-reality,"The right’s favorite talking point on expanded background checks is pretty straightforward: the popular, bipartisan proposal must be defeated because it’ll create a national gun registry. Reality proves this is the exact opposite of the truth, but the NRA’s allies keep saying it anyway.

Today, in an interesting twist, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) grudgingly acknowledged the truth, only to dismiss it in the next breath. For those who can’t watch clips online, Cruz told Capitol Hill reporters:

“I don’t disagree that on its face, the currently pending legislation does not purport to create a national gun registry. But the Department of Justice has been explicit that when you require background checks for private firearms transactions, the only way to make that effective is through a national gun registry. So if the bill that is pending on the floor of the Senate passed, the next step in the process would be that critics would say, ‘Well this isn’t effective. We don’t know if you’re selling your firearm to someone else unless we know you have your firearm.’ “And in my judgment a federal registry of firearms – the federal government keeping a list of every firearm that is lawfully owned by every law-abiding citizen – would be terrible policy and would be inconsistent with the Constitution.”

So, there is no federal registry. The legislation explicitly prohibits a federal registry. Under the pending bill, anyone even trying to create a federal registry would be a felon, subject to 15 years behind bars. No one has even proposed the possibility of a federal registry. But Cruz and his allies are convinced one will organically evolve to prevent private gun sales, even though the Manchin/Toomey measure targets gun shows and online sales.

In other words, Congress has to kill one idea, because there’s a paranoid fantasy about the possibility of a different idea coming up at some point in the future.

If this sounds familiar, it’s what unhinged critics of the Affordable Care Act said about “death panels.” Sure, there’s nothing in the proposal that would create “death panels,” but if you close one eye, tilt your head, and use your imagination, you’ll see it’s possible to envision a system in which the federal government starts murdering senior citizens.

This is no way for a mature democracy and ostensible superpower to debate public policy."
msnbc13,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/look-back-gun-control-history,"In 1994, the Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. The key factor in the major Democratic loss pointed to the federal assault weapons ban that was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994. A part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the assault weapons ban banned semiautomatic weapons from having two or more military features, and placed a ten-year ban on the sale of assault weapons and large ammunition magazines. The ‘94 election was significant because gun control became a deciding factor in the election and wedged two ideologically distant parties further apart.

In 2004, a report to the U.S. Justice Department that assessed the impact of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban on gun markets and gun violence found that “… the most important feature of military-style weapons may be their ability to accept [large-capacity magazines], and this feature has been addressed by the LCM ban and the LCMM rifle ban. Whether changing other features of military-style firearms will produce measurable benefits is unknown.”

Earlier this week, President Obama and the House Democratic Caucus vowed to reduce gun violence by focusing on the following four areas–closing background check loopholes, banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, providing schools with safety resources, and increasing access to mental health services. But the history of gun legislation has shown that one bill does not prevent another massacre from occurring and fuels a recurring pattern.

After a mass shooting, political leaders call for action, then introduce bills that drag out legislative battles, and a law riddled with loopholes finally gets signed. But manufacturers have found ways around even those laws that are deemed legislative milestones: fter the law defined what an assault weapon was, manufacturing companies came up with modified designs and built weapons that became somewhat mainstream. Because the assault weapons ban did not outlaw the sale of semiautomatic rifles and handguns that had been manufactured before 1994, the country quickly discovered that the ban wasn’t all that effective.

For example, Connecticut’s assault weapons ban allowed the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle Nancy Lanza purchased and kept in her home, easily accessible to her unstable son. He used the gun to shoot 20 children and six educators dead. The state ban was modeled after the 1994 federal assault weapons ban.

Mother Jones researched the gun violence of the past 30 years and found that since 1982, there have been at least 62 mass shootings. Twenty-five of these shootings occurred since 2006, and seven took place in 2012. What’s striking is that most of the killers obtained their guns legally.

Generally, the gun control versus the gun rights debate exists focuses on an individual’s right to bear arms and the government’s obligation to counter violence and crime. The wording of the Second Amendment–specifically “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”–seems unambiguous but in fact the interpretation of the law has evolved.

In the 18th and 19th century, armed civilians used guns as a means of survival and protection from foreign enemies. As westward expansion occurred, frontiersman used guns to arm themselves against Native Americans and potential threats in the uncharted territories. Then in 1927, Congress outlawed the mail-order sale of guns or concealed firearms after mob violence broke out from Prohibition. However, mob violence escalated so quickly with the usage of Tommy guns in gang wars that Congress passed the National Firearms Act of 1934, which taxed firearms under 18 inches and on machine guns and required gun registration. This act became the first federal gun-control law.

President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination spurred leaders to pass the Gun Control Act of 1968. This act prohibited the sale of guns to convicted felons, drug users and the mentally ill, and also required firearm dealers to obtain licenses and imposed interstate sale restrictions. The law also raised the age to legally purchase a handgun to 21.

Although the ATF was granted expanded power, the NRA became increasingly agitated, prompting the gun lobby to create a new lobbying branch, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which aimed to nullify the 1968 law. In 1986, President Reagan signed the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act which eased the penalties from the 1968 law, banned a federal registry of gun owners, and disallowed the ATF’s power to inspect gun dealers.

But the gun culture changed again in 1981 when John Hinckley, Jr. tried to assassinate President Reagan and nearly killed his press secretary James Brady instead. He and his wife Sarah became activists. “You can begin to see a sea change of attitudes during this time,” said Sarah Brady. “The NRA was fighting against the cop-killing bullets and plastic guns, and we got into an alliance with law enforcement and we just got together and said, ‘What’s the first thing we should do?’ And we all said, ‘Background checks.’”

In 1991, Ronald Reagan said at a ceremony at George Washington University: “I want to tell all of you here today something that I’m not sure you know. You do know that I’m a member of the NRA. My position on right to bear arms is well known. But I want you to know something else. And I’m going to say it in clear unmistakable language. I support the Brady bill and I urge the Congress to enact it.”

The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed in 1993. This law created a system for background checks of licensed gun buyers, which was maintained by the FBI.

Although this national system prevented convicted criminals and potentially violent people from purchasing handguns, a loophole existed. The 1993 act did not cover private sales from one individual to another. In 1993, 57% of people surveyed by the Pew Research Center said that controlling gun ownership was more important than protecting gun rights; in 2012, the percentage went down to 47%.

In 2004, President George W. Bush said, “I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don’t get in the hands of people that shouldn’t have them.”

Ten years earlier, his father wrote a letter to the NRA just two weeks after the Oklahoma City bombing, resigning as a life member of the NRA. And while Ronald Reagan was the Governor of California, he stated his view on guns in May of 1967 when Black Panther Party members walked into the California Statehouse carrying rifles to protest a gun-control bill. “There’s no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons.”

Former Nixon speechwriter, William Safire, wrote in 1999 how Nixon felt about gun control. “His on-the-record reply: ”Guns are an abomination.’ Free from fear of gun owners’ retaliation at the polls, he favored making handguns illegal and requiring licenses for hunting rifles.”

Now, with the recent Newtown shootings, the issue of gun control and gun rights has returned to national prominence. Americans purchased a record number of guns in 2012 and gun makers have reported a record high in demand. Firearm sales have surged recently as politicians have urged stricter gun laws and a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban following the shooting in Connecticut.

TIME published a list of the worst mass shootings in the last 50 years, excluding Newtown; 15 of the 25 worst mass shootings took place in the United States. Recent research from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center linked guns and homicide and found evidence that shows that more guns means more homicides. Internationally, America is a much more violent country, as Duke University’s Kieran Healy points out in this graph.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicates that 56% believe that the laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter, as opposed to 42% who believe laws should be less strict or kept the same. This 56% number is the highest since 2006, but is still less than the 60-70% who supported stricter laws during the 1990s, including when the federal assault weapons ban was enacted in 1994. Additionally, 69% said that being able to purchase assault and military style firearms played “a good or great role in recent mass shootings”; 38% said it played little to no role. Lastly, 59% said that the availability of high capacity ammunition clips played a good or great role and 39% said it played little to no role.

The poll presents an even larger divide between Republicans and Democrats. The Republican House seems unlikely to budge on gun control, but perhaps a reminder of the Nixon-Reagan-Bush stances on gun control could prove useful."
msnbc14,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/free-guns-vulnerable-women-houston,"One Texas group wants to stop violence against women–by giving away free guns.

While the national debate over gun control rages on, the nonprofit Armed Citizen Project has begun training and arming single women and single moms with pump action shotguns. On its website, the group describes itself as “dedicated to training and arming vulnerable women” and “fighting the war on women, one free shotgun at a time.” The group is also geared toward providing residents of high-crime neighborhoods with firearms at no cost as long as they complete a 4-to-5 hour firearms class and pass a background check.

“We’re empowering citizens and creating new and responsible gun owners,” Kyle Coplen, the group’s 29-year-old founder, told msnbc on Monday. “Criminals have no intention of dying in your hallway. We think that society should use their fear to deter crime.” An early 2013 visit to the vandalized home of a World War II vet inspired Coplen to create the project, he says.

Armed Citizen Project started equipping Houston-area women with free firearms in March, then rolled out phase two, centered around the city’s Oak Forest neighborhood, in early May. It appears to be a relatively small operation at this stage–they have given away only 35 guns to date–but it’s a message that may resonate despite studies to the contrary.

Coplen argues that guns help protect citizens from potentially dangerous home invaders–an aspect that appeals to women who tend to be physically smaller than the stereotypical burly male robber. “Generally, women who live alone have reached out to us for a reason,” he said. “Having a firearm in the home is a forced equalizer.”

However, a recent study conducted by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center suggested women are in fact less safe with guns in the home. It found that women living in states with more accessibility to guns are at a greater risk for violent death via “unintentional gun deaths, suicides and homicide, particularly firearm suicides and firearm homicides.”

A 2003 study from the University of Pennsylvania indicated that a woman with a gun in her home was nearly three times more likely to be murdered compared to a woman without a gun in the home.

Coplen said the reaction from the community has been “overwhelmingly positive,” especially from law enforcement officials in Texas. Not that that matters, he added: “I really have no interest from hearing elected officials on this.”

Houston City Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who represents Oak Forest, does not see the increased distribution of guns as an effective tool to prevent gun crime. “Statistics show that guns are more likely to be involved in an unintentional shooting than in a self-defense shooting,” said Cohen in an emailed statement to msnbc. “That being said, while I support the Second Amendment, I think we should focus on common-sense solutions such as universal background checks.”

Cohen said her offices received several concerned calls about the program. The group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense requested a formal meeting with her.

msnbc reached out to Houston Mayor Annise Parker’s office for a comment, but received no response.

Before launching in Houston, Coplen and his team pored over crime stats to pick a neighborhood and reached out to community members with an old-fashioned, snail mail postcard–a model they hope to replicate elsewhere.

The Armed Citizen Project has ambitious plans to expand into other cities soon: Tucson, Dallas, San Antonio, Indianapolis Detroit, Chicago, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Atlanta."

msnbc17,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-ed-show/new-gun-laws-kentucky-surprise-just-about,"Months before the murders of 20 first graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied the Kentucky legislature to pass one of the most liberal gun laws in the nation. Only 10 lawmakers in both houses voted against the bill last summer and it quietly took effect at the beginning of this year. In fact, the law took effect so quietly it took transportation officials, security guards and firefighters by surprise.

One of the best investigative reporters I’ve ever worked with, Duane Pohlman, has put together a series of stories for WLKY/Hearst about how this new gun legislation has turned Kentucky into what one lawmaker called the “new wild west”. They’re worth watching. For instance, people can bring guns, but not knives into Louisville’s City Hall.

Guns are legal on public buses, according to the state lawmaker who wrote it, though transportation officials have decided to enforce a gun ban anyway.

Firefighters in special districts are given extra rights to carry concealed weapons. Duane talked to one fire chief who explains why that could be seriously dangerous. EMTs can carry too.

I asked Duane a few questions about the law and his reports:

Ed Show: What inspired you to investigate the change in the gun law? Anything beyond fully reporting on the basic change in the law? Duane Pohlman: It wasn’t much to investigate the law and its effect, but getting clear answers was difficult. The law was overwhelmingly and quietly passed by the Kentucky legislature in the Summer of ’12, with backing from the NRA. It was so quiet that many of the public officials and entities were caught off guard when it took effect this January. I received several calls from fire chiefs and mid-level managers who were in disbelief when they were informed. They called me to get some answers. That led to this simple series of stories laying out the law and its impacts. Ed Show: I was surprised that the guard in your first story wasn’t armed with a gun, that knives were not allowed, and that one fire chief is worried about guns on his own crew. What, if anything, surprised you about the response to the law change? Duane Pohlman: Everything! I could not believe this had passed and passed so overwhelmingly (only 10 votes opposed in both houses). I was surprised that Kentucky’s constitution provided more protections than the US Constitution, allowing guns to be carried for personal and property protection. I was surprised by the lack of caring about allowing open guns in urban areas. Above all, I was stunned by the lack of media attention to this issue, which I believe led to it quietly being passed. Ed Show: You reported that public transportation does not allow concealed-carry. If some organizations make exceptions to Kentucky’s law, does it become hard for regular citizens to figure out where they can and cannot carry? Duane Pohlman: It will be hard for citizens to know where they can bring their guns because, frankly, the political leaders are still scurrying for answers. For instance, TARC, the mass transit system in Louisville, is continuing its ban on guns on its buses, though the Executive Director tells me TARC leaders are still researching the legal ramifications of continuing the ban. In addition, I have been told by other leaders they truly don’t know how it applies in places where public gatherings occur. About the only places guaranteed (for now) not to be gun free zones in Kentucky are schools, colleges and universities, and prisons. Again, many of the leaders say they were simply caught off guard when the law took effect and are still sorting it all out. The author of Kentucky’s new gun law, State Rep. Bob Damron, D-Nicholasville, makes it clear. “ I feel more comfortable when citizens have a weapon to protect themselves because, chances are, they’ll protect me as well,” he told me. Fact is many, many people in this part of the country (and other parts) agree.



Kentucky is clearly out-pacing the rest of the nation in allowing citizens to carry guns in public places. The question is, will other states follow?"

Durham County District Attorney Roger Echols on Feb. 25 filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty against the suspect, Craig Hicks, 46, of Chapel Hill, the assistant, Candy Clark, told msnbc. A hearing is expected in early April.

Hicks has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his three neighbors. A Durham County grand jury also indicted Hicks on one count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling.

A preliminary investigation of the shooting deaths suggested the slayings were motivated by an ongoing parking dispute. The victims’ families, however, insist Hicks had racially-motivated intentions. The FBI opened a parallel inquiry to determine whether any federal laws were violated. Investigators haven’t ruled out classifying the killings as a hate crime.

Hicks turned himself into authorities after the shooting.

Hicks was appointed a lawyer. He was expected to appear in court on Monday, but the hearing was postponed until Tuesday."

msnbc24,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/lindsey-graham-his-ar-15-and-the-rodney-kin,"Lawless behavior in the wake of the Rodney King riots—including “marauding gangs” that were “raping” the women of Koreatown—justifies the need for an AR-15 assault rifle in your home arsenal, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham.

The South Carolina Republican delivered that assertion, during Wednesday’s Senate judiciary committee hearing on gun violence in America while challenging the notion Congress should regulate the size of firearm magazines.

Graham cited a question that came during the Google Hangout his “good friend” and vice president Joe Biden held last week on the topic of guns. “What if there’s an earthquake out here and there’s a lawless situation,” Graham said, inaccurately paraphrasing the question from video blogger Philip DeFranco.

Graham then invoked the six days of racially charged rioting that followed the Rodney King verdict and resulted in 53 deaths, thousands of arrests, and ultimately a military presence on the streets to restore calm.

“In 1992 you had the riots in Los Angeles, I think it was the King event, but you could find yourself in this country in a lawless environment through a natural disaster or a riot,” Graham said, making his own jump from earthquake to race riot.

“And the story was about a place called Koreatown,” the Senator said. “There were marauding gangs going through the area, burning stores, looting and robbing,” he continued, with a pause, “and raping.”

Evidence of “marauding gangs” who were “raping” the women of Koreatown is hard to find—and may not exist at all. Two scholars who have written extensively on the Los Angeles riots, which marked a 20-year anniversary in 2012, characterized Graham’s imagery as “unfounded hyperbole” and “political theater.”

To Graham, however, this violent moment in American history 2400 miles away from South Carolina, requires big at-home firepower.

“And the vice president said, in response to—that’s why I want my AR-15 [again, an inaccurate characterization of DeFranco’s question]—he said no, you would be better off with a 12-guage shotgun. Well, that’s his opinion, and I respect it.”

Of course, he also disagrees with it.

“I have an AR-15 at home and I haven’t hurt anybody and I don’t intend to use it,” he flexed. “But I think I would be better off protecting my business or my family if there was law and order breakdown in my community, people roaming around my neighborhood to have the AR-15, and I don’t think that makes me an unreasonable person.”

The political motivation of Graham’s casual description of “marauding gangs” of rapists was further exposed in his strident defense of gun advocate Gayle Trotter, who called the AR-15 the weapon of choice for “millions” of American women and testified that women need high capacity weapons to protect themselves and their children.

“When you start telling me that I’m unreasonable for wanting that women to have more than six bullets, or to have an AR-15 with people roaming around my neighborhood, I reject the concept,” he said."
msnbc25,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-gun-the-heart-the-assault-weapons-d,"National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre is set to appear Wednesday morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee. His testimony, released Tuesday, repeats the same tired ideas that he has already articulated and that much of the nation has already rejected, including putting armed guards or police in schools. And he makes a pragmatic-sounding case for avoiding action, saying we all need “to be honest about what works–and what doesn’t work.”

LaPierre also defends military-style semi-automatic weapons, which gun-control backers in Congress recently introduced legislation to ban. “Semi-automatic firearms have been around for over 100 years,” he tells lawmakers. “They are among the most popular guns made for hunting, target shooting and self-defense.”

The firearm at the heart of the “assault weapons” debate is a Bushmaster AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. A Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was used last month in the Newtown, Conn. shootings that killed 27. Ten days later in Webster, New York, a man set to fire to his house and used a Bushmaster AR-15 to kill two responding firefighters before killing himself. An AR-15 was also used in last summer’s shooting at a Batman movie theater premiere in Aurora, Colo., and a decade ago in and around Washington by the D.C. sniper.

It’s less suited for hunting and home defense, although some people do use it for both purposes, and more ideally suited for other, more complex scenarios ranging from defending against rioters and looters, participating in the demanding sport of High Power target shooting, or arming oneself to deter police or military forces in the case of a citizens’ insurrection. The popularity of Bushmaster rifles also makes them excellent money-makers for gun manufacturers, too.

Designed as a civilian version of the fully automatic M-16 rifle, issued to American soldiers since the Vietnam war, the AR-15 is named after the original manufacturer, Armalite; the AR does not refer to “assault rifle,” as some have erroneously suggested. The same weapon did appear, however, in the Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Assault Weapons, until pressure from the NRA and gun manufacturers demanded that the author change the digest’s title for his next edition to a Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Tactical Rifles.

Gun-rights supporters have rushed to defend the weapon. In a piece titled “The AR-15: The Gun Liberals Love to Hate,” NRA president David Keene wrote online last month that gun-banning politicians and journalists don’t “understand the nature of the firearms they would ban, their popularity or legitimate uses.”

Some people do use a Bushmaster AR-15 to hunt. But most Bushmaster AR-15’s fire small, but high-powered rounds that can make it difficult to stop a deer or other big game without multiple shots. Only in the past decade or so have AR-15 rifles have become good enough to match the accuracy of most other hunting rifles, and many hunters still seem divided over what some derisively call “black guns.” A few years ago, Field & Stream posed the question in an online forum, Are assault rifles for hunting? One young, but experienced hunter searching for middle ground, wrote:

“I am NOT ‘buying into’ liberal media’s ideas. I don’t mind one bit if someone wants to hunt with a[n] AR-15. I just have a personal opinion about them and their place in hunting,” wrote longliner13, describing himself as a young man and avid hunter. “If you enjoy hunting with an assault rifle, great. Do it. I have myself. But I just have the strong opinion that the AR-15 is not necessary in the field.”

What about for home defense? Most experts, along with many others, recommend keeping either a handgun or shotgun over any other long rifle in a house or apartment. The tight confines of any residence make it difficult to wield a long rifle. And if a long gun were still preferred, a shotgun is both easier to aim and more effective at short-range. While the Bushmaster’s high-powered, small rounds could end up penetrating walls and putting family members or neighbors at risk.

Outside the home, however, over more open ground, a Bushmaster AR-15 might be ideal for self-defense. Many gun-rights activists still point to a 1992 video on YouTube of ethnic Korean store owners and other men on the rooftop of their retail business to defend against looters during the riots over the Rodney King police beating trial. Although the store’s defenders appear to have been armed with only rifles and shotguns, there is no doubt that a Bushmaster rifle capable of firing up to 45 rounds a minute would be an effective deterrent against multiple assailants in a riot or other lawless scenario.

There is one area, however, where a military-designed, semi-automatic rifle like the Bushmaster AR-15 does clearly excel. High Power Competition target shooting is now more common than traditional benchrest shooting competitions “by a huge margin,” according to one expert and blogger. “[T]here are no mechanical crutches in High Power—your arms and body must support the full weight of the rifle as you engage the target from a variety of positions,” placing “a premium on good eyesight, training, and overall fitness.”

The Bushmaster AR-15 is among the weapons of choice for High Power Competition. Shooters fire from standing, sitting, kneeling and prone positions, firing up to 20 rounds at a time. Competitions organized by the NRA have helped make High Power shooting competitions a fast growing sport. The proposed legislation to ban many military-style semi-automatic rifles and limit high capacity magazines announced last week by California Sen. Feinstein would at least alter, if not threaten the future of this expanding field of American gun culture.

Why else might someone need a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle? Perhaps so armed citizens might one day deter, if not overthrow a future tyrannical government. This may sound like rhetoric, but it has been the position of modern NRA leaders and other Second Amendment activists for years. “They’re God-given freedoms. They belong to us as our birthright. No government ever gave them to us and no government can ever take them away,” said NRA chief LaPierre last week in Reno.

Since gun control has come under debate in the wake of the Newtown Sandy Hook shooting, similar views have flooded the Internet. “Hunting is a BI-PRODUCT of #2ndAmendment. The #RightToBearArms is TO DEFEND Self, Family & #USA from MURDERING MEN or #Government. #tcop #GOP,” tweeted last week @johnmatthew19, a self-described “Christian,American,Father,builder”.

Another purpose that Bushmaster rifles serve is to make profits for their manufacturer. Bushmaster rifles have made record sales in the wake of the Newtown grade school massacre. The Bushmaster AR-15 retails for about $1,048.99, making it more expensive that most traditional hunting rifles. People who buy it also tend to buy and use more ammunition. “They are fun, accurate, don’t kick, and before you know it, you’ve sent $100 worth of ammunition downrange with a few twitches of your trigger finger,” wrote one Field & Stream columnist.

The rising popularity of the Bushmaster AR-15 has helped make Remington Arms and its North Carolina-based parent company, Freedom Group, one of the nation’s largest and most profitable gun manufacturing consortiums. To continue sales, Freedom Group quietly collaborates with the gun lobby. In 2011, the same year a new CEO, George Kollitides II, took over Freedom Group, Kollitides was appointed to the NRA’s Nominating Committee to hand-pick candidates for elections to the NRA’s current board of directors, as I reported two weeks ago in Mother Jones. Freedom Group has grown from making nearly $80 million in profits five years ago to making an average of almost $250 million a year since 2009, much of it from sales of Bushmaster rifles.

“Bushmaster was one of the first companies to introduce modern sporting rifles to the consumer market,” reads Freedom Group’s last available annual report, “a market that is growing faster than the general firearms industry.”"

msnbc28,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/jared-michael-padgett-oregon-shooting,"Police have identified the gunman in Tuesday’s deadly shooting at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon as Jared Michael Padgett, a 15-year-old freshman at the school.

On Wednesday afternoon, police told reporters that Padgett arrived at the school Tuesday morning on a school bus carrying a guitar case and a duffel bag. Police said they believe the case and bag contained the weapons found with the shooter’s body – an AR-15 rifle, a semi-automatic handgun and a large knife, along with nine loaded ammunition magazines “with the capability of holding several hundred rounds.”

Police said only the AR-15 rifle was used during the attack and that Padgett was also wearing a “non-ballistic vest used for carrying ammunition and other items” and a camouflaged helmet.

According to Troutdale Police Chief Scott Anderson, after arriving at the school, Padgett entered the gym and went into the boys’ locker room, where he shot and killed 14-year-old Emilio Hoffman, also a freshman.

“We have not established any link between the shooter and the victim,” said Chief Anderson.

Anderson said after killing Hoffman, Padgett hit Reynolds High School gym teacher Todd Rispler with a “grazing wound” to the hip. According to police, Rispler then fled the locker room and made his way to the school’s office to tell his colleagues what was happening and initiate the school’s emergency lockdown procedure.

Commending Rispler and his police force, Anderson said, “I cannot emphasize enough the role that Mr. Rispler and the responding officers played in saving many, many lives yesterday.”

After leaving the gym, Padgett encountered responding officers in a school hallway, according to Anderson, and he exchanged gunfire with at least one of them before hiding in a bathroom. That is where Padgett was found by authorities dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“The shooter obtained the weapons from his family home,” Anderson told reporters. “The weapons had been secured, but he defeated the security measures.”

“At this time it would be inappropriate to discuss a possible motive for the murder,” he added."

msnbc40,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/miles-ferguson-another-young-man-shot-police,"A St. Louis police officer fatally shot a young black man on Wednesday night, sparking protests in the south of the city just a day before thousands of protesters are expected to arrive in Ferguson, Missouri for rallies and marches over the killing of Michael Brown.

The young man—described by police as an 18-year-old black man—was fatally wounded while being pursued by an officer who had observed him acting suspiciously and pursued him. The man shot at the officer “at least three times” during the chase; the officer fired 17 shots at the man.

The shooting—16 miles from the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson—set off protests overnight, threatening to aggravate the precarious relations between the communities and police ahead of an emotionally charged weekend.

Photo essay: As Ferguson readies for more protesters, a look back

Brown’s shooting on Aug. 9 prompted days of demonstrations in Ferguson, which worsened when police armed themselves with military-style weapons and equipment, cracking down on protests with tear gas and arrests. Ferguson has become a symbol for those who see Brown’s death as a symptom of discriminatory policing and excessive force. When Ferguson’s own police department struggled to control the protests, it was St. Louis’ police force that took over security.

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters around 1 a.m. CT that an officer, a six-year veteran of the force, was off-duty and working a side job as a security guard when he saw three young men acting suspiciously. After a “physical altercation” between the officer and the man, the fire fight began. It’s unclear how many times the officer’s bullets hit the suspect; the officer was unharmed. A 9mm Ruger was recovered at the scene, as were three projectiles in the direction of the officer.

Dotson said the suspect was known to police, though he wouldn’t elaborate, suggesting that the deceased had a juvenile record.

Calls for demonstrations were spread on social media; police shut down streets to make space for the protests. No protesters were arrested, but several police cars were damaged. At last check, 50 protesters were still demonstrating, Dotson told reporters, promising to protect their ability to police.

The shooting is just the latest in a summer of high-profile incidents between African-Americans and white police officers, a number of which have been fatal.

msnbc42,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/two-nypd-officers-shot-the-bronx,"Two NYPD officers responding to a robbery call were shot in the Bronx late Monday night, police and law enforcement sources say.

A law enforcement source said it appears one officer was shot in the back and the other shot in the arm and stomach near East 184th Street and Tiebout Avenue in the Fordham section shortly after 10:30 p.m.

Police say the officers were not targeted.

The unidentified officers were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital where they are in stable condition, and are expected to be OK, the NYPD said. Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived at the hospital after midnight Tuesday, but it was unclear if he was scheduled to address the media.

Preliminary investigation indicates the anti-crime officers, who were in plain clothes, were responding to a call about a commercial robbery, a police source said.

Investigators are looking for two possible suspects who may have fled in a car, crashed it and abandoned it a couple of blocks away from the scene before fleeing on foot, police sources said. The gun used in the shooting was recovered near the scene.

The shootings happened just hours after the mayor and the police commissioner held a joint news conference to tout record low crime levels, with overall crime down 4 percent from last year. But shootings were up 13 percent, which NYPD officials admitted were “an area of concern.”

City Speaker Melissa Mark-Vivitero released a statement Tuesday morning thanking the two officers for their service and wishing them a speedy recovery.

“Every day, New York’s police officers risk their lives keeping New Yorkers safe and we are very grateful for their service, dedication and commitment,” she said.

Last month, NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot and killed while sitting in a patrol car in Brooklyn, fueling tension between police and City Hall. Police unions have blamed Mayor de Blasio for permitting protests over police conduct that has, in turn, fostered an anti-NYPD atmosphere they believe contributed to the killings of the officers. The family of the gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, have said he was emotionally disturbed and that the shootings had nothing to do with police retaliation.

msnbc43,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/cops-shoot-and-kill-man-holding-toy-gun-walmart,"A young man holding a toy rifle in a Wal-Mart was shot and killed on Tuesday by police in the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek, Ohio, according to Raw Story. John Crawford, 22, was carrying a toy gun he picked up in the store, alarming two other shoppers.

LeeCee Johnson, the mother of Crawford’s children, told the Dayton Daily News she was on the phone with him while he was browsing in the store. “We was just talking,” she told the Ohio newspaper. “He said he was at the video games playing videos and he went over there by the toy section where the toy guns were. And the next thing I know, he said ‘It’s not real,’ and the police start shooting and they said ‘Get on the ground,’ but he was already on the ground because they had shot him. And I could hear him just crying and screaming. I feel like they shot him down like he was not even human.”

CBS reports that two other Wal-Mart customers, April and Ronald Ritchie, saw Crawford walking around the store with what appeared to be a gun and called the police. The police station reports that officers asked Crawford to put down the weapon, and opened fire when he did not comply. He later died of his gun shot wounds at a nearby hospital, where his death was ruled a homicide by the Montgomery County coroner’s office. A request for comment by msnbc to the Beavercreek police department was not immediately returned.

The Ohio Attorney General’s office has said that the gun Crawford was carrying was an MK-177 BB/Pellet rifle, also known as a “variable pump air rifle.” Family members could not be reached for comment by msnbc.

Tasha Thomas, who identified herself as Crawford’s girlfriend, told the Dayton Daily News that she drove Crawford to the Wal-Mart and was also in the store, but was in a different aisle from Crawford when the shooting happened. He was not armed when he entered the store, she said. “He did not have any type of gun on him. It’s not fair.”

A relative told the paper the family had contacted the NAACP and the National Action Network, a civil rights group led by MSNBC’s Rev. Al Sharpton."

msnbc45,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/three-shot-ferguson-during-apparent-baltimore-related-protests,"Three people were shot during protests on Tuesday night in Ferguson, Missouri, near the area where unarmed black teen Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer last August.

The shootings, which occurred at different times, took place around Canfield Drive and West Florissant Avenue, where an estimated 300 people were walking the streets in a protest apparently triggered by recent unrest in Baltimore.

Two of the victims were shot in the neck, and one was shot in the leg. All three were reported to be stable condition, and no police officers were injured. A 20-year-old black male from St. Louis County was arrested in conjunction with one of the shootings, according to a statement released Wednesday by the City of Ferguson.

Police reportedly said that protesters also lit trash on fire, and threw rocks and asphalt, damaging police cars. Rioting and damage to one business was also reported along West Florissant Avenue in Dellwood, a city adjoining Ferguson.

The protests continued for several hours and the police remained in place until 3 a.m. on Wednesday, according to the statement."

In an exclusive interview with “NBC Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt on Wednesday, Feidin Santana said he started recording after he heard a Taser being deployed.

“I remember the police had control of the situation,” Santana said. “He had control of Scott. And Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser.”

Officer Michael Slager was arrested and charged with murder Tuesday for the fatal shooting of Walter Scott after a traffic stop on Saturday. The video appears to show Slager shooting Scott in the back as he was running away from the officer.

“As you can see in the video, the police officer just shot him in the back,” Santana said. “I knew right away, I had something on my hands.”

Santana turned the video over to Scott’s family.

North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey announced Wednesday that Slager was fired. He also ordered body cameras for the police force. Every officer on the street will wear one after a policy is established and the force is trained, Summey said.

msnbc50,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tom-swift-and-his-electric-rifle-explores-dirty-truths-about-taser,"From 2001 to 2012, there were 500 Taser-related deaths reported in the U.S., according to Amnesty International. “Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle,” which made its debut at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, tells the story of how TASER International, the company that supplies law enforcement with its namesake electroshock weapon, grew to become a corporate goliath despite mounting evidence of the product’s potential harm. The documentary takes an in-depth look at the TASER’s founding brothers, Rick and Tom Smith, and the controversial decisions behind their meteoric rise.

On Tuesday, April 21, msnbc sat down with Director Nick Berardini and Producer Brock Williams to discuss their new film and the naivete of trying to invent our way out of complex law enforcement challenges. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

MSNBC: How did you get access to TASER International and its founders Rick and Tom Smith?

Berardini: It’s tough because what I found fascinating was, as I looked into them more, they had sort of this victim’s mentality at that point. They are true believers, which makes them amazing characters. They did not really understand why at that point the public had kind of turned against them. They were starting to lose these lawsuits and they saw themselves as guys making a life-saving weapon. So that victim’s mentality really helped open them up and made them want them to speak. I gave them the promise that I would do my best to hear what they had to say and understand their perspective honestly.

MSNBC: Do you think they were aware of how public opinion toward the Taser changed over time?

Berardini: They definitely felt the pressure. When you’re a true believer, you have these opinions. They revolutionized law enforcement with Tasers. It’s been this way for a decade now since more departments have been using them and they believe wholeheartedly in that revolution. So I think they felt the weight of the damages without respecting the life involved. The liability really became an issue.

“We need to have a more evolved conversation and get to the root of these problems that we’re having with policing instead of inherently just turning to technology.” Nick Berardini, director

MSNBC: If the government had regulated the Taser, do you think the outcome would have been different?

Berardini: I think one of the movie’s powerful messages is the issue of embracing a very simple solution to a very complicated problem. Its hard to just say, “If regulators had been there then none of this would happen,” because that’s not really the way things work in the United States in order to inspire entrepreneurs. The difference is they made a weapon that fell under a consumer product and so that was not an appropriate sphere for them to be able to do that.

For example, several doctors told me offhandedly that, “If this was a medical device, this would have never made it to market.” That’s where the lapse was. So I don’t think it’s as simple as saying it never would have happened had they been appropriately regulated, because there’s no established threshold to determine what makes this Taser safe. What regulation would have done was not allow them to sort of rush to market and then become so powerful that by the time anyone noticed there was something wrong, it was already too late.

MSNBC: In the documentary you introduce Stanley Harlan, a 23-year-old who died after he was stunned for a total of 31 seconds when he was pulled over by officers for speeding. Do you think that there was a danger associated with the officers using this weapon other than a lack of training and its lethality?

Williams: I think part of the message of the film is our desire as a society to try to find a simple solution to a complex problem. You see this idea that you no longer as a police officer have to deescalate a situation and talk somebody down who is angry. You have one solution that you can turn to, and that just solves all problems. I think that was irresponsible on the part of the company to kind of sell it that way.

Berardini: Early in the film, we set up the point of view of the police while they were being introduced to the weapon after all these years. They were just enamored by this ability to play god, so to speak, and stand there and take someone to the ground without touching them. it was so exciting to them. That allowed the company to then convince them, “Hey we’re on the same team and we’re doing this together.”

Williams: Everybody seems to have this idea that there’s probably someone out there that’s making sure everything’s ok. So I think the police department assumed that this company wouldn’t be able to sell its product and say that it’s completely safe if that was untrue, because they just assumed someone is keeping track of whether or not those claims can be backed up.

It was one of those eye-opening things for me, realizing there is not that person. I think people in general need to be more skeptical. In this case, a lot of police departments just accepted at face value the things they were being told by TASER and assumed that it was all true.

“They never acknowledged the damage and I don’t think they have real sympathy for people killed because I don’t think they want to face it honestly.” Nick Berardini, director

We give police enormous responsibility and authority. Yet the way we contextualize giving them so much authority is to simply put our faith in them to maintain order – but that allows for these things to happen. We assume police are experts in making these decisions. The police assume that this company has their best interests at heart and won’t betray them. We’re all making these simplified assumptions instead of understanding that obviously there are multiple agendas. There is never just one agenda and that’s why the film works really hard to treat everybody as a three-dimensional person.

We need to have a more evolved conversation and get to the root of these problems that we’re having with policing instead of inherently just turning to technology. I find it ironic that everybody wants a body camera now, because they think that it will hold officers accountable, and yet TASER also makes the body cameras and is taking advantage of that.

MSNBC: While you were filming, TASER International updated its training procedures to include that officers should not aim for the chest. When this initial change came out, how did you react?

Berardini: When they get to changing the training, I believe it’s a betrayal of police officers because they are speaking out of both sides of their mouth. They’re trying to say that they’re changing this so we don’t all get sued, but really they’re changing it so they don’t get sued. And so that police continue not to worry and think it’s still safe.

Williams: TASER has come up with so many warnings about ways that you’re not supposed to use the product, yet they’re still telling departments that it’s completely safe and the warnings are just there for legal reasons. But as one guy said in an interview, they’ve so warned themselves out of liability that the police almost have to break one of the fine print rules to even use the device. The liability has been shifted onto individual police departments because of those warnings.

Berardini: It’s phenomenal because TASER has such great loyalty within police departments. It’s like these guys were cult heroes to law enforcement officers in the beginning, and they knew how to take advantage of that relationship really effectively.

MSNBC: Did you guys know that you were going to release this film at such a significant time?

“I remember a couple of years ago, we were wondering if the film would still be relevant, and sadly it’s far more relevant now as the problem with policing continues to get out of control.” Brock Williams, producer

I remember a couple of years ago, we were wondering if the film would still be relevant, and sadly it’s far more relevant now as the problem with policing continues to get out of control.

MSNBC: What are you hoping people will get out of this documentary?

Berardini: I think the first step that we can take with this film is making sure that the police have a complete awareness of what they’re dealing with. This film questions the route taken by the company and makes sure that police, before they use these weapons, really do have a full understanding of what they’re capable of.

MSNBC: ”Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle” was originally a book written by Victor Appleton in 1911. Can you elaborate on why you picked that as the title?

Williams: The word “Taser” is an acronym for Thomas A Swift’s Electric Rifle, because the [Victor Appleton] book is what inspired the invention. Jack Cover, who originally created the Taser, was inspired when reading that book. The film represents the naïve idea that an invention can fix our society."
msnbc51,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/rifles-kids-5-year-old-boy-accidentall,"On Tuesday, a five-year-old boy in Kentucky accidentally shot and killed his two-year-old sister using a Crickett rifle that was made and marketed specifically for children.

The maker of the gun, Keystone Sporting Arms, markets its product with the slogan “My First Rifle.” Business has been booming for the company since its 1996 launch by father-son duo Bill and Steve McNeal, according to its website. In its first year, the company sold 4,000 rifles for kids, and by 2008 that number increased to 60,000 rifles. msnbc host Lawrence O’Donnell explored this feat in his latest Rewrite segment.

“The McNeals hit their marketing target when a family living in a mobile home on Lawson’s Bottom Road in Cumberland County, Kentucky, bought a Crickett for their five-year-old boy,” O’Donnell said.

Focusing on the McNeals rather than the grieving parents, O’Donnell dubbed them “the merchants of this death, the guys who made and sold the rifle that killed this two-year-old girl.”

A visit to the “Kids Corner” section of KSA’s website displays the rifles in a variety of designs and colors ranging from brown to hot pink.

O’Donnell described one picture in which a two-year-old boy holds a rifle in his lap, “because the toddler obviously isn’t strong enough to lift it up. That picture is legal child pornography,” he said. The gallery reveals photos of gun-wielding children too young, O’Donnell said, to even play Little League baseball.

“Because we think fastball pitching is too dangerous for five-year-olds,” he said. “If you are concerned with child safety, you don’t give children guns, you don’t give five-year-olds the keys to the car.”

Against the backdrop of the Newtown massacre and the ongoing national debate over gun control, this tragedy raises questions about the business of guns for children.

“You live in a country where Bill and Steve McNeal legally sell guns for five-year-olds,” O’Donnell concluded. “Tonight, you live in a country where they make and sell guns for little kids. Because they can.”"
msnbc52,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/nra-obama-will-take-your-rifle-shotgun-han,"Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association, appeared on Fox News Sunday just days after testifying during a congressional hearing on gun violence, to stoke fears that President Obama will disarm “law-abiding citizens” of their most basic weapons.

“During the campaign, when [Obama] said to people, ‘I will not take away your rifle, shotgun, handgun.’ They leafleted the country with flyers like this, ‘Obama’s not gonna take your gun,’ ‘Obama will protect gun rights,’” LaPierre said. “And now he’s trying to take away all three.”

Host Chris Wallace pushed back on LaPierre’s accusations, confirming that shotguns were never a target for tighter gun restrictions.

“Have you looked at the Feinstein bill that’s he’s supporting? That’s exactly what it does,” LaPierre fired back, referring to the renewed assault weapons ban California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced last month. The bill bans the sale and manufacturing of more than 150 types of military-style weapons, which expands on the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban that expired in 2004.

LaPierre continued: ”I think what they’ll do is they’ll turn this universal check on the law-abiding into a universal registry of law-abiding people. And law-abiding people don’t want that.”

Wallace did not let LaPierre skate by with his claims. “There’s nothing that anyone in the administration has said that indicates they’re going to have a universal registry,” he said.

“And Obamacare wasn’t a tax until they needed it to be a tax,” LaPierre retorted.

“I don’t think you can trust these…” he added, trailing off.

In another heated exchange, the Fox News host lashed out at LaPierre for suggesting that President Obama’s children were under the same kind of threat as other children in America.

“That’s ridiculous and you know it, sir.”"
msnbc53,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rubio-right-the-assault-weapons-ban-failed,"During CNN’s forum on school shootings this week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) faced an outraged parent, whose daughter was shot, and who couldn’t understand the Republican senator’s opposition to an assault-weapons ban.

Rubio responded that the original assault-weapons ban “failed” after its passage in 1994. But is that true? The Washington Post had a good piece on this yesterday, taking a closer look at the data, and concluding that the since-expired law “had a significant impact.”

The 1994 law included a ban on 18 specific models of assault weapons, as well as a ban on any firearms containing certain military-style features, like a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor or a folding stock. It also banned high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 bullets. The bill allowed individuals already in possession of such weapons to keep them. It was also set to expire after 10 years’ time. “The original intent of the assault weapons ban was to reduce the carnage of mass shootings,” [Louis Klarevas, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who wrote a 2016 book on mass shooting violence] said. “And on that front the data indicate that it worked.” Klarevas has compiled data on gun massacres involving six or more fatalities for the 50 years before 2016. His numbers show that gun massacres fell significantly during the time the assault weapons ban was in place, and skyrocketed after the ban lapsed in 2004.

In the American tradition, the country has repeatedly responded to brutal gun violence by imposing new restrictions – each of which was permissible under the Second Amendment. One of the reasons fully automatic weapons aren’t generally available to the public, for example, was the response to the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929.

The massacre in Parkland, Fla., last week was also on Valentine’s Day. There’s no reason policymakers can’t take similar, legal steps in the name of public safety now.

* Postscript: At the same CNN event, Rubio said any attempt to ban assault weapons would open the door too widely: “Once you start looking at how easy it is to get around it, you would literally have to ban every semiautomatic rifle that’s sold in America.” Much to the Republican senator’s chagrin, the crowd erupted in applause.

Yesterday, he followed up by saying this idea may have received cheers, but it’s outside “the mainstream.” First, Rubio opposed a popular and bipartisan background-check bill in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, so I’m not sure he should be commenting on who is and isn’t within “the mainstream.”

And second, there’s ample evidence to suggest Rubio’s assessment is factually wrong."

msnbc55,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/national-rifle-association-nra-convention-draws-gun-lovers-and-vote-seekers,"Tens of thousands of firearms enthusiasts gathered in Indianapolis over the weekend for the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) annual meeting, a celebration of gun culture that’s also a magnet for Republican candidates looking to court the movement’s support.

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin delivered the most discussed line of the weekend at a rally Saturday when she called on the government to return to torturing suspected terrorists.

“Well, if I were in charge, they would know that waterboarding is how we’d baptize terrorists,” Palin said.

On Friday, a bevy of potential GOP presidential candidates spoke, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio, former Senator Rick Santorum, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. Others, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, participated remotely by video.

The gun rights movement had plenty to celebrate over the weekend. Despite a push to restrict assault weapons, large ammunition magazines, and expand background checks in the wake of mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Newtown, Connecticut, states have mostly moved to expand the ability of residents to legally obtain and carry firearms in recent months. Organizers of the NRA meeting hope to carry that momentum to Congress, where they’re pushing for new laws that would force state and local governments to recognize gun permits issued elsewhere.

The movement’s recent successes are largely attributable to the intense political support generated by Second Amendment activists through groups like the NRA, whose clout forced politicians to think carefully before supporting even modest gun control measures that enjoy overwhelming majority support among the public.

msnbc56,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gun-lobby-who-got-elected-the-nra-board,"This year’s gun lobby board election brought a few surprises, as the National Rifle Association has been trying to keep the results (and the low voter turnout) quiet.

George K. Kollitides II is the founder and CEO of Freedom Group, America’s largest and most profitable firearms consortium. One of the company’s products is the Bushmaster AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that was used last December in the Sandy Hook school massacre.

Last year Freedom Group led the gun industry with record sales of almost $1 billion, or $931.9 million. Kollitides also quietly served last year on the NRA’s shadowy Nominating Committee for the NRA’s 2012 board elections, as reported in January in Mother Jones. His place on the Nominating Committee likely helped get his name on the NRA’s official ballot this year.

Yet he still lost his bid for the NRA board, according to election results just published in the August edition of the NRA’s American Rifleman magazine, available only to NRA dues-paying members, a copy of which was obtained by MSNBC. Kollitides remains a Trustee of the NRA Foundation, according to its latest annual report. The foundation’s activities include organizing gun safety and target shooting competitions for children.

Calls to Kollitides’ office at Freedom Group’s headquarters in Madison, North Carolina, requesting comment were not returned.

Other gun industry executives sit on the NRA’s board. Pete Brownell is the third-generation family CEO of Brownells, Inc., America’s largest supplier of firearms parts, tools and accessories. He easily won his reelection. His father and chairman of the board for the family business, Frank R. Brownell III, is also President of the NRA Foundation.

A representative of Brownells in Montezuma, Iowa, told MSNBC.com that neither executive was available for comment.

Two more gun industry executives sit on the NRA board. One is Ronnie G. Barrett, the CEO of the Tennessee-based Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, who designed the first .50 caliber rifle for civilian use. (Last week Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill that would have banned .50 caliber rifles in New Jersey.)

Another is Stephen D. Hornady, an NRA board director who, like Kollitides, is an NRA Foundation Trustee. Hornady is the second-generation family CEO of the Nebrasksa-based ammunition-making firm, Hornady Manufacturing.

Other gun industry figures like Larry and Brenda Potterfield of MidwayUSA, a Missouri-based retailer and wholesaler of firearms products, have contributed generously to the NRA through programs like “Round-Up,” which allows firearms consumers to round-up their purchase to the next dollar to make a donation in the name of defending the Second Amendment. To date MidwayUSA’s Round-Up program alone has contributed $8.9 million to an NRA endowment.

This year, as in previous years, the top two vote-winners in NRA elections have been Oliver North and Ted Nugent. North is the Fox News host who became famous as the protagonist of the 1980s-era Iran-Contra affair. Nugent is the rocker last seen on national television in January scowling down from the Capital gallery at President Barack Obama during the State of the Union Address.

Another popular NRA board director is Marion P. Hammer. A grandmother, under five feet tall, Hammer has long been the most influential gun rights activist in her home state of Florida, where she was also, by all accounts, instrumental in helping to pass Florida’s Stand-Your-Ground law.

Two other long-standing NRA board members were re-elected this year, despite an organized campaign among NRA Second Amendment activists against one, and a notable degree of negative comments online against the other.

H. Joaquin Jackson is a former, storied Texas Ranger-turned-actor who has played lawmen in films like Extreme Prejudice starring Nick Nolte and The Good Ole Boys directed by Tommy Lee Jones. But a video-recorded interview that Jackson gave back in 2005, saying that military-style semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 rifle have no place in hunting, led NRA activists this year to mount a Facebook campaign against him.

Former Senator Larry Craig is the longest-standing NRA board director, having been first elected in 1983. In 2007 Craig pled guilty to the charge of disorderly conduct for his behavior in a men’s room in Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, leading some NRA activists to turn against him.

Only NRA Life Members are eligible to vote, and this year, as in past years, no more than 7.2% of them, or 123,646 voters out of a total of 1,718,786 Life Members, cast a ballot, according to the independent, pro-NRA, Pennsylvania-based gun rights blog, pagunblog.com.

Life members were asked to vote for up to 25 out of 29 candidates. “No write-in candidates received 250 or more votes to quality,” reads an NRA note on the election results in American Rifleman.

The NRA has even failed to publish a list of its latest board of directors online. Earlier this year the group quietly took down a webpage roster of its board members, rerouting the page, www.nra.org/board, to the gun lobby’s home page.

NRA officials at the group’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia declined to comment.

Other notable NRA directors include the actor Tom Selleck, the former NBA basketball star Karl Malone, who is one of several African-American directors on the NRA’s 76-member board, and Grover G. Norquist, the Republican anti-tax crusader."

msnbc69,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-senator-gun-show-loophole-doesnt,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), after having been a senator for three weeks, made his second “Meet the Press” appearance yesterday, and was asked whether there are any regulations and/or restrictions on gun rights that he could support. The Republican said background checks to “prevent felons and those with serious mental illnesses from acquiring” firearms “make perfect sense.”

So, is Cruz on board with a universal background check system? Well, it’s complicated.

Though Cruz supports licensed firearm dealers running background checks as part of existing law, host David Gregory noted that 40% of gun sales don’t involve licensed firearm dealers – this includes firearms purchased at gun shows. Cruz disputed the statistic, adding, “You know, there actually isn’t the so-called gun show loophole. That doesn’t exist.”

And why not? Because as Cruz sees it, licensed firearm dealers are the ones conducting sales at gun shows, and these dealers already follow the law on background checks, so there’s no problem. Except, the senator is confused – as we’ve seen over and over again, background checks aren’t conducted at gun shows, and the loophole does exist.

Cruz can’t have it both ways. He can’t say he supports background checks in the interest of keeping weapons out of the hands of felons and the mentally unstable, while also saying he supports a system in which felons and the mentally unstable can get guns without background checks from private sellers.

On a related note, Cruz raised another argument that suggests he doesn’t quite understand the nature of the policy debate.

“[Y]ou have a lot of people that are worried about preserving the safety of their own home. If you’re talking to a single woman living in Anacostia, who has the misfortune to live next to a crack house, to hell her she doesn’t have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, I think is fundamentally wrong.”

Here’s the follow-up question I have for Cruz: who’s arguing that a single woman living in Anacostia can’t legally purchase a firearm? As best as I can tell, no one. Maybe she shouldn’t have access to an assault weapons intended for a military battlefield, and maybe she doesn’t need a high-capacity magazine, but the policy argument is not about whether Americans can have a firearm in their home. That debate has already been settled.

And given this, I can’t help but wonder if Cruz either doesn’t understand the nature of the conversation or if he’s trying to mislead the public with smoke-screen arguments that don’t make any sense."
msnbc70,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jay-nixon-vetoes-bill-allowing-teachers-carry-concealed-guns,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon vetoed a measure Monday that would have permitted certain educators to carry concealed weapons on school property.

Nixon, a Democrat, cited student safety in public schools as a reason for concern.

“Arming teachers will not make our schools safer,” the governor said in a statement. “I have supported and will continue to support the use of duly authorized law enforcement officers employed as school resource officers, but I cannot condone putting firearms in the hands of educators who should be focused on teaching our kids.”

The measure would have allowed teachers to become “school protection officers,” according to the governor’s office.

“This bill, which would create a new mechanism for the arming of teachers, would not make schools safer,” added Nixon, who is also a former chief law enforcement officer in Missouri.

Monday was the final day Nixon was expected to take action on measures passed earlier in the year. But the legislation could survive if the Republican-led state legislature revokes Nixon’s temporary ban on the bill with a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate during a September session.

Some districts believe schools need armed teachers because they think law enforcement takes too long to respond to emergencies.

In the wake of school shootings across the country, some school board members sent voluntary faculty to a concealed-weapons training. At least 10 districts across Missouri have completed the instruction in the past 18 months.

Districts in other states – including Kansas, Ohio and Indiana – have also demonstrated interest in the training.

Ninety-one percent of teachers said they believe an armed guard would improve school safety at least somewhat, according to a membership poll published earlier this year by the Association of American Educators. Additionally, 75% of the surveyed members feel safe or very safe in their schools. About 20% of the organization’s 20,000 members responded to the survey.

msnbc72,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/burger-chain-prohibits-customers-openly-carrying-guns,"If you want to bring a gun into a Whataburger, you better keep it out of sight.

The iconic Texas fast-food chain recently announced that it will not allow customers to openly carry firearms in its restaurants, despite a new law that empowers Texans to display their guns while walking the state’s streets.

In an open letter to the “gun rights community,” Whataburger CEO Preston Atkinson explained that while he supports Second Amendment rights, “We’ve had many customers and employees tell us they’re uncomfortable being around someone with a visible firearm who is not a member of law enforcement, and as a business, we have to listen and value that feedback in the same way we value yours.”

RELATED: The states could be the only hope for new gun control laws

Texas Restaurant Association CEO Richie Jackson told the Associated Press that he expects other restaurants in the state to adopt a similar policy before the new law goes into effect next January.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation in June, following years of protests and rallies by gun rights advocates. Among the group’s favorite acts of civil disobedience was the repeated practice of bringing military-style assault rifles into Texas Chipotle Restaurants, prompting push back from the burrito chain.

The new law overturned a ban on open carry that dates back to the post-Civil War era, when it was used to disarm former Confederate soldiers and facilitate the emancipation of slaves in the state.

While Texas’ streets, sidewalks, and parks will soon be open to the visibly armed, the law gives private property owners the right to ban guns in their homes or establishments.

Whataburger patrons will still be allowed to carry firearms in the chain’s restaurants, so long as they keep them concealed. But that gives little comfort to Open Carry Texas founder C.J. Grisham, who told the A.P. that the policy was “premature and irresponsible.”

“I think most gun owners that know this policy are simply not going to go to Whataburger, like me,” he said."

msnbc74,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congress-eyes-bills-undetectable-guns,"It hasn’t gotten much attention yet, but a federal ban on undetectable guns will expire in just a couple of weeks. Some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for congressional action ahead of the Dec. 9 deadline.

Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) introduced a bill Thursday that would ban guns designed to escape detection by metal detectors. S. 1774 would reauthorize the Undetectable Firearms Act, which first passed in 1988. Schumer tried to get unanimous consent to pass the bill Thursday evening, but Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) objected, saying it wasn’t a day to be passing any legislation.

“I hope as soon as we come back, we might get this body to pass it, and maybe get the House to pass it,” Schumer said. “We are in a dangerous world. To allow terrorists, criminals, those who are mentally infirm, to walk through metal detectors with guns that are made of plastic and then use them at airports, sporting events, and schools is a very bad thing.”

It’s hardly a secret that congressional Republicans oppose any new gun measures, no matter how popular or sensible they may be, but at issue here is whether an existing law can remain in place.

Under the status quo, federal law prohibits the “manufacture, sale, import or possession of guns that are undetectable by metal detectors and X-ray machines.” The Undetectable Firearms Act was first signed into law by President Reagan in 1988, and it’s been renewed with relative ease twice since then, but with the radicalization of Republican politics, and limited time remaining, the law’s future is very much in doubt.

The irony is, the law is arguably more necessary now than ever. Quite recently, 3-D printing has become more common and readily available to consumers, making it that much easier to produce deadly weapons, quickly and cheaply, that include no metal parts."
msnbc75,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/gun-safety-insurance-companies-may-succeed-w,"Insurance companies may be the best allies for gun control advocates pushing to restrict the spread of firearms in schools.

One Iowa-based insurance company says that from a business standpoint, concealed weapons on campus are simply too risky to insure.

EMC Insurance Companies announced it will not renew insurance policies or continue to cover any Kansas schools that allow teachers and other school staffers to carry concealed guns, according to a report in the Des Moines Register.

The company, which covers approximately 85-90% of all schools in Kansas, said it’s not a new or politically-based decision, but rather an longstanding rule buried in the fine print.

“We’ve been writing school business for almost 40 years, and one of the underwriting guidelines we follow for schools is that any on-site armed security should be provided by uniformed, qualified law enforcement officers,” Mick Lovell, EMC’s vice president for business development, told the Register. “Our guidelines have not recently changed.”

In a May letter to its agents, the company said they “respect” the choices each school district makes to protect the safety of kids using methods “they see fit.”

But that doesn’t translate to coverage, they say. “EMC has concluded that concealed handguns on school premises pose a heightened liability risk,” read the letter. “We are making the underwriting decision simply to protect the financial security of our company.”

Continental Western Group, a smaller insurance group based in Des Moines, and Wright Specialty Insurance, based in New York, have said they plan to follow suit.

The Kansas Association of School Boards has been advising districts to not allow firearms in schools.

In the wake of December’s deadly school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the Kansas state legislature cleared a bill permitting school staffers to be armed. The law kicked into effect on July 1, but so far no schools have implemented the policy.

In response to the massacre, which left 20 kids and 6 adults dead, the National Rifle Associate recommended every school in America gear up with an armed officer.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 30 states introduced similar bills allowing teachers to carry guns on school premises at both public and private institutions."
msnbc76,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/new-gun-report-details-reality-criminals-bypassing-system,"As legislators and grassroots organizations demand that the federal government tighten gun laws to close existing loopholes, new findings have revealed the number of criminals who continue to evade the background checks system.

Everytown for Gun Safety on Wednesday published the results of an investigation in Washington that show most of the criminals in the state purchase firearms from the online marketplace to avoid background checks. Of the identified people seeking guns in unlicensed sales over the Internet, nearly one in 10 had been convicted of crimes that prevented them from legally possessing firearms, including rape domestic abuse, and assaulting police officers. The investigation also found that 44,000 guns are posted for sale annually on the Internet.

“Of the identified people seeking guns in unlicensed sales over the Internet, nearly one in 10 had been convicted of crimes.” U.S. Department of Justice.

The pro-reform gun group, backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, examined five major Washington classified websites, including Armslist.com, the self-described Craigslist for guns. Those platforms illegally transfer about 4,000 firearms each year. The websites range in size, with hundreds to tens of thousands of firearms listed at any given time. Once each day from Feb. 25 until July 12, 2014, investigators extracted online data from all gun-related ads posted by the self-described “private sellers.”

The findings of the report, “Online and Off the Record,” came on the heels of a ballot initiative in Washington that would require criminal background checks on all firearms sales and transfers in the state — including at gun shows and on the Internet. In an unusual move, philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates last month donated $1 million to the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility, a reform group attempting to reduce violence in the Evergreen State.

Early last year, 345,000 Washington residents began pushing for the initiative, known as “I-594,” to appear on a ballot. They will have a chance to vote on the measure, the country’s only statewide background checks initiative, during the midterm elections in November.

Recent polling reveals that 72% of Washington residents support I-594.

The same day as the organization disclosed the results, Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS) began airing two new television commercials in New Hampshire that highlight two Republican congressional candidates’ opposition to sealing the loophole that allows domestic abusers, stalkers, and other individuals who pose a threat to society to buy guns. Members target Congressman Frank Guinta and state Rep. Marilinda Garcia for holding beliefs contrary to those of most residents in the Granite State.

Many of the pro-reform campaigns, such as the national petitions initiated by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, are focused on addressing the loophole in the federal background checks system. Earlier this year, members of the group successfully convinced Facebook and Instagram to regulate all sales and trades on those sites of firearms that are not subject to background checks."
msnbc77,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pentagon-nominee-accidentally-tells-the-truth-about-gun-policy,"Dr. Dean Winslow, Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the Pentagon’s top health official, was on Capitol Hill yesterday for his confirmation hearing, and as Politico reported, it turned out to be a little more interesting than expected.

The most provocative exchange came when the discussion turned to Devin Patrick Kelley, who’s believed to be responsible for Sunday’s mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked if Winslow believes service members who are convicted of domestic violence charges should be dishonorably discharged.

“I’d also like to – and I may get in trouble with other members of the committee – just say, you know, how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy … a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used,” Dean Winslow, a physician and retired Air Force colonel nominated to be the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs, said during his Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) quickly interjected, “Dr. Winslow, I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise.”

I suppose there’s some truth to that, though Winslow is an experienced medical professional with an opinion.

As it turns out, of course, that opinion is deeply at odds with the beliefs of the president who nominated him for this Pentagon post. Donald Trump, for example, responded to the massacre in a Texas church by saying this “isn’t a guns situation.”

At this point, I haven’t seen any evidence that Winslow’s nomination is now in doubt as a result of his moment of candor, though it’s not difficult to imagine Trump’s far-right allies in the NRA and elsewhere raising concerns following yesterday’s hearing.

In theory, the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs doesn’t have any role in shaping gun policy, so it shouldn’t necessarily matter what Winslow believes about American consumers’ access to semi-automatic assault rifles, but recent history suggests that doesn’t matter: Senate Republicans delayed President Obama’s pick for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, for more than a year because he had the audacity to describe gun violence as a public-health issue.

The fact that the surgeon general doesn’t have a vote in crafting gun policy was deemed irrelevant."
msnbc78,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/harry-reid-cant-ban-the-ar-15-maryland-might,"Maryland could be the next state to boast passage of stricter gun laws this week.

The Associated Press is reporting that the Maryland House passed a gun control bill on Wednesday afternoon, after hours of debate on added amendments. The bill will now go back to the Senate, where it originated, where the delegates will either pass the bill in its new form or come together with House legislators to find common ground in the differences on the bill in order for it to pass.

What’s the rush? The House and Senate must reach a compromise on some of the amendments before the end of session on April 8th.

“There is no way to completely eliminate the risk of another tragedy like the one in Newtown,” said Gov. Martin O’Malley in a statement. “But that cannot be an excuse that keeps us from doing common sense things.” O’Malley’s Firearms Safety Act of 2013 includes revising ammunition magazine limits down from 20 to 10, banning assault weapons–more than 40 types, including the AR-15, the gun used by Adam Lanza in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School–expand the list of mental-health patients precluded from purchasing firearms, and institute license to purchase requirements, such as fingerprints, safety training, and background checks for gun purchasers. The Senate approved the bill in February and many of the main points remain in the current form of the legislation.

Maryland would be the eighth state to institute these license-to-purchase requirements, joining the ranks of California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and New Jersey–all with lower rates of gun violence than Maryland. And a recent poll by Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence shows that 81% support licensing of purchasers to buy a handgun. It stands to note that in the poll, 64% of Republicans approved this measure.

But despite Senate approval, the House was left debating certain tenets of the bill and adding on to the already strict regulations proposed by O’Malley. Many of O’Malley’s initial components remained intact, although the assault weapons ban was slightly diluted when House delegates chose to modify the physical characteristics of weapons not specifically listed that would subject them to a ban, as well as allow anyone who purchased banned weapons before October 1st to keep them. The ammunition limit is supported by 71% of Marylanders, but there is still concern that watered down amendments would lead to potential loopholes in the assault weapons ban coverage.

While the bill is ultimately expected to pass the House, The Washington Post reported late Tuesday night that lawmakers close to the negotiations are concerned the gun bill will be sent to a conference “and, therefore, a series of high-stakes votes on the final day of the session,” thus putting time constraints and extra pressure on lawmakers to pass Maryland’s first major gun-control legislation in 17 years.

A spokesman from the governor’s office echoed those concerns on Wednesday, telling msnbc.com that the versions are different and discrepancies will need to ironed out in order for it to pass. The spokeswoman said “so far, we’re happy” with the bill. “We are, at this point, observers,” she said, but “it is our hope” that the legislation passes before the session deadline. Gun control remains the last major item on the governor’s legislative to-do list before the legislature’s session ends on Monday, April 8. If passed, the laws would go into effect on Oct. 1."

msnbc81,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/gen,"Former Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led the war in Afghanistan, endorsed strong gun control laws Tuesday on Morning Joe.

“I spent a career carrying typically either an M16 or an M4 Carbine. An M4 Carbine fires a .223 caliber round which is 5.56 mm at about 3000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It’s designed for that,” McChrystal explained. “That’s what our soldiers ought to carry. I personally don’t think there’s any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America.”

The AR-15, the civilian version of an M-16 or M-4, has been the weapon of choice in many recent mass shootings —both Adam Lanza and James Holmes used them in Newtown and Aurora, respectively. Since Lanza massacred 20 young children in Newtown, Connecticut, gun control has returned to DC’s front-burner and the president has called for strict gun control measures.

“We’ve got to take a serious look—I understand everyone’s desire to have whatever they want—but we’ve got to protect our children, we’ve got to protect our police, we’ve got to protect our population,” McChrystal said. “Serious action is necessary. Sometimes we talk about very limited actions on the edges and I just don’t think that’s enough.”

McChrystal led the American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, but resigned amidst scandal after Rolling Stone magazine published a controversial profile that portrayed the General and his staff as dismissive and disrespectful of the president.

Tragic shooting sprees aside, McChrystal also pointed to the more deadly and common gun violence—32 people die each day from gun violence—as another reason he believes gun control is necessary.

“The number of people in America killed by firearms is extraordinary compared to other nations, and I don’t think we’re a bloodthirsty country,” he said. “We need to look at everything we can do to safeguard our people.”"
msnbc82,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pentagon-nominee-forced-withdraw-after-candid-comments-about-guns,"A month ago, Dr. Dean Winslow, Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the Pentagon’s top health official, was on Capitol Hill yesterday for his confirmation hearing, which seemed to be going well. Then the doctor made the mistake of being candid.

With the mass shooting in a Sutherland Springs church on the minds of many at the time, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked Winslow about service members convicted of domestic violence charges and whether they should be dishonorably discharged. As part of his answer, the doctor shared his belief that it’s “insane” that “in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy … a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used.”

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the committee’s chairman and a beneficiary of the NRA’s generous support, quickly interjected. “Dr. Winslow, I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise,” the Republican said.

Soon after, Winslow’s nomination was put on hold. This week, he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post explaining that his nomination is now over.

Last week, I withdrew my name from consideration to be assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. My appointment had been put on indefinite hold by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I felt the Defense Department needed to fill the position without undue delay. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines deserve the full complement of Pentagon appointees to support them. I am sorry not to be able to assist Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whom I deeply respect, in building the best and most efficient military health-care system possible. I have the credentials to help, including 35 years of experience in the Air Force (including four deployments to Iraq and two to Afghanistan after 9/11), in military and academic medicine, and in private practice, public hospitals, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries, and public health. But unfortunately, I do not possess one credential the committee wanted to see: I do not support the unrestricted ownership of semiautomatic assault weapons by civilians.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) noted yesterday, “Over the course of his six deployments, Dean L. Winslow wielded weapons of war and saw what they did to the bodies of soldiers. When he said those weapons don’t belong on our streets, his nomination to serve the Dept. of Defense was shut down.”

As we discussed in early November, it’s worth appreciating the fact that if Winslow had been confirmed to the position for which he was qualified, he wouldn’t have been able to affect gun policy in any way. Whether the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs agrees with the NRA’s agenda or not is ultimately irrelevant in a policymaking sense – because consumer access to weapons of war falls far outside the office’s purview.

But for Republicans, that didn’t matter. Winslow, a Trump nominee, shared the wrong thought out loud. Like much of the country, he thinks it’s “insane” for civilians to be able to buy semi-automatic assault rifles, and in this Congress, it’s a disqualifying sentiment.

“I have no regrets,” Winslow concluded in his op-ed. “Having semiautomatic weapons makes no sense. It is a public-health issue that, as a doctor, I felt compelled to bring to the Senate’s attention. As a citizen, I am saddened that our government has become so dominated by pro-gun lobbyists that an appointment such as mine – which has no responsibility for gun control – can be sidelined by a single sentence of informed, personal opinion. And that really is insane.”"

msnbc85,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-fake-guns-are-banned-and-real-guns-are-protected,"Three years ago, Tampa was getting ready to host the Republican National Convention, and local officials took a variety of steps to improve public safety for those attending the event. Among the items prohibited in the area outside the convention center? Water guns – but not real guns . The former was deemed a possible threat to public safety, while the latter was protected by state law.

A similar issue came up recently in Tennessee

The Tennessee House of Representatives passed a bill Monday night that makes it illegal to take a squirt gun – but not a real gun – within 150 feet of a school. The new ban was included in a larger bill that would nix any local laws prohibiting people with gun permits from taking guns to parks.

The headline in The Tennessean read , in all seriousness, “House bill bans fake guns – not real guns – near schools.”

What’s especially striking about this story are the circumstances that led state lawmakers to take a look at gun policy in the first place.

As Rachel noted on the show last night, the National Rifle Association’s annual conference starts this week in Nashville, and Tennessee’s Republican-led state government was looking for a way to approve a “thank-you” gift to the NRA in the form of new state policy. The legislature set aside several days of legislating on the issue, which affectionately became known as “gun week.”

As part of the process, lawmakers wondered what to do about a guy known locally as “the Radnor Lake Rambo,” who has a habit of walking around outside courthouses and schools while wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying an assault rifle, which tends to freak people out.

So, one Republican state legislator figured that as long as Tennessee was in the midst of “gun week,” maybe they should do something about the Rambo guy who tends to scare the bejesus out of people. But GOP lawmakers also didn’t want to do anything that might offend the National Rifle Association.

What’d they come up with? A ban on squirt guns. As Rachel explained :

“It’s a ban on fake guns, toy guns, things like squirt guns would be banned specifically anywhere near Tennessee schools. No squirt guns, no fake guns within 150 feet of Tennessee schools. “Real guns are still OK. But squirt guns and toy guns would be illegal outside of schools under the new law. The ostensible reason for this new language was to respond to the Radnor Lake Rambo guy. The Tennessean newspaper helpfully points out that that guy is actually carrying real guns, so he’d still be OK to keep doing what he’s doing under the new law. But if your personal plan to stop that guy was to sully his bullet proof vest with a squirt from your super soaker, you would be the Tennessee gun criminal now, not him.”

Right. If you stood near a school with a loaded AR-15, that would be legal. If you stood near a school with a water pistol, that’d be illegal.

This, evidently, got a little too weird for the legislature, which decided to slow the whole process down, even if that meant not being able to present the NRA with a legislative gift by tomorrow."

msnbc101,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/man-shot-28-times-police-gives-thanks-after-being-freed,"At an emotional and celebratory press conference Friday, Howard Morgan, the Chicago man who was shot 28 times by police then convicted of attempted murder, maintained his innocence after having his sentence commuted earlier this week.

“Right now I’m just concentrating on clearing my name,” Morgan said, “because I’m absolutely innocent of those charges.”

Morgan was freed Monday after outgoing Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn commuted his 40-year prison sentence. He is now working with lawyers to have his conviction reversed.

“He was no criminal when I married him, and he’s no criminal now,” said Morgan’s wife, Rosalind Morgan, who led the fight for his freedom.

Quinn hasn’t explained the reason for his decision, which angered some police unions, as well as one of the officers wounded in the incident. But Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Morgan, said Quinn was well within his rights.

“What Governor Quinn did was not secretive or mysterious in any way,” said Crump. “It’s what the constitution of this state gives him the power to do.”

“There were thousands and thousands of people who signed the petition after they looked on the record as to what took place,” Crump added.

“What I really believe this is is an example of driving while black,” said Crump. “And we don’t need to go much further than that.”

In 2005, Morgan, a former Chicago police officer who was working as a railroad detective, was stopped by four police officers while driving the wrong way on a one-way street near his home. From there, a scuffle ensued, leading to gunfire. Police said Morgan was belligerent and fired first, while Morgan said police started firing as soon as they saw his gun, and denied firing a shot. In the end, Morgan was shot 28 times, 21 in the back, while three officers were wounded.

At a 2007 trial, Morgan was found not guilty of discharging his firearm, but there was no verdict on a charge of attempted murder. At a second trial, a jury convicted Morgan on the attempted murder charge. He was sentenced him to 40 years in prison.

Lawyers for Morgan, 63, have said key evidence was suppressed at trial, and have complained about double jeopardy.

Morgan’s supporters have said his case is an example of the kind of over-zealous policing that lately has been in the national spotlight thanks to the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and several other unarmed blacks.

But John Wrigley, one of the officers who was shot, told a local news station he has questions for Quinn.

“Why do you think he needed to be released? Why do you think he deserved to be released? Did you sit in on the trial? Did he look at the details of this case? I don’t think he did,” Wrigley said.

Morgan’s was one of 43 clemency petitions that Quinn, a Democrat, granted Monday just before leaving office."

msnbc106,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/slideshow/inside-the-2016-nra-convention,"This May, Louisville, Kentucky played host to the National Rifle Association convention — an annual meeting of pistols and politics that this year boasted a 500,000 square foot firearms display. The convention, conceived by the Union officers who founded the NRA after the Civil War, is in its 145th year.

On its opening night, NRA leaders endorsed Donald Trump for president just before the presumptive Republican nominee took the stage and declared, “crooked Hillary Clinton is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office.”

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre also chimed in on the Democratic front-runner, saying that “if she could, Hillary would ban every gun, destroy every magazine, run an entire national security industry right into the ground and put gun-owners’ names on a government registration list.”

“Hillary Clinton,” warned NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox, “has a legitimate chance to be the next president as long as people like us stay home.”

In response, Clinton, who has advocated for change in American gun policy but has never suggested, despite Trump’s claims, abolishing the Second Amendment, tweeted that the country should not accept 33,000 gun deaths in a year as “normal,” adding that “we can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence.”

Meanwhile, hundreds of NRA members, toddlers in tow and guns in hand, shopped the grounds of the convention showroom, where patriotic emblems abound and defense of the “Constitutional right to bear arms,” is key.

Redux photographer Mark Peterson traveled to Louisville for MSNBC to shoot “freedom’s largest celebration” from the inside.

msnbc108,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/florida-gop-rejects-gun-measures-declares-porn-health-hazard,"It appears the Republican majority in Florida’s state legislature has a rather macabre sense of humor.

Just a week after a gunman killed 17 people in a massacre at a South Florida high school, the GOP-led state House had an opportunity to debate a ban on assault weapons; As the Miami Herald reported, the right had reason to be pleased with the outcome.

The bill (HB 219), which would ban the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines like the kind used by Nikolas Cruz, has been mired in a House subcommittee for months and has not been heard. Amid rising tensions at the Capitol, Democrats used a highly unusual procedure to try to move the proposal directly to the House floor for a debate and vote. Republicans voted it down, 71-36. Several survivors of the high school massacre, watching from the visitors’ gallery, were overcome with emotion, and the action set off a firestorm of controversy on social media.

The outcome was not unexpected, but that was little solace to those who hoped last week’s bloodshed might help Republican policymakers to reconsider their assumptions about gun restrictions.

But to fully appreciate the absurdity of the circumstances, consider the fact that while Florida’s state House wasn’t willing to tackle efforts to prevent gun deaths, it was willing to debate the public health risks associated with porn. The Tampa Bay Times reported:

The Florida Legislature is declaring pornography as a health risk. The state’s House of Representatives approved the resolution by a voice vote on Tuesday. The resolution states a need for education, research and policy changes to protect Floridians, especially teenagers, from pornography. Republican Rep. Ross Spano says there is research that finds a connection between pornography use and mental and physical illnesses, forming and maintaining intimate relationships and deviant sexual behavior. Spano is also a candidate for attorney general.

State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D) sponsored the assault-weapons measure and highlighted the depravity of yesterday’s developments.

“Has anyone had to bury their child because of pornography?” Smith asked reporters.

That’s hardly an unreasonable question."

msnbc110,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-nra-finds-new-ways-stoke-the-fires-the-culture-war,"The National Rifle Association has a challenge: the far-right organization has allies running the federal government. In practical terms, that leaves NRA members with very little to fear, at least in political terms. The chances of a far-right Congress approving gun reforms that will be signed into law by Donald Trump are zero.

To be sure, the NRA still has to contend with public opinion. A new Quinnipiac poll, for example, released yesterday, found that 94% of Americans – including 93% of Republicans and 92% of voters in gun-owning households – support requiring background checks for all gun purchases.

But the fact remains that the NRA’s Republican allies will simply ignore public attitudes on the subject – a fact the NRA’s members are no doubt aware of.

How, then, will the group keep its supporters engaged? By pointing to a different enemy: Democratic officials may not be in position to approve any national policies, but there are still liberals out there who, the NRA says in a new video, need to be defeated in a culture war:

“They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse ‘the resistance.’ “All to make them march. Make them protest. Make them scream ‘racism’ and ‘sexism’ and ‘xenophobia’ and ‘homophobia.’ To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding – until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. “And when that happens, they’ll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. “I’m the National Rifle Association of America. And I’m freedom’s safest place.”

It’s quite a worldview.

As Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum noted, the NRA has clearly evolved from being an organization interested in the rights of gun owners, and become “a purveyor of wholesale culture war zealotry.” This video is powerful evidence of this: NRA members aren’t told to worry about legislation; they’re told to direct their fears at “comedy shows” and liberals who “terrorize the law-abiding.”

At the root of NRA propaganda in recent years is an unhealthy dose of paranoia and cultural resentment, and the byproduct is bizarre videos like the one the group released this week.

Vox’s report added, “It’s not hard to figure out what the narrative is here. A liberal insurgency is destroying American society. The ‘only way’ to protect yourself from this surge in left-wing violence (a made-up threat, to be clear) is to donate to the NRA.”"
msnbc111,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/nra-convention-feature-nonoperational-guns-floor,"The National Rifle Association’s annual convention kicks off in Nashville this week, with 70,000 people expected to participate in the three-day gathering.

Attendees can expect to find the usual NRA fare and exhibitors at the 350,000-square-foot Music City Center, but they shouldn’t expect to find functioning weapons. The Tennessean reports this week on the “multilevel security plan,” which includes an important safety measure: “All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational, with the firing pins removed, and any guns purchased during the NRA convention will have to be picked up at a Federal Firearms License dealer, near where the purchaser lives, and will require a legal identification.”

The New York Daily News sees some irony in the convention policy:

The National Rifle Association wants guns at schools, but not its own annual convention. […] NRA boss Wayne LaPierre has called repeatedly for allowing guns in schools, and other facilities. LaPierre says arming teachers and guards will help prevent gun violence. At least, outside the NRA’s own events.

Of course, there’s also a political angle to keep in mind as the far-right group gathers in Tennessee.

A s the local report noted, at least eight likely Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to speak at the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum: Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Mike Pence, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum, and Scott Walker.

Donald Trump and Sarah Palin are also expected to appear.

Correction/Update : Rather than leaving a confusing series of updates , let’s summarize what we now know. The original report from the New York Daily News , which said the NRA had “banned working guns” from the convention, was inaccurate – Tennessee’s open-carry laws still apply at the NRA event. The Memphis Daily News published a piece explaining Tennessee gun laws in more detail. Similarly, when The Tennessean reported, “All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational,” that referred to the guns on display at exhibitors, not the guns attendees bring themselves. updatesNew York Daily NewsMemphis Daily News

This does not mean, however, that convention attendees face no limits on where and when they can carry loaded firearms. We learned late Wednesday, for example, that no guns are allowed in the convention room during performances from Alan Jackson and Jeff Foxworthy. There’s also an expectation that gun owners will have the proper permits before bringing loaded weapons to see speeches from presidential candidates.

We’ve also since learned that Sarah Palin and Mike Pence have canceled their scheduled appearances."
