On Friday, the country mourned yet again when a student at Santa Fe High School shot and killed ten of his classmates and teachers and wounded at least thirteen others. While many members of Congress continue to offer little more than the usual “thoughts and prayers” (at least until we vote them out of office), we can fight for change in our own communities.

Road rage is an American pastime. Nearly 80 percent of motorists admitted to at least one instance of aggressive driving in the past year, according to a 2016 study. A generation ago, drivers confronting each other over a traffic squabble could assume their quarrel would end with strong words or, at worst, a black eye. But in 2013, after one car tailgated another, two men in Ionia, Michigan, stopped in a parking lot to resolve their dispute. Instead of duking it out, they pulled out guns and shot each other. Both men legally carried a concealed weapon; both died in the hospital. (In states without a “right to carry,” the law usually requires people to store their firearms in the trunks of their cars.)1 Ad Policy

In 1997, researchers John Lott and David Mustard asserted that more guns meant less crime; it was an influential argument that likely contributed to states passing right-to-carry laws. Ever since, there’s been a debate over the effects of this legislation on violent crime.2

But with an updated paper by legal scholars John Donohue and Abhay Aneja and economist Kyle Weber, there’s a new consensus: Right-to-carry laws actually increase the rate of violent crime. Ten years after a state passes a right-to-carry law, violent crime—which includes murder, manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault—will be 13 to 15 percent higher than if the state had done nothing.3

What makes this new report so convincing? First, there’s simply a lot more experience with right-to-carry laws: 33 states adopted such legislation between 1981 and 2007. There’s also a lot more data: The researchers were able to track crime statistics until 2014.4

Starting in the early 1990s, violent crime plummeted across the United States. That reduction has masked the effects of right-to-carry laws, but the states that implemented them showed a smaller decrease in violent crime than the ones that didn’t. By itself, this isn’t sufficient evidence, since there could be other factors involved. But the study’s authors used a variety of controls to compare the two sets of states, and they found that the increase in violent crime holds. Interestingly, with the additional data, they found that even the methods of researchers like Lott and Mustard confirm this rise.5

The authors of this new paper have taken advantage of cutting-edge statistical techniques. They constructed synthetic control groups for states and used what’s known as a LASSO analysis to pick the best variables for comparison. The important thing to know about these methods is that, no matter the relative trade-offs of the statistical tool, the findings were consistent: When states passed right-to-carry laws, violent crime ended up higher than it would have been otherwise.6

The report also found that a right to carry has no deterrent effect on property crimes. (Indeed, in some of the calculations, such crimes increased.) This lack of deterrence isn’t surprising, given that victims of violent crimes fail to defend themselves with a gun 99.2 percent of the time. Using reasonable estimates of the relationship between incarceration and crime—that for every 10 percent increase in incarceration, there’s a 1.5 percent decrease in crime—the researchers estimate that the average right-to-carry state would have to double its prison population to counter the effects of this legislation.7 Related Article No Wonder Teachers Are Saying Enough Is Enough Bryce Covert

What causes this rise? The authors note several channels, including road rage, bar fights, and other heated interactions that once would have ended in insults or a fistfight, but that now suddenly turn deadly. Also, people who carry guns outside their homes have their firearms stolen at a rate of more than 1 percent a year, making these concealed-carry permit holders a nice source of guns for would-be criminals.8

This research comes at a perfect time. A bill that passed the House in December and is currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee would allow people with a concealed-carry permit in a given state to carry their firearms in the rest of the country. On April 19, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which includes the heads of 18,000 departments, sent a letter to Congress opposing the law. Now there is overwhelming evidence to back up their claims: Right-to-carry laws only lead to more violence.9"

The Parkland shooting unfolded with a grim familiarity. News alerts that shots had been fired at a Florida high school quickly gave way to reports of multiple casualties and then a final, horrible number: 17 dead, students and teachers. Republicans offered their thoughts and prayers as ambulances pulled away from the school, and they also warned against any “knee-jerk” reactions to the killings, in the words of House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ad Policy

But then something rare happened: The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High got angry and declared war on inaction. “Every single person up here today, all these people, should be at home grieving. But instead we are up here standing together, because if all our government and president can do is send ‘thoughts and prayers,’ then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see,” said student Emma Gonzalez at a rally, speaking through her tears and while still holding notes for her AP Government class. “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this—we call BS.” Video of her speech quickly went viral, and “We call BS” became a new rallying cry for the gun-control movement. In short order, plans came together for a nationwide student walkout and a march on Washington.

Listen to George Zornick on the Start Making Sense podcast.

Fatalism about what these young people—and the larger gun-control movement—can achieve is unwarranted and self-reinforcing. Last November in Virginia, the National Rifle Association backed 13 State House candidates in competitive races and Republican Ed Gillespie for governor. Twelve of those candidates lost (the 13th won on a coin toss), and Gillespie got trounced. At the state and local levels, gun-control advocates have been able to pass measures that Congress has failed to enact, like assault-weapons bans and expanded background checks. It’s worth remembering that the movement didn’t really exist in its current form before the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. Most of the major gun-control groups today were formed in response to that shooting, and Democrats rarely advocated for gun control in the decades prior to that. Given time, this movement can grow—and win—if it has confidence in itself and its arguments.

That’s not to discount the immediate limits of our ossified political system, especially with Donald Trump in the White House after getting over $30 million from the NRA. Trump will never sign significant gun-control legislation, and a Congress that couldn’t even ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre won’t pass it anyway. But as the movement works to elect a different Congress and president, there’s another thing it can do. It can go after the one thing that gun manufacturers value above all else, including human life: money. Current Issue View our current issue

These days, the gun titans are loaded with debt and facing declining consumer demand. In the same week as the Parkland shooting, Remington Outdoor Company, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the United States, announced plans to declare bankruptcy. Signs abound that other parts of the gun industry are in danger, too: According to an SEC filing, a $140 million loan to United Sporting Companies, a major middleman between manufacturers and retailers, lost half its value in 2017. Gun retailers aren’t faring much better: Gander Mountain, a big-box sports retailer that sold guns in most of its stores, went belly-up in 2017 and began to liquidate locations nationwide.

Activists can help deliver a knockout punch to these merchants of death. Divestment is one route, by making guns as radioactive as fossil fuels. In 2013, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System voted to divest itself of millions of dollars’ worth of shares in gun manufacturers. New York City’s employee pension fund did the same in 2016 and also pulled money from sporting stores like Cabela’s and Dick’s that sell guns. College students nationwide should ask their endowment offices whether they have holdings in gun stocks—and if so, challenge their colleges to dump them.

Divestment can happen at the personal level, too. Thirty-five percent of US stock funds include investments in gun and ammunition manufacturers—a staggering $17.3 billion invested in 2,120 funds. At GoodbyeGunStocks.com, you can learn whether your investment fund owns shares in gun companies. If it does, a tool on the website allows you to find gun-free funds. Related Article Has the NRA Finally Met Its Match? Katha Pollitt

Letitia James, New York City’s public advocate, has put considerable pressure on banks to stop lending to gun manufacturers, and suggests the city shouldn’t do business with them if they continue to make those loans. PayPal, Square, Stripe, and Apple Pay already don’t allow payments for firearms to be processed—what if the major banks and credit-card companies did the same?

If Congress managed to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005, gun manufacturers would no longer enjoy broad immunity from civil claims. The families of people hurt or killed by guns could finally hold manufacturers responsible for the damage they caused, with the lawsuits against Big Tobacco serving as a model. Both industries sold things that, when they worked as intended, ended countless lives.

The NRA’s power in Washington is fueled by money from the gun industry. It’s time to turn off the spigot and make it unprofitable to sell death."

There is a learned hopelessness about mass shootings in America that creates the foundations for an emotionally hollow, politically impotent, media-saturated response. Conservatives offer prayers for those who have died and oppose any action that will prevent more deaths. Liberals offer outrage at the carnage and demand that something must be done, but then go on to do relatively little. (Gun owners are almost twice as likely as non–gun owners to have contacted a public official about gun policy, and almost three times as likely to have donated to a group that takes a position on the issue.) The rest of the world looks on aghast that an ostensibly mature democracy could witness such a tragedy and decide to do nothing to prevent it from happening again. Cable-news channels screen mawkish portraits of the dead and arm’s-length, usually posthumous profiles of the killer. Talk of evil is “balanced” by calls for legislation. Then, after a few days, the talking and the calling stop—until the next time. Ad Policy

With nothing changing but the name, place, and number of victims, what some call “compassion fatigue” sets in. But as Susan Moeller, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland, argued in her study of the responses to the media’s reporting of such atrocities, the problem isn’t so much fatigue as it is the cycle of avoidance that causes people to avert their gaze. She writes, “We’ve got compassion fatigue, we say, as if we have involuntarily contracted some kind of disease that we’re stuck with no matter what we might do.”

There is reason to believe that the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed by a single shooter, has the potential to break that cycle. Students, including those from Parkland, have spoken out in ways that are difficult to ignore, calling for youth-led activism against political complacency in general and the National Rifle Association in particular. Piercing through the “Now is not the time for judgment” rhetoric, these students leveraged their vulnerability to political effect. They have held a press conference and called a national demonstration. The issue isn’t fading from the news as quickly as mass shootings tend to do, with interest in the term “gun control” enjoying a sustained high in Google searches a week later.

There are, nonetheless, grounds to be pessimistic or even cynical. We remember Sandy Hook. The kids were younger, the outrage greater; the president even cried—and still, many insist, nothing happened.

But there are three main reasons why we might see progressive possibilities in this moment. The first is that something did happen after Sandy Hook: President Obama spoke up. Five months before that atrocity, James Holmes went into a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and shot 12 people dead during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. The next morning, at a scheduled event in Fort Myers, Florida, Obama said what presidents white and black, Republican and Democrat, have said for the best part of a generation: “There are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection.” But after Sandy Hook, he said something else: “We can’t tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change.” Belatedly, Obama set a new tone. We shouldn’t be too surprised that, after years of presidents and congressional leaders refusing to bring the issue of gun control into mainstream political debate, this new tone did not result in legislative change the first time. You can’t fatten a pig on market day. It takes time. Related Article America’s Refusal to Control Firearms Is Killing Teens at an Absurd Rate Gary Younge

Second, this time the challenge is being led by young people who are motivated in a way that the mostly white, suburban gun-control movement has not been. “Maybe the adults have got used to saying, ‘It is what it is,'” said 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez, who was in the school when the shooting happened. “But if us students have learned anything, it’s that if you don’t study, you will fail. And in this case, if you actively do nothing, people continually end up dead.” Parkland was the eighth school shooting and the 30th mass shooting of the year—and it was only Valentine’s Day. In the four days afterward, there were four more mass shootings.

Finally, and crucially, this fight comes at a moment of heightened consciousness about the nation’s political trajectory and with a new critical mass determined to correct it. As a result of Donald Trump’s victory, many liberals and progressives have been doing things over the past year—campaigning, marching, phone banking, running for office—that they hadn’t done for a long time, if at all.

In the course of this activism, many are now realizing that the issues that energize us most—whether it’s immigration, sexual harassment, racism, or health care—are not isolated. In the past, campaigning around a tragedy like Parkland would have concentrated solely on gun control. That doesn’t go far enough. Avoiding the more enduring American pathologies that allow the gun culture to flourish—the obsessions with conquest, domination, force, power, masculinity, and rugged individualism—means failing to explain why a racist, anti-Semitic teenage boy with a grudge and an easily available weapon of war can go to school and kill others at will, and what might be done to prevent it. It means failing to recognize that America’s gun culture is deeply embedded in its general culture.

The Trump agenda is a broad and unrelenting assault on equality and human rights. But it did not come out of nowhere, and it did not invent the divisions that it exploits. For the resistance to be effective, it cannot be narrowly focused. It must, instead, shed light on how these various struggles are connected. The young campaigners have a stake, an audience, a platform, and allies. That may not be enough to stop the next school shooting. But it’s more than gun-control advocates have had for some time."

After so many mass shootings, there’s a temptation to be cynical. With little legislative movement, the violence continues; the past six months have seen three of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history. Just as brutal are the deaths that often fail to grab our attention—according to data from the CDC, an average of 96 Americans are killed by guns each day, a number that climbs by the year.

But this time, the impassioned protests of high school activists and survivors have ignited action and revealed a nationwide frustration with the relentless sequence of massacres. “People right now are just fed up with the lack of change,” says Andrew Patrick, the media director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV).

The students of Parkland are also attempting to connect with activists and victims of gun violence not given the same amount of attention. Acknowledging the discrepancy between their suddenly high-profile platform and that afforded to young black activists who have been at the forefront of this issue, they met over pizza with their peers in Chicago and attempted to bridge their experience with the high rates of gun homicides endemic within communities of color.

A recent CNN poll found that 70 percent of Americans support stricter gun control laws, the highest level since 1993. After public pressure following the Parkland shooting, corporations in industries ranging from aviation to banking have started to cut ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA). The movement has even led to tangible legislative success; the Republican-controlled Florida state legislature recently passed a bill that added restrictions on gun purchases—the first of its kind in the state in over 20 years.

The cracks are beginning to show and advocates of “gun sense” policies (activists say that there’s nothing controlling about protecting public safety and so “gun control” is a misnomer) are beginning to win. Here are five ways you can join the fight:

1. Contact your elected officials—at every level.

A raft of proposals are being considered at the city, state, and federal levels. Here are just a few to write and call lawmakers about: Current Issue View our current issue

FEDERAL:

• Stop Concealed Carry Reciprocity. Last December, on the fifth anniversary of Sandy Hook, the House passed an NRA-backed bill for concealed carry reciprocity, which would allow individuals who have a concealed carry permit in one state to carry a gun in another, even when current laws differ. The bill, now being considered by the Senate, would essentially create a national gun license and loosen the ability of states to regulate concealed carry.

• Support “gun sense” bills. Legislation with bipartisan support up for consideration include raising the age limit for purchasing AR-15s and banning bump stocks. Dianne Feinstein has also introduced a bill to ban assault weapons altogether. There is also a push to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (Fix NICS), though Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demands this be accompanied with a more in-depth, universal background check system. Read more about the bills and their supporters here.

STATE:

• Support GVRO/ERPO policies. In the 12 months after the 2012 Newtown shooting, states passed 70 laws easing restrictions on gun sales and owners, highlighting the role state legislatures have played in abetting gun proliferation. Advocates for gun safety are answering with their own ideas and right now many are promoting Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) policies—also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPO)—to statehouses across the country. GVRO/ERPO policies allow family members and law enforcement officials to temporarily have access to guns removed for individuals who are at high risk of endangering themselves or others, with studies showing a significant influence in preventing gun deaths. The goal is to have ERPO-style policies implemented at the state level in all 50 states; so far, five have passed laws.

LOCAL:

• Fight preemption laws. After decades of lobbying by the NRA, more than 40 states now have preemption laws regarding firearms that strip the authority of municipalities to regulate the sale and use of guns. In some states such as Florida, extreme preemption laws threaten officials who enforce their own gun ordinances with personal $5,000 fines and removal from office, and a fine of up to $100,000 for the town itself. Urge your city council members and mayors to vocally oppose state preemption laws and to join coalitions such as the nonpartisan Campaign to Defend Local Solutions, which seeks to protect the rights of local authorities to create their own gun laws free from state interference.

• Stop schools from arming teachers. Florida’s governor signed a measure allowing trained school workers to carry handguns, a proposition that is also gaining traction in the White House. In some areas, local school boards are starting to reject this pressure. Attend local school board meetings to make your disapproval heard.

2. Exercise consumer power.

The NRA and the dangerous agenda of gun deregulation it pushes is the principal threat to gun safety in America. Isolating this immensely powerful group through the commercial sector is a particularly potent tactic that is gaining traction right now. “Corporate America is usually quick to pick up on an issue, and their responses are a major sign that the cultural landscape is shifting,” says Patrick.

Amid a flurry of a customer complaints and threats of boycott, Delta Airlines, MetLife, Hertz, and the First National Bank of Omaha—which used to offer an “NRA Visa Card”—dropped discount programs and business partnerships with the NRA. Retail giants like Walmart and Dick’s have also recently toughened their restrictions on gun sales.

Campaigns are now encouraging customers to call, email, and tweet at Fedex and Amazon: the former has bucked the tide and resisted demands to cut its discount program for NRA members, while the latter continues to host NRATV, a channel that streams NRA propaganda 24/7.

You can find more information on the Fedex and Amazon campaigns here (about halfway down the page). And if you’re a customer of any of these other companies continuing their associations with the NRA, you can also tell them that you oppose their partnership.

Consumer power is also effective in negotiating the presence of guns at private establishments themselves. A few years ago, Target, Chili’s, Chipotle, and other chains requested customers stop bringing guns into their stores. While the power businesses have to prohibit open and concealed carry varies from state to state, reach out to those near you and encourage them to take public stances against guns on their premises.

3. Participate in rallies and petitions, get in the loop.

Mass demonstrations of popular support for gun reform help to end the normalization of gun violence. You can find information about the March For Our Lives in DC here and other events here. On April 20th, students, faculty, and staff will stage another walkout (you can find one near you here). Another method of action is through petitions: here’s one to remove the ban on federal gun violence research and another to stop “bad apple” gun dealers.

Gun safety organizations will be driving protests and proposals throughout the year, so it’s important to keep updated. Sign up for the newsletters of national groups such as the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and States United to Prevent Gun Violence.

4. Join and support grassroots organizations in disproportionately affected communities.

The Parkland high school activists are just one node in a larger movement to stop gun violence that traces back at least to the 1970s. Grassroots efforts have been leading the struggle, especially within communities which are disproportionately affected by gun violence. For instance, African-Americans are more than twice as likely to die from gun violence than any other racial group and black activists have been pushing for gun reform through anti-violence campaigns for decades, often without much in the way of resources or national attention. Here are a few organizations to follow and donate your money, time, and energy to:

• Dream Defenders is a black youth-led group that was founded in Florida after the killing of Trayvon Martin. With a racial justice mission, the collective has organized actions protesting gun violence around the state and led a 2013 sit-in in the Florida Capitol protesting the state’s Stand Your Ground laws in the context of George Zimmerman’s acquittal.

• LIVE FREE is a social justice campaign created by people of faith seeking to end mass incarceration and gun violence. They’ve organized campaigns with black and brown leadership in more than ten states, and also use a unique, community-oriented “ceasefire” strategy to deter chronic perpetrators who are responsible for the majority of gun homicides.

• Community Justice Reform Coalition is an anti-violence coalition that aims to prevent gun violence through policy advocacy and programs. The organization centers criminal justice reform in communities of color. Past gun safety initiatives have included community interventions, domestic violence programs, and public health approaches.

5. Make your vote count this November.

35 Senate seats, 6,066 state legislative seats, and all members of the House are up for election in 2018, meaning that one of the most effective ways to take action on gun violence prevention is through the polls. If you haven’t already, make sure to register to vote and research your district representatives. Here, it’s useful to follow the money: Drain The NRA has aggregated data on politicians who have received funding from the gun lobby, while NPR has compiled an extensive list of the voting records of representatives on key gun bills since 1993.

“People are viewing gun violence through a different prism since Parkland and it’s kind of been changing in the five years since Sandy Hook,” Patrick said. “The elected officials in power had their time to act and I think eventually we’ll see a lot of Americans vote on this come November.” With all the energy around this issue, we have a great opportunity to flip seats that are bought by the corporate gun lobby and replace them with representatives who will prioritize gun safety."

Two days before the March for Our Lives drew as many as 800,000 demonstrators to Pennsylvania Avenue, students at Thurgood Marshall Academy in southeast Washington held their own rally in the school gymnasium. “Living in DC, it’s easy to be in a bubble. We live in the nation’s capital. There’s the monuments, the statues, the memorials, and all of that,” Jayla Holdip told her classmates. “But we need our stories to be heard. It should not be normal for everybody in this room to be affected by gun violence.”1 Ad Policy

In 2016, 77 percent of all homicides in Washington, DC, were committed with a gun, and Thurgood Marshall is located in one of the most dangerous zip codes in the city. In the past two years, the Sixth and Seventh Police Districts, which cover the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, recorded 154 homicides and 829 assaults with a deadly weapon in which a gun was used. By comparison, the Second Police District, which encompasses a geographical area about as large as the Sixth and Seventh combined but also has a richer and whiter population, saw just five homicides and 37 gun assaults over the same period.2

“Gun violence is an issue that our DC community and other cities have experienced for generations. Although we personally have not experienced a school shooting, we know the destruction of guns all so well,” said Zion Kelly when it was his turn to speak. At the beginning of the school year, Kelly’s twin brother Zaire, also a Thurgood Marshall student, had been shot and killed on the way home from a college-prep class. He was 16. In January, Paris Brown, a junior, was shot to death less than two miles away—the second person in a school of fewer than 400 students to be killed with a gun since the school year began.3

Murders in this part of the city, much less meetings of student activists, aren’t normally headline news. But that day, two risers full of news cameras were on hand to record the rally. “To these cameras,” said one of the students, Aaron Woods, staring directly at the camera to the laughter of his classmates, “and these government officials who we’re trying to reach—yeah, we’re looking for y’all.”4 “It should not be normal for everybody in this room to be affected by gun violence.” —Jayla Holdip, student at Thurgood Marshall Academy

The cameras were there because some of the now-famous students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida, had come to join the rally. They didn’t waste any time noting the irony. “We’ve seen again and again the media focus on school shootings, and oftentimes be biased towards white, privileged students,” said David Hogg, one of the most visible Parkland survivors. “Many of these communities are disproportionately affected by gun violence, but they don’t get the same share of media attention that we do.”5

Hogg’s admonition wasn’t immediately absorbed by at least some of the media people present that day—when Hogg had to depart early, a good number of the camera crews followed him into the hallway, even as the Thurgood Marshall students were still speaking. But the Parkland survivors and other youth leaders of #NeverAgain have made it clear that they’re aiming to build a movement that’s multiracial and inclusive—one that addresses gun violence everywhere, not just in suburban schools and movie theaters. In so doing, they are trying to eliminate one of the central paradoxes of our gun-control debate: While a disproportionate number of the victims of gun violence are black, most mainstream gun-control advocacy is conducted by white people, and the subjects of race and racial inequality have, for the most part, gone unbroached.6

The contemporary gun-control movement was essentially born again after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in late 2012. Until that point, politicians very rarely talked about new gun laws. Even when a gunman killed 12 people and injured 70 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, right in the middle of the 2012 presidential campaign, then–President Barack Obama refused to call for any new legislation.7 Current Issue View our current issue

Then Newtown happened. Six adults and 20 children, all between 6 and 7 years old, were massacred in 11 minutes by a 20-year-old shooter wielding a semiautomatic rifle and two handguns. In the shock and outrage that followed, several new gun-control groups were born: Americans for Responsible Solutions, now called Giffords after its founder, Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in 2011, and Everytown for Gun Safety, which is funded by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and former New York City mayor, and which absorbed Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action. The first real gun-control push in decades revolved around the 2013 bill proposed by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA), which would have expanded background checks for gun purchases and heightened gun-trafficking penalties. It failed to get the necessary 60 votes in the Senate.8

These post-Newtown groups genuinely care about gun violence in the inner city, and the policies they’re advocating really would help: Background checks and tighter enforcement against so-called straw purchasers would stem the flow of handguns into big cities, where they are overwhelmingly responsible for most of the violence. (In Chicago, for example, over 90 percent of the guns recovered at crime scenes were handguns, and in 95 percent of the cases where police could identify the possessor, that person was not the first purchaser of the gun.) But in the same way that the opioid epidemic suddenly focused national attention on the pointless, punitive nature of the War on Drugs only after the crack-cocaine epidemic had ravaged cities and exploded the prison population, the political space for gun legislation didn’t truly open up until white kids in the suburbs started becoming victims, too.9

Shaped by this political context, the post-Newtown gun groups are, at their core, small-C conservative. They emphasize soccer moms who want to protect their children, or law-enforcement officers who think the streets have become too dangerous, or veterans who believe weapons of war should not be used by civilians. They also haven’t been able to get hundreds of thousands of people out into the streets—preferring an inside game of slow consensus building with lawmakers and taking small legislative wins where they can.10

Yet during almost exactly the same period that these post-Newtown groups took off, in what often seemed like a universe parallel to the Newtowns and Auroras, a vibrant, youth-led, anti-racist movement against police and vigilante shootings was rising up across the country. “We’ve been marching. We’ve been rallying. We’ve been saying our chants and our calls for justice,” said Samantha Johnson, co-chair of the Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, which formed in response to Trayvon Martin’s death. “We, as activists, understand the ebb and flow of how society views individuals in certain communities of color. We understand that.”11

The #NeverAgain movement is poised to bring these two streams together. “It’s important, as people of the American society and people in the media, [that we] recognize this inequality and that we work to solve it,” said Hogg. “First, though, we must call it out, and we must call it for what it is, and that’s racial bias towards us and many other people that’s not only in the media, but that’s in our society, too, as a whole.”12

The March for Our Lives rally featured several speakers of color who drew specific, sustained attention to the toll that gun violence takes in inner cities. It wasn’t just a pro forma checking of that box, but a central part of the movement that the students are trying to build. Edna Chavez told the crowd in DC about her brother, killed by a gun in Los Angeles. “My brother, he was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset going down on South Central. You hear pops thinking they’re fireworks. They weren’t pops. You see the melanin in your brother’s skin turn gray.” Sixteen-year-old Mya Middleton described having a gun stuck in her face in Chicago. “He said, ‘If you say anything, I will find you.’ And yet, I’m still saying something today.” And the star of the rally, who created perhaps its most viral moment, was Naomi Wadler, an 11-year-old from Virginia. “I represent the African-American women who are victims of gun violence, who are simply statistics instead of vibrant, beautiful girls full of potential,” she said. “For far too long, these black girls and women have been just numbers. I am here to say ‘Never again!’ for those girls too.”13

These kids are disrupting politics as usual in other ways as well. #NeverAgain’s key tactical innovation has been to call bullshit on the country’s broken dialogue around guns—that’s literally one of the movement’s slogans. “We call BS,” Parkland student Emma González declared in the speech that helped jump-start the movement. “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS.”14

That’s an explicit rebuke to the National Rifle Association’s tired talking points, but also an implicit repudiation of the cautious incrementalism that has characterized the post-Newtown gun-control movement. When the Las Vegas shooting happened last October—the deadliest mass shooting in the United States—there was no federal policy response except for a clarification of federal rules that may ban bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic guns to operate at nearly an automatic rate of fire. The youth leaders of #NeverAgain are much more maximalist in their views and straightforwardly unafraid to reject small-scale compromises as insufficient. “When they give us that inch, that bump-stock ban, we will take a mile,” said Delaney Tarr, one of the Parkland survivors, at the rally. This radicalism—or, some might say, utopianism—is rooted in a strange mix of youthful confidence that all the world’s problems can be solved, and a horrendous and very adult experience with flying bullets and bloodshed. “Talking to politicians, they’re always gonna try to talk around in circles and say that you’re wrong because of X, Y, and Z. But that’s not true. They don’t know what it’s like to be 20 feet from an AR-15,” Alfonso Calderon, a 16-year-old Parkland student, told the crowd at Thurgood Marshall. “They don’t know what it’s like to have somebody that you love die because of laws that are inadequate. And it’s heartbreaking. They’re presenting ideas that aren’t solutions—they’re bandages to stab wounds. It’s just not gonna work.”15 “When they give us that inch, that bump-stock ban, we will take a mile.” —Delaney Tarr, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High student

The Parkland students have not been afraid to frame the gun problem in stark moral terms—without worrying about the discourse police. “It just makes me think: What sick fuckers are out there that want to sell more guns, murder more children, and, honestly, just get reelected?” Hogg vented in an interview with The Outline earlier this month. “What type of person are you, when you want to see more fucking money than children’s lives? What type of shitty person does that?”16

All of this has thrown pro-gun politicians and activists off their game. At the heart of their panic is the notion that the passion gap that has long characterized the gun debate—one in which, for example, 21 percent of gun owners contact a public official to express an opinion on gun policy, versus 12 percent of non–gun owners—may be suddenly, and resoundingly, closing.17

The NRA’s Twitter account fell silent on the day of the march, an occurrence usually reserved only for the hours after a mass shooting, when the NRA feels that its advocacy would do more harm than good. On Fox News, as footage rolled of a massive, energetic march expanding the terms of the gun-control debate by the minute, the network’s “young” talking heads criticized the event in boilerplate terms, deploying the shibboleth that armed guards were present at the rally, so guns must de facto be good. (In fact, the only armed guards I saw during the march in Washington were DC police officers.)18

There has also been a pervasive effort on the right to discredit the Parkland kids as simply not real. Naturally, some prominent conservatives dubbed them mere pawns of George Soros. The hugely popular blog RedState ran a long post after the march in which the author claimed to have discovered that Hogg wasn’t even at school during the shooting. (He was; RedState retracted the entire post with one long strike-through, but blamed a “confusing” CBS report.) After the march, a photoshopped video of González ripping up the Constitution flew around right-wing Twitter accounts and blogs. (In the actual video, she was tearing up a shooting-range target.)19

In the days following the Parkland shooting, as the student survivors were becoming household names, the top trending video on YouTube purported to show that some of the kids were actually “crisis actors,” part of some inscrutable mega-plot to confiscate everyone’s guns. (YouTube was forced to remove the video after an outcry.) Normally the purview of niche conspiracy cranks like Alex Jones, the crisis-actor theory was spread by a Florida legislator’s aide, who was later fired, and reached all the way to Donald Trump Jr., who “liked” posts about it on Twitter. Hogg, one of the main targets of these charges, had to go on CNN to publicly declare: “I’m not a crisis actor—I’m somebody that had to witness this and live through this, and I continue to have to do that.”20

Many adults simply cannot accept that high-school kids are sick and tired of mass shootings in their schools, nor that their moral outrage is real. “The fact that these people refuse to believe that something like this could happen is something that all of us don’t want to believe,” Hogg said on CNN. “But the sad truth is that it is.”21

It seems clear that in the weeks since the Parkland shooting, the student survivors have been winning their battles. Whether they win the war depends a lot on how this movement evolves and is able to channel the energy of the streets into actual changes to gun policy.22

So far, the results have been mixed. In the wake of the shooting, the notoriously gun-friendly, Republican-controlled Florida Legislature did pass a raft of new gun laws: It raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21, created a three-day waiting period for sales, and banned bump stocks. But it left out most of the Parkland students’ key demands: banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and expanding background checks. The adults of the gun-control movement haven’t cracked that particularly tough nut either—but the kids have, in a way, taken on a much larger task, by very publicly putting on the mantle of solving inner-city gun violence, too.23 “It’s bad enough that we have to return with clear backpacks. Should we also return with our hands up?” —Kai Koerber, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High student

If you live in a wealthy suburban neighborhood where crime is low and the schools are good, and somebody shoots up the local shopping center, the policy solution is simple: Get rid of the guns, and life can resume happily after that. In the country’s largest urban areas—which have less than one-tenth of the US population but more than one-fifth of the country’s gun violence—shootings are the final coda to a tragic story of economic segregation, terrible educational options, over-incarceration, and a flourishing underground drug trade.24

And some of the proposals that accompany gun-control legislation, such as increased criminal penalties and heightened policing, have the potential to harm people of color more than they would help. When Florida legislators passed their post-Parkland measures, they included more law enforcement inside schools and made searches of students much easier. “It’s bad enough we have to return with clear backpacks,” said Kai Koerber, a black student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, speaking to reporters recently. “Should we also return with our hands up?”25

While reducing the number of illegal guns flowing into big cities has been a priority of community activists’ for decades, it’s far from the only one, and complex demands will lead to an even more complex political strategy for achieving the fundamental goal: that Americans should be able to live free of the fear of being killed in their neighborhoods or schools.26

Black Americans worry about gun violence by a much larger percentage than do either white or Latino voters, and therefore are likely to support drastic solutions. A new, intersectional gun-control movement can thus expand the political base agitating for change. But it might also find itself in a trap in which gun violence can’t be solved until racism and inequality are, too; it might fail thanks to the bigotry of incredibly high expectations.27

Reconciling sky-high dreams with the realities on the ground is the very definition of growing up. And the Parkland survivors will grow up alongside their movement. We don’t know where it will go yet, but could anyone else have started it and disrupted decades of bullshit about guns?28

“People believe that the youth of this country are insignificant,” said Parkland student Alex Wind during the rally. “People believe that the youth have no voice. I say that we were the only people who could have made this movement possible.”29"

Lucy McBath effectively put her Georgia state House race on hold when she got the news of the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14. “We had to be there for these children,” she told me over coffee at an Emily’s List conference last week. Ad Policy

McBath lost her own child, Jordan Davis, to gun violence in 2012, when a white man who didn’t like the music Jordan and his friends were playing shot him through an open car window at close range. His killer, Michael Dunn, invoked Florida’s stand-your-ground law in defense during trial. Devastated, McBath worked to keep the media from tarnishing her extraordinary son the way so many other young black victims have been diminished in death. After a mistrial, Dunn was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. McBath has been organizing, in some fashion, to be there for “these children”—from Jordan, to the first-graders of Newtown, to the Parkland survivors—ever since.

McBath helped plan the March for Our Lives last month and organized a prayer vigil at Washington’s National Cathedral the night before. Sometime during that whirlwind, she developed a new plan: She would run for the House of Representatives in Georgia’s sixth district against first-term GOP Representative Karen Handel. Lucy McBath decided to move from a small state House race where she’d already raised more than $100,000 and was given a decent chance to win, to contest a US House seat that was the most expensive in history last year, when newcomer Jon Ossoff tried to become the first Democrat to represent the district in 40 years and narrowly lost in a special election.

Handel is sitting on almost $1 million, and two of McBath’s three male Democratic rivals have written their campaigns big checks. McBath, by contrast, had to return all the money she’d raised for the state House seat and start over. She is also starting late; the primary is May 22. Two of her primary opponents have gained some traction in the activist community: Former local CBS news anchor Bobby Kaple is running on “affordable, accessible health care,” while Kevin Abel, a businessman and a South African immigrant who is Jewish, has attacked Donald Trump’s treatment of DACA kids and other immigrants. Having raised less than $50,000 so far, McBath is an underdog in every sense of the word, but she is also Lucy McBath, a nationally known activist and the only woman in a Democratic primary that will be decided by women. In the sixth district, roughly 60 percent of likely Democratic voters are women, and a quarter are people of color. McBath sees a path to victory, despite her late start.

But money isn’t McBath’s only obstacle. There are Democrats in her district who are upset that she walked away from her state House race, leaving the party scrambling to find a candidate. One likely supporter told me the busy McBath is alienating some potential backers by skipping many local candidate forums, which lends an impression she’s a national figure who thinks her name recognition will boost her over lesser-known Democrats. “It might not,” this person says. “We’ve had so many requests it’s unreal, and we’re incredibly grateful,” campaign manager Rebecca Walldorff responds. “We’ll do as many as we can.”

Still, if McBath makes it through the Democratic primary, this will be an epic race in an epic midterm year, pitting a conservative, white, pro-NRA, anti-abortion incumbent against a liberal, African-American, pro-choice, and pro–“gun sense” woman who toured the country as one of the “Mothers of the Movement” on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Current Issue View our current issue

JW: So tell me why you decided to move from running for the state House seat to running for Congress.

LM: I was lobbying in Denver—Colorado’s been doing some really good work on gun laws—and the minute I got off the plane my phone was blowing up over Parkland. I moved right into getting prepared to support the children. Getting prepared for the march. Organizing the event at the National Cathedral.

That was the catalyst for me. I felt, my God, our kids are standing up, and nobody’s there supporting them? Our children are going to bat for themselves? I just thought that was unacceptable—we as adults weren’t standing up and doing the right thing. These are the civil rights leaders of their day and time. They’re the kids at the lunch counters, they’re the young people who were opposing the Vietnam War, they’re the kids who were fighting for civil rights right along with Martin Luther King Jr.

This is a demographic we did not have in 2016. When I was traveling with the Mothers of the Movement, I cannot tell you how many millennials we met who weren’t voting. Our hearts were broken. They weren’t coming to the rallies. They would tell me, “My vote doesn’t matter.” I was a staunch Hillary supporter, but I have to applaud Bernie, he did get the kids out.

So I just realized I’d have far greater impact to move the needle, on so many issues, in Congress. Plus, I’ve been working everywhere else, but people didn’t even know I lived in this district. How dare I not do it for my own community? That’s Jordan’s legacy.

JW: Georgia’s sixth district saw an explosion of activism last year, even though Jon Ossoff lost…

LM: What Jon Ossoff was able to do for us, to have that tidal wave of Democratic voters interested in making that shift…

JW: Yes, I covered your Indivisible chapter, plus the Liberal Moms of Cobb and Roswell Counties…

LM: And now we have Cobb Progressives, No Safe Seats, we have a whole infrastructure that we didn’t before. The sixth is so moving forward, and they have all been diligently building. It’s amazing how motivated and structured they have become. The Democratic primary voters will be 60 percent women, 24 percent minorities, and I fit both demographics. The reality that I have lived is that I can speak to my neighbors about being a single mom, I can speak about women’s reproductive health, about health care…

JW: And about guns.

LM: You know when Trump had all those Congress members in to talk about guns, after Parkland? I was pissed off by that! They were making nice with him. Dianne Feinstein, I love her, but she was just sitting there smiling, they weren’t asking the right questions. They want to trade Fix NICS [a bill that strengthens the National Instant Criminal Background Check System] in exchange for concealed carry reciprocity? No! They want everybody to be able to carry their guns across state lines—no background checks, no training, they might be domestic abusers, but we’re gonna let them carry the guns anywhere they want? No!

JW: How did the 2016 campaign, and your role with Hillary Clinton and the Mothers of the Movement, influence your decision to run for office this year?

LM: All along people would say: have you thought about running for office? The entire time I was on the campaign trail with Hillary. I’d say: I’m not a politician! I really got a baptism by fire. I came to understand the depth of what it takes to be a public servant. Even though she didn’t win, that effort wasn’t wasted, not at all. She gave us confidence, so now we’re able to be the mouthpiece that she wasn’t able to be in the White House. We are that cadre of women who can push her agenda forward. I’m excited that I get to be a part of that process—that I get to carry out what she couldn’t carry out.

JW: Are you still in touch with the other mothers?

LM: We are still in touch. We text all the time. Everyone’s stayed active, everyone’s still on the trail in whatever way they can be.

JW: And what about Hillary—has she endorsed you?

In the aftermath of mass shootings, a now familiar pattern emerges: tragedy, accusations, pledges to do better, and eventual silence. Laudable desires to enact effective gun control tend to lie at the center of these fleeting public discussions. With some 250–350 million guns in circulation, firearms regulation is an issue of mammoth proportions, and it should be debated. But, unfortunately, attempts to identify the factors that lead to gun violence often take on a stigmatizing and inaccurate bent. That was exemplified by the president’s comment that the man who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February was “mentally disturbed.” Later, he suggested that the lack of “mental hospitals” was to blame for the incident, and even suggested incarcerating innocent people in mental-health facilities because “he hasn’t committed the crime, but he may very well.” Meanwhile, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch suggested “crazy” people should be barred from gun ownership at a CNN town-hall meeting on Wednesday, while Wayne LaPierre told a packed house at CPAC that the “failure of the mental health system” is to blame for gun violence. With sentiments like these, it’s easy to see why “not guilty by reason of insanity” can still result in a lifetime of incarceration. Ad Policy

The president, like much of the rest of the country, is having the wrong conversation about mental health, guns, and violence.

There’s a popular myth that mass shootings are the work of “madmen,” and that keeping guns out of the hands of mentally ill people via discriminatory policy decisions will resolve the ongoing epidemic of gun violence in the United States. This misconception persists despite the fact that it’s blatantly inaccurate: Mass shootings account for less than 1 percent of gun deaths in the United States (by the FBI’s definition of four or more deaths in one incident). Moreover, a 2015 analysis of 235 mass murders, including shootings, found just 46 mentally ill perpetrators; factors like “rage,” “hostility,” and being “disgruntled” were more common than mental-health conditions.

Mentally ill people are not inherently more violent than anybody else. Issues like substance abuse and situational factors can increase violent behavior, but the same is true of people without mental-health conditions. Evidence suggests mentally ill people are actually less likely to kill someone with a firearm, overall, than their sane counterparts. Related Article Out of Bloodshed, Hope for Gun Control Gary Younge

But when they do, they’re usually killing themselves. This cuts to the crux of the problem with the way we talk about guns and mental health: Rather than taking on the very real and horrific toll of suicide in the United States, pundits and members of the public focus on the very tiny fraction of mentally ill people who commit heinous crimes and extrapolate wild conclusions.

According to the Brady Campaign, approximately two-thirds of gun fatalities in the United States are suicides—that’s 50 people every day dying by gun, accounting for half of all suicides. Suicide, commonly an act of extreme desperation, is highly impulsive in nature; people make decisions about suicide in less than an hour. And of those who attempt suicide and survive, only around 10 percent try again and succeed. The ready availability of an extremely lethal device is a recipe for disaster for people in crisis: Guns account for a small fraction of methods used to attempt suicide, but they are the most successful.

Limiting access to guns could have a profound impact on the suicide rate. There’s evidence to support this: Efforts like changing the formulation of domestic gas, adding suicide barriers at popular jumping sites, and regulating poisons have resulted in reductions in suicide. When a method isn’t available, it gives suicidal people time to stop, think, and seek help. Current Issue View our current issue

If the United States is deeply worried about gun deaths—and it should be—identifying an easy point of intervention should be highly appealing. Yet suicide rarely comes up in conversations about gun violence. A few simple measures would save lives, without stigmatizing mental illness or creating discriminatory legislation that might violate privacy, civil rights, and the autonomy of the mentally ill community. There’s no reason for suicide to be the 10th leading cause of death in the United States overall, and the second for people aged 10–34.

Background checks should keep guns out of the hands of people with a history of violence who clearly shouldn’t be owning them—as for example in the case of the man who gunned down 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017. A mental-health condition alone isn’t sufficient cause to blacklist someone. Neither is relying on a representative payee for Social Security. This program appoints people to manage finances for Social Security beneficiaries who can’t handle them on their own, and applies primarily to people with significant cognitive, intellectual, and developmental disabilities, not mentally ill people. Yet it was namechecked in Obama-era regulations that the GOP voted to roll back in 2017, leading to widespread outcry that Republicans were handing guns to “people too mentally ill to cash a check.”

That said, self-exclusion is certainly an option for people who worry that they can’t handle weapons responsibly. Research in 2016 found that many mentally ill people would be interested in the opportunity to add themselves to a “do not sell” list, fearing they might try to buy a gun in a moment of desperation and use it to commit suicide. Of 200 survey respondents receiving inpatient or outpatient psychiatric care, 46 percent said they’d like to be able to add their name to such a list, voluntarily flagging themselves so they’d fail a background check.

Requiring people to secure their firearms could also make a huge difference. Yet there’s no federal gun-storage or -locking law, leaving this issue up to the states. Proper storage keeps children from playing with guns—Everytown for Gun Safety identified nearly 300 “accidents” involving minors in 2017—but it can also prevent an impulsive decision on the part of someone who lives in a home with guns.

Waiting periods could be another powerful tool for reducing the availability of firearms for use in homicides as well as for people in crisis, as evidenced by a 2017 study that explored 45 years of data across 16 states and the District of Columbia. The researchers found drops in both homicide and suicide rates in states with waiting periods. To the dismay of gun proponents, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a challenge to California’s 10-day waiting period.

There are few, if any, settings in which someone needs to obtain a gun instantaneously. Enacting a waiting period might create a brief inconvenience for someone purchasing a gun for a legitimate purpose, like hunting, but it could also save a life: A suicidal person should not be able to walk into a gun shop, buy a weapon, and leave. Some states are already exploring experimental programs to get suicide-prevention training and materials into gun shops and ranges, creating another point of intervention, but blocking instant purchases could be highly effective.

It’s undeniable that the United States needs to take meaningful steps to prevent gun deaths. Rampage killings capture the bulk of the attention, but the use of guns in intimate-partner violence, unrelated homicides, and suicides should be cause for grave concern. While Congress continues to limit the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence thanks to the Dickey Amendment, there is enough information from other sources to understand that the guns/mental health narrative advanced in the media in the wake of mass shootings is wrong, stigmatizing, and ultimately unhelpful.

To meaningfully address gun violence, we need to reduce the number of weapons in circulation overall, and cut down on weapons sales to people likely to harm themselves or others. The trinity of universal background checks backed by better databases, waiting periods, and gun-storage laws could radically reduce gun violence in the United States. These are basic lifesaving measures akin to requiring people to wear seatbelts, and they’re not dependent on broadly stigmatizing 20 percent of the population.

Rather than demonizing mentally ill people for mass shootings, the United States should be talking about the real risk with guns and mental health: That it’s too easy for suicidal people to obtain guns to shoot themselves, leading to nearly 22,00 preventable deaths every year. Until the conversation about gun violence can be reframed onto actual, rather than mythological, risks, needless gun deaths will continue."

When Adam Lanza entered Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, inexplicably bent on ending as many lives as possible, he was carrying a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle and several high-capacity magazines. Although it is not clear yet where the AR-15 used by Lanza (which was registered to his mother) was purchased, the model is familiar to many shoppers at Walmart. It’s on sale at about 1,700 Walmart stores nationwide (though the retail chain pulled the weapon from its website early this afternoon), along with other guns of questionable use for duck hunting. Which other assault weapons can shoppers pick up at their Walmart?





Sig Sauer M400 semiautomatic assault rifle

The Sig Sauer M400 semiautomatic assault rifle is advertised on Walmart’s website as “designed for use in law enforcement, military operations…as well as competitive shooting.”



“Imagine my shock to see this rifle hanging in the gun case at my local store,” a Utah reviewer raved on the Walmart site. “I went back the next day to get it, alas, it was gone. No biggie, there’s always another Walmart within a couple dozen miles right? Two hours later I had one in hand.”





Semiautomatic Colt M4 OPS .22 rifle

Colt’s M4 Ops .22 rifle carries a thirty-round magazine, which you can also purchase at Walmart.





Colt LE6920 Carbine Semi-Auto Rifle, 223 Rem/5.56 NATO

This Colt semiautomatic rifle comes with high praise from one Walmart reviewer: “I am a former Marine and this is just the same as the M16 but for the AUTO, never used AUTO that much in the Marines anyway.” That’s reassuring.





Smith & Wesson 811030 MP1522 Rifle and Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun

When James Holmes killed twelve people and injured fifty-eight others in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater, he was carrying a Smith & Wesson M&P15 (another in the AR-15 class of weapons) and a Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun, along with two handguns.





Winchester 22LR Hollow Point Rounds, 555pk

There are also 381 types of ammunition listed on the Walmart web site. You can buy a 555-pack of Winchester hollow-point bullets, which the Walmart website advertises as “great for plinking and varmints,” but which would cause extensive damage should they enter a human body and expand, as they are designed to do.

Given that a hypothetical American, who is underage, has been convicted of a gun crime, has restraining orders out against him, and is on a terror watchlist could go online and have an assault rifle shipped to his door without incident, the US gun lobby seems to have its work cut out for it: simply blocking any action in Congress will perpetuate this madness. Ad Policy

President Obama issued executive orders Tuesday in an attempt to bypass this legislative stasis. The biggest piece is expanding the number of small private dealers who must obtain licenses to sell guns and then must perform background checks. He will also send more money to agencies conducting the background checks, increase mental-health funding, and make it easier for states to send mental-health information into the background-check system. Federal agencies will also fund more research into making guns safer.

These efforts have been widely praised by gun-control groups, and are probably the outer limit of what Obama can hope to achieve on guns while he is president. He doesn’t claim the changes will solve the country’s gun problem, and they won’t: They will mainly nibble at the edges. It may be harder to buy a gun from a private seller online, but it will remain far from impossible.

Obama likely knows, however, that he’s facing an increasingly serious situation. The gun lobby isn’t content to simply play defense, but has pressed a completely unashamed effort in courts and state legislatures across the country to further weaken America’s already anemic gun laws.

Would it be crazy in a country already seeing a spike in mass killings, many of them conducted with semi-automatic assault weapons, to allow fully automatic machines guns to flood the streets? Yes, but that’s the aim of dueling court cases working their way up the federal judiciary at the moment. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP!

In both Hollis vs. Lynch and Watson vs. Lynch, the plaintiffs are mounting an innovative challenge to federal laws that since 1986 have prohibited anyone from manufacturing fully automatic machine guns. (There are a relatively small number of pre-1986 machine guns still in existence, which one could obtain right now after a background check and an agreement to be monitored by federal authorities).* Working in tandem, Ryan Watson of Pennsylvania and Jay Lynch of Texas both applied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives for permits to manufacture fully automatic machine guns.

Both men made the application under the auspices of individual, unincorporated trusts. Their argument was simple: While the 1986 Gun Control Act forbids “persons” from possessing machine guns, Hollis and Lynch argued that the definition applied to actual people, corporations, or partnerships—but not trusts.

The ATF actually approved both applications, before declaring them a mistake almost immediately and subsequently revoking the approval. The two men mounted immediate court challenges, and made dueling claims: one, that unincorporated trusts should be allowed to legally manufacture machine guns, but also more broadly, that laws against machines guns passed in 1986 are fundamentally unconstitutional breaches of the individual right to bear arms.

(Watson added an additional Fifth Amendment claim to his suit because the ATF seized a machine gun he was able to manufacture in the brief period between when his application was approved and revoked, which he claimed was an undue denial of his right to property by the federal government.)

These concurrent challenges were no coincidence—they are both receiving financial backing and coordination from an array of pro-gun groups, including the Gun Owners of America, a group considered even more extreme than the National Rifle Association, and some of the same pro-gun groups who engineered the landmark Supreme Court decision in United States vs Heller that clarified an individual’s right to bear arms.

Neither case has so far been successful in a federal court, but these pro-gun groups have supplied money to keep the appeals going, and both cases are now at the federal appellate level. If the more narrow question of trusts owning machine guns is decided favorably for the plaintiffs, it’s possible people might be able to pay a few thousand dollars to a lawyer, form a trust, and manufacture machine guns—though Obama’s recent executive actions incidentally attempt to tighten the ATF definition of persons to include trusts, because people have also been forming trusts in order to transfer weapons with a mandated background check. It’s not yet clear how that would affect the claims in Hollis and Lynch.

But the big fish, in any case, is a court ruling that machine guns are “arms” just like handguns, and thus the federal government must allow their possession. The brief filed by Gun Owners of America in Watson argues that “Machine guns are not dangerous and unusual weapons, but rather the lineal descendants of founding-era firearms,” and specifically cites a passage in Heller that says “the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms.”

The case is a bit of a long shot: To succeed, it would probably have to reach the Supreme Court, and then find five justices willing to make some new law as to what is, and is not, a bearable arm.

Michael McLively, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks legal challenges to gun laws nationwide, told me that the chances for success were “pretty small,” though not impossible. He said Watson may have a better shot because his case has landed in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, which is generally more conservative. His group may file a brief in Watson’s case, which he said “has been on our radar for the past few months now.”

There is some unsettled law in Heller as it relates to machine guns, McLively said, though he isn’t too worried the courts will actually find them permissible. “The court didn’t come out and say that machine guns are outside scope of Second Amendment [in Heller], but they telegraphed that outcome,” he said.

Still, you can see why this is a shot worth taking for gun groups. There is a potential legal opening to exploit, and it can be done largely out of public view—while a congressional push to legalize machine guns would no doubt be met extremely poorly, this effort requires no voting and is being done largely out of public view.

And it’s far from the only challenge: McLively said his group has tracked over one-thousand Second Amendment challenges since the Heller decision in 2008, 94 percent of which have been unsuccessful. But with persistence and a seemingly unlimited amount of money, gun groups can keep chipping away.

The most dangerous cases involve whether the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms, elucidated in Heller, extends outside the home. Most courts have ruled that it applies only to conduct in the home, and thus various local restrictions on concealed or open-carry permits have been upheld. But two federal appeals courts have found the Second Amendment applies or likely applies outside the home—findings that, if cemented by the Supreme Court, could wash away a number of existing state restrictions on firearm possession in public places.

That would be unfortunate for the many states trying to keep some gun restrictions in place—but there are many others going in the opposite direction. Texas’s open-carry law just went into effect, meaning permitted citizens can have a gun strapped to their belt as they grocery shop or pick up their child from daycare. In fact, as The New York Times recently noted, the Texas legislature has a no-wait security line for people carrying licensed guns, while everyone else has to go through metal detectors.

And Texas isn’t alone in its absurdity. In 2015, Arkansas passed a law explicitly allowing guns in a locked car on the premises of K-12 schools and colleges, and Oklahoma allowed K-12 employees to carry guns at school functions. Florida said it was okay for everyone to carry unlicensed weapons in a declared state of emergency. Idaho permitted unlicensed firearms outside the limits of any city. (There are not many cities in Idaho.) Tennessee created concealed-carry permits that would last for a person’s lifetime.

All the while, American appetites for guns is growing. In December, after a string of mass shootings capped off by the carnage in San Bernadino, California, gun sales reached a post–Sandy Hook high point. Obama’s executive actions are creating some much-needed momentum in the opposite direction, but make no mistake—he’s swimming against an extremely strong current.

The following is a Q & A with Professor Garen Wintemute, Baker-Teret Chair of Violence Prevention, at the University of California at Davis medical school. Wintemute is one of the country’s leading experts on the public health theory of gun control. He has long argued that gun violence is equivalent to a medical epidemic, and that, as such, public health measures ought to be taken to counter its spread.



Sasha Abramsky: What happened in Connecticut last Friday was by some measures an appalling aberration; yet by other measures it was all too predictable. How can we understand this event as something more than an aberration? Ad Policy

Garen Wintemute: We may very much want to understand and to predict. But predicting exactly who and where and when and what the body count will be is simply impossible—because no two of these events are alike. And one of the great mistakes is trying to prevent the last one—because the next one will be different. But will there be another similar event, will there be another body count? That’s an absolute certainty. Firearms are readily available. We have created “global gunning,” much as we have created global warming. We have made a whole series of policy decisions that have made the widest possible array of firearms available to the widest possible array of people for use in the widest in the widest possible array of circumstances. And we are paying the price for those decisions; or, in this case, our children are paying it for us.

What can be done about this? You’ve got the issue of mental illness; the issue of gun control. You read about Syria’s chemical weapons, for example; they’re in a binary state—you need both elements to make them deadly. It’s the same thing here. You’ve got two elements. How do you stop them fusing?

We don’t know how big a role mental illness played here. But let’s step back; we have conversations like this at times when there’s been a mass murder, particularly of children, because we’re wired to see these catastrophes as salient events. But take Sandy Hook, Oak Creek, Aurora, Columbine, Virginia Tech, all of them together come to ninety-one dead. It’s awful. But we lose, on average, eighty-eight people every day to firearm violence in the United States, and we have more than 200 people every day injured seriously enough to go to the emergency department. You ask me what we do? The answer is first what we do not do is try to figure out a way simply to prevent mass shootings. That won’t work. The one option we might have had in the past is closed to us now. That’s the option Australia took; they got rid of high-capacity weapons. But we have nearly as many firearms in this country as we have people; our context is different. We could ban high-capacity magazines. That would be fine. But there are tens of millions of them already in circulation. What do we do about those? We could ban further sales of assault weapons. But we need to understand there are millions of those guns in circulation in the US already. Unless we are willing to recover those weapons, we are going to continue to pay the price for the decisions we have made over the last thirty to fifty years.

We need to have solutions that will make a difference in the presence of 300 million firearms. Our chance to emulate the model set by Britain and Australia and Canada is gone. The guns are here now. We all participated at one level or another in letting that happen. And we will continue to pay a price. But we can make a difference. We can make a dent, and that’s worth shooting for.

So we work to prevent firearm violence. We require a background check for all firearm purchases. Forty percent of gun sales in the US do not involve a background check. Number two, we improve the data on which those background checks are run, so somebody whose mental illness is known in one state, that mental illness is known in all states. Improving the mental health records database would help us identify seriously mentally ill people so that they can’t buy guns. The third thing I’d recommend is we expand the criteria we now use for denying the purchase and possession of firearms. For example, under federal law we do not ban people from purchasing firearms for alcohol abuse; it doesn’t matter how serious the abuse is. We don’t ban people from purchasing firearms who have long records of violent crimes when those crimes are misdemeanors. If I beat my partner, I am prohibited [from gun ownership] for life. If I beat you up, nothing happens; I can buy guns the next day.

After what happened in Connecticut, it’s at least possible that there will be a momentum to a conversation on gun control. If it’s to be done well, what should it involve?

Assault weapons play a disproportionate role in violence generally. If we’re going to go after assault weapons, we’ll need to do so in a more comprehensive way than we did before. The two signature pieces of violence prevention legislation in the last thirty years have been the Brady Act and assault weapons ban. The assault weapons ban was a great idea, it got watered down, and it’s been very difficult to show a beneficial effect. The Brady Act, denying the purchase of firearms to people who are prohibited, that’s been shown to be effective, but at the same time not to prevent firearms homicides; because 40 percent of gun sales are not subject to the Brady Act because they are made by private parties. If you think you’re going to fail a background check, you don’t waste your time with a dealer; you go to private parties.

We know they [universal background checks and expanded denial-of-purchase criteria] are feasible, effective, and at the political level we know they’re supported not just by the general population, but by gun owners and even NRA members. Poll after poll after poll on background checks and broadening denial criteria. Gun policy in the US does not reflect the priorities of gun owners, let alone the general public. It reflects the priorities of a radical fringe of gun owners."

Despite a sordid and deadly reputation in Iraq, the mercenary army that began as Blackwater and is now known as Academi was a top recipient of Pentagon contracts for training Afghanistan’s security forces from 2002 to 2014, a government watchdog reported Tuesday. Ad Policy

The latest report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) also includes the surprising disclosure that IBM—a company not generally known as a defense contractor—was the largest beneficiary of a Pentagon program to stabilize Afghanistan by facilitating private investment in its vast mineral wealth.

Both findings were included in a SIGAR report that attempts to account for $66 billion appropriated by Congress to the Department of Defense for Afghanistan reconstruction. Altogether, the government spent $104 billion between 2002 and 2014 for the program. The Pentagon issued the bulk of the contracts, and the rest came from the Department of State and the US Agency for International Development.

Of the $66 billion spent by the Pentagon, however, SIGAR said DoD could only report on $21 billion, or less than one-third of its total. It accounted for the huge “discrepancy” to differences in executing contracts between “DoD and Federal accounting systems.” The Pentagon was also “unable to provide” contract data from the pre-2010 time, SIGAR said.

In 12 years of war, the report says, Academi Training Center Inc. received $569 million in contracts, or 31.9 percent of the total, of the Pentagon’s $1.8 billion Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities Fund for Afghanistan. The program, known as “DOD CN,” was designed to stabilize Afghanistan by training the country’s security forces to support military operations against drug traffickers and other armed groups.

The total puts Academi, which acquired Blackwater in 2011, far ahead of the Pentagon’s top contractors, including Northrop Grumman, CACI, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, all of which obtained multi-million dollar contracts under DOD CN.

Through two subsidiaries, Northrop Grumman received $363 million, which included “support to Afghan air capability,” SIGAR said.

(Correction: SIGAR contacted reporters after posting its report to say that it had miscalculated its contract totals and concluded that Blackwater/Academi was actually the second-largest Pentagon contractor for its Afghanistan training program. Northrop Grumman was the largest—see the update below.)

CACI, the intelligence contractor best known as the supplier of private interrogators at the US military prison in Abu Ghraib, received $248 million; Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest military contractor, won $195 million in contracts; and Raytheon Technical Services $88 million, the report said.

The awards to Blackwater and Academi were made despite the public condemnation of the company for its brutal tactics in Iraq. Those tactics were symbolized by the 2014 murder and manslaughter convictions of four Blackwater security guards for their roles in a deadly 2007 massacre at Baghdad’s Nisour Square that killed 17 and injured 14 unarmed civilians. That incident “marked a bloody nadir in America’s war in Iraq,” the New York Times reported at the time.

The trial was an epilogue to the story of Blackwater, which began as a police- and military-training facility in North Carolina and came to symbolize the country’s outsourcing of its wartime responsibilities. About 1,000 of Blackwater’s contractors guarded diplomats in Iraq. Others loaded bombs onto Predator drones. The company’s founder, Erik Prince, tapped retired Central Intelligence Agency officials for executive positions, and at one point, the C.I.A. hired Blackwater contractors to covertly track and kill Qaeda operatives worldwide, a program that was shelved before any killings were conducted.

Prince, who gained his notoriety in part from Jeremy Scahill’s 2007 book, Blackwater: The Rise of the World’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army, left the company five years ago. But he’s still seeking opportunities abroad as a kind of mercenary-consultant for foreign governments under the rubric of the Frontier Resources Group, a private equity fund based in the Cayman Islands that focuses on Africa.

In 2013, according to a recent story by Aram Roston in Buzzfeed, Prince met with the former president of Nigeria and proposed to “assemble a well-trained fighting force of non-Nigerians to battle Boko Haram,” the Islamist army that’s been terrorizing much of the country. In October 2014, he proposed that the United States use private contractors—presumably people on his payroll—to fight the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

“If the old Blackwater team were still together, I have high confidence that a multi-brigade-size unit of veteran American contractors or a multi-national force could be rapidly assembled and deployed to be that necessary ground combat team,” he wrote.

Ironically, the SIGAR report comes one day after three of the guards convicted for manslaughter asked a federal judge for leniency in their case, arguing that “a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 30 years is unconstitutionally harsh,” according to the Washington Post. The four former Blackwater defendants are scheduled to be sentenced later this month.

The $65 million appropriated to IBM was about 9 percent of the total spent by the Pentagon for a controversial project designed to convince foreign investors and mining companies to develop Afghanistan’s extensive mineral wealth. As I reported here in February on a contractor called Praetorian Standard:

The program, run by a Department of Defense Task Force for Business Stability Operations with the US Army’s Corp of Engineers, was first described by New York Times reporter James Risen in 2010. At the time, Afghan officials estimated that their deposits of copper, gold, lithium and other minerals could be worth as much as $3 trillion… In December 2014, the special inspector general began what he called a “full-court press” to determine how the Pentagon mismanaged its Business Task Force in Afghanistan. “They’ve spent approximately $700, $800 million, and as far as we can see, they’ve accomplished nothing,” SIGAR John Sopko wrote in a letter to [then] Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel detailing the corruption.

According to the latest SIGAR report, the task force spent a total of $696 million between 2010 and 2013 (it ceased operations at the end of fiscal year 2014). Of that, IBM received $65 million in obligations, or over nine percent. “IBM implemented projects designed to foster the use of information technology in order to bolster the Afghan economy,” SIGAR said.

Other US contractors identified in the SIGAR report include Navistar Defense, DynCorp International, Triple Canopy and Textron Marine & Defense.

Overall, the two largest recipients of the Pentagon’s reconstruction program were Asia Global Shipping Group and the Parwan Group. Both are Afghan logistics companies that provided transportation, building supplies and fuel to the Afghan National Security Forces. AGS received close to $1.8 billion and Parwan about $1.4 billion.

Blackwater/Academi’s total of $569 million places the mercenary at number five on the contract total. Not bad for a company responsible for so much murder and mayhem.

UPDATE: On April 2, SIGAR posted an updated report with the following corrections to its fact sheet:

*In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported $1.8 billion in DOD CN obligations. The correct reported total obligation is $1.5 billion.

**In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported that Northrop Grumman and its associated companies had received $363 million in total awards. The correct total obligation amount is $325 million.

***In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported that Northrop Grumman and its associated companies received the second-largest amount of total DOD CN obligations. The company was in fact the top recipient of DOD CN obligations.

****In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported that Academi Training Center, Incorporated had received $569 million in total DOD CN obligations and that Academi Training Center, Incorporated was the top recipient of DOD CN awards. The correct number of total awards is $309 million and Academi Training Center, Incorporated is the recipient of the second largest number of total rewards."

Listings for semi-automatic rifles on the popular online gun website Armslist.com, September 27, 2013. Ad Policy

Last October, while most of the country was obsessed with the presidential election only a week away, Radcliffe Haughton walked into a Wisconsin spa with an entirely different obsession. Earlier in the month, Zina Daniel, his estranged wife, obtained a restraining order against him after a long history of domestic abuse and stalking. She worked at the spa, and he had visited before—seventeen days prior, he slashed her car’s tires in the parking lot outside.

But now he came with more than a knife: Haughton had a .40 caliber semi-automatic Glock handgun with him. Immediately upon entering the store, he shot Zina dead—and then murdered one of her co-workers, and then another. He continued shooting, and four other people were wounded before he finally turned the gun on himself.

The judge’s restraining order specifically forbade Haughton from buying a gun, and had he gone to any licensed firearms dealer, he presumably would have been denied. Instead, Haugton went to the increasingly popular Armslist.com, where tens of thousands of guns are up for sale, and where the vast majority of the sellers are private citizens. Within days he had the Glock.

Armslist.com is only a part of the online gun marketplace, but it is a big part—there were almost 100,000 listings on the site in August. The site, and many others like it, went from being virtually unknown to hugely popular in a matter of months, as other mainstream online retail markets, like Craigslist, cracked down on gun listings:



Courtesy Mayors Against Illegal Guns

A new study by Mayors Against Illegal Guns has revealed that every thirtieth gun sold on Armslist.com was sold to someone who would have failed a background check. Of 607 would-be buyers in the sample, which stretched from February to May of this year, 3.3 percent were sold to someone who committed a crime that prohibited firearm possession under federal law.

That ratio is many magnitudes higher than the one for licensed gun dealers—based on the rate of background check denials, only 0.87 percent of would-be buyers at licensed dealers are prohibited purchasers. The report gives a troubling analogy for the Armslist.com marketplace: if one in every thirty passengers on a Boeing 747 were on the federal terror watch list, there would be twenty-two suspected terrorists on board.

And in fact, the ratio is likely much higher. Mayors Against Illegal Guns had a relatively simple methodology—the group examined 13,000 “want-to-buy” ads where the buyer entered a name and contact information, and then compared that information to publicly available criminal records.

So the one-in-thirty result is almost definitely an undercount, because it doesn’t include people who are precluded from gun ownership for other reasons: serious mental illness, immigration status, a history of drug abuse or other non-criminal criteria.

But more notably, only 5 percent of the people who place “want-to-buy” ads on Armslist.com disclose their name and contact information. So one could fairly assume that among the people who choose anonymity, the ratio of prohibited buyers is higher. The analysis also doesn’t, and couldn’t, take into account the people who simply respond to the sellers’ ads directly—another likely approach if someone knows they can’t buy a gun legally.

And again, Armslist.com is only one part of the huge online gun marketplace; Mayors Against Illegal Guns is just scratching the surface here. But other investigations have borne similar results. In 2011, investigators working for New York City called 125 sellers in fourteen states advertising on ten different websites, including Armslist.com. The investigators plainly said they were unlikely to pass a background check—and 62 percent of the sellers agreed to transfer a weapon anyway. On Armslist.com the rate was 54 percent.

These are exactly the kinds of sales the Manchin-Toomey gun legislation that failed in the Senate earlier this year was designed to stop. Under that bill—which 90 percent of the public supported—a background check would be applied almost universally, including, crucially, for online sales.

“Loopholes in our federal gun laws have taken a devastating toll on communities and neighborhoods across America. Yet in April, a minority of US senators blocked the common-sense legislation that would have closed these deadly loopholes,” said Boston Mayor Thomas Menino when the study was released. (He is a co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.) “It’s time for our leaders in Washington to put public safety first and pass sensible gun laws that will help save lives.”

The common refrain from pro-gun activists is that criminals will avoid background checks anyway—which, as this study shows, is true. But maybe we shouldn’t make it so easy for them.

When Adam Lanza entered Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, December 14, inexplicably bent on ending as many lives as possible, he was carrying a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle and several high-capacity magazines. Sadly, this isn’t the first time the country has had to deal with the aftermath of a horrific shooting spree, nor is it the first time we’ve encountered an AR-15 in this context: only days earlier, it was the weapon of choice for a shooting at an Oregon mall that killed two people. Five months earlier, it was used by James Holmes in an attack that wounded fifty-eight people and killed twelve in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. And several years before that, a man and his teenage accomplice used a Bushmaster AR-15 to terrorize the Washington, DC, area with a series of random shootings. Ad Policy

Although it is not yet clear where the Bushmaster AR-15 used by Lanza (and registered to his mother) was purchased, the model is familiar to many Walmart shoppers. It’s on sale at about 1,700 Walmart stores nationwide, though the retail chain pulled the weapon from its website three days after the attack. While the deadly rampage in Connecticut has finally and unmistakably highlighted the madness of making such weapons readily available, it’s a concern that many people with a Walmart in their community have been trying to address for years. Several months back, the Rev. Greg Brown had a troubling conversation with two members of his youth group from the northwest side of South Bend, Indiana. “They were honor roll students and little young folks that love the Lord,” Brown recounted. “One of the kids came up to me and said, ‘Rev, you ain’t gonna believe what happened the other day at Walmart.’” The kids went on to describe how, on a recent visit to the big-box store, a man asked them to fill up a gym bag with ammunition and sneak it out of the store for him. They declined.

Walmart’s ammunition sales have troubled Brown since at least 2009, when two teenagers shoplifted bullets from the local Walmart, shot at an employee who tried to stop them in the parking lot, and then embarked on a citywide robbery spree in which one man was seriously injured. When Brown headed down to the store to see how easy it would be to steal ammunition, he was shocked. Not only were there bullets arrayed on the unlocked shelves; there were rows of guns as well, including assault rifles.

South Bend has the most violent crime per capita in Indiana and well more than double the national median. Brown was outraged that Walmart was even selling these weapons, let alone that they were unlocked and under the supervision of hourly employees without specific training in firearm handling and sales. (Brown says a former Marine handles the gun sales at a nearby Dick’s Sporting Goods.) “It’s totally wrong, and it’s totally unacceptable,” he said. “You look back there and see a dad holding a gun, his son pulling on his pocket. And the son knows the gun is going home. The son’s going to know where the gun is.”

South Bend isn’t the only place where Walmart is stocking guns, including combat-style weapons and gun-related paraphernalia. The big-box chain at one point sold guns in only about a third of its stores, mainly in remote rural areas where hunting is popular. But in 2011, without much fanfare, Walmart expanded gun sales to about half of its 3,982 stores nationwide, including those in more urban areas like Albuquerque and Spokane.

The expansion of gun sales at Walmart came after a five-year slowdown. In 2006, the chain announced that it was rolling back gun sales, citing declining profit margins on the relatively expensive weapons, which even at Walmart can retail for hundreds of dollars. But in 2011, company executives were looking at eight straight quarters of declining sales at stores open for a year or more—the worst slump in Walmart’s history.

They must also have noticed that Barack Obama’s inauguration had sparked a rally in gun sales, which have steadily increased every year since 2008. The government isn’t allowed to track firearm sales, but the FBI does release figures on how many retailers ask it to run background checks—a relatively reliable indicator of total gun sales, although likely a lowball estimate, since a person can buy multiple guns on a single background check, and many gun shows aren’t required to perform such checks. In 2007, retailers asked the FBI for just over 11 million background checks; by the end of 2009, 14 million checks were requested—a 27 percent increase.

In April 2011, Walmart began stocking guns in more and more stores, expanding the sales to 1,750 outlets nationwide. By the end of that year, the FBI received 16.4 million background check requests; the number is 16.8 million this year. Overall Walmart sales figures are back on track after the 2011 slump, and executive vice president Duncan Mac Naughton told shareholders at a meeting in October 2012 that gun sales in particular are a staple of the chain’s strategy to continue boosting its numbers. He said that over the past twenty-six months, gun sales at Walmart stores open for a year or more were up an astonishing 76 percent, while ammunition sales were up 30 percent. Walmart is now the biggest seller of firearms and ammunition in America.

“This gun thing, it’s really just a nightmare,” says Bertha Lewis, president of the Black Institute, which has been organizing Walmart workers this year to protest wages and working conditions. Given its aggressive gun sales, Walmart’s logo “shouldn’t be a smiley face; it should be an automatic weapon,” she adds.

* * *

Nearly 400 guns are available in Walmart’s catalog. And even if your local store doesn’t sell a particular model, you can special-order it (assuming you pay half the cost ahead of time). With the exception of its stores in Alaska, Walmart doesn’t sell handguns, though it does sell ammunition for them, along with a wide variety of semi-automatic long-barrel weapons. For example, at half the Walmarts in America, you can buy a semiautomatic Colt M4 Ops .22 rifle; it carries a thirty-round magazine, which you can also purchase in the store. Or perhaps a Sig Sauer M400 assault rifle, advertised on Walmart’s website as “designed for use in law enforcement, military operations…as well as competitive shooting,” which is just one of several AR-15 assault rifles for sale.

In keeping with the store’s pitch as a one-stop destination for shoppers, with everything from gas to groceries, gun enthusiasts can also obtain a wide range of gun accessories—including the 360 types of ammunition listed on Walmart’s website. You can buy a 555-pack of Winchester hollow-point bullets, which the website advertises as “great for plinking and varmints,” but which would cause extensive damage should they enter a human body and expand, as they are designed to do. There are full clips of ammunition for assault rifles, including “quiet ammo” that makes only a quarter of the noise of regular bullets. Laser-pointing sights for handguns are also available, as well as belts for holding shotgun shells (only $4.97 at select stores).

Walmart, which declined to comment for this story, has said elsewhere that its stores will always respect local laws and ordinances on gun sales. But in 2005, Walmart was busted by Bill Lockyer, then the California attorney general, for thousands of state gun law violations—including selling to people that the AG’s office had notified Walmart were prohibited from owning firearms; delivering guns to customers before they passed a background check; and sometimes even failing to ascertain a customer’s identity. The company settled the suit for $14.5 million.

And, of course, Walmart has contributed to efforts to change state gun laws and make the possession and use of firearms even easier. It was one of the key backers of the American Legislative Exchange Council when the group aggressively pushed “stand your ground” laws in states across the country. (Walmart has since dropped out of ALEC under public pressure.)

In 2008, the store reached an agreement with Mayors Against Illegal Guns to adopt tough new standards for sales above the federal requirements for gun retailers. But even if every regulation is adhered to, the mass sale of weapons and ammunition will undoubtedly contribute to this country’s horrifying gun violence problem.

In fact, Walmart is increasingly popping up in court documents. In 2011, on the morning that he killed six people, including a federal judge, and injured thirteen others, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Jared Lee Loughner went to two Walmarts in Tucson in search of ammunition. He was turned away at one store for “strange behavior,” according to police, but got what he was looking for at the next Walmart. (“We share in the sadness for those people whose lives were ended too soon,” the store said in a statement at the time.)

In November, a disturbed 20-year-old in Missouri was arrested for planning mass shootings at a screening of the new Twilight movie and at the local Walmart—the latter because he could reload there. “He decided that he would go and shoot people at Walmart in Bolivar,” according to the court documents. “He would walk into the store and just start shooting people at random and if he ran out of ammunition…he would just break the glass where the ammunition is being stored and get some more and keep on shooting until police arrived.”

Local news reports are rife with stories of gun thefts at Walmart stores, often apparently because of lax oversight of the weapons inventory. In October, a man and a woman cracked open a display case at a Walmart store in Tyler, Texas, “while a clerk wasn’t looking,” according to local reports, and stole four assault rifles. The two have yet to be apprehended.

A week earlier, at a Walmart in Missoula County, Montana, a clerk was showing a Sig Sauer semiautomatic rifle to a man who then “grabbed it and ran for the store’s entrance,” according to the charging documents. The police nabbed him a short time later, after he had tossed the AR-15 from his car. In early November, police in Summerville, South Carolina, were on the lookout for suspects in incidents at two separate Walmarts, where display cases had been smashed with a hammer and the AR-15s and other assault rifles inside them stolen. And these are just a few of the incidents involving guns or ammunition at Walmart in the past two months. Since the start of 2012, there have been at least fifty shootings in a Walmart store or parking lot, incidents tracked on a blog called Walmart Shootings (walmartshootings.blogspot.com).

The possibility that South Bend could end up on that list once again is what has the Reverend Brown so alarmed. For forty-eight years, he has lived with his mother, Bertha, a retired schoolteacher, in a house less than a mile from a Walmart. The neighborhood is a rough one, and he’s seen it get worse; Brown said that the locals sometimes call it Babylon, “because ain’t nothing righteous.”

Bertha, who has lived in South Bend for sixty-five years, says the violence is the worst she’s ever seen. “It’s real sad, because we’ve got a lot of young people, and people are getting killed—every time you look, someone is getting shot,” she says. “Every time you pick up the paper…. I don’t know who’s doing it, and they can’t seem to catch these people, but the guns are out there.”

For four months last summer, Reverend Brown’s prayer group, nicknamed the God Squad, walked around town sticking three strips of tape (symbolizing the Father, Son and Holy Spirit) with anti-violence messages onto telephone poles. The group was “praying that we could cease the violence, cease the drama. And it worked in some areas,” Brown said. “But I’m going to be honest with you: we’re at an all-time high.”

So when he saw the weapons for sale at Walmart, Brown took action. He called the chief of police and members of the City Council, who in turn applied pressure on local Walmart managers. In response, the chain promised the city in writing, in June, that it would no longer sell assault weapons in South Bend.

Brown thought the problem was solved. Then, this past fall, his phone rang: “I had a parent call me and say, ‘Mr. Brown, they’re selling them.’” He went back to Walmart, and indeed, the weapons were still on display—without much in the way of security. “I saw the glass unsecured,” Brown said. “The employee who worked there said, ‘I only work part-time back here.’ He opened the glass…. This guy left the cabinet open and walked away.”

This time, Brown came prepared: he’d brought a police officer and a reporter for the local ABC station with him. They took pictures, and the reporter did a story that made waves in South Bend. Walmart apologized and promised to fix the error.

A month later, Brown said he’d heard from a police officer that the combat-style weapons were being sold inside the packed store on Black Friday. He said he’ll keep up the fight and plans to visit the City Council again to ask for tougher action. “I’m not against guns; I’m not trying to go against the NRA,” Brown said. “But I’m against the way they sell them. You can go in Walmart at 3:30 in the morning and you can’t buy a can of beer. But you can walk in there to the ammunition [counter] and buy as many boxes as you want. I have a problem with that.”

Other anti-violence activists are disturbed by Walmart’s ballyhooed expansion into urban markets like Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles, Reno, Detroit and other cities. That, combined with the increased gun sales, could be a recipe for disaster.

The chain says it won’t sell guns at those stores—a condition of approval for a new Walmart in Washington, DC—but Bertha Lewis is wary. Even if that turns out to be true, the guns are likely to be sold at a Walmart somewhere else in the area. “Guns are a scourge in black and brown and low- and moderate-income communities,” Lewis said. “And here comes Walmart with Mr. Smiley Face: ‘Here, here’s a $5 sweater—and, oh, by the way, you can get this gun.’”

Lewis thinks the gun sales will soon be a new front in the activist campaign against Walmart. “You’re going to see it more and more and more as folks organize against Walmart,” she said. “One of their vulnerabilities is their stance on guns. Don’t try to sell me an apple and a gun at the same time. Don’t tell me that you’re trying to give fresh fruit and vegetables to people so that they can have a healthy life, and then you turn around and on the next counter you have instruments of death.”

Also in this issue, the editors say nothing like the Newtown massacre ever needs to happen again and Katherine S. Newman examines “The Roots of a Rampage.”"

On Sunday morning, the president of the United States humiliated his secretary of state, derided diplomacy as “wasting time,” mocked North Korea’s national leader as “Little Rocket Man,” and renewed his macho threat to “do what needs to be done” to thwart North Korea’s nuclear program—at the UN last month he said he might “need” to “destroy” the country. As always, analysts struggled to make sense of Trump’s tweets—geopolitically, psychologically—but the conclusion seemed inescapable that he is itching for a military conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary. Ad Policy

On Sunday night, a 64-year-old retiree by the name of Stephen Paddock took at least 10 rifles, some of them semi-automatic or automatic weapons, to the 32nd floor of the gilded Mandalay Bay resort casino, and gunned down hundreds of people, killing at least 50, in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Paddock shot his prey from up high and watched them scatter, like ants, like animals. There is no connection between Trump’s threat and Paddock’s massacre, except a profound lack of empathy, a toxic male willingness to indulge grievances (we don’t yet know Paddock’s, but we soon will) with violence, and an obsession with the display of absolute power.

Maybe it’s because I went to bed fearing a war, even a nuclear conflict, with North Korea, and woke up to random bloody gun terror at a country-music concert in Las Vegas that I see the two tragedies as entwined. There is something deeply wrong with the American male identification of guns as a symbol of freedom. We need to translate that correctly: By this definition, it is the capacity for brutal violence that is also a symbol, maybe even a prerequisite, of freedom. Of almost strictly male freedom, we must emphasize. This set of values wasn’t invented by the madman in the White House; he is just a symptom of a country and an electorate that value guns over children’s lives. On social media today I saw a heartbreaking impotence among many pundits and political activists, repeatedly expressed this way: If we didn’t do something to regulate guns, especially automatic weapons, after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre—in which 20 first-graders and six school staffers were murdered—we’ll never do anything. I don’t share that point of view, but I understand it.

Once again, the National Rifle Association has blood on its hands. At one time a respectable organization of gun owners promoting proper gun use and gun safety, three decades ago the NRA began to turn itself into a trade association for big gun manufacturers, and a purveyor of canny right-wing paranoia designed to spur gun sales. In the 1990s, as right-wing anti-government zealots began a backlash against what they perceived as a Democratic administration intent on taking their guns and their freedom, the NRA channeled that paranoia. Even after the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 by government-hating extremists, NRA head Wayne La Pierre was describing Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents as “jackbooted government thugs” in a fundraising letter. Guns went from being something used to hunt or—perhaps, in a rare event—to protect oneself and one’s family, to being a symbol of individual sovereignty and freedom from control of government. The Obama administration was a great gift to the NRA; gun and bullet purchases soared after the election of our first black president. Nonetheless, the NRA spent $30 million to elect Trump, who spoke at its national convention and praised LaPierre as a patriot.

Trump repaid the NRA’s investment by signing a bill that lifted Obama-era limits on gun sales to the mentally ill. Yet, with the departure of the Obama administration, gun sales have sagged; the first black president is no longer around to take your guns, and the NRA-loving Trump is in the White House, so maybe it’s safe to stop hoarding guns? Not so fast, said the NRA. In a despicable propaganda video earlier this year, NRA cheerleader Dana Loesch spun a lurid tale of Black Lives Matters protesters and Women’s Marchers as the latest threat to guns and, yes, freedom. Hollywood liberals, the fake-news media, as well as an ex-president (you know whom they mean) are painting Trump as an illegitimate “Hitler.” Only the NRA—and, yes, more guns—can protect your freedom.

On Monday morning, Trump again repaid the NRA’s $30 million investment with a pathetically passive statement that described the Las Vegas massacre as though it were a natural disaster, never once mentioning the weapons of hell that caused it. He called it “an act of pure evil,” extolled the bravery of police and first responders, and made appeals for love, prayers, and unity. He displayed his trademark lack of empathy about the victims’ families: “We cannot fathom their pain or imagine their loss.” What a strange thing to say: Many of us can, and if we can’t, it’s our human responsibility to try, to bear witness. If we really can’t fathom their pain or loss, we don’t have to do anything about it.

Sadly, we are unlikely to do anything about it. In the wake of the murders, gun stocks are soaring, anticipating a rise in gun sales as the result of a possible move to restrict firearms such as used to be routine after a bloody spree like this one. I don’t think the gun industry has much to worry about. I hope to be proven wrong. Nevada has among the most lax gun laws in the country, with no limits on the number of firearms one can own, no requirement of registration, no limits on automatic weapons. The dead suspect’s brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters: “Find out who sold him the machine gun!” Will any Nevada lawmaker be brave enough to make that an issue?

This morning, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Trump still planned to visit Puerto Rico this week. That’s good—there’s plenty he could do to help the storm-ravaged island. One easy helpful move would be to shut down his Twitter attacks on San Juan Mayor Carmen Cruz and on the people of Puerto Rico as lazy. With reports over the weekend that the commonwealth’s morgues are filling up, there may well have been more than 50 deaths last night there. But their slow-motion tragedy has been nearly blasted out of the news by this cruel assault on people Trump more easily sees as real Americans.

President Obama used to use these occasions, which hit him all too frequently in his eight years, to search for ways to prevent future tragedies, usually ideas for gun-safety legislation and mental-health funding. In his brief remarks Monday, Trump did nothing of the kind. He seemed to warn against “searching for some kind of meaning; the answers do not come easy.” I preferred the response to the massacre that came from Senator Chris Murphy, who represents Newtown, Connecticut: “It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.”

We’ll see, but I’m not optimistic. The president rode a wave of white male paranoia and perceived lost power to the White House; the GOP has stoked those emotions for 50 years. It’s hard to imagine this president, or this Congress, begin to unravel the connections they’ve woven between masculinity, power, guns, and violence. The best short-term outcome I can see? Trump may be too busy to tweet insults and up the likelihood of war with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un."

We have been here before and we will find ourselves here again. The extrajudicial killing of black people like 12-year-old Tamir Rice is not new, and neither is the fact that Timothy Loehmann, the officer who killed him, will not face any criminal charges. Our recent history with Darren Wilson and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Daniel Pantaleo and Eric Garner in New York, and the mysterious death of Sandra Bland in Walter County, Texas, show us how little to expect for black lives in the current “justice” system. Ad Policy

The killing of Tamir Rice felt like it could have been different. He was a 12-year-old shot in broad daylight while playing with a toy gun. That much was surmised, or at least hypothesized, by the person who made the initial 911 call. But somehow, that information didn’t make it to the officers who responded to the call, Loehmann and Frank Garmback, and when they arrived to the scene Loehmann opened fire within two seconds. They later claimed that Tamir had ignored their repeated commands to drop the (toy) weapon, but video that surfaced shows them acting more swiftly than their accounts of the shooting would have you believe—too swiftly to have assessed any threat, to make any commands, or made any good-faith attempt at de-escalation. It was the video, that damning piece of evidence, that was supposed to make this time different—the video we didn’t have when Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. The police are not afraid of cameras because the cameras only capture the police doing their jobs.

We had video when Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner, and that didn’t make a difference. But maybe Tamir, a child, would be a more sympathetic victim than the 53-year-old Garner, who was accused of the vicious crime of selling loose cigarettes. Tamir was a child playing in the park.

But black children aren’t children, as we were reminded after the McKinney, Texas, pool-party incident, where officers assaulted a black girl wearing a bathing suit, and the assault on a 16-year-old Spring Valley High School student in South Carolina. Black children are assumed latent criminals with violent intentions. Tamir was big for his age and therefore perceived as older, we are told, and should have known as much before playing with his toy gun in a public space. Then again, Ohio is a state where it is legal for an adult to carry a firearm openly, so what grounds, then, did the police have for shooting him?

And what to make of Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty’s declining to indict Loehmann and Garmback, and, in the words of Samaria Rice, Tamir’s mother, acting “like the police officers’ defense attorney” by suggesting to the grand jury that no charges be brought against them? What does it mean when those charged with upholding the law interpret the law in a way that leads no one being held accountable for the death of a 12-year-old black child? How could anyone look at that video and draw any other conclusion than the legal definition of murder?

The video didn’t matter to McGinty, because killing black people is not a crime. The police are not afraid of cameras, because the cameras only capture the police doing their jobs. “Serve and protect,” as popularly understood, is a myth. For the police, to serve means to use violence, including lethal force, at their discretion at any time, and to protect means to validate the threat of blackness born of the racist imagination. They are not meant to deter or prevent crime; the police exist to violently reinforce the status quo of white supremacy and economic degradation. Killing black people is not a crime. Instead, it is the basis of American identity. Related Article How Can No One Be to Blame for Tamir Rice’s Death? Dani McClain

Every now and then, the system surprises us, as in the case of former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, recently convicted on four counts of rape after assaulting 13 black women. It’s these moments that are suppose to inspire hope that the system can be tinkered with and reformed, that we can find justice for black lives within the current structure. But this is the exception. More often, “justice” looks like non-indictments in the death of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, and Tamir Rice. It looks like a year to bring charges against Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke in the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, or a hung jury in the case of William Porter, the first officer to go to trial for the death of Freddie Gray. More often than not, “justice” looks like black people being killed by police with no headlines or hashtags. It is the routine killing of black people by the state with no chance for accountability.

When indictments and charges and convictions do come down, it feels like a moment to rejoice. This system has never accounted for black people as citizens, so on the rare occasion that it does, there is some relief. But that relief is tempered by the fact that killings and beatings will continue, no matter the consequences for a select few officers, because the job of the police has not changed. We still call on them to “serve and protect”—to arrest and kill—because every black child is seen as latent criminal with violent intentions. We are still delusional about the role police can play in curbing violence. We still think that 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, who was killed when cops responded to a domestic disturbance call in Chicago last weekend, deserved to die, and that 55-year-old Bettie Jones’s death in the same incident was an “accident.” We think Tamir Rice’s being big for his age is enough of a justification for the bullet that killed him.

We have been here before and, unless white people decide that black lives are more valuable than the American identity built on violence toward blackness, we will find ourselves here again. Until then, the police will do their jobs, the cameras will capture it, and everyone will go about their business."

While I write this dispatch, I’m waiting patiently for the next set of dispiriting killings in this country. And I have faith. Before I’m done, some angry—or simply mentally disturbed—and well-armed American “lone wolf” (or lone wolves) will gun down someone (or a number of people) somewhere and possibly himself (or themselves) as well. Count on that. It’ll be my last paragraph. Think of it as, in a grim way, something to look forward to as you read this piece on American armed mayhem.

National security officials and politicians have been pounding home the message that the “greatest threat” to Americans is an extreme and brutal jihadist movement thousands of miles away and the videos and social media messages its followers produce that make it seem close at hand. With that in mind, let’s take a look at a few of the dangers of armed life in these United States, a quick survey of national insecurity in a country armed to the teeth.

I’m sure you won’t be surprised to learn that, in the first half of 2015, there’s been a plethora of incidents to draw on. There’s the killer still on the loose in northern Colorado who shot at people in cars or out biking or walking late at night. There’s the suspected serial killer who dumped seven bodies behind a strip mall in New Britain, Connecticut, and may now be in jail on unrelated charges. There’s the ongoing trial of James Holmes who blew away 12 moviegoers and wounded 70 in a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012. There was the mass killing of seven people in February in the tiny town of Tyrone, Missouri, by Joseph Aldridge, an armed recluse who then killed himself. And don’t forget Sudheer Khamitkar, who shot to death his wife and two young sons and then himself in Tulsa in April, or Christopher Carrillo, who murdered four of his family members and then turned his gun on himself in a Tucson home in May. And many others.

In such a list, there should be a special place for a phenomenon that, though largely untabulated, has been gaining attention in recent years as ever more Americans “carry” in ever more places. This means ever more loose guns lying around. I’m talking about the mayhem committed by toddlers (or perhaps they should be thought of as American lone wolf cubs). Toddler shootings range from the 2-year-old who killed his mother in a Walmart in Idaho with the gun she was packing in her purse as 2014 ended to the 3-year-old who discovered a gun in a purse in an Albuquerque motel room in February and wounded his father and pregnant mother with a single shot. Such a list for this year would have to include the Florida 2-year-old who found his father’s gun in the family car and killed himself with it in January, the 3-year-old who picked up an unattended gun and killed a 1-year-old in a Cleveland home in April, the Virginia 2-year-old who found a gun on top of a dresser and killed himself in late May, and the 4-year-old who, at about the same time in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, picked up a shotgun at a target shooting range and killed his 22-year-old uncle. Toddler killings have been commonplace enough in these pistol-packin’ years that they now significantly outpace terror killings in the United States. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED.

The Big Leagues of Violence

While we’re at it (before we get to the really big stuff), there is the crew I think of as American-style suicide killers. They lack a political or religious ideology like the suicide bombers of the Middle East, but they are on missions for which killing yourself as well as others is the imagined end. Think of them as informal American jihadis, in touch with no ISIS social media types, watching no inflammatory terror videos, but all riled up anyway, often deeply disturbed, armed, and on suicide missions in the American homeland.

Moving on to bigger things, one kind of killing has been much in the news of late: police shootings. The figures the FBI has traditionally compiled on them have proven to be way too low, so others have entered the fray. The Washington Post, for instance, recently began compiling a database of “every fatal shooting by police” in the United States in 2015 (deaths by Taser not included). Their figure so far: at least 385 for the first five months of 2015 or approximately one of every 13 non-suicide gun deaths so far this year.

“About half the victims,” the Post reports, “were white, half minority. But the demographics shifted sharply among the unarmed victims, two-thirds of whom were black or Hispanic. Overall, blacks were killed at three times the rate of whites or other minorities when adjusting by the population of the census tracts where the shootings occurred.” A Guardian study adds this detail: “Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people.”

According to The Guardian, a recent Bureau of Justice report found that over the last eight years an average of 928 Americans have died annually at the hands of the police. (FBI figures: only 383.) In other words in those years, there were 7,427 police homicides, the equivalent of more than two 9/11s. Compared to other developed countries, these figures are staggering. There were, for instance, more fatal police shootings in the United States in the month of March 2015 (97) than Australia had between 1992 and 2011 (94). Similarly, there have been almost three times as many police shootings in California alone in 2015 (72) as Canada experiences annually (25).

And when it comes to armed dangers in a country in which there are estimated to be between 270 and 310 million guns or, on average, nearly one firearm for every man, woman, and child, we haven’t even made it to the major leagues of death yet. Take, for instance, suicide by gun. In the last year for which we have figures, 2013, there were 21,175 such deaths and they seem to be rising. Deaths by firearm in this country totaled 33,636 in that year and seem to be rising as well.

And just for the heck of it, maybe we should throw in one other kind of weapon (even if it generally lacks the intentionality of firearms): cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Many traffic deaths could certainly qualify as assaults, however unintentional, with a deadly weapon. In 2013, there were 32,719 such deaths, essentially equaling death by gun in America.

In all, then, we’re talking about approximately 66,000 death-dealing assaults with weapons or vehicles in this country yearly.

Armed Dangers and Meal Tickets

Now, let’s leave those annual fields of carnage behind and turn to the “greatest threat” of our moment—or so the officials of the national security state would have you believe. You know what that is, of course: the Islamic State with its sophisticated propaganda skills that, according to official Washington, regularly run circles around whatever this country and its allies can muster in response. Despite the nearly trillion dollars a year that goes into national security and the elaborate surveillance and monitoring systems that have been put in place, we remain strangely defenseless against its wiles. Using social media, its facilitators threaten to obliterate distance, reach across oceans, and rile up displaced, marginalized, and often slightly unhinged young American Muslims, and—at least so the story goes—prepare the groundwork for unparalleled mayhem in “the homeland.”

With that dire scenario in mind, here is 2015 in Islamic State terrorism in the US in terms of death and destruction: In May, evidently affected by ISIS’s social media presence, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, two young American Muslims from Phoenix who were roommates, set out to attack a cartoon exhibit and contest in Garland, Texas, devoted to the Prophet Muhammad and organized by Islamophobe Pam Geller. Armed with assault rifles and wearing body armor, they managed to wound an unarmed security guard in the ankle before they were killed by an off-duty traffic officer, also working security at the event.

Similarly, this month a 26-year-old black Muslim, Usaamah Rahim, was reportedly involved in an ISIS-inspired plot in Boston to somehow behead Geller. He then supposedly abandoned that plan, deciding instead to behead some local “boys in blue.” Approached on the street for questioning by Boston police and FBI agents in plain clothes, he pulled out a “military-style knife,” they claimed, threatened them, and was shot to death. (Some aspects of their account have been questioned.) And that’s it, folks. The greatest threat on the planet has, so far this year, managed to inspire three marginal young men to get themselves killed. When it comes to the dangers in American life, put that in the context of tens of thousands of annual deaths by firearm, or even of the toddler killings.

Despite all the talk of possible jihadist plots, this is the evidence we have of the threat to the “homeland” which the Islamic State represents at the moment and into which so much money and preventive activity flows (to the exclusion of so much else). It is, we are told, a “new threat,” utterly unlike the normal dangers of our American world. In fact, such violence, rare as it may be, shouldn’t seem aberrational at all. It really should strike us as more of the same—even if the names of the perpetrators sometimes have a different ring to them: men, often young, with access to weapons, in some cases mentally unstable, and with a grudge, intent on striking out. They should remind us of those American men who so regularly kill their girlfriends and then themselves or of many of the mass killers of recent years.

Yet this is the lone danger that is constantly played up as the one worthy of both fear and investment. Of course, jihadist terror is perfectly real, and if Americans lived in Syria or Iraq or Libya, it would be a horrifying problem. But whatever the present skills of ISIS’s propagandists, such violence has, since 9/11, proven more dangerous than shark attacks, but not much else in American life. And when law enforcement agencies are surveyed, according to Charles Kurzman and David Schanzer, they, too, see the dangers of Islamist terrorism as modest indeed in this country, particularly in comparison to the homegrown far-right-wing version of the same.

It matters that we are still protected by two oceans and that the Islamic jihadist heartlands are distant indeed. But let’s be honest: the threat of Islamic terrorism here is also a meal ticket for the national security state. (Hence all those plots that turn out to be essentially instigated, funded, often essentially organized by FBI informers and then “cracked” by the FBI.) It’s one major way that the officials of that state-within-a-state ensure support and funding, endow themselves with special privileges, including never having to appear in court for potential criminal acts, and entrench their anti-democratic methods and the blanket of secrecy that goes with them ever more deeply in American life.

As for the real armed dangers in our world, nobody’s likely to put much money into protecting you from them and, despite those 66,000 deaths a year, somehow the world continues to spin and the end is not nigh.

By the way, you do have one thing coming to you, don’t you? I promised you a last paragraph. So here goes.

In the week-plus since I first began writing this piece, there was indeed one Islamic State–“inspired” attack in the United States. A 21-year-old man lunged at an FBI agent searching his home in Staten Island, New York, with “a large kitchen knife.” He was reputed to be part of another of those ISIS-inspired terror “plots” that seem unlikely to ever be successfully carried out. There was also a mass killing. A 21-year-old white racist walked into a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and opened fire in what, if he had been Muslim, would have been called a terror attack, killing nine, including the church’s pastor, who was also a state senator. As Reuters reported, the massacre “recalled the 1963 bombing of an African-American church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four girls and galvanized the civil rights movement of the 1960s.” There was as well at least one more grim toddler shooting. A Cincinnati 3-year-old found his mother’s gun in her purse, shot himself in the chest, and died. There was also at least one more fellow on a suicide mission: a Vermont man sought by the police in the killing of his ex-girlfriend engaged in a high-speed car chase before crashing and committing suicide by gun. There were a number of police homicides, including: a man on probation in a Hacienda Inn in South Lake Tahoe; a 28-year-old man in a high-speed car chase in Stockton, California; a 28-year-old man, unarmed but “behaving erratically,” in Des Moines, Iowa; a man who stabbed a policeman trying to arrest him in Brighton Beach, New York; and a man tentatively identified as African in Louisville, Kentucky, accused of violently threatening the police with a flag pole (with the usual conflicting stories from police and eyewitnesses about what actually happened). And in the smorgasbord that is America’s cavalcade of violence, we shouldn’t leave out the off-duty Neptune, New Jersey, police sergeant who chased his ex-wife in 7-year-old daughter before threatening to kill himself and being arrested by the police; or the Iowa City mall security guard, evidently fired from his job earlier that day, who went home, got a weapon, returned, and killed a 20-year-old female employee of the mall’s children’s museum whom he had previously been harassing. He fled, but was arrested by the police soon after. Meanwhile, a mentally disturbed young man with a grudge against the police bought an armored van on eBay (“touted as a ‘Zombie apocalypse assault vehicle’ with ‘gun ports’ capable of ‘drive-by mow-downs’ and full armor and bulletproof windows ‘just in case someone might try to take this bad boy from you’”). He then built pipe bombs, armed himself with an assault rifle and shotgun, drove to Police Headquarters in Dallas, and launched a full-scale attack on the place. Miraculously, he managed to kill no one, despite also crashing his van into several police cars, and was finally killed by a police sniper. And last but hardly least, some gunfire hit closer to home. Three young men in Brooklyn, New York, were shot and wounded in a housing-project playground complex (named after a neighborhood 13-year-old who had been killed by a policeman in 1994). Someone I know gives classes in that complex. The shooter remains on the loose."

There is a ban on the sale and distribution of toy guns in New York City. This measure was enacted after police accidentally shot and killed a child who was brandishing a toy pistol. There is no such ban on real guns, however. Perhaps you could lend her one of your own. Have fun at the party.

There is a ban on the sale and distribution of candy bars in New York City.

Troubled Mind

Dear Troubled:

There is a ban on innocent suspect profiles in New York City. This measure was enacted after police accidentally shot several dozen innocent suspect profiles who were brandishing their bodies in suspiciously expressive and unpredictable ways. As you can surely understand, it becomes very confusing for law enforcement when they have to make on-the-spot judgments balancing the presumption of innocence, one of our most sacred jurisprudential ideals, against the kinds of decisive action necessary to protect us all from high crime statistics. You will be pleased to know that since the enactment of this ban, the police have shot only guilty suspect profiles whose résumés provided ample probable cause for prolonged gunfire.

Have you considered moving to New Jersey? I hear that there are quite a few innocent suspect profiles who commute.

Dear Dr. Mad Law:

While on vacation in Jamaica, I sent a postcard to my sister, who lives in New York City. When she got it, the card was in little pieces and wrapped in a plastic bag with a note of apology from the post office. My sister says it’s because the post office unfairly singles out Jamaican postcards; next thing you know they’re in a plastic bag. Can this be true? What gives?

Bewildered Sister

Dear Bewildered:

There is a ban on the sale and distribution of all postcards, regardless of ethnic or national origin, in New York City. This measure was enacted after a recent flood of angry postcards nearly buried City Hall and threatened to sweep the occupants from their various offices. Better safe than sorry.

Furthermore, I was able to confirm that the postal workers who encountered your particular postcard acted reasonably under the circumstances. What your letter fails to mention is that your card pictured a suspiciously beady-eyed, gaudily outfitted tropical parrot whose talons were clenched around a large gun-shaped branch. Understandably, the postal police, whose jobs are very stressful, feared for their lives and drew their weapons. But despite repeated volleys, the parrot’s fierce raptor talons remained clenched, leading frightened law officers to reasonably conclude that the parrot was wearing bulletproof bootlets. They continued shooting in self-defense until they were sure that they had made a tragic mistake. As you must know, Jamaican parrots have often appeared on When Good Pets Go Bad, and your shifty little bird bore a strong resemblance to them all. I’d say those fine public servants were just doing their job.

A Connecticut judge ruled Thursday afternoon that a lawsuit against Remington Arms Company over the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School can move forward. Ad Policy

The ruling is a victory for the victims and families who brought what could be a landmark case against gun manufacturers—but it should be understood as a narrow procedural win that did not yet beat back the gunmaker-immunity law passed by Congress in 2005. Ultimately, the unprecedented immunity given to gun manufacturers may still shield Remington from any liability for the deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook in December 2012.

The families are arguing that Remington is liable for “negligent entrustment” of the Bushmaster XM15-E2S that Adam Lanza used to carry out the massacre. When Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), the highly controversial legislation that gave gun manufacturers broad immunity against civil suits, it wrote in an exemption for negligent-entrustment claims.

But negligent-entrustment cases have commonly involved situations where a gun shop sells a weapon to someone it knows shouldn’t have it. The Sandy Hook families are making a novel claim that gun companies, and in this case Remington, are guilty of negligent entrustment by the very act of mass producing and marketing lethal, military-style weapons to the general public despite recurring evidence that assault rifles are used in mass killings—and that the gunmaker-immunity law does not apply.

If successful, their case would open the industry to waves of lawsuits over deaths caused by assault rifles. If the trial even got to the discovery phase, it might reveal fascinating information about how gun companies market their weapons, and what they truly believe about the lethality of their products.

Judge Barbara Bellis didn’t rule on the question of whether the families have a legitimate negligent-entrustment claim that gets past the PLCAA. Rather, she rejected a bold defense motion to dismiss the case that argued that the court doesn’t even have jurisdiction in the first place. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST ANALYSIS AND REPORTING

“[Defense lawyers] were trying to get the case dismissed before any discussion of the facts simply on the basis of PLCAA, saying that it was a jurisdictional statute that denies the court the opportunity to even consider the claims,” said Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA who has written extensively about the legal landscape around gun control. Bellis rejected that claim, and said her court does have jurisdiction.

If the defense lawyers had successfully argued that courts can’t even hear cases against gun manufacturers, it would have been a notable victory for the industry. But just because Bellis will continue to hear the case, it doesn’t mean she will ultimately decide that the families can get around PLCAA. “As to other issues about the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ claim, she sort of kicked the can down the road, and so they’re going to have to fight about that again,” said Sachin Pandya, a law professor at the University of Connecticut.

The next court hearing is scheduled for April 19, and victory for the Sandy Hook victims and families remains a distant goal. “I think the plaintiffs still have very tough road ahead of them,” said Winkler. “The PLCAA provides broad protection for gunmakers, and the gunmakers may yet win this case and get the plaintiffs’ claims thrown out.”

Gunmaker immunity has taken a central role in the Democratic presidential primary, as Bernie Sanders voted for the immunity legislation. During the campaign, he co-sponsored a bill to repeal most of the immunity provisions in PLCAA, but he also has defended his vote at times, and told the New York Daily News this month that he doesn’t think “the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer.”

Bellis’s ruling came down only hours before the final Democratic presidential debate. In a statement, Clinton said, “Today’s ruling in Connecticut is an important step forward for these families, who are bravely fighting to hold irresponsible gunmakers accountable for their actions. They deserve their day in court. Period. Unfortunately, PLCAA—the sweeping immunity law that protects gun manufacturers and dealers—still remains a major obstacle for these families and others seeking to hold these gun companies accountable.”"

On the February 25 edition of MSNBC’s AM Joy, host Joy Reid moderated a segment about the NRA, digging into the callous attacks the NRA has made against the Parkland students who are demanding gun control. Reid and her panel had a merry time belittling the NRA’s most visible spokesperson of late, political soldier of fortune Dana Loesch. To put a period on the point that the NRA is behind the times, Reid shared an ad featuring Loesch pitching her new show on NRA TV as a program that will challenge media giants. The panel called the NRA format “so ’90s” and rightfully pointed out that NRA TV isn’t likely to make a big splash on social media. Ad Policy

I wasn’t laughing. Yes, NRA TV—presented on NRATV.com, Roku, and Youtube, among other outlets—is nonetheless watched by almost no one. And, yes, NRA TV is far from representative of mainstream views about guns. NRA TV’s mix of live talk and short videos, which feature sensational attacks on the media, speeches by NRA bigwigs like Wayne LaPierre and Chris W. Cox (the principal political strategist for Institute for Legislative Action, NRA’s lobbying arm), scare videos, and cable-news style punditry, makes arguments very few people in the United States would support. Take, for example, a recent segment featuring former Secret Service agent and failed Florida congressional candidate Dan Bongino, in which he argues that for a “good number of people,” the AR-15 is “a fantastic self-defense weapon.”

The existence of NRA TV is, in fact, one of many signs that the right wing has lost the real culture wars, having almost no influence in Hollywood, popular music, or mainstream media. No wonder it promotes the meme “fake news.”

But there’s something very important missing from this analysis. NRA TV isn’t targeting the mainstream. No, NRA TV is directly speaking to the group Donald Trump referred to as “Second Amendment people” in a campaign speech many read as an incitement to violent action from gun advocates if the election were “rigged” and Hillary Clinton won.

Trump’s “Second Amendment people” include the Patriot Movement, a network made up of groups like the Bundy bunch that famously staged a 41-day armed occupation of the Malheur County Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon, in January 2016. The animating, radicalizing core ideology of that movement is violent white nationalism. NRA TV ideologically trains these front-line troops, which many believe will only grow more dangerous as the Trump presidency continues, particularly if he is perceived to be under attack, scandalized, and humiliated. That’s no joke.

Trump is like a fetish object for far right, whose rage is not really animated by corrupt banks, failing government, the rise of the 1 percent, and globalization. These forces may create the underlying conditions for the rise of radical movements, but what animates movements on the right—the demons that drive them to action and keep them tucked into Trumpist foolishness—is their hatred of people like us. We are the targets of their rage specifically because they’re losing cultural currency as we grow in cultural influence. We have become proxies for all of the ills of society. For these radical elements of the white-identity movement, the stockpiling of guns is one way of signaling in-group belonging, their commitment to the past in a world where they are losing the future, and, of course, their possession of the ultimate tools of the bully.

But don’t underestimate the right. Yeah, the NRA may well be out of touch with the mainstream. But what the far right generally, and the NRA in particular, is very good at is manipulating the Overton Window. By organizing and training the most active and extreme elements of the right, the NRA capitalizes on the radicalizing effect of the arguments made by that part of the movement.

The Overton Window is what public-policy advocates often use to frame the viable range of ideas in political discourse, while excluding what is considered too extreme. But the window isn’t static. Extremists can stretch the limits of what is acceptable and push political debates to the right when the political climate is ripe for change, as is the case right now.

In the 1980s, religious right-wing groups employed debate coaches to teach evangelical youth how to engage in the abortion debate in order to push the debate over abortion to the right. NRA TV is an updated version of the same tactic that attempts to drive Second Amendment panic."

Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr is a person without political fear. Maybe that comes from being the son of the brilliant Dr. Malcolm Kerr, “a pioneer in the field of Middle East studies,” who was killed in Lebanon in 1984 when president of an American University in Beirut. Maybe it comes from having nothing left to prove after leading the Warriors to two championships as well as a 73-win season over the last three years. Maybe it comes from coaching in the Bay Area, where the political winds tend to move toward wanting prominent athletic figures to engage on issues instead of “sticking to sports.” Whatever the motivations, Kerr has again chosen to use his platform to try to reach people who may not otherwise be reached by speaking out after yesterday’s mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. The greatest tool of the National Rifle Association and the politicians they own is our cynical belief that none of this can ever change. Meanwhile, racist politicians push for “a wall” to keep out imaginary enemies. This is depressing, but it cannot be an excuse for inaction. Steve Kerr spoke to that dynamic before Wednesday’s game against the Portland Trailblazers, saying: Ad Policy

Nothing has been done. It doesn’t seem to matter to our government that children are being shot to death day after day in schools. It doesn’t matter that people are being shot at a concert, in a movie theater. It’s not enough, apparently, to move our leadership, our government, people that are running this country, to actually do anything. That’s demoralizing. But we can do something about it. We can vote people in who actually have the courage to protect people’s lives and not just bow down to the NRA because they’ve financed their campaign for them. So, hopefully we’ll find enough people, first of all, to vote good people in, but hopefully we can find enough people with courage to help our citizens remain safe and focus on the real safety issues. Not building some stupid wall for billions of dollars that has nothing to do with our safety, but actually protecting us from what truly is dangerous, which is maniacs with semi-automatic weapons just slaughtering our children. It’s disgusting.

Kerr wasn’t the only person in the sports world to speak out. After Trump tweeted out, “No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school,” Seattle Seahawk wide receiver Doug Baldwin tweeted back to him, “Yea.. but the fact is that they AREN’T safe. Just more rhetoric and no action. WAKEUP!!!!”

These may seem like small gestures, but when you have a president and NRA-owned Congress gaslighting an entire country by telling us that these kinds of shootings are merely “mental-health issues” while both making it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns and cutting funds for mental-health programs, it’s easy to fear that we are collectively going mad ourselves. I don’t write these words lightly. Coming from a family where mental health is a serious issue, I see the NRA and GOP’s instinct to stigmatize people with mental illnesses as craven and contemptible. But when these shootings occur and all we get is a shrug, some prayers, and bombast about this being “the price of freedom,” it is easy to feel like we are losing our own grip on reality. I am not saying gun control is the answer to what ails us, because the rot runs so much deeper. We live in a country where the killer in Parkland and the people he slaughtered have lived their entire lives in a post-Columbine, post-9/11 world. Now that we know the shooter was trained by white supremacists and wore MAGA hats, we also know the politics that we must defeat… politics that give rise to this kind of senseless slaughter. We live in a a country where school shootings and the everyday specter of violence has been baked into our lives. It will take as many voices as possible, from the sports world and beyond, to tells us that this is not the way it has to be. Another world is still possible if we have the will to fight for it. One thing is certain: It is glaringly obvious who stands in our way."

AFTER NEWTOWN. Our editorial in this week’s issue calls on Congress to pass legislation banning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. “Gun control advocates should not be intimidated: the political winds at their back are strong,” we write. But with no political will to ban the sale of handguns, we argue that its time to broaden the fight—and target those who profit from guns. George Zornick reports how Walmart, the top seller of firearms and ammunition nationwide, helped make the Newtown shooter’s AR-15 the most popular assault weapon in the country. Just as his story was going to press, Walmart pulled the weapon from its website. But don’t be fooled—as Zornick reports, the move is a public relations one: the retail giant never directly sold the AR-15 on its website, and it’s still on the shelves in about 1,700 stores nationwide. Click here for more on five assault weapons you can pick up at Walmart. And take a look at a clip of George Zornick talking to MSNBC’s Tamron Hall about his investigation. Ad Policy

Also this week, Lee Fang asks who the NRA really represents: gun manufacturers or gun owners? “In reality, the NRA is composed of half a dozen legal entities; some designed to run undisclosed attack ads in political campaigns, others to lobby and collect tens of millions of undisclosed, tax-deductible sums,” writes Fang. Find out more on how corporations who profit from unregulated guns are funding the NRA. And take a look at Todd Gitlin’s piece on the “unbearable elasticity of gun logic” and how for the gun lobby, Newtown was evidence that more guns are necessary.

“We beat the NRA!” Judge Rebecca Dallet announced as she claimed her pattern-breaking win in a contentious race for a position on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Ad Policy

Dallet trounced conservative Judge Michael Screnock, securing 56 percent of the vote statewide to become the first liberal contender elected to an open seat on the high court since 1995. Dallet will replace one of its most right-wing members, retiring Justice Michael Gableman.

The outcome of the first such high-profile statewide contest of 2018 signaled that the influence of the National Rifle Association is far less of a defining force in swing states such as Wisconsin than was once imagined.

Conservatives built their dominance in Wisconsin judicial races over the past several decades by pulling together classic right-wing coalitions. Although these contests are decided on a nonpartisan ballot, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and his fellow partisans relied on the infrastructure of the Republican Party and its allies—such as the NRA, anti-choice groups, and corporate interests—to generate enthusiasm in traditionally low-turnout spring elections.

Screnock, who had long been involved with right-wing causes, earned an enthusiastic endorsement from the the NRA’s political operation before the Supreme Court primary election in February. In fact, on the day before a gunman murdered 17 students, teachers, and coaches at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Chris W. Cox, the national chairman of the the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, identified Screnock’s campaign as a priority for the group and said, “It’s important that all pro-Second Amendment voters get to the polls on Feb. 20 and elect Judge Michael Screnock to the state Supreme Court.”

Screnock finished first in the primary, which set up Tuesday’s contest with Dallet.

While mailings from the gun group identified Screnock as “the candidate who has committed” to the NRA’s agenda, Dallet bet that Wisconsinites were ready for a sensible response to gun violence—and to the special-interest groups that thwart necessary action. “It’s lawful to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of dangerous criminals and those who shouldn’t have them,” she argued. “I value human lives over money. My opponent cannot say the same.” Current Issue View our current issue

Running in a state with a hunting heritage and high levels of gun ownership, Dallet explained: “In Wisconsin, the vast majority of gun owners are responsible people. Hunting will remain one of our state’s favorite pastimes. In my court, I’ll always defend our rights and the rule of law. Common-sense gun restrictions are clearly constitutional.” And she went a step further, highlighting the fact that her opponent was backed by the NRA and that she was not.

“Just hours before a 19-year-old boy took an AR-15 and murdered 17 of his former classmates, the #NRA endorsed my opponent for Wisconsin Supreme Court. Their last tweet before the #ParklandShooting was announcing their support for @JudgeScrenock,” noted Dallet, the mother of three teenage daughters.

Dismissing Screnock as “an extreme activist who has pledged to stand with the #NRA over the people,” Dallet tweeted after the primary: “That’s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won’t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money?”

She got responses like: “Give ’em Hell Judge Dallett!” And she never looked back.

The Wisconsin race was about more than guns. Dallet took on Trump and Trumpism, even airing a television ad that featured images of the president and a narrator saying: “He’s attacked our civil rights and our value. She’ll protect them.” When women marched to protest Trump and his policies, Dallet marched with them. “I wake up every day with gratefulness and joy for my family, and dread for my country. What nonsense will President Trump tweet today, and what group of Americans will he attack?” she said. “And I think most of us are disgusted at the lowering of our standards. Most of us agree that the distasteful attacks on women, immigrants, and the vulnerable need to stop.”

Dallet also distanced herself from Walker and the big-money politics he has brought to Wisconsin. While Screnock rejected a proposal to strengthen rules that require judges to recuse themselves from cases involving their major campaign donors and supporters, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel explained: “Dallet was very critical of the Supreme Court’s refusal to adopt a rule about when justices should recuse themselves from cases, and particularly of its vote to shut down the John Doe II investigation of Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign.”

As Walker campaigned for Screnock, Dallet made her support for an independent judiciary central to her campaigning.

Several national Democrats endorsed Dallet, including Vice President Joe Biden and former attorney general Eric Holder. But when Holder came to the state, Dallet chose not to appear with him and reemphasized her commitment to drawing firm lines on ethics issues, telling reporters: “Certainly if millions of dollars were spent on my campaign by a party in a case that was sitting in front of me…then I would recuse myself. And I think that distinguishes me from Judge Screnock, who refuses to make those assurances.”

In a measure of how desperate Screnock supporters became as the race progressed, the conservative’s backers claimed that because Dallet had publicly refused money from the NRA, she had shown more bias on gun issues than Screnock, who had accepted NRA support but had “not stated his personal views on firearms.”

The argument was laughable, as were many of the last-minute efforts by Walker’s political team and corporate special-interest groups to smear Dallet. By speaking in smart, nuanced ways about gun issues, while at the same time refusing to bend to the NRA, Dallet framed an approach that was in tune with voters—in Wisconsin and, potentially, other states across the country where the NRA has historically bullied candidates of both parties.

On Election Day, she ran well in urban areas. But Dallet also won a number of rural counties in western and northern Wisconsin—many of which backed Donald Trump in 2016—where at least some pundits had presumed that the NRA endorsement of her opponent would sway the result in the other direction.

The calculus had changed. So it was that, before a cheering crowd on election night, the judge who will soon be Justice Rebecca Dallet declared: “Tonight we proved that when the people rise up and stand together, we can beat the special interests. We beat the NRA, and we beat the millions of dollars that were spent on this race—flooding into our state.”"

In this week’s issue, we describe how Walmart has expanded gun sales—including military-style assault weapons—to half of its stores nationwide, and is the country’s biggest retailer of guns and ammunition in the country. Ad Policy

As our story was about to be published, Walmart removed a Bushmaster AR-15 style assault rifle, the same gun Adam Lanza used to carry out his attack on the Sandy Hook Elementary School, from its website. All of the other assault weapons remain. (See other examples here).

This is one of the most transparent public relations moves in relation to a dangerous product that I can recall—it was literally the least Walmart could do. To be clear, the store never actually sold the guns online. Rather, you can peruse Walmart’s gun inventory on its website, read customer reviews and product specifications and then find a Walmart near you that carries the item.

All Walmart did was remove that one gun, the one most likely to create a public relations problem, from a website where you couldn’t buy it anyway. But the Bushmaster remains on Walmart shelves—something the retail giant confirmed to MSNBC this afternoon, saying there is “no change” to its firearm sales.

Other retail chains, however, are making changes—though only slightly more substantial than Walmart’s URL adjustment. Dick’s Sporting Goods is “suspending” sales of some rifles in stores nationwide during “this time of national mourning,” and taking all guns out of stores located near Newtown, Connecticut. Cabela’s will stop selling AR-15s in Connecticut only.

If Walmart were to curtail weapons sales, however, it wouldn’t just hurt their bottom line. Freedom Group, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the country with $237.9 million in annual sales, said in its most recent financial statement that Walmart accounts for 13 percent of those sales alone, and warned investors of trouble should Walmart ever change its policy:

Our sales to Wal-Mart are generally not governed by a written long-term contract between the parties. In the event that Wal-Mart were to significantly reduce or terminate its purchases of firearms, ammunition and/or other products from us, our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Freedom Group was dumped today by its private equity owner, Cerberus Capital, following investor pressure. They’re in for more trouble if Walmart stops selling guns—but don’t look for that to happen anytime soon, based on how the retail giant has responded so far.

On October 1, there were 16,000 American soldiers serving in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. But it was Las Vegas that most resembled a war zone and represented the biggest danger to American lives that day. From the punched-out windows of his 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel, Stephen Paddock rained down an appalling level of destruction on a country-music concert below. Using an enormous cache of guns, in less than 12 minutes he single-handedly massacred 58 people and injured 527 more. It was a deadlier day than American soldiers have ever suffered in Iraq or Afghanistan, and the worst mass shooting in modern US history.1 Ad Policy

This latest slaughter demands that the country grapple with gun-control issues beyond the debate over background checks. A more fundamental question is at hand: How much lethal firepower should citizens be allowed to possess?2

There will be a fierce debate about where to draw the line, but no reasonable person can say the Vegas shooter wasn’t well past it. Paddock had effectively assembled a small ordnance depot in his luxury hotel suite. He had at least 23 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. A majority of those guns were military-style assault weapons; some were mounted on shooting platforms with scopes and tripods and outfitted with devices that made them fully automatic. Investigators later found 19 more guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition at his home.3

The destructive capacity of this arsenal is staggering, but it is not out of line with the firepower unleashed by other mass shooters. Omar Mateen, who was responsible for the 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, had three weapons, including an assault rifle, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He killed 49 people and wounded 68 more. Adam Lanza had only 300 seconds to shoot his assault rifle inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown before the police engaged him, but he got off 154 rounds and killed 26 people. James Holmes shot 82 people inside an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 90 seconds. When Jared Loughner shot up a meet-and-greet with then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in Tucson, he fired 33 times in 19 seconds.4 Related Article The American Impulse to Equate Guns With Freedom and Masculinity With Violence Is Killing Us Joan Walsh

Assault weapons with large magazines for ammunition are the common denominator in these killings. After World War II, the US Army’s Operations Research Office performed a study and found that the chief predictor of casualties was the number of shots fired. The military then asked the private sector to develop a lightweight weapon with a large, detachable magazine that could be used to inflict extreme damage on the enemy. The firearms manufacturer ArmaLite answered the call with the AR-15, which became the military’s standard-issue rifle.5

Now weapons very similar to the AR-15 are sold by sporting-goods stores, gun shops, and online retailers nationwide to any citizen with any level of training, or none at all. Large magazines that carry up to 100 rounds are also legal, and ammunition sales are barely regulated. The devices that Paddock used to make his weapons fully automatic are legal as well. Remarkably, Republicans in Congress plan to make lethal weapons even more dangerous: The House may soon vote on a bill making it much easier for citizens to obtain silencers and armor-piercing ammunition.6

Such measures must be blocked, but the gun-control movement also needs to push for action on reducing the number and kinds of weapons that Americans can possess. Creating a nationwide registry of gun owners and their firearms would be a start, along with enacting federal laws that prohibit more than one handgun purchase per month. Three percent of Americans already own 50 percent of the guns and can let loose military-level assaults on any venue they choose: concerts, malls, elementary schools. Background checks wouldn’t have stopped Paddock, Mateen, Lanza, Holmes, or Loughner. All those guns were purchased legally. But why were they allowed to be sold?7"

Ed. Note: In the light of today's tragic mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, many people are calling for an immediate discussion on gun control. Here are three places where Congress can get started–a list we published in the wake of the Aurora theater shooting that is, alas, still just as relevant. No action has been taken on any of these measures. Ad Policy

America’s gun laws are truly outrageous: in Colorado they allowed James Holmes to stockpile several weapons in a short period of time, including an AR-15 assault rifle with a high-capacity magazine, without ever registering the purchases with authorities. On the federal level, as we described yesterday, there are efforts underway to put guns into the hands of veterans with mental incapabilities, people on terror watch lists, and to weaken the federal bureau that enforces many gun laws.

President Obama has repeatedly relayed that he is only interested in enforcing “existing” gun laws. Even right-wing pundit Bill Kristol thinks this is misguided: he said on Fox News this weekend that “I actually think the Democrats are being foolish as they are being cowardly. I think there is more support for some moderate forms of gun control.”

So what are some moderate reforms that President Obama could get behind? Here are three bills introduced recently in Congress that would easily fall into the category of “common sense”—yet cannot seem to be passed.

Reinstating the Assault Weapons Ban. In 1994, gun-control advocates vanquished the NRA and passed a federal ban on assault weapons, but during Congressional negotiations they had to compromise: the ban would affect only weapons manufactured after the date of enactment, and the bill would have a ten-year sunset. Bill Clinton signed the law in September of that year.

Alas, ten years later, the Congress and the White House were both controlled by pro-gun Republicans, and it was an election year—so the ban expired. Today, you can for example walk into most big-box sporting goods stores and buy an AR-15 assault rifle. (This is what Holmes, the Colorado shooter, did).

In the wake of the mass shootings in Tuscon in 2010, Represenative Caroline McCarthy—who’s husband was killed in a mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad in the early ’90s—re-introduced a permanent ban on assault weapons in the House. Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Neither came up for a vote.

Obama campaigned on reinstating the ban, but “won’t even talk” about it today. When he was a Senator and chair of the Judiciary Committee in 2007, Joe Biden tried to get the ban reinstated as part of the Crime Control and Prevention Act. Mitt Romney, for that matter, signed a ban on assault weapons in Massachusetts in 2004.

Banning high-capacity magazines. Reports indicate that at most ninety seconds passed between the first 911 call in Aurora and the apprehension of the suspect. Yet he was still able to shoot seventy-one people—in large part because his AR-15 rifle had a 100-round drum capable of firing fifty to sixty shots per minute.

Just this week, Senator Lautenberg said he plans to introduce legislation banning these high-volume ammunition clips. “No sportsman needs 100 rounds to shoot a duck, but allowing high-capacity magazines in the hands of killers…puts law enforcement at a disadvantage and innocent lives at risk,” Lautenberg said. Other Senate Democrats, like Senator Dianne Feinstein, said they will support the legislation. “We’ve got to really sit down and come to grips with what is sold to the average citizen in America,” she said.

Republican Senator Ron Johnson, however, said the bill will “restrict our freedoms.” It’s extremely unlikely it can muster the sixty votes needed to overcome a Senate filibuster.

Regulate Sniper Rifles. Among the more dangerous weapons currently sold in America are .50-caliber rifles. Some can be outfitted to fire large rounds originally intended for use with Browning Machine Guns, and have been adopted by the military as long-range sniper rifles. According to a Congressional Research Service report, these weapons—freely available at most gun retailers—“could be used to shoot down aircraft, rupture pressurized chemical tanks, or penetrate armored personnel carriers” and “have little sporting, hunting, or recreational purpose.”

In the 110th Congress, Senator Feinstein introduced the Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons Regulation Act, which had very modest goals: to simply treat those weapons as short-barreled shotguns and silencers are treated, that is, to levy taxes on their manufacture and transfer, and require they be registered with authorities. That bill was defeated."

Not so with the global arms trade. It’s good for one or two stories a year in the mainstream media, usually when the annual statistics on the state of the business come out. Ad Policy This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com.

It’s not that no one writes about aspects of the arms trade. There are occasional pieces that, for example, take note of the impact of US weapons transfers, including cluster bombs, to Saudi Arabia, or of the disastrous dispensation of weaponry to US allies in Syria, or of foreign sales of the costly, controversial F-35 combat aircraft. And once in a while, if a foreign leader meets with the president, US arms sales to his or her country might generate an article or two. But the sheer size of the American arms trade, the politics that drive it, the companies that profit from it, and its devastating global impacts are rarely discussed, much less analyzed in any depth.

So here’s a question that’s puzzled me for years (and I’m something of an arms wonk): Why do other major US exports—from Hollywood movies to Midwestern grain shipments to Boeing airliners—garner regular coverage while trends in weapons exports remain in relative obscurity? Are we ashamed of standing essentially alone as the world’s number one arms dealer, or is our Weapons “R” Us role such a commonplace that we take it for granted, like death or taxes?

The numbers should stagger anyone. According to the latest figures available from the Congressional Research Service, the United States was credited with more than half the value of all global arms transfer agreements in 2014, the most recent year for which full statistics are available. At 14 percent, the world’s second largest supplier, Russia, lagged far behind. Washington’s “leadership” in this field has never truly been challenged. The US share has fluctuated between one-third and one-half of the global market for the past two decades, peaking at an almost monopolistic 70 percent of all weapons sold in 2011. And the gold rush continues. Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who heads the Pentagon’s arms sales agency, euphemistically known as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, estimates that arms deals facilitated by the Pentagon topped $46 billion in 2015, and are on track to hit $40 billion in 2016.

To be completely accurate, there is one group of people who pay remarkably close attention to these trends—executives of the defense contractors that are cashing in on this growth market. With the Pentagon and related agencies taking in “only” about $600 billion a year—high by historical standards but tens of billions of dollars less than hoped for by the defense industry—companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and General Dynamics have been looking to global markets as their major source of new revenue.

In a January 2015 investor call, for example, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson was asked whether the Iran nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration and five other powers might reduce tensions in the Middle East, undermining the company’s strategy of increasing its arms exports to the region. She responded that continuing “volatility” in both the Middle East and Asia would make them “growth areas” for the foreseeable future. In other words, no worries. As long as the world stays at war or on the verge of it, Lockheed Martin’s profits won’t suffer—and, of course, its products will help ensure that any such “volatility” will prove lethal indeed.

Under Hewson, Lockheed has set a goal of getting at least 25 percent of its revenues from weapons exports, and Boeing has done that company one better. It’s seeking to make overseas arms sales 30 percent of its business.

Good News From the Middle East (If You’re an Arms Maker)

Arms deals are a way of life in Washington. From the president on down, significant parts of the government are intent on ensuring that American arms will flood the global market and companies like Lockheed and Boeing will live the good life. From the president on his trips abroad to visit allied world leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to the staffs of US embassies, American officials regularly act as salespeople for the arms firms. And the Pentagon is their enabler. From brokering, facilitating, and literally banking the money from arms deals to transferring weapons to favored allies on the taxpayers’ dime, it is in essence the world’s largest arms dealer.

In a typical sale, the US government is involved every step of the way. The Pentagon often does assessments of an allied nation’s armed forces in order to tell them what they “need”—and of course what they always need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied equipment. Then the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the deal, notifies Congress of its details, and collects the funds from the foreign buyer, which it then gives to the US supplier in the form of a defense contract. In most deals, the Pentagon is also the point of contact for maintenance and spare parts for any US-supplied system. The bureaucracy that helps make all of this happen, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, is funded from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals it negotiates. This gives it all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell.

And the pressure for yet more of the same is always intense, in part because the weapons makers are careful to spread their production facilities to as many states and localities as possible. In this way, they ensure that endless support for government promotion of major arms sales becomes part and parcel of domestic politics.

General Dynamics, for instance, has managed to keep its tank plants in Ohio and Michigan running through a combination of add-ons to the Army budget—funds inserted into that budget by Congress even though the Pentagon didn’t request them—and exports to Saudi Arabia. Boeing is banking on a proposed deal to sell 40 F-18s to Kuwait to keep its St. Louis production line open, and is currently jousting with the Obama administration to get it to move more quickly on the deal. Not surprisingly, members of Congress and local business leaders in such states become strong supporters of weapons exports.

Though seldom thought of this way, the US political system is also a global arms distribution system of the first order. In this context, the Obama administration has proven itself a good friend to arms exporting firms. During President Obama’s first six years in office, Washington entered into agreements to sell more than $190 billion in weaponry worldwide—more, that is, than any US administration since World War II. In addition, Team Obama has loosened restrictions on arms exports, making it possible to send abroad a whole new range of weapons and weapons components—including Black Hawk and Huey helicopters and engines for C-17 transport planes—with far less scrutiny than was previously required.

This has been good news for the industry, which had been pressing for such changes for decades with little success. But the weaker regulations also make it potentially easier for arms smugglers and human rights abusers to get their hands on US arms. For example, 36 US allies—from Argentina and Bulgaria to Romania and Turkey—will no longer need licenses from the State Department to import weapons and weapons parts from the United States. This will make it far easier for smuggling networks to set up front companies in such countries and get US arms and arms components that they can then pass on to third parties like Iran or China. Already a common practice, it will only increase under the new regulations.

The degree to which the Obama administration has been willing to bend over backward to help weapons exporters was underscored at a 2013 hearing on those administration export “reforms.” Tom Kelly, then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American arms exports. He responded:

“[We are] advocating on behalf of our companies and doing everything we can to make sure that these sales go through… and that is something we are doing every day, basically [on] every continent in the world… and we’re constantly thinking of how we can do better.”

One place where, with a helping hand from the Obama administration and the Pentagon, the arms industry has been doing a lot better of late is the Middle East. Washington has brokered deals for more than $50 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia alone for everything from F-15 fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to combat ships and missile defense systems.

The most damaging deals, if not the most lucrative, have been the sales of bombs and missiles to the Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have been killed and millions of people are going hungry. Members of Congress like Michigan Representative John Conyers and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy have pressed for legislation that would at least stem the flow of the most deadly of the weaponry being sent for use there, but they have yet to overcome the considerable clout of the Saudis in Washington (and, of course, that of the arms industry as well).

When it comes to the arms business, however, there’s no end to the good news from the Middle East. Take the administration’s proposed new 10-year aid deal with Israel. If enacted as currently planned, it would boost US military assistance to that country by up to 25 percent—to roughly $4 billion per year. At the same time, it would phase out a provision that had allowed Israel to spend one-quarter of Washington’s aid developing its own defense industry. In other words, all that money, the full $4 billion in taxpayer dollars, will now flow directly into the coffers of companies like Lockheed Martin, which is in the midst of completing a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell the Israelis F-35s.

“Volatility” in Asia and Europe

As Lockheed Martin’s Marillyn Hewson noted, however, the Middle East is hardly the only growth area for that firm or others like it. The dispute between China and its neighbors over the control of the South China Sea (which is in many ways an incipient conflict over whether that country or the United States will control that part of the Pacific Ocean) has opened up new vistas when it comes to the sale of American warships and other military equipment to Washington’s East Asian allies. The recent Hague court decision rejecting Chinese claims to those waters (and the Chinese rejection of it) is only likely to increase the pace of arms buying in the region.

At the same time, in the good-news-never-ends department, growing fears of North Korea’s nuclear program have stoked a demand for US-supplied missile defense systems. The South Koreans have, in fact, just agreed to deploy Lockheed Martin’s THAAD anti-missile system. In addition, the Obama administration’s decision to end the longstanding embargo on US arms sales to Vietnam is likely to open yet another significant market for US firms. In the past two years alone, the United States has offered more than $15 billion worth of weaponry to allies in East Asia, with Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea accounting for the bulk of the sales.

In addition, the Obama administration has gone to great lengths to build a defense relationship with India, a development guaranteed to benefit US arms exporters. Last year, Washington and New Delhi signed a 10-year defense agreement that included pledges of future joint work on aircraft engines and aircraft carrier designs. In these years, the United States has made significant inroads into the Indian arms market, which had traditionally been dominated by the Soviet Union and then Russia. Recent deals include a $5.8 billion sale of Boeing C-17 transport aircraft and a $1.4 billion agreement to provide support services related to a planned purchase of Apache attack helicopters.

And don’t forget “volatile” Europe. Great Britain’s recent Brexit vote introduced an uncertainty factor into American arms exports to that country. The United Kingdom has been by far the biggest purchaser of US weapons in Europe of late, with more than $6 billion in deals struck over the past two years alone—more, that is, than the United States has sold to all other European countries combined.

The British defense behemoth BAE is Lockheed Martin’s principal foreign partner on the F-35 combat aircraft, which at a projected cost of $1.4 trillion over its lifetime already qualifies as the most expensive weapons program in history. If Brexit-driven austerity were to lead to a delay in, or the cancellation of, the F-35 deal (or any other major weapons shipments), it would be a blow to American arms makers. But count on one thing: were there to be even a hint that this might happen to the F-35, lobbyists for BAE will mobilize to get the deal privileged status, whatever other budget cuts may be in the works.

On the bright side (if you happen to be a weapons maker), any British reductions will certainly be more than offset by opportunities in Eastern and Central Europe, where a new Cold War seems to be gaining traction. Between 2014 and 2015, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, military spending increased by 13 percent in the region in response to the Russian intervention in Ukraine. The rise in Poland’s outlays, at 22 percent, was particularly steep.

Under the circumstances, it should be obvious that trends in the global arms trade are a major news story and should be dealt with as such in the country most responsible for putting more weapons of a more powerful nature into the hands of those living in “volatile” regions. It’s a monster business (in every sense of the word) and certainly has far more dangerous consequences than licensing a Hollywood blockbuster or selling another Boeing airliner.

Historically, there have been rare occasions of public protest against unbridled arms trafficking, as with the backlash against “the merchants of death” after World War I, or the controversy over who armed Saddam Hussein that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Even now, small numbers of congressional representatives, including John Conyers, Chris Murphy, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, continue to try to halt the sale of cluster munitions, bombs, and missiles to Saudi Arabia.

There is, however, unlikely to be a genuine public debate about the value of the arms business and Washington’s place in it if it isn’t even considered a subject worthy of more than an occasional media story. In the meantime, the United States continues to hold onto the number one role in the global arms trade, the White House does its part, the Pentagon greases the wheels, and the dollars roll in to profit-hungry US weapons contractors."

On February 21, one week after a former student with an AR-15 murdered 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, students around the country walked out of their schools and into protests in support of meaningful gun-control laws. Ad Policy

In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, nearly 100 high-school students from Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) left their school building and marched to a downtown commercial square, where they joined hands and observed 17 minutes of silence. The goal, according to the protest’s media liaison, senior Serena Zets, was to “express solidarity with the students in Parkland and show [gun violence] is not only an issue that affects individual schools and individual people, but a societal issue we need to reckon with as a country.” This story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words. For more Student Nation, check out our archive. Are you a student with a campus activism story? Send questions and pitches to Samantha Schuyler at samantha@thenation.com.

In the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland, senior Christian Carter, one of three lead organizers of the protest, said he had been alarmed when he noticed that classmates and teachers weren’t talking about the shooting. “At CAPA we’re used to having conversations about what’s going on in the news,” he said. “But we didn’t talk about it, we didn’t have a conversation about these shootings.” He and the other organizers of the march spread word of the walkout plan on social media.

“No one stopped us as we left the building,” said Senior Nia Arrington, another lead organizer of the action. “They held the doors open for us. They called the police to escort us down there.… [principal] Ms. [Melissa] Pearlman stood in the office and waved us goodbye.” Students said teachers knew about the planned walkout and that many expressed support.

Zets was surprised by the turnout. As one of its leaders, she was at the front of the march and could only see the 10 people in front of her and 10 behind. But by the time the group had made it a block away from the school, she turned around to see 80 more trailing behind. She said that rumors of punishment by the school administration deterred many others from participating.

Carter said he remembered “looking at every single one of those kids’ faces” and appreciating “the beauty in seeing so much diversity in our walkout.” “It was three black kids who planned, who were the faces of our walkout, who organized it,” he said, referring to himself, Arrington, and senior Anyah Jackson. “I saw so many kids from CAPA who don’t shut up at school, so for them to stand—for students, for students to stand—for 17 minutes and not talk, there’s something powerful about that,” Carter said.

In Market Square, Arrington stood in the middle of the circle of students and addressed the crowd. “If our politicians won’t lead us—if our politicians won’t make change, we make that change!” she said. “The students, when we come together, it’s something powerful.…We will not be divided; we will not be locked out; we will not stop.” Current Issue View our current issue

As she led students in 17 minutes of silence, Arrington said she thought about the victims at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “It’s hard to not put yourself in their shoes,” she said. “When is it going to happen again?”

After the walkout, the students said, the school called their parents and served the protesters with after-school detentions. According to students who attended a meeting with the school principal and district administrators, Superintendent Anthony Hamlet stressed that students who left the building unauthorized had created a safety concern, while Principal Pearlman wrote in an e-mail that she had learned about the walkout from a parent the morning that it took place, not from the students at a prior time. She said students had told her about their intent to walk out and march to the square when she asked later that morning. “While we all understand the immense emotional aspects to these events and respect the intent of students and staff that want to participate, we do not support such ‘walk outs,’” she wrote. “A ‘walk out’ of students creates additional safety concerns for both students and staff.”

Kate Daher, a retired Pittsburgh Public Schools social-studies teacher of 20 years who spent the latter part of her career at CAPA, led a brief, but effective, campaign against the punishment. She wrote in a letter to the editor, “I find it especially ironic that during Black History Month while our students engage in non-violent civic action, they are to be disciplined for doing what they learn to do in their 9th grade Civic classes under the course theme, ‘Be the Change.’… Instead of punishment, students and teachers should be encouraged to protest the dangerous conditions that exist as a result of gun violence. After all, it is their lives that are at stake.”

Daher described a “firestorm” of calls and e-mails hitting the school in response to the proposed punishment. It worked. Pearlman waived the detentions in favor of small group discussions known as “restorative circles,” saying she was “moved by the ‘passion’ and the ‘advocacy’” of participating students,” the Post-Gazette reported.

Building on the success of the walkout, Carter said organizers have raised hundreds of dollars to support PPS students’ travel to Washington, DC, for the March 24 March for Our Lives. Zets, who had previously organized a voter-registration drive that resulted in the registration of 80 percent of her eligible classmates, said that bringing elected officials to CAPA for a New Voters’ Forum is also among the students’ next steps.

“I think people need to look out,” Carter said. “Because 2018 is going to be a year of change, and a year of students raising our voices, and a year of saying that we are not backing down.”"

Twenty-five years ago, on June 12, 1982, approximately a million people demonstrated in New York City’s Central Park against nuclear arms and for an end to the arms race of the cold war. Nothing like it had ever happened before. It was not only the largest antinuclear demonstration but the largest political demonstration of any description in American history. Nothing like it has happened again, either. The tide of protest was at its high-water mark, and thereafter receded steadily. Ad Policy

June 12 was the culmination of a movement that had begun in the 1970s with resistance to nuclear power and then proceeded to nuclear arms. Its immediate objective, launched in early 1980 in a “Call to Halt the Nuclear Arms Race,” written by antinuclear activist Randall Forsberg, was a bilateral Soviet-American “freeze on testing, production, and further deployment of nuclear weapons.” In 1982 freeze resolutions were introduced in nine states and passed in eight; later, freeze resolutions, though in watered-down form, passed the House and the Senate.

Although the nationwide strength of the movement is rightly associated with anxiety produced by the nuclear buildup launched by Ronald Reagan, it is telling to recollect that the freeze was in fact born in President Jimmy Carter’s final year in office. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Carter responded by announcing what became known as the Carter Doctrine, threatening the use of nuclear arms if the Soviet Union should attempt to move beyond Afghanistan to dominate the Persian Gulf and its oil reserves. At the time, the United States had no large conventional forces available in the Middle East to deter Russia, leaving nuclear weapons as the only military means available. None other than Paul Wolfowitz, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Regional Programs, wrote in a “Limited Contingency Study” in 1977, “We…have a vital and growing stake in the Persian Gulf region because of our need for Persian Gulf oil and because events in the Persian Gulf affect the Arab-Israeli conflict.” Thus, the Carter Doctrine initiated the long shift from cold war concerns to the preoccupation with the Persian Gulf that later would result in the two Iraq wars and now threatens a third war, against Iran. The recent refusal of not only George W. Bush but GOP presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in a possible war with Iran seems to bring this long development full circle.

The reasons for the decline of the antinuclear movement are full of paradox and, in the last analysis, possibly unknowable. In part, it became a victim of its own success. Few riddles are harder to untangle than the relationship of the success of the freeze movement and the simultaneous success of its antagonist, President Reagan. It is a matter of record that the movement powerfully undercut public support for Reagan’s nuclear buildup. According to a CBS/New York Times poll, between 1981 and 1985 support for increases in military spending dropped from 61 percent to 16 percent. It is a matter of record, too, that in response Reagan returned to nuclear arms negotiations with the Soviet Union.

But even more important, in March 1983, in part for the same reason, he startled observers, including most of the top officials of his own Administration, by proposing his Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars, to defend the United States from nuclear attack. When that was accomplished, he added in a second bombshell, the two superpowers, finding their nuclear weapons now “impotent and obsolete,” could do away with them. The motivation for co-opting the freeze is well documented, yet so is the sincerity of Reagan’s fervent desire not just to freeze but actually to abolish nuclear weapons. That sincerity was put on spectacular display at the summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, between Reagan and Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, also a nuclear abolitionist. As memorandums of the summit show, the two leaders came within a hair’s breadth of agreeing to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. Thus, in a sense the spirit of June 12 reached a high point and expired at Reykjavik.

The aftermath has been dispiriting. Arms control resumed and had some successes, but no fresh or bold initiative to deal with the nuclear danger has been launched. No heir to either the freeze movement or Reagan has arisen. The end of the cold war, seemingly the greatest opportunity to lift nuclear danger since 1946, was wasted. Instead, the whole issue fell into a shocking state of neglect, as if people believed that a mortal illness could be dealt with by forgetting about it.

In the years of silence, the unattended predicament quietly went haywire, assuming a malevolent post-cold war shape. Observing that the cold war powers, whatever they might say or not say, were determined to hold on to their nuclear arsenals, other nations–India, Pakistan, North Korea, perhaps Iran–determined to join the undissolved nuclear club. Whereupon the nuclear powers suddenly awoke to the danger and declared that these nuclear arsenals were intolerable. Having, in the early post-cold war years, mutely forgone the idea of negotiated nuclear disarmament for all, the United States soon turned to war as the ultimate solution to proliferation, and the Bush Doctrine of preventive war was born. There followed the Iraq War and, now, the threat of war with Iran, including the multiplying threats to use nuclear weapons. The wellsprings of change in public opinion are as hard to predict as ever. No one can say whether a June 12, or some twenty-first-century equivalent, is in the offing. That one is needed is beyond argument."

“We are standing at the assembly line the whole day, doing the same task again and again. It has nothing to do with my education,” says Xu Min, a 19-year-old college student in Hubei, China. “None of us want to be here. We are all depressed, but we have no choice.… The work is exhausting.” Ad Policy

For ambitious young people worldwide, the internship offers an on-ramp to a corporate career through office grunt work. But whereas American interns “pay their dues” as coffee-making cubicle peons, Chinese interns serve as a different kind of cog in the “emerging economy’s” manufacturing machine. Xu Min’s internship program, according to investigators, sent her and about 300 fellow students to serve as cheap labor on the global electronics assembly line.

An investigation by Danish labor watchdog group Danwatch traces connections between students at Chinese vocational schools and universities, and supplier factories of major tech brands, which furnish European educational institutions and other consumer markets with information technology equipment. So Xu Min’s labor on a server assembly line run by the Taiwanese multinational company Wistron may, ironically, help her European student counterpart enjoy state-of-the-art gadgetry on her university campus.

Drawing on field research and interviews with workers last summer, investigators concluded that an officially sanctioned pipeline of deregulated labor allows both schools and multinationals to benefit from the exploitation of young temp workers. Under pressure from their institutions and the approval of Western brands, “Thousands of Chinese students…work 10-12 hours a day, six days a week, for up to 5 months.” Their overtime—typically needed to cover basic living expenses—may amount to as much as 100 hours a month, far exceeding the regulatory limit of 36 hours per month. The investigated subcontractor, Taiwanese multinational Wistron—along with its multinational clients Lenovo, Dell, and HP—have acknowledged Danwatch’s concerns overall, but generally denied students were systematically forced to work.

Traditionally, rural migrants have filled manufacturing labor demands, but conscripted interns now form a major surplus army of labor, enabling manufacturers to capture a vulnerable youth workforce that’s increasingly striving for a life beyond factory drudgery. Though less publicized than Asia’s notorious garment sweatshops, advocates say the exploitation of contingent student workers follows similar practices of predatory capitalism as “development.”

Exploitative internships are imposed as graduation requirements, Danwatch reports, violating both Chinese laws and the International Labour Organisation Convention on Forced Labor.

A labor recruiting agent told Danwatch that Wistron’s Zhongshan factory held some 15,000 workers and “between 2,000 and 3,000 students,” with more due for arrival soon, and that they “have to work as regular workers, they also do overtime, but they are not supposed to work the night shift.” THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

But investigators found that many do work night shifts, and the system seems to allow employers to skirt other social-security mandates. Norma Josefa Martinez, author of the report, says via e-mail from Denmark that the gargantuan, controversial Apple supplier Foxconn has been known to employ some 150,000 interns and, according to academic researchers, may “save around 45 million Yuan (6.3 million euros) in a single month by not providing their 150,000 interns with welfare benefits and insurances.”

Education Ministry regulations mandate that internships be “directly relevant” to students’ academic programs. However—echoing common criticisms of internships in Western countries—students (typically not in tech-related fields) told researchers their duties were not only irrelevant but were potentially undermining their academic progress. Business student Zhu Wen told researchers: “The school sent us here, but I don’t learn anything that contributes to my studies in the assembly line. I can’t stand it here.”

Xu Wen, of Huanggang Normal University, told Danwatch that after students learned they were being sent for factory stints at Wistron shortly before summer started, “Many students protested, as we are accounting majors and want to do relevant internships. The school told us that if we refused, we would not get our diploma.”

The student preciariat’s complaints highlight structural economic problems facing China’s upward-striving youth. College is sold as a ticket into the middle class, but amid exploding wealth inequality, social frustration is roiling as students chafe against Beijing’s wall of elitism, which reserves the best jobs for children of the connected upper class.

While schools tell students “eating bitterness” through harsh work builds morale, they often feel powerless under Beijing’s paternalistic labor policies. Her research shows, Jimenez says, that many students just accepted that “that is just how things are and even though it is not fair, that is how the system is.”

This system could undermine labor standards for all, as factories’ intensifying use of intern labor apparently provides an alternative to better-regulated, higher-cost standard employees, according to Danwatch. As the labor recruiter explained matter-of-factly: “We are not hiring workers, because the student workers have arrived.”

Meanwhile, regular workers are experiencing significant pay raises through local minimum-wage hikes—populist policies enacted amid spiking labor unrest among factory workers and slumping economic growth.

The government recently announced plans to dramatically expand vocational programs—a seemingly well-intentioned policy that, without tighter oversight, could indirectly expand the trend of “student interns being used by businesses as a source of cheap and flexible labour,” according to Hong Kong–based advocacy group China Labour Bulletin.

Though the companies deny charges of forced labor, in statements to Danwatch both HP and Dell have acknowledged “gaps” in their supply chain oversight, and reported they had temporarily suspended their internship programs and “committed themselves to monitor Wistron Corporation internships programs more closely in the future.”

But for the students milling through factories now, activists want corporations to establish strong public procurement guidelines in universities’ contracts with tech vendors, coupled with transparent independent auditing (an alternative to the conventional voluntary, weaker “corporate social responsibility” codes).

Perhaps the hope lies in the students themselves. Just as student-labor activism spawned global movements against sweatshops and other corporate abuses, today the Hong Kong-based student group SACOM is leading campaigns against tech-sector worker abuse on the mainland.

The sense of outrage trickles down the production line: As intern Li Xiaoying told researchers, “I’d rather work for free and learn than be here.”

Now transborder solidarity could reemerge in the tech space as students at opposite ends of the campus supply chain work toward labor and educational freedom."

On July 2, Occupy Wall Street protester Cecily McMillan was released from Rikers Island, completing a sentence that her jury never wanted her to serve. On May 19, that jury of twelve convicted McMillan of felony assault against police officer Grantley Bovell. The verdict came after a four-week trial, during which McMillan’s defense team argued that it was actually Bovell who assaulted McMillan, and that she had elbowed him as a reflexive response after he grabbed her breast. The trial carried symbolic weight because it was the last Occupy criminal case, one of the few Occupy-related felonies, and an incident of alleged police violence that many protesters felt characterized NYPD norms. Still, the jury returned a “guilty” verdict. As is typical, jurors had been instructed by the judge not to read or research any further details of the case on their own, including the punishment that McMillan would face if convicted. Ad Policy

After the conviction, members of the jury learned that McMillan faced two to seven years in prison, according to sentencing guidelines. An anonymous juror told The Guardian that “they felt bad,” and that “even a year in jail is ridiculous.” The juror added that he hadn’t been convinced of McMillan’s guilt, but gave in to his fellow jurors and, not expecting harsh sentencing, voted to convict. Nine of the twelve jurors petitioned Judge Ronald Zweibel for leniency and no incarceration. At that point, however, the power was out of their hands (Zweibel ended up sentencing McMillan to ninety days in jail and five years’ probation). Many of McMillan’s supporters expressed frustration that the jurors who had held Cecily’s freedom in their hands didn’t take the consequences of the trial seriously until after it was over.

In trials that involve police testimony, as McMillan’s did, jurors are often inclined to trust state authority: the police and prosecutors. “When juries refuse to acquit people, it’s a nod to authoritarianism and our natural willingness not to be skeptical,” says Mariame Kaba, founding director of Project NIA, which works to end youth incarceration. In fact, according to an article published last year in the journal Law and Social Inquiry, “as jurors indicate more trust and confidence in the police, their likelihood of favoring the prosecution increases,” a serious problem for defendants in trials like McMillan’s. And “white jurors overall are more likely to favor the prosecution and are more willing to vote for guilt on the first ballot than are black jurors.” This fundamental trust in the criminal justice system betrays a profound ignorance of what Kaba calls “the inconceivable notion that the system could be railroading you.” Jurors become an extension of state power, trusting rather than checking it.

In fact, the right to a trial by jury is meant to be “part of the system of checks and balances to rein in the power of the state,” explains Paul Butler, a law professor and former prosecutor, and the author of Let’s Get Free: A Hip-Hop Theory of Justice. “You could call it political or you could call it constitutional. But the right of jurors to establish justice is deeply embedded in both the Constitution and our Anglo-American tradition.” This includes the practice of jury nullification, in which jurors may acquit a defendant whom they believe to be guilty, due to objections to the law or sentencing practices. No judge can overturn a “not guilty” jury verdict, and such cases cannot be retried.

Nullification dates back to the trial of William Penn and William Mead in 1670 in England. When jurors refused to convict them of unlawful assembly, the judge imprisoned the jurors. On appeal, a higher court released the jurors and found that they could not be punished for acquittal. The first chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, John Jay, said in 1794: “The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy.” And it remains entirely legal for a jury to acquit, regardless of the evidence, as a means of resisting unjust laws and sentencing. Juries have nullified to protest injustices throughout American history—in defense of the Boston Tea Party, against the Fugitive Slave Act, against Prohibition.

Despite this proud tradition, nullification has been a well-kept secret since 1895, when the Supreme Court ruled that while juries had the right to nullify, judges were not required to inform them of this power. “Most courts have refused to tell jurors about this power, because judges want to be the ones that have the last say,” explains Butler. “Most courts tell jurors that if you find the defendant is guilty, you must convict.” Not only are judges not required to inform juries of their right to nullify, but lawyers are prohibited from doing so, with rare exceptions (New Hampshire, for example, requires that juries be informed in criminal cases of their right to nullify). To mention nullification would land lawyers in contempt in most courts.

“It’s very strange for it to be a fairly essential power that jurors have, but no one’s allowed to express it,” says attorney and law professor David Kairys. Kairys defended the “Camden 28” in an unusual trial in which the defense was permitted to inform the jury of their right to acquit for any reason. The case involved a group of twenty-eight Catholic activists who in 1971 raided a local draft board to protest the Vietnam War. They had been entrapped by the FBI and were clearly guilty of the prosecution’s charges. At the trial, the judge instructed the jury: “The law does not recognize religious or moral motives or higher law for the commission of a crime, no matter how noble. I charge you that you may not treat the defendants’ beliefs with respect to the war in Vietnam, or other possible injustices to which you have heard references, as a possible negation of criminal intent.” Kairys and the defense team argued that, in saying this, the judge had misinformed the jury and had to correct himself. As a result, the judge ruled that the defense could openly address nullification in their closing arguments. This was rare, according to Kairys—so rare that he knows of no other case where nullification has been openly discussed in court.

In his closing statements, Kairys told the jury:

This power that juries have is the reason why we have you jurors sitting there instead of computers. You are supposed to be the conscience of the community. You are supposed to decide if the law, as the judge explains it to you, should or should not be applied in these circumstances. Nothing the judge will say to you is inconsistent with this power. This is not a request on our part that you show any disrespect for the law. It’s an essential part of the law. It’s as essential as reasonable doubt. You decide what to do with the law the judge explains. You decide, considering the circumstances of the case, whether you should brand the defendants as criminal. You are only required to say ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’; you don’t decide that they did it or they didn’t do it.

Kairys talked about Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and Daniel Ellsberg—all of whom, he said, “violated laws to preserve life and liberty.” He concluded: “The prosecution is asking you to brand these people as criminals. If that’s done, it will be done in your name. No one else’s. I urge you to say no to the prosecution, say no to this horrible war, say no to the FBI’s manufacture of a crime, and say yes to some hope for the future. Say yes for life. Thank you.”

All twelve members of the jury voted to acquit. Upon hearing the verdict, people in the courtroom began to sing “Amazing Grace.” Kairys says that although popular sentiment against the Vietnam War played a part in the jury’s decision, similar acquittals did not occur. The opportunity to explain nullification to the jury was crucial.

While the Camden 28 acquittal made explicit use of nullification, Butler says that nullification is effectively invoked all the time. “When I was a prosecutor in DC in the early ’90s, the jurors in DC were mainly African-American,” he explains. “It was commonplace in the prosecutor’s office that if we had a young black defendant and it was a nonviolent drug crime, the jury was not going to send him to jail. They would acquit him.” Butler says that such juries recognize the overrepresentation of African-Americans in the criminal justice system, and decide that, as long as there is no violent threat, they will not send another black person to prison. “Those are political acts by jurors, even if they’re not explicitly political,” he says.

Exercising the right to nullification can be tricky. If a potential juror, during jury selection, criticizes certain laws or their selective enforcement, it can result in his or her exclusion from the jury. Prosecutors, after all, want a conviction. When Butler was practicing in DC, sodomy laws were still in place, and many potential jurors would tell prosecutors that they didn’t support the laws, only to find themselves dismissed from jury duty. He says people’s feelings about drug laws are often similar and can lead to their dismissal. A Pew Research Center poll found that Americans, by a ratio of almost two to one, approve of states that have reduced mandatory sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders. Meanwhile, according to Department of Justice statistics, almost half of federal prisoners in the United States are incarcerated because of a drug offense. “People famously don’t show up for jury duty, and one reason is they don’t like the criminal justice system. They think it’s unfair and they don’t want to be complicit in it,” says Butler. But “you don’t have to be. There’s actually something you can do to protest it.”

People must know their rights before they get called to jury duty. Telling a sitting juror about nullification can be considered illegal tampering. But ensuring that all potential jurors know about nullification is not only legal but critical to the administration of justice. “When people start to understand the power they can exercise as jurors, I think that makes them more enthusiastic about jury service,” Butler says. And in an era of mass incarceration, harsh sentencing, racial profiling and police repression, the jury box is arguably the most powerful spot in the courtroom."

Bernie Sanders’s secret weapon is hiding in plain sight. It was there for everyone to see throughout the Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night, but we aren’t hearing about it in the post-debate coverage. Apparently it is invisible to the TV talking heads, headline writers, pundits, campaign reporters, and other media types who decide these things. Ad Policy

The media elites are fixated on a single question only: Who won? The American media’s tendency to cover politics like a sporting event dates back decades, of course, but it seems to grow more entrenched and absurd with each passing election. Thus the presidential election is covered like a horse race, presidential debates like boxing matches. Who landed the best punches? Who avoided them? Hence most news stories after Tuesday night’s debate carried headlines along the lines of “Hillary Triumphs After Attacking Sanders’s Gun Record.”

What actual voters think about Tuesday’s debate, however, might be quite different. Michael Tomasky, the political columnist at the Daily Beast, seems to be the only mainstream commentator who broke from the herd to make this point. Citing the results of two separate focus groups whose opinions had not been influenced by the media’s post-mortem declarations, Tomasky wrote, “There’s reason to believe that people watching at home didn’t share the media’s overwhelming verdict” that “Clinton crushed it.” On the contrary, both focus groups thought Sanders had won.

Leaving aside the simplistic focus on who won or lost, Sanders clearly appealed to many people Tuesday night, and his secret weapon helps explain why. That secret weapon is the gift of plain speech. This gift is less about the content of Sanders’s remarks, though that matters, than it is about the way he delivers them—he uses the kind of language ordinary people use themselves and speaks with a passion that makes it clear he genuinely believes what he’s saying.

Agree with his specific ideas and policies or not, Sanders was the only person on that stage Tuesday night who talked like a real person, not a calculating politician or policy wonk. Sanders didn’t talk about a “five-point plan,” like Clinton did in describing her proposal to reform banking regulation, or try to cram statistics into every answer like former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley did. Sanders didn’t mince words (“of course” he’d shut down the NSA’s domestic surveillance program) or run away from what he believes in (democratic socialism, as manifested in Scandinavia). He embraced his beliefs and actions and explained them in straightforward terms: yes, he had a different voting record on guns, because he represented a rural state where guns play a different role in daily life than they do in urban areas, but he was still tough enough to receive a grade of D-minus from the National Rifle Association. You might like that answer or not like it, but at least you can understand it.

Maybe the reason today’s media elites miss this aspect of Sanders’s appeal is that they’ve been on the inside of the political carnival looking out for so long that they’ve forgotten that debates, campaigns, and elections are not for them, they’re for the public. Most media elites are so distanced from ordinary people, and have been rubbing shoulders with conventional politicians for so long, that they don’t really get how alien and off-putting most politicians sound to the average person.

A second case in point: Sanders also was the only person on stage Tuesday night whose every other sentence didn’t contain a self-praising “I”: I accomplished this as governor, I have a plan for that, I have high ethical standards. What regular person likes listening to a braggart? (Well, clearly millions of Tea Party supporters and other right-wingers find Donald Trump’s bragging appealing, but even that is likely to wane after a while.) Sanders likewise refused to be drawn into attacking other candidates—even after Clinton went out of her way to attack his gun record and despite CNN’s childish insistence on trying to provoke cat fights, as if urging two candidates to criticize one another somehow amounts to hard-hitting journalism).

Again, this is an area where the media elite is in its own world, annoyingly out of touch with average Americans. The media likes cat fights because they make for dramatic television moments that the rest of the media can then talk and write about. The average American, by contrast, has been saying for years that she doesn’t like attack ads or their journalistic equivalent. The political and media elite’s continued wallowing in this mud is a part of the reason so many Americans are turned off to politics, at least as it’s presented by the mainstream media.

Bernie Sanders’s secret weapon of plain speech means that he comes across as, in a word, authentic. And authenticity goes a long way with Americans. We are a people for whom ideology matters a lot less than speaking plainly and sticking by your beliefs.

All of which recalls a leader who could not be more different from Bernie Sanders ideologically: Ronald Reagan. When Reagan ran for president in 1980, media elites ridiculed him as a simplistic former Hollywood actor whose ideas were too extreme for middle America. Voters, however, responded to Reagan’s clear, simple message and made him president. Fingers ever to the wind, the media elites soon changed their tune, christening Reagan “the Great Communicator.” There was sycophancy in the media’s about-face, but also reality: Poll numbers showed that even many Democrats who did not agree with this or that specific policy of Reagan’s nevertheless gave him the benefit of the doubt because he communicated his ideas in a clear, simple way and obviously believed they would work. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

If the first half of Sanders’s secret weapon is how he speaks, the second half is what he says. The political and media class in Washington haven’t caught up to this either, but Sanders’s basic message is one that very large numbers of Americans agree with: The system is rigged. The top 1 percent—“the millionaire and billionaire class,” as Sanders puts it—take too much of the nation’s wealth. Our political system and its elections are corrupt: The rich can buy a government that’s to their liking by throwing unlimited amounts of money at elections.

This may sound like radical, left-wing talk within the elite circles where most of the Washington political and media class travel, but it sounds like common sense to vast numbers of people across the country. Americans of all regions, political affiliations, ages, and races recognize that what Sanders says is true. And they find it refreshing that finally there is a politician who says it with the kind of conviction and track record that makes it believable, not just a campaign posture.

Speaking plainly and saying things that vast numbers of the American people agree with is what makes Bernie Sanders a much more creditable candidate than the mainstream media has recognized. It’s why Sanders is drawing such enormous crowds on the campaign trail. It’s why his poll numbers are close to or better than Clinton’s in key primary states and nationwide. It’s why he is raising as much money as Clinton is, despite forgoing donations from the millionaires and billionaires who dominate every other candidate’s fundraising efforts.

None of this means that Sanders will be the next president of the United States. But isn’t it a bit early to be drawing that conclusion about anyone? Here’s a prediction, though: The more opportunities ordinary Americans have to see and hear Bernie Sanders directly, unfiltered by the mainstream media and its silly definitions of proper news coverage, the less secret Sander’s secret weapon will be—and the more likely that Sanders will get what he asked for Tuesday night: for “millions of people to come together” to make a “political revolution” and take back their government from the 1 percent and those who do its bidding."

[This piece has been updated and adapted from William D. Hartung’s “Nuclear Politics” in Sleepwalking to Armageddon: The Threat of Nuclear Annihilation, edited by Helen Caldicott and just published by the New Press.] Ad Policy

Until recently, few of us woke up worrying about the threat of nuclear war. Such dangers seemed like Cold War relics, associated with outmoded practices like building fallout shelters and “duck and cover” drills.

But give Donald Trump credit. When it comes to nukes, he’s gotten our attention. He’s prompted renewed concern, if not outright alarm, about the possibility that such weaponry could actually be used for the first time since the 6th and 9th of August 1945. That’s what happens when the man in the Oval Office begins threatening to rain “fire and fury like the world has never seen” on another country or, as he did in his presidential campaign, claiming cryptically that, when it comes to nuclear weapons, “the devastation is very important to me.”

Trump’s pronouncements are at least as unnerving as President Ronald Reagan’s infamous “joke” that “we begin bombing [the Soviet Union] in five minutes” or the comment of a Reagan aide that, “with enough shovels,” the United States could survive a superpower nuclear exchange.

Whether in the 1980s or today, a tough-guy attitude on nuclear weapons, when combined with an apparent ignorance about their world-ending potential, adds up to a toxic brew. An unprecedented global anti-nuclear movement—spearheaded by the European Nuclear Disarmament campaign and, in the United States, the Nuclear Freeze campaign—helped turn President Reagan around, so much so that he later agreed to substantial nuclear cuts and acknowledged that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”

It remains to be seen whether anything could similarly influence Donald Trump. One thing is certain, however: The president has plenty of nuclear weapons to back up his aggressive rhetoric—more than 4,000 of them in the active US stockpile, when a mere handful of them could obliterate North Korea at the cost of millions of lives. Indeed, a few hundred nuclear warheads could do the same for even the largest of nations and those 4,000, if ever used, could essentially destroy the planet.

In other words, in every sense of the term, the US nuclear arsenal already represents overkill on an almost unimaginable scale. Independent experts from US war colleges suggest that about 300 warheads would be more than enough to deter any country from launching a nuclear attack on the United States. Current Issue View our current issue

Despite this, Donald Trump is all in (and more) on the Pentagon’s plan—developed under Barack Obama—to build a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers, submarines, and missiles, as well as new generations of warheads to go with them. The cost of this “modernization” program? The Congressional Budget Office recently pegged it at $1.7 trillion over the next three decades, adjusted for inflation. As Derek Johnson, director of the antinuclear organization Global Zero, has noted, “That’s money we don’t have for an arsenal we don’t need.”

Building a Nuclear Complex

Why the desire for so many nukes? There is, in fact, a dirty little secret behind the massive US arsenal: It has more to do with the power and profits of this country’s major weapons makers than it does with any imaginable strategic considerations.

It may not surprise you to learn that there’s nothing new about the influence the nuclear weapons lobby has over Pentagon spending priorities. The successful machinations of the makers of strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles, intended to keep taxpayer dollars flowing their way, date back to the dawn of the nuclear age and are the primary reason President Dwight D. Eisenhower coined the term “military-industrial complex” and warned of its dangers in his 1961 farewell address.

Without the development of such weapons, that complex simply would not exist in the form it does today. The Manhattan Project, the vast scientific-industrial endeavor that produced the first such weaponry during World War II, was one of the largest government-funded research and manufacturing projects in history. Today’s nuclear warhead complex is still largely built around facilities and locations that date back to that time.

The Manhattan Project was the first building block of the permanent arms establishment that came to rule Washington. In addition, the nuclear arms race against that other superpower of the era, the Soviet Union, was crucial to the rationale for a permanent war state. In those years, it was the key to sustaining the building, funding, and institutionalizing of the arms establishment.

As Eisenhower noted in that farewell address of his, “a permanent arms industry of vast proportions” had developed for a simple enough reason. In a nuclear age, America had to be ready ahead of time. As he put it, “We can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.” And that was for a simple enough reason: In an era of potential nuclear war, any society could be destroyed in a matter of hours. There would be no time, as in the past, to mobilize or prepare after the fact.

In addition, there were some very specific ways in which the quest for more nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles drove Eisenhower to give that farewell address. One of his biggest fights was over whether to build a new nuclear bomber. The Air Force and the arms industry were desperate to do so. Eisenhower thought it a waste of money, given all the other nuclear delivery vehicles the United States was building at the time. He even cancelled the bomber, only to find himself forced to revive it under immense pressure from the arms lobby. In the process, he lost the larger struggle to rein in the nation’s nuclear buildup and corral the burgeoning military-industrial complex.

At the same time, there were rumblings in the intelligence community, the military establishment, the media, and Congress about a “missile gap” with the Soviet Union. The notion was that Moscow had somehow jumped ahead of the United States in developing and building intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). There was no definitive intelligence to substantiate the claim (and it was later proved to be false). However, a wave of worst-case scenarios leaked by or promoted by intelligence analysts and eagerly backed by industry propaganda made that missile gap part of the everyday news of the time.

Such fears were then exaggerated further, thanks to hawkish journalists of the era like Joseph Alsop and prominent Democratic senators like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, as well as Stuart Symington, who just happened to be a friend and former colleague of an executive at the aircraft manufacturing company Convair, which, in turn, just happened to make ICBMs. As a result, he lobbied hard on behalf of a Pentagon plan to build more of that corporation’s Atlas ballistic missiles, while Kennedy would famously make the nonexistent missile gap a central theme of his successful 1960 campaign for the presidency.

Eisenhower couldn’t have been more clear-eyed about all of this. He saw the missile gap for the fiction it was or, as he put it, a “useful piece of political demagoguery” for his opponents. “Munitions makers,” he insisted, “are making tremendous efforts towards getting more contracts and in fact seem to be exerting undue influence over the Senators.”

Once Kennedy took office, it became all too apparent that there was no missile gap, but by then it hardly mattered. The damage had been done. Billions of dollars more were flowing into the nuclear-industrial complex to build up an American arsenal of ICBMs already unmatched on the planet.

The techniques that the arms lobby and its allies in government used more than half a century ago to promote sky-high nuclear weapons spending continue to be wielded to this day. The twenty-first-century arms complex employs tools of influence that Kennedy and his compatriots would have found familiar indeed—including millions of dollars in campaign contributions that flow to members of Congress and the continual employment of 700 to 1,000 lobbyists to influence them. At certain moments, in other words, there have been nearly two arms lobbyists for every member of Congress. Much of this sort of activity remains focused on ensuring that nuclear weapons of all types are amply financed and that the funding for the new generations of the bombers, submarines, and missiles that will deliver them stays on track.

When traditional lobbying methods don’t get the job done, the industry’s argument of last resort is jobs—in particular, jobs in the states and districts of key members of Congress. This process is aided by the fact that nuclear weapons facilities are spread remarkably widely across the country. There are nuclear weapons labs in California and New Mexico; a nuclear weapons testing and research site in Nevada; a nuclear warhead assembly and disassembly plant in Texas; a factory in Kansas City, Missouri, that builds nonnuclear parts for such weapons; and a plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that enriches uranium for those same weapons. There are factories or bases for ICBMs, bombers, and ballistic missile submarines in Connecticut, Georgia, Washington State, California, Ohio, Massachusetts, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Such a nuclear geography ensures that a striking number of congressional representatives will automatically favor more spending on nuclear weapons.

In reality, the jobs argument is deeply flawed. As the experts know, virtually any other activity into which such funding flowed would create significantly more jobs than Pentagon spending. A study by economists at the University of Massachusetts, for example, found infrastructure investment would create one and one-half times as many jobs as Pentagon funding and education spending twice as many.

In most cases it hasn’t seemed to matter that the jobs claims for weapons spending are grotesquely exaggerated and better alternatives litter the landscape. The argument remains remarkably potent in states and communities that are particularly dependent on the Pentagon. Perhaps unsurprisingly, members of Congress from such areas are disproportionately represented on the committees that decide how much will be spent on nuclear and conventional weaponry.

A Field Guide to Influencing Nuclear Thinking in Washington

Another way the nuclear weapons industry (like the rest of the military-industrial complex) tries to control and focus public debate is by funding hawkish, right-wing think tanks. The advantage to weapons makers is that those institutions and their associated “experts” can serve as front groups for the complex, while posing as objective policy analysts. Think of it as an intellectual version of money laundering.

One of the most effective industry-funded think tanks in terms of promoting costly, ill-advised policies has undoubtedly been Frank Gaffney’s Center for Security Policy. In 1983, when President Ronald Reagan first announced his Strategic Defense Initiative (which soon gained the nickname “Star Wars”), the high-tech space weapons system that was either meant to defend the country against a future Soviet first strike or—depending on how you looked at it—free the country to use its nuclear weapons without fear of being attacked, Gaffney was its biggest booster. More recently, he has become a prominent purveyor of Islamophobia, but the impact of his promotional work for Star Wars continues to be felt in contracts for future weaponry to this day.

He had served in the Reagan-era Pentagon, but left because even that administration wasn’t anti-Soviet enough for his tastes, once the president and his advisers began to discuss things like reducing nuclear weapons in Europe. It didn’t take him long to set up his center with funding from Boeing, Lockheed, and other defense contractors.

Another key industry-backed think tank in the nuclear policy field is the National Institute for Public Policy (NIPP). It released a report on nuclear weapons policy just as George W. Bush was entering the White House that would be adopted almost wholesale by his administration for its first key nuclear posture review. It advocated such things as increasing the number of countries targeted by the country’s nuclear arsenal and building a new, more “usable,” bunker-busting nuke. At that time, NIPP had an executive from Boeing on its board and its director was Keith Payne. He would become infamous in the annals of nuclear policy for co-authoring a 1980 article at Foreign Policy entitled “Victory Is Possible,” suggesting that the United States could actually win a nuclear war, while “only” losing 30 million to 40 million people. This is the kind of expert the nuclear weapons complex chose to fund to promulgate its views.

Then there is the Lexington Institute, the think tank that never met a weapons system it didn’t like. Their key front man, Loren Thompson, is frequently quoted in news stories on defense issues. It is rarely pointed out that he is funded by Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and other nuclear weapons contractors.

And these are just a small sampling of Washington’s research and advocacy groups that take money from weapons contractors, ranging from organizations on the right like the Heritage Foundation to Democratic-leaning outfits like the Center for a New American Security, co-founded by former Obama administration Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michèle Flournoy (who was believed to have the inside track on being appointed secretary of defense had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election).

And you may not be surprised to learn that Donald Trump is no piker when it comes to colluding with the weapons industry. His strong preference for populating his administration with former arms industry executives is so blatant that Senator John McCain recently pledged to oppose any new nominees with industry ties. Examples of Trump’s industry-heavy administration include Secretary of Defense James Mattis, a former board member at General Dynamics; White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who worked for a number of defense firms and was an adviser to DynCorp, a private security firm that has done everything from (poorly) training the Iraqi police to contracting with the Department of Homeland Security; former Boeing executive and now Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan; former Lockheed Martin executive John Rood, nominated as undersecretary of defense for policy; former Raytheon vice president Mark Esper, newly confirmed as secretary of the Army; Heather Wilson, a former consultant to Lockheed Martin, who is secretary of the Air Force; Ellen Lord, a former CEO for the aerospace company Textron, who is undersecretary of defense for acquisition; and National Security Council Chief of Staff Keith Kellogg, a former employee of the major defense and intelligence contractor CACI, where he dealt with “ground combat systems” among other things. And keep in mind that these high-profile industry figures are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the corporate revolving door that has for decades been installed in the Pentagon (as documented by Lee Fang of The Intercept in a story from early in Trump’s tenure).

Given the composition of his national security team and Trump’s love of all things nuclear, what can we expect from his administration on the nuclear weapons front? As noted, he has already signed on to the Pentagon’s budget-busting $1.7 trillion nuclear build-up and his impending nuclear posture review seems to include proposals for dangerous new weapons like a “low-yield,” purportedly more usable nuclear warhead. He’s spoken privately with his national security team about expanding the American nuclear arsenal in a staggering fashion, the equivalent of a ten-fold increase. He’s wholeheartedly embraced missile defense spending, pledging to put billions of dollars more into that already overfunded, under-producing set of programs. And of course, he is assiduously trying to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, one of the most effective arms control agreements of recent times, and so threatening to open the door to a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

Unless the nuclear spending spree long in the making and now being pushed by President Trump as the best thing since the invention of golf is stopped thanks to public opposition, the rise of an antinuclear movement, or Congressional action, we’re in trouble. And of course, the nuclear weapons lobby will once again have won the day, just as it did almost 60 years ago, despite the opposition of a popular president and decorated war hero. And needless to say, Donald Trump, “bone spurs” and all, is no Dwight D. Eisenhower."

Very few people enjoy paying taxes, so it’s hardly surprising the Internal Revenue Service is unpopular. This makes it an easy political target, particularly for those who are already on a mission to slash and eliminate as many taxes as possible. Senator Ted Cruz, for example, proposed shuttering the IRS entirely during his recent presidential campaign and said he would post the 125,000 agents along the southern border. Ad Policy

For years, the agency has been in the crosshairs of the Republican Party, particularly the far-right members of the House who have now organized themselves as the Freedom Caucus. But last week the war on the IRS escalated significantly, beyond mere rhetoric and hectoring: the House Judiciary Committee is now seeking to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

Ostensibly, the decapitation of the IRS can be traced to the scandal that broke three years ago, when it was disclosed that conservative groups were being held to a higher standard in their quest for tax-exempt status. The agency’s bungling of that issue and the subsequent dodginess of those responding to Republican fury—including Koskinen—only added to Republican resentment.

But impeaching a civil servant? Even if Koskinen were inept (his real crime may be his failure to genuflect before those who badgered him in hearings,) invoking impeachment is like using a nuke for pest control. The last civil servant who was impeached was William W. Belknap, the secretary of war, for taking a kickback. That was 1876.

If Koskinen survives the impeachment process, as expected, he still faces possible censure, but whatever the outcome, assaults on the agency are sure to multiply. That’s because the real complaint many Republicans have with the IRS is not that it is underperforming but, rather, that it is performing at all.

For Republicans, particularly members of the Freedom Caucus, targeting the IRS represents a crafty—some might say “cunning”—strategy: a pincer movement designed to emasculate government’s ability to raise revenues, even as it draws the line on deficit spending. In such a scheme, the IRS is the carotid, that vital artery that oxygenates all of government. The less it takes in, the more government atrophies.

And the political risks are minimal. In an election year, what’s not to like? Name one politician whose career was set back by attacking the IRS, a cultural whipping boy for as long as there has been a government. In the Bible, “publican” (or tax man) is a dirty word, and only Jesus could make an honest man of Matthew, the corrupt tax collector turned disciple.

For years, Republicans have whittled away at the IRS budget, deliberately undercutting its capabilities. Its budget has been cut by about $1 billion—about 17 percent—over its 2010 budget, factoring in inflation. The agency has been forced to shed some 13,000 people. The result: During the height of last year’s filing season, 90 percent of calls to the agency’s helpline went unanswered. That further incited discontent, fed the perception of a callous bureaucracy, and allowed those in oversight to cast themselves as champions of the aggrieved.

You can’t kick a dog and then yell at him for not being able to run. But that is the perversity of the policy now pursued by the Freedom Caucus. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

The ranks of auditors have also been depleted, reducing the efficiency of collection, and emboldening those already inclined to cheat. In 2015, there were 1.2 million audits conducted—a drop of some 350,000 over the course of five years. That in turn meant government collected $30 billion less in revenue. For perspective, the Environmental Protection Agency, reviled by many on the right, has a budget of $8 billion, the equally detested Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a mere $600 million.

The impeachment effort, radical and nearly unprecedented as it is, masks a much broader attempt to reshape government itself. And as worrisome as it may be to pragmatists that the revenue-raising function of the nation is in jeopardy, so too is the entire oversight apparatus of Congress, or at least what remains of it.

The impeachment drama may share more in common with Kabuki than oversight. And impeachment represents a serious escalation in a conflict in which the IRS is only the proximate target: the debacle is certain to have an impact on the tenor and integrity of congressional investigative and oversight hearings—and on whatever tattered remnants of comity have survived the ravages of political polarization.

Government itself has long relied on such hearings and investigations for vital information, accountability, and reform. Historically, such hearings have exposed some of the nation’s most egregious abuses and produced some of the most important reforms, like those resulting from hearings on Teapot Dome, Watergate, and the CIA. (They have also, on occasion, veered wildly off course and shamed the nation: think Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.)

Republicans are not the only culprits here. As a committee chair, then-Representative John Dingell was notorious for his bullying tactics and withering assaults. But at least the findings and the facts still enjoyed a measure of respect.

This can no longer be said. Even before hearings on Koskinen’s impeachment, meaningful oversight had been reduced to preaching to the choir, a display of histrionics, not designed to produce information, but calculated to discredit political adversaries. One might well ask why Representative Jason Chaffetz was so determined to have Koskinen’s head on a platter, why he suggested Obama might be impeached for the Benghazi affair, and yet long resisted calling Michigan’s Republican Governor Rick Snyder to testify on the Flint, Michigan, water scandal.

As chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Chaffetz only followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, Representative Darrell Issa. The hallmarks of their hearings have been incivility, bombast, and innuendo. In addition, no committee has provided a purer example of such partisan excess as the House Select Committee on Benghazi, whose interminable quest to mortally wound candidate Hillary Clinton has itself profoundly devalued oversight and congressional credibility.

There is the very real danger this impeachment effort will not be the last, that it is the opening gambit by those who would normalize impeachment as a way to punish or exile political opponents or use the congressional equivalent of capital punishment as a warning to others to take heed and not resist their demands for obeisance. And no one should imagine the Democrats are above taking a page from the Republican playbook. Adding impeachment to the arsenal of partisan options only further institutionalizes the tit-for-tat-ism that already cripples Congress.

Some five years ago, former Oklahoma representative Micky Edwards, onetime chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, offered this advice for those tasked with oversight: “…take off your party hat. Put it in a drawer, and deal with this as somebody who has taken an oath of office…to carry out the mandates of the Constitution to function as the people’s voice.” That’s “people’s,” not “party’s.”

Which brings us to the nettlesome question asked by the Roman poet Juvenal: “Who shall guard the guards?” Who is there to provide oversight of those charged with oversight? And what is to prevent not only the further deterioration of Congress’s oversight function but also a deeper erosion of faith in government? If there were to be a legitimate exercise of impeachment authority, perhaps it should be reserved for those now so willing to wield it against others."

Oslo, Norway—From the indigenous communities exposed by remote nuclear tests, to activists living in bustling cities across the globe—a new resistance is growing. Peace Organizations worldwide have joined together to stand up to the nine nuclear-armed states in the form of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, known commonly as ICAN. While many have hailed them for revitalizing the nuclear-disarmament movement, their greatest achievement to date is their influence on the creation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. This bold new step in disarmament stands out from previous anti-nuclear movements, because it went after a comprehensive ban. While it won’t as of yet directly eliminate a single nuclear weapon, as none of the current signatories have them, many believe it will significantly alter the nuclear-weapons industry. Ad Policy

The world’s powers remain at a crossroads. According to a recent Pew Poll, one of the few things Americans agree on today is that the nuclear threat coming from North Korea is real and should be taken seriously. On the other hand, the United Nations overwhelmingly voted to adopt a treaty that will prohibit nuclear weapons, and the disarmament movement, it seems, has never been more democratized. That is, ordinary people have never seemed to have such an impact on global affairs. So how can a campaign be awarded for its role in ridding the world of nuclear weapons when nuclear war seems so near?

The Norwegian Nobel Committee acknowledged ICAN’s role in the negotiations as the key factor for awarding it the Nobel Peace Prize for 2017. At this year’s ceremony, Berit Reiss-Andersen, chairman of the Nobel Committee, addressed critics of this movement: “Many people think that the vision of a nuclear weapons free world, global zero, is utopic, or even irresponsible. Similar arguments were once used to oppose treaties banning biological weapons, chemical weapons, cluster munitions and land mines. Nevertheless, the prohibitions became a reality and most of these weapons are far less prevalent as a result. Using them is a taboo.”

The Nobel chairwoman later invoked the words of Ronald Regan, saying, “A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The only value for our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will be never used, but then would it not be better to do away with them entirely?” Nuclear Weapons Resisting Nuclear Weapons Means Resisting Injustice and Oppression Ray Acheson

While many groups have come before them, ICAN is a unique coalition of people and organizations who have influenced governments to fill the crucial legal gap to nuclear disarmament, one they believe will help stigmatize and delegitimize these weapons as a valuable tool in global politics. Current Issue View our current issue

This global coalition has taken the reigns of the disarmament movement that has been active since the 1940s. Its approach has engaged activists and diplomats in the global south, from countries that have been exposed to nuclear weapons and rejected them. ICAN democratized nuclear disarmament as an issue for anyone to take part in.

There are too many people in ICAN to profile in one article, so I dug through to find different representatives from different corners of the earth. Each brought their own backgrounds, medical, legal, social, and all came together over a decade ago to lobby for the ban.

In Australia, ICAN began with Felicity Ruby, Dimity Hawkins, Dr. Bill Williams, Dr. Tilman Ruff, and others who launched the global effort with a strong medical and scientific perspective. According to Dr. Kathleen Sullivan, a disarmament educator in the United States, and one of the campaign’s earlier members, “the initial thinking revolved around horror, humor, and hope—to amplify the need for a louder nuclear taboo, to educate the public, reignite the movement fueled more by what we love than what we fear.”

Ray Acheson, director of Reaching Critical Will, the disarmament program at the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), was at the launch of ICAN in 2007 in Vienna, at a side event on the margins of the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee. “Originally the goal was to pursue a multilateral disarmament treaty with the nuclear-armed states’ support,” she explained, “but after these governments failed to implement their disarmament commitments and continued investing billions into nuclear-weapon modernization, our thinking shifted to go after a ban treaty instead.” While the nine nuclear-armed states and the NATO alliance show no signs of support for the treaty, ICAN helped design a treaty that didn’t need them, at least not at first. When Acheson appeared on Democracy Now!, the longtime member of ICAN’s International Steering Group said, “The treaty is actually designed not to include them necessarily. It would have been great if they had have come along, and it would have looked like a very different treaty. But given that they weren’t engaged in the negotiations and that they aren’t interested currently in disarmament, we needed to create something that could attack the system of nuclear weapons indirectly, getting around different economic, political, legal structures of nuclear weapons that keep the practices and policies of nuclear deterrence going currently.”

Tim Wright, director of ICAN Australia, was the very first volunteer back in 2006. Tim has advocated for ICAN in the Asia-Pacific region, and around the globe. According to Acheson, “He personally sat on the phone in New York and Australia and called individual countries to persuade them to join the humanitarian pledge against nuclear weapons, and will now do so for the treaty.” Wright, alongside a team of volunteers, also maintains the digital voice of ICAN, and constantly works to keep campaigners around the world informed and engaged with videos and social-media posts.

ICAN has inspired thousands of people around the world whose countries do not maintain nuclear arsenals to join the struggle for a nuclear-free world. Members like Drs. Peter Mburu and Kelvin Kibet of the International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) have been moved by the devastating effects nuclear war would have on the planet, including in their hometown of Nairobi, Kenya. Mburu admits, “It is true we have bigger problems—extreme poverty, corruption, youth unemployment, but there is a question of justice. A few countries can form a cabal hoarding power under pretenses of global security. The effects of nuclear weapons are well-documented, and even a small detonation would indiscriminately affect far too many people, including people in my part of the world, albeit indirectly. That is unacceptable.”

“Nuclear disarmament is not top priority in many non-nuclear-armed states, let alone in the developing world,” agreed Kibet.”Fighting poverty and disease among others come first. However, if a nuclear war happened, research shows that it’s the developing world that will be hardest hit.”

Lawyers, like Seth Shelden, a Fulbright specialist and a professor of law at CUNY, volunteered their time to ICAN to help ensure that the treaty would be as comprehensive and effective as possible. According to Shelden, “The treaty builds on existing international humanitarian law regarding use and threats of use of nuclear weapons, and goes several steps further by banning actions such as possession, testing, and development, as well as use and threats of use, of nuclear weapons under all circumstances.” It also addresses such issues as environmental remediation, victim assistance, and the illegality of stationing, transferring, and investing in nuclear weapons.

Maral Hassanshahi, a young Iranian physician studying at the University of Maryland–College Park, wanted “to stand up for myself and for others. I have seen women who could not defend themselves and live lives full of fear and regret. I didn’t want to be one of them.” She became a doctor and in her studies and activism learned how she could help the public through the Nobel Prize–winning IPPNW, which maintains an active presence in Iran. “ICAN has campaigned to inform people that the effects of these weapons are horrible, and even a limited use could affect them, too. They know no boundaries,” she says. “My work is mostly to empower and educate youth to work toward a healthier, safer world for everyone. Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous and destructive issue of our time and, together, we need to do something before it is too late.”

Dr. Carlos Umaña, director of IPPNW Costa Rica, also believes that just because his country doesn’t have nuclear weapons doesn’t mean he shouldn’t have a say on nuclear weapons-related issues. “There is really no such thing as a non-nuclear nation, for as long as any state has them, the entire international community lives under the nuclear threat.”

In 1967, Latin American governments created the first international nuclear-weapon-free zone, and have been involved since then in the fight for a nuclear-weapon-free world. However, “The Latin American public,” according to Silesky, “is preoccupied with other issues—such as violence, poverty, and instability. They do not think much about the nuclear threat.” He aims to change to that.

The global campaign convened on the United Nations Headquarters in New York to influence the treaty process. Coordinated by Daniel Högsta, ICAN’s campaigners and advocates encouraged member states to push for language agreed upon in campaigner meetings to ensure that the final draft was an effective document. However, at the heart of the negotiations were the testimony of those who have survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the countless others who have been exposed to nuclear tests.

Sue Coleman Haseldine knows all too well the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. She was exposed to the “black mist” fallout from tests held in her native homeland of Maralinga, in the southern Australian outback. Despite being evacuated to an outside compound, she was exposed as a child. She and her granddaughter suffer from thyroid cancer. Her township also has high levels of cancer. Haseldine believes the bombs brought this: “It has changed our genes,” she told her local media. “These diseases weren’t around before the bombs.”

Abacca Anjain Maddison hails from Rongelap, an island that will remain uninhabitable for generations because of radioactive contamination caused by nuclear testing conducted in the Pacific. A former senator of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, she travels the world with ICAN, gives voice to the survivors of the nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and aims to get compensation for the damage done to her land.

The earliest days of Setsuko Thurlow’s activism date back to 1954, when she came to the United States on a scholarship and she spoke out about the atmospheric testing in Bikini Atoll region. Setsuko Thurlow survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima when she was 13 years old. Like most children her age, she was mobilized for the war effort. On August 6 at 8:15 am she found herself buried in a collapsed building when the atomic blast ripped through her city. She told me how she escaped, but the ghostly victims, burned and mangled from the incredible heat still haunt her. “We Hibakusha have always felt that no one should ever allow what happened to us, to ever happen to another human being.”

When Thurlow accepted the Nobel on behalf of ICAN, she decried the use of nuclear weapons and being known as a victim: “We refused to wait for an immediate fiery end or the slow poisoning of our world. We refused to sit idly in terror as the so-called great powers took us past nuclear dusk and brought us recklessly close to nuclear midnight. We rose up. We shared our stories of survival. We said: Humanity and nuclear weapons cannot coexist.”

Members of ICAN refuse to accept the argument that nuclear weapons will never be abolished. Their strategy is to focus on the long term goal of abolishment, rather than short-term politics of who sits in what seat.

According to Acheson, ICAN’s next mission is to reach nuclear “umbrella” states, like those in NATO, and lobby against their practices. “We will work hard to ensure the treaty enters into force as quickly as possible—which means getting as many countries as possible from around the world to sign and ratify the treaty—our national campaigners will be very active in supportive states,” she said. The action plan involves educational programs, direct action, and parliamentary hearings to help reach both civil society and their political leaders."

It was the gun. It was the mental illness. It was the Tea. It was ""Second Amendment remedies"" and ""reload"" and candidates’ districts marked with cross hairs. It was glennbeckrushlimbaughmichaelsavagetalkradiotv with its 24/7 fomenting of hatred and contempt for Democrats, its antigovernment paranoia. It was the incivility. It was Arizona. It was the Internet. It was hypermasculinity and contempt for women. It was the gun. Ad Policy

It’s been only a few days since Jared Loughner opened fire with a Glock 19 in the Tucson supermarket parking lot where Representative Gabrielle Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet. And with Giffords gravely wounded, six dead and thirteen others injured, already millions of words have been written about why. In the Guardian, my Nation colleagues Gary Younge and Max Blumenthal point to Arizona’s poisonous right-wingery, some of it aimed directly at Giffords, a well-liked centrist Democrat: after she voted in favor of healthcare reform, her Tucson office was vandalized; at a 2009 meet-and-greet, a protester dropped a gun. In a letter to the New York Times, Giffords constituent Ronnie Bergen recalls attending a healthcare forum arranged by the Congresswoman: ""the event was packed with anti-Obama people, and the tone was ugly: shouting, rude, menacing individuals…. It was a chilling experience, even for one who had grown up in the bitter politics of the 1960s."" As Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik put it, Arizona has become ""the mecca for prejudice and bigotry.""

Might an unbalanced young man be influenced by the world around him? The very idea is ""political opportunism,"" harrumphs David Brooks: Loughner was simply deranged, possibly schizophrenic and ""locked in a world far removed from politics as we normally understand it.""

In a way, sure. For example, there’s no evidence that Loughner knew about Sarah Palin’s notorious electoral map on which Giffords’s district was one of twenty marked with cross hairs. This was a man who disrupted his community college math class by shouting out questions about the end of the world, posted gibberish on YouTube and was fired as an animal-shelter volunteer because he deliberately walked puppies in an area quarantined for parvovirus. But you don’t have to be Michel Foucault to understand that mentally ill people express their demons in ways that are culturally—and politically—inflected, and in Arizona that inflection is right-wing antigovernment hysteria. He may never have mentioned Palin (and really, must she always be the center of attention?), but his obsessions—the gold standard, government tyranny through mind control, the ""second Constitution""—are familiar themes of far-right patriot movements. Mark Potok, who monitors wing-nut extremism for the Southern Poverty Law Center, sees in the jumble of novels on Loughner’s MySpace page a theme of the individual against the totalitarian state, with Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto thrown in ""as variants of a kind of generalized ‘smash the state’ attitude."" And David Brooks, let’s get real: Loughner opened fire on a government event—a Democratic government event—not a shopping mall, a swimming pool or a classroom at Pima County Community College, from which he’d been suspended.

It used to be that after a spectacular killing there would be a lot of hopeful/rueful talk about keeping it from happening again: the media would be full of self-examinations and mea culpas, calls for more tolerance, more civic engagement and better laws. Who hasn’t vowed never to be like Kitty Genovese’s neighbors? Now right-wingers claim that they are the real victims of the Tucson shooting: Palin has just released a video claiming that attacks on her cross-hairs map are a ""blood libel."" (Because it’s Sarah Palin, one wonders if she even knows that ""blood libel"" almost always refers to anti-Semitic accusations that Jews kill Christian children and use their blood for ritual purposes.) Rush Limbaugh ""jokes"" that Loughner has Democrats’ ""full support"" because now they can take away your guns.

As if. Democrats abandoned gun control years ago, when they decided it lost Gore crucial votes in 2000 and they pivoted to go after the white male vote. Even progressives dropped the issue as hopeless, part of what made NASCAR dads and other red-state he-men see them as effete, effeminate and out of touch. Jon Tester, Brian Schweitzer and Jim Webb got high marks from both the NRA and progressives. Now there are some sixty-five pro-gun Democrats in Congress, including, ironically, Giffords. What are the chances they’ll support the bill Carolyn McCarthy is proposing, which would ban the sale of large ammunition clips like the one Loughner used? Or even Republican Peter King’s call to ban carrying guns within 1,000 feet of certain elected officials and judges? As Howard Dean told Lawrence O’Donnell on The Last Word, ""The so-called pro-gun lobby has won,"" and the most we can do is ""something around the edges."" That is what passes for a positive, muscular, vigorous response in the most highly armed nation in the world, with ninety guns for every 100 people, 10,000 gun murders a year and 20,000 more gun deaths from suicide and accidents.

We can’t ban speech. But whatever Loughner’s demons turn out to be, what let him kill six people and wound fourteen was that he had access to a gun—and a magazine that let him shoot thirty-three bullets without reloading. (Indeed, the Glock 19 was the same model gun Seung-Hui Cho used to kill thirty-two people at Virginia Tech.) It’s a little pathetic—has it really come to this, that it will be a huge uphill battle to ban something that has no purpose except to kill up to thirty-three people before anyone can stop you? Apparently, yes. In Arizona, Glocks have been flying off the shelves since the shootings. Meanwhile, in Congress, Democrat Heath Shuler and Republican Jason Chaffetz have announced they will be packing heat."

On Saturday night, Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old black boy who was said to be well-liked, died after Balch Springs police officer Roy Oliver fired his gun at the car in which Edwards was riding. Oliver shot Edwards in the head, and Edwards succumbed to the wound at a nearby hospital. Ad Policy

When I first saw Edwards’s school picture on Monday, I smiled. The cheesy background, the adolescent forehead acne, the half-smile—like he wanted to bare his teeth but knew that would slash his cool in half—were all familiar. It’s the kind of photo I remember putting in my middle-school diary—scored from a boy I had a crush on, after giving him mine. I wondered whether Edwards gave his crush this school photo, and if the crush pasted it in their diary with a heart around it like I once did.

And then I remembered Edwards was dead and that the diary entries of those who knew and loved him would never be about him as a person who lives.

The story of a black boy shot dead by law enforcement is a regrettably commonplace one at this point. Last year The Washington Post found that even though black Americans represent only 13 percent of the population, they are 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by law enforcement. The photo of Edwards feels particularly reminiscent of the widely circulated photo of Jordan Davis, another teen who was shot in a car by a white man, in 2012.

Each time a black boy is shot and killed we go through the same trauma. A photo of the boy is released, his sweet, pimply face imprinted in our minds. And every time this happens we think, “Maybe, just maybe this will be the boy who gets justice.”

And every time this happens, there is always a glimmer of hope that the justice system will bring accountability to the perpetrators and the police department they work for. I remember that sense of hope right before the it was announced that no charges would be brought against the officer who shot dead 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Surely, I thought, justice would be brought for a child. I was wrong.

Then there was Freddie Gray, whose death sparked powerful civil unrest in Baltimore. After the state’s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, brought charges against the officers involved in his death, I thought, surely, they’ll be found guilty. Instead, two officers were acquitted and then the prosecutor’s office decided not to proceed on the charges brought against other four officers involved.

And I remember feeling that sense of hope when it was a possibility that the cops involved in the shooting death of Louisiana man Alton Sterling could face federal charges. On Wednesday, in the midst of news over Edwards’s case, the Justice Department announced that it would not seek charges.

I can count on one finger the times a police officer has even gotten to the point of guilty plea in a high-profile case—once. On Tuesday, Michael Slager, the officer who fired eight rounds and killed 33-year-old Walter Scott, pleaded guilty to the charge of violating Scott’s civil rights by using excessive force.

But that glimmer of hope returned on Tuesday. This time, the police admitted that the story they originally gave to the public—that police fired shots at the car Edwards was riding in because the driver of the car was backing it up and using the car as a weapon—was false. The officer was even fired from the force. Balch Springs police chief Jonathan Haber did not mince words about holding the officer who shot and killed Edwards accountable. “From our policies, which I went by, there were violations. I acted on them,” Haber told the Dallas News on Tuesday evening. Balch Springs is a suburb of Dallas, which employs one of the largest forces in the country, and its police chief, David Brown, “a reformer,” has dedicated his career to improving relations between community members and police by advocating for a reduction in the use of force.

Now that a tragedy has taken place, the police department in Balch Springs might be trying its best to respond to the needs of Edwards’s family and the community at large. But the department already knew that Oliver was troubled. According to an NBC News report, Oliver was ordered to attend anger-management classes in 2013 after he lashed out on the stand in court. Arisha Michelle Hatch, a managing director at the racial-justice organization Color of Change, is wary of labeling the response in Balch Springs as progress. “Such a low bar has been set for responsiveness from police and prosecutors in tragic situations like these—so from that standpoint, the decisions made by the Balch Springs’s police department to correct the record about the events that led to Jordan’s death and to fire one of the officers feels extraordinary,” she tells me. But there are “troubling signs,” she said, that point to “deeper problems” in the department. Edwards’s brother, who was in the car with Jordan, was held in jail after his brother was shot in the head, but the police officer who shot Jordan was not. Hatch also wonders why the district attorney hasn’t made a statement, why the video of the shooting hasn’t been released to the public, and why the officer hasn’t been arrested. “There’s still so much work to do to shift to a culture of accountability around policing,” Hatch says.

No matter how proactively the Balch Springs PD responds to this killing, without a Department of Justice that seeks to hold police departments accountable, as it did during the Obama era, the actions taken by this suburb will be just a blip, an anomaly. The change in administrations—from a Department of Justice committed to reducing police violence against black Americans, to one that seeks to eliminate all traces of that commitment—makes the fight for police accountability even that much tougher for families and communities impacted by excessive force.

In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered a speech in Detroit that explicitly named the Justice Department’s position on police accountability. “The communities we serve must see our commitment to the impartial enforcement of our nation’s laws—every day,” he told the crowd. “Our communities must know that we enforce the laws that protect our civil rights with the same vigor that we enforce the laws that protect our public safety. I can assure you that under my leadership, the Department of Justice will enforce all of our nation’s laws, with equal conviction.”

Under Obama, the Justice Department did indeed make strides in holding individual police forces accountable. After 18-year-old Michael Brown died in a police-involved shooting in Ferguson, the DoJ investigated the police department and published a damning report that said there was a pattern of discrimination against the city’s black residents. The department did the same thing in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray. The DoJ also entered into formal agreements with 15 troubled police departments across the country to reduce discrimination.

But since Jeff Sessions took the helm at the Justice Department, he has made it clear that he is committed to rolling back the incremental and institutional changes the former administration’s DoJ had set in motion. Sessions has announced that he plans to review all existing reform agreements between the DoJ and police departments and has said on multiple occasions that criticisms of police departments leads to an increase in crime.

Without federal oversight, troubled police departments that do not already have a strong commitment to accountability will continue to shoot and kill unarmed black men without an iota of fear that they will be held responsible. And that is a terrifying possibility."

A friend recently played a tape for me which he had made at the press conference when Bill Leonard, head of CBS News, announced that Dan Rather would succeed Walter Cronkite as anchorman and managing editor of CBS Evening News, a job Cronkite had held for nineteen years. The mood of the occasion was almost randomly solemn or businesslike or playful– as though no one could be certain as to how seriously the changeover should be taken. The principal concern, I sensed, was for the American people. There seemed a chance that Cronkite had accidentally become our electronic monarch, in which case this ordinary corporate event, the semi-retirement of an employee at the age of 65, had better sound a little like an abdication followed by a coronation–which it did. Ad Policy

Rather was the most solemn of all, and that is nothing against him. I don't see how he could have gotten out of being humble yet brave, and so on.

But that was a year ago. The actual crisis is upon us. On March 6, Cronkite vanishes from the Evening News, as promised. This is a test of how crazy television can make us, or fail to make us, and the news is good. I can find no one who feels that we are losing a leadership figure of any sort. The people have somehow managed to keep Cronkite nicely in scale–with a lot of help from Cronkite himself. A subliminal message in every one of his broadcasts was that he had no power and wanted none. So now we feel that a kindly and intelligent teacher is leaving our village. It turns out not to matter that the village happens to be as big as all outdoors.

I have seen Cronkite laugh like Father Christmas when he is told that he should run for President or Vice President or Senator. No one ever seems to mention a governorship or a seat in the House of Representatives. I have also noticed that nobody else laughs much at the joke, even when Cronkite explains it–when he says that he is only a newsman, Without any of the gifts and enthusiasms good leaders have. He intimated in a recent interview that he hadn't even aspired to be a big shot in television, that he would have been nearly as contented as he is today if he had remained what he was in the beginning–a print journalist of no great fame. He loves his family. He loves his friends. He loves his sailboat. And he remains as entranced by the unfolding of each day's news as a child with a new kaleidoscope.

What makes it hard for others to laugh along with him is that this is the land of opportunity, and no one here is supposed to fail to snatch any opportunity that is unlucky enough to be caught in the open. Walter Cronkite could have been President of this country, just as George Washington in his own day could have become King. All he had to do was to lose his temper in public, and to pick a side:

""This is Walter Cronkite, born in Joplin, Missouri, and raised in Texas, and you all know me, and I am fed to the teeth with all the stupidity and greed I see in Washington. I can no longer sit by idly and so on.

His last name is Dutch, by the way–like Roosevelt.

Morley Safer, Cronkite's CBS colleague for the past fifteen years, said the other day that he expected local rather than national television news people to transmute their popularity into hard-edged political power. I thought at once of a young man of my acquaintance who had been a star reporter a few years back on a local show here in New York City. At the age of 30, he concluded in all seriousness that he should run for mayor, and that nobody could stop him.

""Why should you be mayor?"" I asked him.

""Because nobody can jive me,"" he replied.

The young man was a famous crusader. Cronkite is not. He may still become one, although I myself do not particularly recommend it, but he has so far done nothing to match, for example, Edward R. Murrow's vivisection of Senator Joseph McCarthy on the air. Cronkite's lack of rudeness to any political faction over so many years may have had a curious side effect, as unwelcome to him, I'm sure, as it should be to all of us: he may have encouraged us to imagine that there is a sort of sanity and wisdom on which all Americans can and-should agree. Cronkite is not our electronic monarch–but he just might, accidentally, have become our electronic Uncle Sam.

No, Virginia, this is an acrimoniously pluralistic society. There is no Uncle Sam.

I asked Safer if there were any particular political, issues in which Cronkite had felt personally involved year after year. He said that Cronkite, as a public speaker off the air, is regularly angry and disgusted and alarmed over anyone, no matter how powerful or popular, who would in any way limit the freedom of the press.

This, I submit, is not how Uncle Sam talks. It is the romantic stubbornness of an old newspaperman.

Safer said, too, that when he worked under him Cronkite declared with utmost sincerity that his assistants were doing all the work, and that the investigating they were doing out in the world was what he himself most loved to do.

This is the raffish gallantry of an old newspaperman.

Cronkite steps aside just as old newspapermen are becoming as legendary as cowboys. As young as this country is, we will have a rich mythology, by and by. Radio and television news began with old newspaper people. How else could they have begun?

The noun ""press"" is now archaic as applied to news editors and reporters. Equally antique is the cliche that describes Walter Cronkite so well:

""He has printer's ink in his veins."""

Like a medieval wizard, Donald Trump has performed an extraordinary act of alchemy in recent months. He has converted one thing into something different entirely. Instead of an election being “a discussion and contest about policies and policy choices,” he has changed its definition. In 2016, in the GOP primary—and possibly in the general election itself—he has remade “election” to be “a popularity contest based around spectacle.” Ad Policy

As a political journalist, I’d say it’s craziness-inducing. Quite simply, there are no in-depth policies or ideas in the Trump campaign, other than build a wall, deport some people, impose some vague tariffs on China and other global competitors, and “make America great again.” It’s almost certainly the flimsiest set of proposals of any presidential campaign in history. And that’s deliberate. A campaign about absolutely nothing is a campaign that devolves into a reality TV–style popularity contest. Which is why we now have the ungodly spectacle of Marco Rubio saying Trump pees his pants and Trump saying Rubio sweats too much. It’s the ultimate infantilization of politics, reducing everything to a spectacle of the crass and the absurd. And in such a milieu, with the political process utterly denuded of politics, a barbarian such as Trump has a huge advantage. He plays the caveman game better than anyone else. He throws bigger and better tantrums, and his insults are coarser and harsher.

If you look back at history, that’s what Fascist messages, whether it be Mussolini’s rise or Hitler’s, Pinochet’s or Somoza’s, have always been: a vile stew of inchoate nationalism and racism, an iron-fist intolerance for dissent, a lot of name-calling and bluster, and a gross simplification of every political and sociological problem. Ultimately, all prospect for real social reform gets silenced, because the political process no longer has room, or even language, for proper policy debate and discussion; and the culture as a whole becomes completely debased.

We already see that in the vast GOP crowds Trump is drawing—people who treat the choice of president, the choice of whose finger should be on the nuclear button, as no different from a WWE spectacle or a vote on American Idol or The Apprentice. They don’t want to talk about climate change; or refugees—other than to bar them or deport them; Syria—other than to say they hate all Muslims; poverty; or global public health challenges. They don’t want to discuss education or wealth inequity. They have no desire for a conversation on how to get the uninsured access to doctors, or how to fix public infrastructure, or how to deal with police brutality, or the heroin epidemic, or the crisis in affordable housing. Or how to secure nuclear materials, or how to deal with the potential implosion of the European Union.

There’s nothing about any of these issues of national or international significance in a Trump speech. In fact, there’s nothing that in any understandable form is political. His campaign speeches are about “toughness” and national salvation. His victory speeches, when he notches up another primary success, are barely literate bromides about the joys of greed and of grabbing. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Trump’s supporters want theater—and not of the highbrow variety. They want blood and gore, tits and ass. They want adrenalin. If Trump took his cock out and shook it about onstage, I suspect his audiences would go wild. They want the money shot. Which is why they love it when he urges them to beat up protesters, or when he calls his opponents crybabies, or when he mocks a female journalist for menstruating.

This is, quite simply, pornography vaguely masquerading as politics. Which is why the other GOP candidates have had so little success knocking him off the pedestal. They are, however crudely, politicians; and, as politicians tend to do in an election, they’re talking politics. Trump is a manipulative stage-man, like the snake-oil sellers of yesteryear…and while his rivals talk politics, he sells his snake oil. His extraordinary success has come about not because he’s out-politicking Rubio et al., but because he has convinced the GOP electorate that this election has absolutely nothing to do with politics. He hasn’t done an end run around his opponents; he has simply decided to play a different game on an entirely different field.

The Romans in their decadence had bread and circuses, as well as gladiatorial combat, to keep the masses happy. We, apparently, now have reality TV and WWE. The Romans ended up with their Neros and Caligulas, mad megalomaniacs with brains warped by lead poisoning and gene pools warped by incest. We have Trump, whose bullying, self-pitying, aggrandizing rants suggest something approaching syphilitic madness.

But there is one difference: The problems Roman emperors had to deal with didn’t have quite the globally cataclysmic potential that today’s great challenges do. The Roman emperors didn’t control thousands of nuclear weapons, nor did they have to make critical decisions regarding how to put the brakes on climate change.

If the GOP base has now, finally, fully devolved into a mob, and if that mob wants spectacle instead of policy, the party has signed its own death warrant. It will have ceased to function as a political party and will have become simply a springboard for demagogues.

In the long run, because I have to believe in an arc of progress spanning the great eons of history, I can only hope that such a group will eventually become irrelevant—a vengeful, thuggish outlier on the edge of the political system. But as John Maynard Keynes once noted, “In the long run we are all dead.” The vast, overwhelming question of the moment is what happens in the short term? How do we as a country rescue the political process—that extraordinary process by which the most powerful country on Earth chooses its leaders, its public face, its top officials, whose every decision affects every corner of the globe—from this grotesque, pornographic, alchemical hijacking that it is now facing? If we don’t, the lights will go out all over America—as Sir Edward Grey, Britain’s foreign secretary, said of Europe, when pondering the hideous spectacle of the continent sliding into what would become the First World War—and they won’t come on again in our lifetimes."

Louis Baggetto contributed data analysis to this report.

One of them was South Side resident Damian Turner. A tall, charismatic teenager with a passion for video games and rapping, 18-year-old Turner had cofounded the grassroots activist group Fearless Leading by the Youth (FLY). With it, he campaigned to improve conditions at a city juvenile-detention center. On August 15, he was shot in the back just after midnight at a South Side intersection. He was pronounced dead about an hour later, after an ambulance drove him to a downtown hospital.

The next week, about a month before Turner would have turned 19, friends and family packed the nearby St. Andrews Temple for his funeral, where they received copies of his rap mixtape. “People really didn’t want to listen to it, because they were going to cry,” recalled Turner’s stepsister Alexssa Moore.

Turner’s homicide—the result of a stray bullet from a drive-by shooting—was one of 436 in Chicago that year. But it stirred a city in which activists, politicians, and medical experts were already grappling with the absence of trauma care for the victims of gun violence on the South Side. After Turner died, FLY made his 10-mile ambulance trip downtown its signature issue.

* * *

On what would have been Turner’s 19th birthday, members of FLY and its parent organization, Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP), held a rally in front of the University of Chicago Medical Center to call for the opening of a facility that would treat severely injured patients. The state-of-the-art medical complex, which touts itself as “The Forefront of Medicine” and is backed by a $782 million endowment, sits in the affluent neighborhood of Hyde Park, just four blocks north of the weedy intersection where Turner was shot. But like many other South Side shooting victims, Turner traveled downtown, to the trauma center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Often, the victims of traumatic injuries—caused by such things as car crashes, shootings, and falls—are taken to the nearest trauma center, hospital operating rooms equipped with cutting-edge tools and teams of specialized surgeons. Severely injured patients are 25 percent less likely to die if they receive treatment at a top-level trauma center than if they are treated in an emergency room. But it’s been 25 years since the South Side has had one. The University of Chicago Medical Center closed its adult trauma center in 1988, after only two years of operation. And in 1990, the South Side’s last adult trauma center closed. Today, the only four adult trauma facilities within city limits are downtown and on the North and West sides.

FLY has argued that the university’s lack of an adult trauma center fuels a serious health inequity, disproportionately affecting black youth in some of the city’s most violent neighborhoods. Since 2010, FLY’s fight for the University of Chicago Medical Center to open a trauma center has mushroomed into a full-blown movement, fueled by support from doctors, students, religious leaders, and union nurses who are convinced that a South Side trauma center would save lives.

“Nobody on this earth deserves to die if they have a chance to live,” Turner’s mother, Sheila Rush, told The Nation in an interview last May. “My son did not even have a chance, because he was fighting for his life on the way in that ambulance on that long ride to the hospital.”

Representative Bobby Rush of Chicago—who introduced a bill in Congress in 2013 that would have appropriated $100 million in federal funds for trauma centers—lays part of the blame for his own son’s shooting death in 1999 on the University of Chicago’s lack of a trauma center. “The fact that a community that’s home to about 750,000 people on the greater South Side of Chicago—an overwhelming portion of which sits in my congressional district—does not have one, not one, Level I trauma-care center literally results in the needless loss of life for far too many of us,” Rush testified before Congress in 2011.

In 1984, years before Michael Jordan was a household name, Chicagoans were getting excited about another, younger homegrown basketball star: Ben Wilson, who had been named the best high-school player in the country. But the 17-year-old athlete’s career was cut short after he was shot twice outside his high school—less than five miles away from where Turner was shot—and operated on more than two hours later at a hospital without a trauma center.

Nine Chicago-area trauma centers banded together to form a network two years later, to direct ambulances to the closest, most appropriate care available. Although several hospitals have since left the system, one of the architects of the original network, Dr. Gary Merlotti of Chicago’s Mount Sinai Hospital, insists that the city suffers from neither an insufficient quantity nor quality of trauma centers.

“I don’t think we have an inadequate number,” Merlotti says. “We have a geographic maldistribution.”

Activists calling for a South Side trauma center agree. But it wasn’t until two years ago that they could point to hard data to make their case.

A 2013 study, led by Northwestern University trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, found that Chicago gunshot-wound victims more than five miles away from a trauma center were likelier to die. She dubbed these regions “trauma deserts.” According to a Nation analysis of city data, nearly a fifth of Chicago residents live five or more miles away from a trauma center, most of them on the South Side. And between 2001 and 2013, more than a third of the city’s homicides and shootings have taken place more than five miles away from a trauma center.

“I found that particularly with life-threatening gunshot wounds or stab wounds to the heart or to the chest, that I wasn’t saving those folks that I might have saved when I was a resident,” said Crandall, whose curiosity was sparked because the majority of her downtown hospital’s gunshot-wound victims hail from the city’s South Side, more than a dozen miles away.

Another study, published last year and led by Dr. Renee Hsia of the University of San Francisco, focused on California. It determined that victims of all types of traumatic injuries were 21 percent more likely to die if their driving time to a trauma center increased after the closure of their nearest facility.

While trauma-care experts have criticized the research, most notably for its focus on distance instead of time, they have also found its premise to be straightforward and reasonable. “Obviously, the longer distance you are from definitive care by experts, the more likely the outcome from whatever physiologic derangement is afflicting you will be less favorable,” said Dr. Joseph Tepas, a trauma researcher at UF Health Jacksonville in Florida. “That’s logic.”

In fact, the idea that trauma patients who wait longer for treatment are likelier to die is a cornerstone of American trauma care. In 1960, the US Army gave Dr. R. Adams Cowley of the University of Maryland Medical Center a grant to study severe civilian injuries. The researcher—commonly called the “father of trauma care”—used it to open the country’s first-ever hospital trauma unit, a four-bed section dubbed the “death lab,” in which he treated and studied dying patients. Cowley’s observations produced his theory of the “golden hour,” a period after traumatic injury in which medical attention is most likely to save a life. It remains accepted wisdom that trauma patients face a much higher risk of dying the longer they wait for care.

The creation of trauma centers grew in tandem with federal involvement in coordinating emergency medical services, driven by the expansion of the national highway system and a rise in automobile accidents. In 1973, President Richard Nixon signed the Emergency Medical Service Systems Act. This led to the appropriation of more than $300 million to develop and expand regional EMS systems across the country. Hospitals joined in, hoping to attract patients, staff, and revenue by investing in trauma centers. By the mid-1980s, however, the trend in some regions had reversed. One major factor was a shift in Medicare reimbursements in 1982: Seeking to rein in hospital bills, Congress switched the program from a retrospective to a prospective payment system, setting average payments for specific classes of illnesses instead of covering the cost of individual Medicare patients’ treatments after the fact. The aim was to encourage cost-effective treatments by letting hospitals keep the difference between actual treatment costs and Medicare payments. But trauma centers paid a price: The initial prospective payments not only failed to account for the severity of patient injuries, but they ultimately put tremendous financial pressure on a hospital’s overall finances. As R. Adams Cowley and his colleagues found in a 1992 study of 44 recently closed trauma centers, this payment shift was cited by hospital administrators as one of the top reasons for the closures of their trauma centers.

In 1991, one year after the South Side’s last trauma center closed its doors, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) recognized urban trauma-center closures as a disturbing phenomenon, citing 22 such closures nationwide since the mid-1980s in the six major American cities they studied: Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, Miami, San Diego, and Washington. According to the report, the South Side’s last trauma center—the one at which Damian Turner would have been treated for his gunshot wound—closed in 1990, largely due to a doubling of its caseload, and three other metropolitan areas out of the six in the study experienced a similar phenomenon. “When trauma centers withdraw from established trauma systems, the patients who normally would be seen at those closed facilities must be taken to other, open trauma centers, usually the next closest in the system,” the GAO noted. “If continued, the domino effect can deteriorate trauma systems to the point of failure.”

A Nation analysis of American Hospital Association data from the 25 biggest US cities reveals that between fiscal years 2006 and 2011, a dozen hospitals with trauma centers closed. In East St. Louis, Illinois, where 98 percent of the population is black and 47 percent live below the poverty line, the approximately 27,000 residents were served by a single facility, Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital, which housed the only trauma center in the city. The trauma center closed in 2008, and the hospital itself shut down in 2011. “It was a horrible feeling,” then-mayor Alvin Parks said. “I can remember standing there, in front of Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital the day that the trauma center was going to close. It was snowy, it was sleeting, and we stood out in front of the hospital, protesting the closure of the trauma center, with many people with tears in their eyes, because we knew that some people were going to die as a result of the trauma center being closed.”

* * *

At a coffee shop in Damian Turner’s neighborhood last April, antiviolence activists Jimmy Poole and Martin Johnson debated the South Side’s lack of trauma care. Johnson insisted that the absence of a trauma center at University of Chicago Medical Center was “racially motivated and discriminatory to the poor.” But Poole maintained that it was about cost, not color.

¨You can’t put a number on a moral obligation,” Johnson countered.

“No, you can’t,” Poole replied. Then he asked Johnson to imagine the number of people who would come to the only trauma center on the South Side.

In 1987, a year before it closed, the UCMC’s trauma center accrued a $2 million loss treating 217 patients—65 percent of them subsidized or uninsured. In the first three months after the UCMC facility closed, most new patients at the South Side’s last remaining trauma center were government-insured or uninsured, and the hospital lost $400,000. The cost of caring for uninsured and government-insured patients is a major factor in a trauma center’s profitability. Because patients by law cannot be denied care once at an emergency facility, trauma centers have no choice but to provide care, whether it pays or not.

“The major challenge with keeping trauma centers open is the financial aspect: If you’re not seeing the cases that are paying your bills, it’s very difficult to keep a trauma center solvent,” says Ian Weston, executive director of the advocacy group American Trauma Society.

According to estimates by the Trauma Center Association of America, the cost of treating uninsured trauma patients alone is at least $230 million a year. Penetrating trauma—which includes gunshot wounds and stabbings—is more common among uninsured patients and at urban trauma centers.

As the battle for a South Side trauma center rages, the Nashville-based Hospital Corporation of America has, since 2010, opened five new trauma centers in Florida, all of which operate in zip codes where a majority of the residents have health insurance. And in four out of the five zip codes, a majority of the residents have private insurance. (HCA has since been accused of inflating treatment charges.)

HCA’s openings stand in stark contrast to the closings on the South Side, where a well-endowed nonprofit institution like UCMC may be able to cover the losses incurred by treating uninsured trauma patients, but lacks any financial incentive to do so.

“This sign behind is more than a sign. it’s a prescription for the University of Chicago,” FLY activist Veronica Morris-Moore told a May 2014 rally of some two dozen activists flanked by reporters and cameras. Unfurled near the medical center’s entrance was a banner reading Rx Prescription, with the words Trauma Center Now below it. So far, FLY’s prescription has proved a bitter pill, one that the university is unlikely to swallow. So what can be done for the South Side and similar communities across the United States?

Jennifer Ward, president of the Trauma Center Association of America, argues that one solution is ensuring that everyone has a right to high-quality trauma care, just as they do police, fire-fighting, or ambulance services. “I think that the country needs to understand that trauma-center care should be categorized in the same way as any other public good,” she says.

The Affordable Care Act may reduce the number of uninsured trauma patients, which in turn might help trauma centers better handle their costs—but only in those states that don’t opt out of Medicaid expansion. Some states already subsidize uncompensated trauma care with taxes on cigarettes (Hawaii) or fines on driver offenses (Texas). But in those states, the safety net for financially vulnerable trauma centers with a large population of uninsured patients remains tied to state economies and budgets.

Federal funding could ease the burden. In 2010, Congress passed legislation authorizing $100 million every year through 2015 to help cover the cost of uncompensated trauma care. Yet Congress never appropriated those funds, even in the wake of the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), who survived thanks to treatment at the only Level I trauma center in southern Arizona.

From the top down, advocacy for federal trauma-care funding has fallen on deaf ears. President Obama has never mentioned trauma centers in any of his proposed budgets. And since fiscal year 2010, trauma centers have never appeared in any of Congress’s appropriation bills.

Funding may be on the way: In March, the House of Representatives passed the Access to Life-Saving Trauma Care for All Americans Act, which would authorize $100 million in grants for uncompensated trauma care through 2020. As of press time, the bill—introduced by Representative Michael Burgess (R-TX)—has been referred to the Senate. Even if the bill passed, Congress would still need to appropriate the funds, which would cover only a portion of the country’s uncompensated trauma-care costs.

But in the meantime, injury will continue to strike often and without warning, and its unluckiest victims will remain at the mercy of hospital balance sheets.

“You try and go to any private institution with a colon cancer and see if they’ll take care of you. And the answer is they won’t,” Dr. Merlotti says. “But in that circumstance, you have some time to locate somebody who will. Trauma doesn’t afford that opportunity.”"

It’s been a month since former New York Police Department Officer Peter Liang was found guilty of manslaughter, but the movement to “save” him is gaining momentum. Liang, who in 2014 shot and killed Akai Gurley, an unarmed 28-year-old black man, is Chinese-American. He’s also the first New York City cop to be convicted in a police-involved shooting in more than a decade, causing many people in Asian-American communities to accuse the justice system of “scapegoating.” In the immediate aftermath of his conviction, thousands of supporters rallied in cities across the country, flooding the streets with signs that read: “Save Peter Liang,” “No Selective Justice,” and “One Tragedy, Two Victims.” Last week, amid continued calls for protest and massive social media support, Liang began to assemble a new team of lawyers to appeal the verdict. Ad Policy

On February 5, I sat in a cramped courtroom watching his trial alongside other journalists, the Brooklyn district attorney, and supporters of both Peter Liang and Akai Gurley’s family. The basic events of the evening are not disputed: On November 20, 2014, Liang and his partner were patrolling a Brooklyn housing project when he shot Gurley in a dark stairwell. They did not attempt to resuscitate Gurley, and spent two critical minutes debating whether to call their supervisor while Liang said over and over again that he was going to lose his job. Gurley was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Liang maintains he fired his weapon by accident, and that he was in shock and inadequately trained to perform CPR. As the room waited impatiently for the defense to present its case, I caught a glimpse of Liang sitting next to his lawyers on the far side of the room. His head was bowed low, his back small. The sight of him conjured in me a familiar sense of despair.

As a daughter of Japanese parents, I’ve often felt a deep sense of duty and obligation, perhaps a burden, that I couldn’t quite explain to my white peers. That is, for an Asian kid, there always seemed to be more at stake. The narrative of the model minority has been so deeply embedded into the Asian immigration story that it’s seeped into our collective psyche. Our “success” is a way of justifying why we’re here and why we belong. Our sense of worth is tied to the “success” of our people as a whole. To fail is to betray generations. It’s hard to explain the depth of filial piety, but it’s impossible to understand Asian support for Liang without it. Peter Liang is everything to his parents. As I watched Liang and his family in the courtroom, I saw my parents in his, myself in him. But no matter how deeply I felt this cultural kinship, I couldn’t defend him.

The following week, Akai Gurley’s family and those of other victims of police shootings gathered outside the courthouse for a press conference. I stood by as cameras swarmed around them on the sidewalk, cars zipping behind them. Among those who spoke was Nicholas Heyward Sr., the father of Nicholas Heyward Jr., an African-American boy shot by a police officer in 1994. Like Akai Gurley, he was shot in the dark stairwell of a New York City housing project. He was 13 years old. More than 20 years later, Heyward Sr. was standing in front of the courthouse again, holding up a picture of his son in his hand. I felt the weight of one’s life being changed forever.

Our “success” comes at a cost. What supporters of Peter Liang are asking for is to grant Liang, like Darren Wilson and Daniel Pantaleo, the license to take black lives at will. In other words, to defend Liang is to affirm the system in place. The final stage of our “success,” then, is to achieve equal status with the oppressor, so that we too can fully enjoy the fruits of white supremacy, even if it means casting aside those who are impoverished and discriminated against in our own communities under the shadow of the model minority myth.

But there are those in our communities who stand on the other side. As Akai Gurley’s family members spoke that day, they were surrounded by young Asian-American activists, some raising their fists in the air. They were members of the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV), a pan-Asian community organization based in Chinatown that helps low-income Asian immigrants and refugees living in the city. Founded in 1986, the group opposes institutional racism, and from the beginning has called for the indictment of Peter Liang despite relentless attacks from pro-Liang groups. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

As snow began to fall onto the sidewalk, Cathy Dang, executive director of CAAAV, stood before the cameras and recited the names of two Asian-American men beaten by the Police Department: Peter Yew, a young Chinese-American engineer living in New York City who was brutalized by cops during a traffic stop in 1975; and Kang Wong, an 84-year-old Chinese man, who was battered in 2014 for allegedly “jaywalking.” In both cases, Dang pointed out, it was black communities that stood on the front lines with Asian-American protesters.

It is undeniable that the very rights and freedoms we have today are inextricably tied to black struggle—they were fought for and won by warriors in the civil-rights and black nationalist movements, carried on today by Black Lives Matter. In what was to be his last public speech, Malcolm X put forth the basic premise that black liberation lies at the core of the liberation of all peoples. “It is incorrect to classify the revolt of the Negro as simply a racial conflict of black against white, or as purely an American problem,” he told the room of students. “Rather, we are today seeing a global rebellion of the oppressed against the oppressor, the exploited against the exploiters.”

From the internment of Japanese Americans in the 1940s to the brutal murder of Vincent Chin in 1982, Asian Americans have often been on the side of the oppressed rather than the oppressor. As writer I.Y. Lee writes in her essay “Are We Trayvon Martin?,” Grace Lee Boggs, Yuri Kochiyama, and other Asian-American leaders worked closely with black organizers, including Malcolm X, during the civil-rights movement, reifying the Afro-Asian solidarity that raged against a system bent on dividing people of color. As antiblack racism permeates almost every facet of society today, we need to ask ourselves once again: Whose side are we on?

Peter Liang killed Akai Gurley. As Gurley lay dying, Liang didn’t call the ambulance. He didn’t offer any medical assistance. In that moment, he deprived a parent of a son and a child of a father. No, this verdict wasn’t a tragedy. No, there weren’t two victims. Peter Liang is part of a racist system that tries to tell us black lives don’t matter. We must stand with Akai Gurley’s family in opposition to any appeal of Liang’s conviction, call for systemic change in the Police Department, and demand all police officers be held accountable. Until we see the loss of Akai Gurley as the loss of our own, we are complicit in the cycle of systemic racism—and our own oppression."

Last night around 10:45 in Minneapolis, a group of suspected white supremacists opened fire on a crowd of Black Lives Matter activists, injuring five people. All five were taken to the hospital and one underwent surgery early this morning. The shooters targeted a Black Lives Matter encampment near the Minneapolis Police Department’s 4th Precinct, where protesters have remained for over a week to demand consequences for the police killing of unarmed 24-year-old Jamar Clark. Ad Policy

Miski Noor, a Black Lives Matter organizer, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “A group of white supremacists showed up at the protest, as they have done most nights.” Noor told the Star Tribune that when Black Lives Matter activists tried to get the group to leave, “they opened fire on about six protesters.”

The attackers, some of whom were allegedly wearing masks and bullet-proof vests, fled from the encampment, which was a block away from the police station. Many protesters at the encampment claim police officers simply stood around. One Black Lives Matter activist, Toor, 21, came to the encampment after work, having heard about the shooting. “People heard the police saying, ‘This is what you wanted, this is what you asked for.’” According to one eyewitness, it took the police 15 to 20 minutes to respond, evoking the Ferguson police’s decision to let the body of Michael Brown lie outside for hours.

Cops started macing concerned bystanders and being violent was even more triggering #4thPrecinctShutDown — h a f s a (@QUESADILLABABY) November 24, 2015

The police did not respond to these specific accusations and issued a statement claiming that officers immediately responded to the shooting.

As of now, little is known about the identity of the attackers. Over the last week, protesters in Minneapolis have been facing regular threats from white supremacists. On Friday night, two masked men decked in camouflage came to the protests and made Black Lives Matter activists feel threatened. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP!

One of the masked men gave the local outlet, City Pages, an ominous statement that night. “I don’t know if this is what [protesters] were planning, just standing here. It’s almost as if they expect one of us to do something. They expect one of us to be in the wreckage of all this. It’s boiling. It’s going to be happening soon.” According to City Pages, the same men released a video of them driving to the precinct, brandishing a gun, and declaring, “We’re going to knock this shit out.… a little reverse-cultural enriching. Let the fire rise.” As of now, it is unclear whether there is any connection between these masked, armed men and those that shot at protesters last night.

These attacks are just the latest of what appears to be a resurgence of organized white supremacy in America, made disturbingly clear by Dylann Roof’s shooting spree on a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this summer. According to Sam Richards of the North Star Post, the Minneapolis shooters are alleged to have yelled, “Race war and Trump 2016” before there shooting.

Three days ago, a mob of white supporters at a Trump rally attacked a Mercutio Southall Jr., a Black Lives Matter activist, who recalls being called “N*****” and “monkey,” as he was kicked, punched, and shoved to the ground. The assault took place in Birmingham, Alabama, where white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church over 52 years ago.

In response to the assault, Trump appeared to endorse the violence, declaring, “Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing. I have a lot of fans, and they were not happy about it. And this was a very obnoxious guy who was a trouble-maker who was looking to make trouble.” Trump added to the controversy on Sunday, tweeting out false, racist statistics about murder rates that turned out to be have been posted by a neo-Nazi.

According to Black Lives Matter activists in Minneapolis, as in the civil-rights movement, there is little distinction to be made between this rising vigilante white-supremacist movement and the police.

In a 2007 federal employer discrimination suit, for example, several minority police officers accused the department of systematic discrimination. In the suit, Robert Kroll, now the head of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, is accused of regularly wearing a “motorcycle jacket with a “White Power” badge sewn into it.”

“None of these groups are new,” says Yohanan Blackkwell, an organizer, who was present for the beginning of the precinct occupation. The KKK has been around and police were the original slave catchers. We’re going to deal with it the same way we always do, singing the gospel and holding up the mirror to these terrorists. The plantation here in Minneapolis is going to be torn down.”"

If after Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and Darius Simmons, you thought that you could be sickened by racist violence but no longer shocked, you need to know the story of Jonathan Ferrell. This past weekend, as the country remembered the fiftieth anniversary of the 16th St. Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham that took the lives of four little girls, another murder draped in racism took place, and the details, even in these jaded times, are shocking.

Jonathan Ferrell, a 24-year-old former football player at Florida A&M University crashed his car in Charlotte, North Carolina. The wreck was so awful that Ferrell, according to police reports, had to climb out of his back window. He somehow stumbled in the middle of the night to the closest home and pounded on the door—“banging on the door viciously,” in the bizarre phrasing of Charlotte police chief Rodney Monroe—and begged for help. According to police reports, the person inside didn’t call an ambulance but hit her alarm panic button, indicating to police that a home invasion was in progress. As the Charlotte PD approached, Ferrell continued to “attempt to gain the attention of the homeowner.” When they arrived, Ferrell “charged” toward them. One of the three officers tasered Ferrell. When that did not stop his “advance”, 27-year-old Officer Randall Kerrick opened fire, hitting Jonathan Ferrell ten times – initial media reports said three times – killing him at the scene.

Officer Kerrick was the only policeman to take out his gun and fire, which raises questions about their description of Ferrell as “charging” towards them after being tasered. According to The Charlotte Observer, police actually said initially that Kerrick’s actions were “appropriate and lawful.” Yet the brazenness of the shooting, the absence of any evidence Ferrell was under the influence of anything other than a possible concussion, and the fact that there was really no way to spin this, meant that Kerrick was quickly arrested and charged with voluntary manslaughter. According to North Carolina law, “voluntary manslaughter” means that Kerrick acted with “imperfect self-defense.” The police statement said that “the evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive. Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.”

Jonathan Ferrell was a member of Florida A&M’s 2010 championship team. He was going to turn 25 in October and was engaged to be married. He was called “the shepherd” for the way he looked after those around him. His mother Georgia and twin brother Willie Ferrell, who also played on Florida A&M team, spoke to CNN this morning, their shocked sadness on full display. His college coach, Earl Holmes, was “stunned”, saying, “I was saddened when they told me. They told me he was murdered. I said, ‘What? Murder? That doesn’t sound like him. Not the Jonathan I remembered.’ The Jonathan I remembered was a soft-spoken kid, quiet and to himself…. A lot of times bad things happen to good people.”

But they don’t just “happen.” One of the reasons there was so much media and mainstream outrage around the murder of Trayvon Martin was because he wasn’t killed at the hands of police. When the police kill an unarmed black or brown male, the media, the political establishment, and even many mainstream civil rights organizations are inclined to give them a major benefit of the doubt. One can ask the families of Ramarley Graham or Sean Bell if that sounds about right. Being stopped by police for DWB (Driving While Black) is outrage enough. Being killed by police for SHWB (Seeking Help While Black) demands a response.

When the four girls of the 16th St. Baptist Church were killed, many asked how the United States could lecture the world about democracy and human rights when it couldn’t guarantee the safety of children in a house of worship. Let’s update this. How can President Obama lecture the world about the “American values” the United States wants to project in the Middle East when an unarmed young man can’t ask for help after a car wreck without being seen as a lethal target? Forget “post-racial” America. We can only hope that, after Trayvon Martin, we aren’t “post-outrage.” The Ferrells deserve if nothing else our collective insistence that there be justice for Jonathan Ferrell and that such a senseless death never happen again.

At a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump made an extemporaneous comment that appeared to suggest that Hillary Clinton should be shot to prevent the appointment of liberal Supreme Court judges: Ad Policy

“Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick —[crowd booing]—if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know.”

The straightforward reading of these comments would be that he suggested assassination, if even in a joking manner. (Ending sentences in “I don’t know” is a common Trump locution after a joke.) It’s not totally clear whether Trump meant Clinton would be the target, or that he was suggesting shooting the judicial nominees or using arms in some other way to prevent them from taking a seat on the court.

Trump’s campaign immediately blasted out a statement that attempted to clarify his remarks. “It’s called the power of unification—2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won’t be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump,” said Trump adviser Jason Miller. Trump was clearly talking about a hypothetical time after Clinton had been elected and was selecting nominees, however.

Regardless of what was in Trump’s head when he made the comment, there is little doubt that legions of his fans will take this as a suggestion of violence—Second Amendment solutions to government overreach is a common formulation among Tea Partiers and radical pro-gun groups.

Last month, Ben Carson—who has endorsed Trump—said on Fox News, “They’re always saying you don’t need a high-powered weapon to hunt deer. The Constitution is not about deer hunting. It’s about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion.”

When she was campaigning for the senate in 2014, now-Senator Joni Ernst said at an NRA rally, “I have a beautiful little Smith & Wesson, 9 millimeter, and it goes with me virtually everywhere. But I do believe in the right to carry, and I believe in the right to defend myself and my family—whether it’s from an intruder, or whether it’s from the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important.”

In 2010, Nevada Senate candidate Sharron Angle caused a major controversy when she said, “If this Congress keeps going the way it is, people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies and saying my goodness what can we do to turn this country around? I’ll tell you the first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out.” LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Threatening violence against Democratic presidents is not new ground for many hard-right politicians either. Senator Jesse Helms famously said in 1994 that Bill Clinton “better have a bodyguard” if he were to visit any military bases in North Carolina. Earlier this year, Texas governor Greg Abbott tweeted that if Obama wanted “more gun control,” he should “COME AND TAKE IT,” along with an image of a cannon. Speaking about Obama at a Christian conference in June, Senator David Purdue prayed, “Let his days be few.” Following the shooting of police officers in Dallas last month, former Congressman Joe Walsh tweeted “This is now war. Watch out Obama.”

Even people close to Trump have been fairly explicit about assassinations. His former butler wrote on Facebook that Obama should be “hung from the portico” of the White House (actually, the “white mosque,” in his phrasing). A Trump advisor, Al Baldasaro, said last month that “Anyone that commits treason should be shot. I believe Hillary Clinton committed treason.” Trump gave Baldasaro a shout-out at a campaign stop earlier this week.

This long lineage of violent comments makes it irrelevant what Trump truly meant—it’s about what many of his supporters will hear, which is an amplification of the idea that guns should be used against a supposedly over-reaching or illegitimate government.

It’s frightening to recall that in 2012, when Trump briefly believed that Romney would win the popular vote but lose the electoral college tally, he tweeted a call for “revolution.” With his comments Tuesday, and recent assertions that the November election will be “rigged,” we are approaching an incredibly dangerous situation."

It took more than a dozen years for the lesson of The Nation’s editorial on Reagan's near-assassination—that stricter gun control would have possibly prevented the attack—to bear fruition, in the Brady Law, mandating background checks for certain gun purchases, dedicated to the Reagan assistant who was shot and seriously injured that day. James Brady died in 2012 of complications from the wound, and his death was deemed a homicide. Ad Policy

The most irrelevant comment we hard on the day of the shooting came from a spokesman for an anti-gun control group, who was quoted as saying that since Washington already had strict laws, the incident was proof that gun control doesn’t work. Gun control laws in Washington or New York City or Detroit can never work so long as handguns can be purchased at a pawn shop in one state and transported to another. Handgun controls won’t solve the problem, but they would begin to reduce the risks. Ironically, the one Federal agency that deals with the interstate arms traffic—the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms—is slated for a severe cutback in the 1982 budget. Opponents of gun control, like John Connally, who told a television interviewer that more “discipline” was needed, in the sense of swifter, sterner punishment of all criminals, ignore the irrational component in assassinations and, indeed, in most of the murders in this country. An available gun transforms violent emotions into deadly action.

Thanks to the heroic determination of high-school students, the gun-control movement is on the march in the United States. Companies around the country are distancing themselves from the NRA. Yet media giants like Amazon and Apple still purvey NRA propaganda; major financial companies like Visa and MasterCard keep facilitating gun sales; and the storied insurance company Lloyds of London persists in insuring the NRA and gun shows. Ad Policy

The immovability of these big targets makes clear the challenges of a consumer-boycott strategy against an industry historically at the heart of modern life. Arms manufacturing has been entangled with our financial system from the beginning, and excising it from the economy will not be easy.

Britain’s military engagements and colonial excursions in the 18th century helped drive industrialization. Military contracting fueled the development of metallurgical industries. In 1752, Birmingham boasted that “above Twenty thousand Hands” were employed “in useful Manufactures…greatly serviceable to the Government.” The town worked to quash any legislation threatening its booming firearms industry, convinced that injury to it would damage the entire region, throwing a “considerable…portion of its population” out of employment.

Britain’s biggest gun-making firm was owned by Samuel Galton Jr. Galton was a Quaker, and the Religious Society of Friends is a sect known for its pacifist commitments. In 1796, responding to concerns raised in his church, Galton defended his business by arguing that there was no industrial work he might do that did not in some way contribute to war. Indeed, fellow Quakers in town included families like the Lloyds, his iron suppliers, whose war profits laid the foundation of Lloyds Bank. Galton’s logic did not persuade the Quaker church; he was officially disowned. The church refused to receive “further Collection from him or to admit his attending our Meetings,” but he defiantly continued to attend the worship, and the Quaker Ackworth School and other Quaker charitable organizations continued to accept his donations. Meanwhile, as war with France went on, the Galton gun fortune skyrocketed. The family used this wealth to establish a bank in 1804. The Galton bank later merged with Midland, now part of HSBC. Related Article The Adults Have Failed, So Students Are Leading the Way George Zornick

Soon after, government-spawned innovation in firearms manufacturing again drove industrial revolution. After decades of patient investment, the US federal government enabled the production of firearms with interchangeable parts. The resulting “American System of Manufacture” was adopted in machine-tool, sewing-machine, and other industries. British gun makers followed suit, adding bicycles, cars, and other essential modern goods to their offerings. At the end of the 19th century, global arms sales were thriving. European and American arms companies obtained banking partners that gave loans to client states. Cartels formed as business alliances emerged to divide up world markets.

In the early 20th century, the French arms maker Paul Allard of Schneider-Creusot reminded critics that his factories had long been oriented toward the “whole industry of metallurgy and mechanical construction,” with only periodic focus on war matériel at the government’s behest. The science-fiction writer H.G. Wells likewise pointed out that the profits of arms trading accrue not only to arms makers but to “thousands of persons of all ranks of life,” “as lesser shareholders,” even when they are “quite innocent of any desire to slaughter their neighbours.” Moreover, he noted, arms manufacturers made other products, too. In 1935, a British Royal Commission argued that the line between military and civilian manufacturing was so blurry that it was impossible to say who was and who wasn’t making arms. Parts used in arms manufacturing often also had uses in other goods. Like Galton, the commissioners saw the entire economy as ineluctably involved with arms production, recognizing that “large numbers of people, of all classes…by reason of their employment, their business interests or by the holding of shares, may have a financial interest in war or the preparation for war.”

Despite the historic reality of the centrality of arms-making to the evolution of modern industry and finance, we often echo the Quaker church that scorned Galton and imagine arms makers as especially scandalous “merchants of death.” Andrew Undershaft in George Bernard Shaw’s 1907 play Major Barbara was the ultimate caricature of the malevolent arms maker. Today, we focus on the villainy of the NRA and the politicians in its pocket. This outlook shapes strategies like pressuring companies that partner with the NRA to cancel their discounts to NRA members. Current Issue View our current issue

The NRA certainly is villainous. But Galton had a point, too. The rest of us remain systemically implicated, even if we don’t buy or invest in firearms.

In 2007, Remington, a firearms maker central to America’s industrial history, was bought by Cerberus, a private-equity firm. After Sandy Hook, public-pension fund investors like the California State Teachers’ Retirement System pressured Cerberus to dump Remington. Failing to find a buyer, Cerberus moved the gun maker into a “special financial vehicle.” Meanwhile, it profited from booming gun sales—panic purchases in anticipation of new controls. Cerberus has earned nearly $20 million in advisory and other fees from Remington since 2007, apart from the more than $60 million return on equity in 2012.

Meanwhile Remington borrowed millions from Huntsville, Alabama, where it opened a plant on the understanding that the loan would be forgiven if the company brought enough jobs. Remington also borrowed money to buy out those who wanted to divest. Some of its debt is held in funds managed by JP MorganChase.

Remington has now filed for bankruptcy, and Cerberus will finally lose control of it. The bankruptcy proceedings presume that someone will buy Remington—possibly another gun maker like Sturm & Ruger. In the meantime, Remington is assuring employees and shareholders that its operations will go on as normal.

Its interim owners include JP Morgan Asset Management. Bank of America and Wells Fargo currently fund the revolving loan of about $200 million that allows Remington to borrow for operations.

Gun-control advocates speak of pressuring banks like JP MorganChase and Wells Fargo to refuse to allow their services to be used for firearms sales, but these banks are themselves deeply invested in the gun business. Moreover, thousands of employees; law, advertising, and insurance firms; materials and parts suppliers; and retailers remain implicated in Remington, too.

Meanwhile, the public at large remains an indirect patron of the very gun makers that it asks banks and companies to shun. Forty percent of firearms manufacturers’ profits in the United States come from government contracts, including military arms and law-enforcement arms bought by state, county, and municipal forces with our tax contributions. Through our support of armed policing and American military engagements abroad, we enable these purchases.

It is certainly a positive step that financial firms like Blackstone Group and BlackRock Inc. are culling gun companies from the portfolios of clients who do not wish to invest in them. But Galton’s question has been lost: What of all the other ways in which we remain complicit in firearms manufacture?

Divesting from firearms alone will not wash the blood from our hands. We must rethink our commitment to a mutually terrorized public and mutually terrorized system of “global security.” Galton may have been too easy on himself, but he was right that by focusing on his particular culpability, his accusers obscured the larger scandal of their civilization’s dependence on arms."

Virginia’s elections on Tuesday night were a stinging loss for the Republican Party. Governor-elect Ralph Northam won by the biggest margin for a Democratic gubernatorial candidate since 1985, and Democrats made massive and unexpected gains in the House of Delegates. Ad Policy

Election night was also very difficult for the National Rifle Association, which is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, and spent big bucks in an effort to defeat Northam and several other Democrats who ultimately won. The NRA poured over $2 million into races in Virginia, including a massive $750,000 advertising push in the last three weeks before the election.

The losses came up and down the ticket. Northam, Lieutenant Governor–elect Justin Fairfax, and Attorney General Mark Herring all faced NRA-backed candidates and won. In 13 competitive races where the Democratic candidate was endorsed by the pro–gun control group Giffords (until recently known as Americans for Responsible Solutions) and the Republican was backed by the NRA, the Giffords candidate was victorious in 12. The winner of the 13th race still hasn’t been declared, as Democrat Shelly Simonds and Republican David Yancey await a full vote tally. Among the winners was Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was fatally shot on the air as she reported for a local Virginia television station. His opponent was backed by the NRA.

Other gun-control groups like Moms Demand Action and Everytown also pushed hard for these pro–gun control Democrats—Everytown dumped $700,000 into Virginia races as election day drew near.

NRA candidates in very safe Republican districts still won, but that was to be expected. In short, the NRA got its clock cleaned everywhere that mattered.

Since the NRA frequently gets involved in competitive federal and state races nationwide, almost always on behalf of Republican candidates, naturally sometimes its candidates win and sometimes they lose. There can be a tendency to over-read these results—if a race didn’t meaningfully turn on gun control, it probably didn’t tell us much about gun politics. But that was clearly not the case in Virginia.

Northam, who boasted about his F rating from the NRA, protested outside NRA headquarters in Fairfax after the Las Vegas shooting that claimed 58 lives and injured 546 others. “I appreciate it when someone says, ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with you.’ But it’s time to take it a step further; we need to take action,” he said. Current Issue View our current issue

His running mates were equally aggressive in going after the NRA. “Each one of us is very proud of our F,” Fairfax said.

Mark Herring, who was reelected as attorney general Tuesday, had a particularly combative relationship with the NRA. Virginia had concealed-carry reciprocity agreements with 30 states until 2015 when Herring announced he was cutting the agreements with 25 of those states, citing permit policies that were too lax. This outraged the NRA and other gun-control groups, and ultimately Herring’s move was reversed by Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, who signed a bill that reinstated the agreements with those 25 states but instituted “voluntary” background checks at gun shows, along with heightened enforcement from state police. (Gun-control groups bashed McAuliffe for the move, and Herring refused to attend the bill’s signing.)

Voters understood that gun control was a big issue in the race. Seventeen percent of voters listed “gun policy” as their most important issue, which was second only to health care. Those voters split evenly between Northam and Gillespie, which cuts against the conventional wisdom that pro-gun voters tend to prioritize the issue to a much greater extent than people who favor gun control. “The narrowing of this enthusiasm gap portends greater losses for candidates that strictly adhere to the gun lobby’s agenda,” said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, in a post-election memo.

Legislators at the federal level noted the results too, like Senator Chris Murphy, one of the leading gun-control champions in the Senate:

Exit polls show top 2 issues for #Northam voters tonight were health care and guns. Say it again. Health care and GUNS. —Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 8, 2017

The story of the Virginia elections is that, while Gillespie outperformed several past statewide Republicans in conservative, rural areas, he got absolutely clobbered in Virginia’s suburbs. There were many reasons for this, but it tracks with the long-running belief by gun-control advocates that the issue plays big-time in suburban areas, particularly with women. Republicans seem to be catching on to this fact—when post–Las Vegas legislation to ban “bump stocks” was introduced in the House last month, it had 15 Republican co-sponsors, all of whom were from vulnerable districts, many of them in suburban areas. Gillespie boasted of his NRA endorsement, but didn’t actually release his responses to the NRA’s issue questionnaire.

There are some caveats to these results, namely that two high-profile mass shootings happened in the run-up to the election. Voters tend to react strongly to such shootings but then quickly lose interest in gun control, which they may not have had a chance to do between the Las Vegas shooting and Sunday’s attack in a church in Sutherland, Texas, which killed 26 people, and Tuesday’s voting. But, that said, every bit of data about Tuesday seems to be pointing in one direction: Pro-gun Republicans in anything but a safe district should be very worried."

The unfolding civil trial against Remington Arms Company over what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary school is rapidly approaching what could be a watershed moment in American gun politics: forcing a major arms manufacturer to disclose internal deliberations over how to manufacture and market assault weapons to the general public. And Remington is using every legal tool at its disposal to prevent that—even asking this week for a Connecticut judge to seal emerging evidence in the case. Ad Policy

The lawsuit, brought by some of the families and survivors from Sandy Hook, took several surprising turns this spring. First, a Connecticut judge refused to throw the case out, and later she ruled that the discovery process can begin. Legal experts didn’t give the case much chance of making it past an initial hearing, yet it has now lasted several months. They also didn’t anticipate the discovery phase beginning so quickly. Several legal scholars told The Nation earlier this year that discovery, if it ever came, was a long way off.

It’s still quite possible that the defendants—Remington Arms Company, which produced the Bushmaster XM-15 that Adam Lanza used at Sandy Hook to kill 26 people, along with Camfour, a middleman distributor and also a gun shop in East Windsor, Connecticut—will succeed in derailing the case, potentially by wielding the broad gunmaker immunity passed by Congress in 2006. The judge has not directly ruled yet on whether that immunity applies here.

But the discovery process is already underway. Lawyers for the Sandy Hook families told The Nation that for nearly a month they’ve been communicating with Remington about documents they would like turned over.

“We have a first set of requests. We’re looking for a broad range of information—financials, marketing documents, a lot of things related to the weapon and how it’s sold,” said Katie Mesner-Hage, one of the lawyers from Koskoff, Koskoff and Bieder who is working the Sandy Hook case.

The legal team is also scheduling depositions with Remington executives, in which they would have to testify under oath about the company’s practices when it comes to distributing the XM-15. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Once these documents are turned over and the depositions occur, they will be a matter of public record regardless of what happens with the case going forward. These revelations have the potential to shine new light on exactly what major arms companies believe about the lethality of assault weapons, and how they apply that knowledge during the mass-production and marketing process.

Remington, however, is determined to stop that information from ever becoming public. In Bridgeport Superior Court on Monday, the defense team raised the prospect of a protective order that would seal any discovery documents and keep them out of public view. They have until July 5 to file it.*

Companies facing civil suits of this nature commonly ask for protection of company information, but are generally only successful when they are seeking to protect genuine trade secrets or similar types of information. Mesner-Hage anticipates Remington will ask for a very broad protection order, covering almost everything that comes out in discovery, and that there will be subsequent legal tug-of-war over what will eventually become public.

The Sandy Hook families want as maximum sunlight into Remington’s activities. “There should be as much transparency as possible. This is not a case that should be conducted behind closed doors and with a lot of sealed documents,” said Mesner-Hage.

Meanwhile, several mass shootings have provided a grim backdrop to the ongoing legal case, most recently the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando—the worst yet in American history. The Sandy Hook families were in court for a scheduled hearing just over a week later.

“It was very surreal to have the horrific tragedy in Orlando happen just before we were set to argue in court,” said Mesner-Hage. “It hung over the proceedings to some extent, because how could it not.”

Elena Kagan was confirmed Thursday as the 112th justice to serve on the Supreme Court bench, in a significant victory for the Obama administration and womens’ rights groups—and a significant defeat for the National Rifle Association. Ad Policy

Kagan was approved on a 63-37 vote, earning the support of fifty-six Democrats (all except Nebraska’s Ben Nelson), Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders, Connecticut Independent Joe Lieberman and five Republicans who had already announced their support for her: Lindsey Graham, the South Carolinian who cast the sole GOP vote for Kagan on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Richard Lugar of Indiana, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.

The Senate made history with its choice. As People For the American Way President Michael B. Keegan noted: “Thanks to today’s vote, the Supreme Court will have three female Justices for the first time in our nation’s history.""

National Organization for Women president Terry O’Neill was similarly enthused. ""NOW eagerly anticipates three brilliant women justices individually and collectively making their mark on a Supreme Court long dominated by men, while making decisions that greatly impact the lives of everyday people,"" said O’Neill. ""This is more than a symbolic, inspiring achievement for women—it will be a genuine victory for every woman and girl who benefits from Elena Kagan’s years of service on the high court.""

In addition to making history, however, the senators also sent a signal that was very much of the moment. And it had to do with their indepenence from a supposedly definitional special-interest group.

The NRA staked much of its reputation as a political powerhouse on an aggressive campaign to defeat Kagan, who earned the ire of the lobbying group after she expressed the view that several past rulings allowing for modest gun controls were ""settled law.""

But Senate voted, even members who had long been closely allied with the group rejected its counsel.

According to an analysis by Doug Pennington, a veteran watcher of Congressional voting on gun issues, nine senators with A ratings from the NRA voted to confirm Kagan: Montana Democrat Max Baucus, Alaskan Democrat Nick Begich, Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey, New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand; South Carolina Republican Graham, South Dakota Democrat Tim Johnson, Pennsylvania Democrat Arlen Specter, Montana Democrat Jon Tester and Virginia Democrat Mark Warner.

In addition, a number of senators with records as staunch defenders of 2nd amendment rights, such as Vermont Independent Sanders, Maine Republican Collins and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold were solid supporters of Kagan.

The Senate’s overwhelming vote on this nomination represents a second significant rejection of the NRA’s lobbying on High Court nominations in as many years, and a signal that Senate Democrats—and a number of Republicans—are willing to buck the group that likes to position itself as the thousand-pound gorilla of legislative lobbying in Washington.

That’s a big deal, not merely in the context of the Kagan vote but in the broader context of the role gun issues play in judicial nomination fights. Last year, the NRA went all out to block Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who like Kagan is a native of New York, a city that has struggled with gun violence.

Sotomayor was confirmed on a 68-31 vote.

Kagan’s margin was smaller but comparable and, as with Sotomayor, attracted significant bipartisan backing..

That’s important, not merely in the context of the Kagan vote but in the broader context of the role guns issues play in judicial nomination fights.

Kagan is not an anti-gun zealot. She’s expressed respect for the Second Amendment, which she interprets in a mainstream manner. But there is little question that, like the vast majority of Americans, she favors reasonable anticrime and antiviolence measures, some of which would allow for regulation of gun sales and distribution of weapons.

That was not acceptable to the National Rifle Association, the stealth representative of gun manufacturers in Washington. NRA lobbyists were unsettled by the prospect that a rational majority, with personal experience of the issues that arise when urban areas are flooded with cheap handguns, could emerge on the court.

So the group mounted a last-ditch effort to put roadblocks in the way of Kagan’s nomination, complete with fevered alerts urging members to call senators with appeals ""to OPPOSE and filibuster the Kagan nomination!""



The NRA reportedly employed what is considered to be its most powerful threat on the Hill—a suggestion that it will include the Kagan confirmation choice on the short list of votes that are used to determine the NRA’s legislative scorecard ratings.

Those ratings are a big deal for Republicans and many Democrats running in rural areas where a high grade from the NRA counts for something with voters—just as a low grade can count against an incumbent, no matter what the party. Remember that two decades ago, Vermont’s Sanders beat an Republican Congressman at least in part by highlighting the low NRA rating of the incumbent. And Wisconsin Feingold, who has made defenses of the Second Amendment central to his broader constitutional advocacy, always makes note of what even a conservative critic acknowledges are ""good ratings from the NRA—an important metric in a state bristling with deer rifles.""

Feingold has already backed Kagan as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that advanced her nomination to the full chamber, and Sanders is expected to do the same.

The NRA’s efforts to ""bully senators""—as Jill Pike of the Third Way think tank put it—were unlikely to gain traction with Feingold or Sanders. But the opposition so many of the the A-rated senators was significant.

When senators start saying ""no"" to doing the bidding of the gun manufacturers on these votes, and acknowledging as much, they strike a blow against special interests. And they remind us that, for all its money power and all its threats, the NRA is not calling the shots on High Court confirmations."

Seamus pointed his rainbow flag with the feather handle at his sisters and “pow-powed” them, calling out, “Yous are dead now, guys. I shot yous.” Ad Policy This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com.

Madeline and Rosena laughed and just kept on running, with Seamus at their heels. I hid my face in my hands. It wasn’t just that he was playing guns, but that he was using a Pride flag as his gun at a vigil to mourn those killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. My pacifist husband Patrick ran to redirect their activities, replacing the flag with a ball and glove and beginning a game of catch. Vigil organizers were taking turns reading the names of those killed into a microphone.

“… Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22

Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36

Luis S. Vielma, 22…”

Those three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol. He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack.

The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can’t speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers.

The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

And all over the country, since that fateful day that elicited the usual cries of “never again,” the killing continues: Alton Sterling and Philando Castille, by the police; Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Officer Brent Thompson and four Dallas Police officers, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Smith, Michael Krol, and Patrick Zamarripa, by a lone sniper, Micah Johnson, who himself was then killed by an armed police robot; three more police officers in Baton Rouge on July 17.

“… Montrell Jackson, 32

Matthew Gerald, 41

Brad Garafola, 45…”

And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive, I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren’t high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days.

“Stabbin’ My Bunny”: Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence

And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those “guns.” As a boy, Patrick wasn’t allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put “Stop War Toys” stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends’ houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like “protester at the Pentagon” than cops and robbers. I’ve been thinking recently about why toy guns didn’t have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood—were made to understand—what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger—the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble—had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger.

Our parents—our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists—made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest, my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called “free-fire zones” on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn’t point toy guns at each other. We didn’t pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe.

Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once—and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child’s play. It was serious business and was to be resisted.

As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don’t have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we’ve been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen) son, as he’s recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play?

When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it.

In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, “What are you doing?”

“Stabbin’ my bunny. I kilt her,” she responded matter-of-factly.

Seizing a “teaching moment” and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. “Now, your bunny is dead,” I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. “You know what happens when living things die, right? It’s forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.” Rosena and I then “buried” the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had “killed” that bunny, she could never play with it again.

About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn’t hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion.

Toys matter. We’ve put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We’ve bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we’ve accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted “this crap” out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances.

A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend’s dad had bought at Walmart. A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying “toy” was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice’s hands were still reportedly in his pockets.

Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice’s pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer’s quick trigger finger, racism, and her son’s blood.

I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice’s hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn’t have been that far from what regularly goes through my son’s head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands.

Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere

Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group. Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys “R” Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids.

I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys “R” Us displaying.

We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip.

What we found was not exactly what I expected—on many levels.

Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything—lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.)

I had finally found the Nerf “blasters,” but he wasn’t interested. “Let’s not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?”

I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKIIfor $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic “blasters” on display and marketed to kids “eight and up” seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don’t like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone—even a brain-hungry zombie—but as it turned out, I needn’t have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn’t in his wheelhouse.

Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word “gun” on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house, killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster, which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem, with “more distance, more ammo,” which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89.

By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven.

So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for “real” toy guns. No such luck. I didn’t find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn’t find an ersatz Sig Sauer either.

It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don’t seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com, where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99.

“Start Them Young”

The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys “R” Us outlet—just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and—more critically—the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we’re a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn’t keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio.

The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child’s initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns—even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers.

“Start Them Young,” a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for Thompson/Center Arms, about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: “[We’re] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters—the ultimate first gun. We’re targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.” In other words, kids are literally in their sights.

It’s a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market.

Can we be safe—any of us—in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores—from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers—had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in “economic activity” in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That’s the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths—police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: “Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence… the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.”

We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children’s play. We see violence solving problems on every screen—from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s maxim still applies: “One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.” Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it’s going off right now.

I don’t want to police my kids’ imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don’t have to. It says don’t interfere with your kid’s play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn’t real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression.

I get what they’re saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn’t real. The pow-pows don’t actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem.

We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids—particularly our boys—play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships.

I don’t want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don’t want them to get comfortable with killing either.

I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than “Pow, pow, yous are dead now!” And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people—and how much killing hurts us all."

A lot of what I hope to be doing with this blog I fear might verge on pedantry. Too much of what we observe today on the right we act as if started the day before yesterday. Always, we need to set the clock back further—as a political necessity. We have to establish deeper provenances. Or else we just reinvent, and reinvent and reinvent the wheel.

Or, in this case, reinvent the assault rifle. Some of the best coverage and reflection on December 14—the day of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary—has come from the outstanding folks at Josh Marshall’s Talking Points Memo. And part of the mix over at TPM is its reprinting of e-mails from ordinary readers, offering marvelous worm’s-eye views and analyses of the issues of the day. Sometimes, however, the worm’s-eye view only views what the worm’s eye views. On December 15, as the nature of the fearsome arsenal took inside that first grade classroom—the Bushmaster XM-15, the 10mm Glock SF and 9mm SIG Sauer handgun—was becoming apparent, but before, I think, it had been established that the mother he stole the guns from before murdering her may have been a “full-on” prepper, arming for Armageddon, TPM printed this interesting e-mail from a reader identified as SS:

I was raised with guns. More to the point, my childhood was steeped in gun lore…. I bring this up to establish my bona-fides. The gun culture that we have today in the U.S. is not the gun culture, so to speak, that I remember from my youth. It’s too simple to say that it’s “sick”; it’s more accurately an absurd fetishization. I suppose that the American Gunfighter, in all of his avatars, is inescapably fetishistic, but (to my point) somewhere along the way—maybe in, uh, 1994?—we crossed over into Something Else…. I can’t remember seeing a semi-automatic weapon of any kind at a shooting range until the mid-1980s. Even through the early 1990s, I don’t remember the idea of “personal defense” being a decisive factor in gun ownership. The reverse is true today: I have college-educated friends—all of whom, interestingly, came to guns in their adult lives—for whom gun ownership is unquestionably (and irreducibly) an issue of personal defense. For whom the semi-automatic rifle or pistol—with its matte-black finish, laser site, flashlight mount, and other “tactical” accoutrements—effectively circumscribe what’s meant by the word “gun.” At least one of these friends has what some folks—e.g., my fiancee, along with most of my non-gun-owning friends—might regard as an obsessive fixation on guns; a kind of paraphilia that (in its appetite for all things tactical) seems not a little bit creepy. The “tactical” turn is what I want to flag here. It has what I take to be a very specific use-case, but it’s used—liberally—by gun owners outside of the military, outside of law enforcement, outside (if you’ll indulge me) of any conceivable reality-based community: these folks talk in terms of “tactical” weapons, “tactical” scenarios, “tactical applications,” and so on. It’s the lingua franca of gun shops, gun ranges, gun forums and gun-oriented YouTube videos. (My god, you should see what’s out there on YouTube!) Which begs my question: in precisely which “tactical” scenarios do all of these lunatics imagine that they’re going to use their matte-black, suppressor-fitted, flashlight-ready tactical weapons? They tend to speak of the “tactical” as if it were a fait accompli; as a kind of apodeictic fact: as something that everyone—their customers, interlocutors, fellow forum members, or YouTube viewers—experiences on a regular basis, in everyday life. They tend to speak of the tactical as reality.

An interesting perspective, and I don’t question the accuracy of SS’s observations about his own experience. I do want to argue, however, that the culture he’s talking about—the one in which ordinary folk fancy themselves gunslinging avengers, rehearsing for the inevitable “tactical” scenario to come—goes back much further. It goes back at least as far as 1967, a time when there were no YouTube videos to document it—in Detroit, for example, where, as I wrote in Nixonland, that year’s historic riots touched off preparations among blacks and whites both for something approaching a race war:

A local black nationalist minister, Albert Cleage, observed to a reporter that the shooting ranges were packed and the city was way behind in processing gun registrations. “So naturally, any black man who can get ahold of a gun is getting hold of it.” A flyer circulated in white neighborhoods: “Are YOU READY NOW to PREPARE YOURSELF for the NEXT ONE? Or will you be forced to stand helplessly by because you were UN-prepared to defend your home and neighborhood against bands of armed terrorists who will murder the men and rape the women?” At an outfit called Breakthrough…organized workshops in VFW and Knights of Columbus meeting halls with representatives of the National Rifle Association, who suggested each family stockpile two hundred rounds of ammunition.

Ah, yes, the NRA. More on that later, but for now—continuing from Nixonland:

The NRA, once a hobby club for sportsman, was becoming a new kind of organization altogether. Its magazine, American Rifleman, had a new column, “The Armed Citizen,” which ran glowing accounts of of vigilantes. Connecticut senator Thomas Dodd, a conservative, had a bill pending to limit the sale of firearms through the mail. It had once seemed uncontroversial. Now white and black would-be vigilantes agreed the Dodd bill was a prelude to the confiscation of all firearms. Guns & Ammo called the bills supporters “criminal-coddling do-gooders, borderline psychotics, as well as Communists and leftists who want to lead us into the one-world welfare state.”

Sound familiar, kiddies? There’s nothing new under the wingnut sun. In any event, one of those supporters was Massachusetts’ young junior senator, Edward Moore Kennedy, whom the NRA’s American Rifleman said was following the “Communist line” for trying to outlaw the method by which his brother’s assassin had obtained the murder weapon. The tactical turn was well on its way.

Much of this information comes from a 1968 Esquire article by Garry Willls that he expanded into a marvelous book of reportage, The Second Civil War: Arming for Armageddon, and from a contemporary Time article you can read here if you’re a subscriber; sadly for history buffs and students, Time’s archives used to be, but are no longer, free.)

A bit more water would have to flow under the bridge before the transformation of the NRA into a de facto organization by, of and for for aspirant vigilantes would become complete. One historical transformation that contributed: the tactical turn on the left—among white revolutionaries and black power militants—had to die out. It began in earnest in 1966, when Black Panthers began patrolling the streets of the Sunshine State with guns. As I put it in Nixonland:

Here was one of the things that made these young men remarkable: beneath their berets and leather jackets, behind their bandoliers, they were also naively earnest. They believed implicitly in the majesty of the law. Revolutionaries in an only-in-America kind of way, they perceived themselves as a fully functioning ghetto constabulatory, apparently suprised when the response of the police—whom they called an “army of occupation”—was to wish them dead. “What are you doing with the guns?” a patrolman would ask them, a little afraid. ‘What are you doing with your gun?” Huey Newton would shoot back, and pull out one of the law books he always carried with him as other stood by with cameras and tape recorders.

(Yes again: nothing new—except the cellphone technology—under the sun.)

Huey would step out of his car and snap a live round into his chamber: California law only outlawed the carrying of loaded weapons inside a motor vehicle.

Things shifted, of course, when the Panthers started patrolling rich white neighborhoods, including the one where a right-wing supporter of Ronald Reagan in the state assembly, Don Mulford, lived. When the assembly debated Mulford’s subsequent bill to ban the carrying of loaded firearms in public places, Panthers strolled onto the floor of the state assembly fully armed. The Mulford Act passed right quick after that—and, ironically, one of the nation’s first high-profile gun control laws was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan. (We’ll see how ironic in my next post.)

Another 1960s scene of left-wing vigilante culture to contemplate: the time a pretty female revolutionary, a former Quaker who had once won a Decency Award from the Kiwanis Club, testified at the Chicago Seven trial about her practice shooting an M1 semiautomatic rifle. Why? the prosecution asked. “After Chicago I changed from being a pacifist to the realization that we had to defend ourselves. A nonviolent revolution was impossible.” She spoke, in other words, of the tactical as reality.

That left-wing world, of course, is long past. And once the gun nuts were mostly on the right, however, their long march to Capitol Hill hegemony began. In my next post, I’ll explain that process, and introduce an antihero into the story, who got involved in this business long before a lot of us knew, a little bit under the radar—long before, that is to say, he became the fortieth president of the United States.

Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes was able to kill twelve people and injure fifty-eight more with an assault rifle in July. George Zornick argues that a few key gun control regulations could have prevented the tragedy."

I was all set to write a column about the paralysis of progressives around guns: how even the ghastliest school shootings rouse few of us to more than hand-wringing and despair. After each massacre, I was planning to say, we go through the motions, writing letters to the editor, making donations to gun-control groups and politicians who promise to fight to stem the tide, but, except for the most dedicated activists, our involvement is pretty small-bore and low-key. The Million Mom March was the last major national mobilization, and that was back in 2000. A majority of Americans support gun control, but the passion—and the money, and Congress—is with the National Rifle Association. Ad Policy

The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, aren’t having any of that. Survivors of a horrific rampage by Nikolas Cruz, a former fellow student who murdered 17 and wounded more than a dozen, they’re speaking out—screaming out—in a way we haven’t seen before, confronting the politicians who have failed them.

They’re all over TV. Twitter is exploding with their rage: “You are the President of the United States, and you have the audacity to put this on Russia as an excuse. I guess I should expect that from you,” one student tweeted at Donald Trump. Senior Emma Gonzalez may have made history with her blistering speech at a rally three days after the massacre: “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this—we call BS. They say tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS.”

Plans are afoot for marches: The Douglas students are organizing a “March for Our Lives” in Washington on March 24, and others may be in the works as well. Students at a high school in Boca Raton have already staged a walkout, and maybe you saw the coverage of the students who staged a die-in outside the White House. Meanwhile, wags are writing checks for “thoughts and prayers” to NRA-funded pols. Silly, but better than rolling your eyeballs and sighing.

Maybe the kids will save us in the end—and not a moment too soon. Because too many of us well-meaning liberal/progressive adults have been cowed by the gun lobby. We’ve resigned ourselves to quasi-defeat and accepted the NRA’s framing, the mythological sanctity of “gun rights.” So we speak of “responsible” gun owners. Proud rural folk taught to shoot by Granddad. “Commonsense” gun laws. Respect for the Second Amendment. We say, “We don’t want to take away anyone’s guns.” For progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand, deferring to the NRA was, at one time, not just a perceived political necessity but also a way of signaling respect for the values of (white) rural voters. Even saintly Paul Wellstone, longtime gun-control advocate, introduced a 1997 bill watering down a ban on guns for those convicted of domestic violence.

Meanwhile, for the pro-gun crowd, it doesn’t seem to matter how many people die (over 35,000) or are injured (over 81,000) per year; or that you are vastly more likely to kill yourself or others if you have a gun in the house; or that, on average, one to two women are shot and killed each day by a past or present partner. Each atrocity is just another reason for more guns. Rush Limbaugh called just the other day for guns to be allowed in classrooms, while Education Secretary Betsy “Grizzly Bear” DeVos argued that arming teachers is an “option.” Because kids are never shot by accident when a gun falls out of a purse or pocket, and not one of the 3.6 million teachers in the land would ever use a gun to threaten a student.

The commentariat hasn’t always been much help, either. In the mainstream media, playing the pundit who takes weird and contorted “contrarian” positions is good for your career. A few years ago, libertarian writer Megan McArdle wrote a piece in The Daily Beast claiming that nothing much could be done about guns, so kids should be taught to rush the shooter: “If we drilled it into young people that the correct thing to do is for everyone to instantly run at the guy with the gun, these sorts of mass shootings would be less deadly, because even a guy with a very powerful weapon can be brought down by 8-12 unarmed bodies piling on him at once.” Let the kids handle it! McArdle, by the way, just got a column in The Washington Post.

In The New York Times, meanwhile, David Brooks worried, post-Parkland, that gun-control advocates don’t show enough “respect” to red-staters, while Ross Douthat tied himself in knots explaining why guns should be permitted but abortion banned. Douthat also defended the paranoid right-wing fantasy that guns let us resist the state “when it imposes illegitimately” (good luck with that!) and proposed to reduce gun violence by delaying the age at which citizens can buy AR-15s to 30 (for semiautomatic pistols, he suggests waiting until 25). It’s as though 64-year-old Stephen Paddock never killed 58 people in Las Vegas (and injured another 851) less than five months ago. It’s as though the vast majority of killings with guns, including mass murders, were not committed by grown-up men. Well, at least they’re not having abortions.

Enough with the craziness, and enough with the clever pundits and the quiet politicians and the defeatist citizenry, too. There’s no reason why anyone—of any age—needs to own an AR-15. In fact, maybe I shouldn’t say this, because we progressives seem to be all about winning the MAGA-hat-wearing white working class, but I don’t believe you have a right to own a gun, period. So show up for the gun-control marches and bring your friends. Follow the money—the NRA money—and work like heck to elect anti-gun candidates. The Douglas students have changed the conversation. It will take a whole lot of us to keep it going."

They want common-sense gun control, they want the assault-weapons ban to be reinstated, they want an end to the lies coming from the NRA. They want all these things, but most of all, they want their friends, classmates, and family members to stop dying. They want an end to the violence that has plagued schools, churches, movie theaters, and city streets, bringing agony in its wake. That’s why students across the country have been marching, walking out of school, and demanding change with new vigor since the shooting at Parkland, Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead in February.

The most recent action was April 20’s National School Walkout, on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School Massacre, which saw thousands of students, from Portland to Austin to Richmond, take to the streets to demand action on gun violence. Photographer Tracie Williams joined a walkout in New York City to hear from the students themselves why they are joining this growing movement. “The Polaroids took a few minutes to develop,” Williams said, “which really allowed me the time to engage with the students in a meaningful way.” Williams asked the students to reflect on how they’ve been affected by gun violence, and what they want to see in their future. She found their answers to be tinged with anger and fear, but also full of hope.

So last weekend I was in Crown Heights with a couple of friends in a deli when the door flew open and I heard pops in my left ear that shook me into sobriety. A guy in the deli said “man it’s poppin’ tonight!” That really made me think, for real gun violence and violence to end in general we need to do away with the system that facilitates it.

Vicky, 15

Schools shouldn’t be places where kids and teachers are filled with paranoia. It should be a safe space. And that’s why I’m here.

Aushna, 17

I’m here to show that I know what’s happening in the US and I CARE. I want to know what happens with gun control, considering it directly concerns me. Students and children are typically seen as a statistic when making decisions, but I wanna show that we are an educated generation!

Ethan, 15

This all just needs to stop. All the time I hear this on the news, from my mom, my friends. I wish that it could be easier to find a solution, but like many things in life, finding a solution to worldwide problems isn’t easy.

Tazha, 14

Isidore, 17

For me today was more about recognition of the past and those who were murdered. We must act now!! Young people have historically been agents of change for rights movements. We are not only the future, we are the present.

Derek, 15

I have never been directly affected by guns but I don’t want anyone else to have to go through losing a friend or loved one.

I am here because of the fact that I could have been in the same position as any other victim. And that I could potentially acquire a military-style weapon. There needs to be a change.

Here today because we live in a time where I feel unsafe, I feel scared, anxious, restless and fearful of entering public places.

I’m here to see real change.

I was at the park with my brother, sister & dog. We were about to leave and then we heard gunshots. Everyone in the park ran out. I didn’t want my younger siblings to ever experience that again.

Growing up in the Bronx, there have been times when I would be so scared to go outside because of the sounds of shots and screams coming from outside my window. That’s why I believe it’s so important, as young people, to use our voices for gun reform so that no child has to go through that.

Brand', 'Joseph Hogan', 'The Nation', 'Mychal Denzel Smith']",2016-10-18 13:09:25-04:00,https://www.thenation.com/article/why-the-gun-control-movement-fails-2/,"On the evening of November 22, 2013, as the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination drew to a close, Kenneth Mills Tucker, 19, sent a tweet letting the world know his plans for the night: “Out with the gang Dooney Wayne n Rell what’s going on tonight. My last weekend being a teenager.” It was to be Kenneth’s last weekend ever. Ad Policy This article is adapted from Gary Younge’s new book, Another Day in the Death of America.

Shortly after 3 am on November 23, a residential area of northwest Indianapolis crackled with gunfire from an automatic weapon, sending stray bullets through windows. By the time the police arrived, the scene looked like something from a David Lynch movie. A green 2002 Honda Accord had struck a utility pylon and flipped onto its roof. Of the four passengers, one had fled, two sat on a grass verge complaining of pain, and the last—Kenneth—lay motionless, having staggered about 100 feet from the car with a bullet in the left side of his torso. At 3:57 am, as the coroner noted, “Medical intervention was unsuccessful and the decedent was pronounced non-viable.”

November 23, 2013, came in the months between George Zimmerman’s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin, when the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag was coined, and Michael Brown’s fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, which was when the hashtag really took off. It was an unremarkable Saturday shortly before Thanksgiving—and as befits an unremarkable Saturday in America, 10 children and teens were shot dead. (On average, seven children are killed by guns in the United States each day, but weekends tend to be worse.)

This was the day I had picked at random to put a human face—a child’s face—on gun violence. Black, white, and Latino, over a 24-hour period, these children fell in barrios, suburbs, and rural areas; on stairwells, on street corners, and at sleepovers. All were boys: The youngest was 9 and the oldest was Kenneth, who was the second to be shot and the first to die. I spent 18 months looking for their families, friends, teachers, and coaches—anyone who knew them. By the time I completed the project, two things—beyond the personal stories—became clear.

The first was that every black parent I spoke to said that they had assumed this could happen to their son. (Of the 10 children who were killed that day, seven were black, two Latino, and one white; on an average day, five would have been white, four black, and one Latino.) “You wouldn’t really be doing your job as a parent here if you didn’t think it could happen,” one father in Newark told me. His son was shot dead on the evening of November 23. A mother in Dallas whose son was also shot that evening had assumed that her other son would be the one to get killed—but either way, she’d factored it in. In low-income communities of color, death stalks youth with relentless intent. Most of the teenagers I met who were friends of the deceased knew others who’d died; their Facebook pages and Twitter accounts are like online graveyards.

Doriane Miller, a Chicago-based primary-care physician, says that some of her patients on the South Side show symptoms of post-traumatic-stress disorder. A few years back, she started noticing a growing number of young patients presenting physical symptoms for which there was no obvious physical cause. The one thing many had in common were “RIP” tattoos, mourning friends who had been killed. But when she tried to raise it with them, they didn’t want to talk about it. “What are you going to do about it?” they’d say. “Nothing is going to change what’s happened.” Miller noted a fatalism in many of them, “a sense that this is the way it is in my life and in my community. There is a learned hopelessness around this. And so you suck it up, you man up, and you move on.”

Which brings us to the second thing that struck me while talking to these families about the 10 young deaths of November 23: When I posed an open-ended question to the victims’ parents about why they thought these tragedies kept happening, not a single one mentioned guns. When I asked a more leading question about what they specifically thought of guns, they would always be more forthcoming. Almost all of them saw the ubiquity of guns as a problem. But it did not necessarily follow that they saw getting rid of guns as a viable solution. To dwell on the innocence of “babes” and “angels” suggests there are less angelic, more deserving victims.

When the National Rifle Association held its annual convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2010, Judy Williams protested. When somebody gets shot dead in Charlotte, Williams knows about it. The organization she runs, Mothers of Murdered Offspring, has arranged vigils for murder victims for more than two decades. When MOMO started, the police would contact the group and let it know when a shooting had occurred. Now MOMO is such an institution in the city that the victims’ families usually go straight to them.

“I don’t think the Second Amendment means what they think it means,” Williams says. “You can dress it up and take it to church, but that don’t make it right that there should be no control.” If the NRA were coming back next year, I ask her, would she protest at the convention again? Williams pauses. “The reality of it is, they are not going to do away with guns in this country.… The fact is that they are so plentiful on the streets and people have them…. It’s ludicrous to think you can take guns out of people’s homes in this country.… It ain’t gonna happen.”

Having identified the problem, but without being able to envision any political remedy, Williams grudgingly understands the ubiquitous presence of guns as a banal fact of death in this country. Herein lies the central challenge for the national gun-control movement: It has rallied many good people who are doing good work, but it has failed to connect with the communities most keenly affected by gun violence. Indeed, the people who need it most—low-income communities of color—are the very ones we hear from least.

Segregation is a serious barrier to empathy. So when poor black and brown people are shot dead in areas deprived of resources, the media, the police, and a sizable portion of the political class are confirmed in their view that these are dysfunctional places where dysfunctional people live and die. It doesn’t challenge their worldview; it confirms it.

“If you’re a reader of The New York Times, then a child who is shot by a stray bullet during a gang shooting is not easy for you to imagine,” says Dan Kois, the culture editor of Slate, who in 2013 ran an online, crowdsourced death tally to record all the people who were shot daily. “Sandy Hook was easy for people to imagine.”

When there are mass shootings, the nation’s attention becomes concentrated on the issue. National gun-control advocates come to the fore and make the case for the kind of common-sense laws that would keep more Americans safe. But most people who are shot dead do not die in mass shootings—and most children and teens who are shot dead are not that young and not that white. Indeed, most people who are killed by a gun use one to kill themselves, and many of the remaining deaths come in the form of routine interpersonal violence. So the readers of The New York Times (and The Nation, for that matter) are going to have to broaden their imaginations if they’re going to mount an effective, sustainable challenge to the gun lobby.

* * * When you take these empathetic shortcuts, a lot of people get left out along the way.

Five months after Kenneth was shot, the NRA held its annual convention, this time in Indianapolis. In a cavernous exhibition hall showcasing the industry’s finest killing machines, scores of white men (few other demographics were present) aimed empty barrels into the middle distance and pondered their purchase. Elsewhere there were seminars on everything from “Wild Game Cooking: From Field to Table” to “The Men and Guns of D-Day.”

The NRA’s executive vice president and CEO, Wayne LaPierre, addressed a huge rally where he painted a dark picture of the hydra-headed threats enveloping the country, leaving no person safe and no place uncontaminated by suspicion. “We know, in the world that surrounds us, there are terrorists and home invaders and drug cartels and carjackers and knockout-gamers and rapers, haters, campus killers, airport killers, shopping-mall killers, road-rage killers, and killers who scheme to destroy our country with massive storms of violence against our power grids, or vicious waves of chemicals or disease that could collapse the society that sustains us all. I ask you: Do you trust this government to protect you? We are on our own.”

Whenever the NRA meets, protesters also gather to challenge the premise underpinning this dystopian vision: that guns make us safe. They don’t. The fact remains that the more likely you are to have a gun in the house, the more likely you are to be shot dead. Every other developed country has the same problems as the United States, to a greater or lesser degree: segregation, inequality, racism, citizens with mental-health problems. The one thing they don’t have is a huge arsenal of guns to throw on that tinder.

A few weeks before this particular NRA convention, then–New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had announced that he would spend $50 million developing a grassroots network of gun-control advocates that would bring together some of the main organizations campaigning on the issue, including Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, to form a group called Everytown for Gun Safety. The group’s press conference in Indianapolis on the day of the NRA’s convention was one of the first events it ever held.

I had hoped that I might find Kenneth’s friends or relatives, galvanized by his death, among the gun-control activists gathered that day. But looking around the room at the press conference, that seemed unlikely. In a city where one in four people is an African American and more than half the homicide victims are black, there were precious few black people among the protesters—save for a handful of women at the podium, all from other cities, who had lost their sons to gun violence. Indeed, despite Indianapolis having one of the highest homicide rates of any of the cities that I covered in my new book, Another Day in the Death of America, there didn’t seem to be anyone at the press conference who was from Indianapolis and had suffered from gun violence.

When I asked one of the organizers if I could talk to a local person, I was steered to a woman from Carmel, a wealthy nearby suburb. This woman, like many others in the room, had been spurred to action by Sandy Hook. “I have four little kids,” she told me. “When that happened, I couldn’t help thinking about my little kids in school. I’d been growing increasingly more concerned—every time a shooting happened, I thought, ‘Oh my God.’ But I didn’t really know how serious it was. Few circumstances are as great as a mom trying to protect her children.”

This emotional connection to Sandy Hook is easy to understand. The enduring image of that day—distraught children being escorted by a police officer in an orderly line, their faces contorted with panic and trauma—was searing. The sight of parents waiting anxiously to learn the fate of their kids and the pen portraits of fledgling lives so senselessly destroyed were harrowing.

And yet, if this is the connection on which the gun-control movement primarily depends, it will never achieve its potential, and it will prove a poor match for the apocalyptic narrative set out by LaPierre. To dwell on the innocence of “babes” and “angels,” as many gun-control activists did after Sandy Hook, implies that there are less innocent, less angelic victims out there more deserving of their fates.

The pursuit and promotion of the ideal “worthy” victim has long been a staple of social-justice campaigns. It can be effective at times, but it is always problematic. The argument’s center of gravity shifts from “This shouldn’t happen to anyone” to “This shouldn’t happen to people like this.” Sandy Hook may clarify the obscenity and the injustice of people being shot—but when you take these empathetic shortcuts, a lot of people get left out along the way.

Almost an hour after Kenneth was killed in Indianapolis, 17-year-old Stanley Taylor was killed in Charlotte following an altercation at a gas station. Mario Black, a school-behavior specialist, knew Stanley well: He’d been his teacher and, years earlier, had gone to school with Stanley’s mother. Just a couple months before the teen’s death, Black had set up the Million Youth March of Charlotte, after his own young cousin was shot. “We want to bring positive things to the community as it relates to people who are 13 to 25 years old,” he told me. “Because we always hear the negative. There’s always someone in that age group who’s getting gunned down here.”

He had plans to hold a huge family-day festival for the city’s youth and was seeking funding and support from churches and local leaders, but he was frustrated by the response. “The same people who are talking about it, won’t do anything about it,” he said. “We need donations. Everything we’re doing is coming out of our pockets. So we’re at a standstill.” The group’s first community give-back day—a family event with toys for the needy and barbers providing free haircuts—was dedicated to Stanley and his mother, Toshiba, who received a candle in his honor. When I met Black a year later, at the second give-back day, he was still struggling to get the idea off the ground. That day was dedicated to Ajewan Jones, one of Stanley’s best friends, who’d been shot dead six months after him. As I write, the streets of Charlotte are full of demonstrators protesting the police shooting of Keith Scott, and right-wing commentators are asking why no one in the black community cares about “black-on-black” violence.

Many of the kids who died during the 24 hours covered in my book were raised in tough circumstances and had messy lives. Moreover, communities of color are criminalized in a manner that makes “innocence” itself a notion that cannot simply be taken at face value. So long as the gun-control narrative stops with protecting innocents and babes, it’s difficult to see who will ever speak out for these kids.

Take Kenneth. More than two years after he died, two of the people in the car with him that night had warrants issued for their arrest in connection with a gang that trafficked guns and drugs in northern Indianapolis. We don’t know whether Kenneth was involved in that. We do know that eight months before he died, he was arrested for driving while black—or, more specifically, he was stopped for slowing down but “failing to come to a full and complete stop” while approaching a stop sign. The officer who pulled him over said he smelled marijuana, but could only find a pipe with marijuana residue in it, and so Kenneth was charged with “possession of paraphernalia.”

This is how large numbers of young people of color in the United States are caught up in the criminal-justice system—with a dragnet. It is also in no small part why their families fail to connect with the gun-control movement. “Sometimes, in the past, that has held organizations back,” says Julia Browder Eichorn, an African-American gun-control activist who lives in Columbus, Ohio. “To put someone out there who has had less than a stellar lifestyle—the opposition is going to tear that apart. They’re already calling our children, who have done nothing, ‘thugs.’ That’s a huge piece of why you don’t see more moms of color in this movement. Maybe they knew their kids were doing these things and they didn’t stop them. Maybe they just prayed nothing would happen to them. We have to stand with that mom who maybe didn’t make the best choice, or maybe she made the best choice that she could, but sadly her kid’s not here anymore.” Ready to Fight Back?

In the absence of that explicit solidarity, the national gun-control movement not only distances itself from the communities that would give its message and campaigns a sense of urgency, but can even appear to stand in opposition to them. When gun-control advocates emphasize the dangers of guns getting easily into the hands of “criminals”—as though the criminal-justice system is a neutral space—they move from gun control to social control: The central issue becomes not the gun, but the person wielding it.

None of the family members I spoke with raised the Second Amendment one way or the other. Almost all of them believed that guns were too readily available; none believed there was anything that could be done about it. Only one mother, according to her Facebook posts, had developed any real affinity with the gun-control movement. Otherwise, it was as though each death took place in helpless, hopeless isolation—a private, discrete tragedy complete unto itself. The broader context of race and poverty was clear to many. But when I told them of other families who had lost children that day, all seemed genuinely shocked that their grief overlapped in real time with that of others.

It’s as though they had lost a loved one in a war without any clear purpose, end, or enemy; a war they could do nothing about; a war that they long knew existed but from which they hoped by luck, judgment, discipline, and foresight they might be able to protect their kids; a war that is generally acknowledged in the abstract but rarely addressed in the concrete; a war that took their children but offered them no allies or community in their grief; a war they knew was taking place elsewhere, but experienced alone, as though it were happening only to them—when in fact it is happening to America. Every day.

Guns. In a country with more than 300 million of them, a country that’s recently been swept up in a round of protests over the endless killing sprees they permit, you’d think I might have had more experience with them. Ad Policy

As it happens, I’ve held a gun only once in my life. I even fired it. I was in perhaps 10th grade and enamored with an Eagle Scout who loved war reenactments. On weekends, he and his friends camped out, took off their watches to get into the spirit of the War of 1812, and dressed in homemade muslin underclothes and itchy uniforms. I was there just one weekend. Somehow my pacifist parents signed off on letting their daughter spend the day with war reenactors. Someone lent me a period gown, brown and itchy and ill-fitting. We women and girls spent an hour twisting black gunpowder into newspaper scraps. I joked that the newspaper was anachronistic—the previous week’s Baltimore Sun—but no one laughed.

A man came by with a long gun, an antique, resting on the shoulder of his jerkin to collect our “bullets” and he must have read the gun terror written on my face.

“Wanna give it a try?” he asked.

“Sure,” I said, stumbling to my feet, pushing my gown out of the way, and trying to act like I didn’t have broken-rifle patches, symbols of the pacifist War Resisters League, all over my real clothes. I felt a surge of adrenaline as I took the heavy weapon in my way-too-small hands. He showed me how to wrestle it into position, aim it, and fire. There were no bullets, just one of my twists of powder, but it made a terrifying noise. I shrieked and came close to dropping the weapon.

And there it was: the beginning, middle, and end of my love affair with guns—less than a minute long. Still, my hands seemed to tingle for the rest of the afternoon and the smell of gunpowder lingered in my hair for days.

Got Guns?

One in four Americans now owns a gun or lives in a household with guns. So how strange that, on that day in the late 1980s, I saw a real gun for the first and last time. I grew up in inner-city Baltimore. I’ve worked at soup kitchens and homeless shelters all over the East Coast and stayed at dozens of Catholic Worker Houses around the country—Providence, Camden, Syracuse, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles—every one in a “tough” neighborhood. I lived in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the mid-1990s, before you could get a $4 coffee or a zucchini scone on Van Brunt Street, before there was an Ikea or a Fairway in the neighborhood. All those tough communities, those places where President Trump imagines scenes of continual “American carnage,” and I’ve never again seen a gun. Current Issue View our current issue

Still, people obviously own them and use them in staggering numbers and in all sorts of destructive ways. Sensing that they’re widespread beyond my imagination, my husband and I have started asking the parents of our kids’ school friends if they own guns when we arrange play dates or sleepovers. We learned this from the father of a classmate of my 11-year-old stepdaughter Rosena. The dad called to make the arrangements for his son to come over after school. We talked logistics and food allergies and then he paused. “Now, I am sorry if this is intrusive,” he said, “but I do ask everyone: Do you keep guns in your house?” He sounded both uncomfortable and resolute.

I almost choked on my urge to say, “Don’t you know who I am?” In certain odd corners at least, my last name, Berrigan, is still synonymous with muscular pacifism and principled opposition to violence and weaponry of just about any kind, right up to the nuclear kind. But that dad probably didn’t even know my last name and it probably wouldn’t have meant a thing to him if he had. He just wanted to make sure his son was going to be safe and I was grateful that he asked—rather than just assuming, based on our Volvo-driving, thrift-shop-dressing, bumper-sticker-sporting lifestyle, that we didn’t.

“You know how kids are,” he said after I assured him that we were a gun-free household. “They’ll be into everything.”

And right he is. Kids are “into everything,” which is undoubtedly why so many of them end up with guns in their hands or bullets in their bodies.

“Do you question everyone about their guns?” I asked the dad. He replied that he did and, if they answered yes, then he’d ask whether those weapons were locked away, whether the ammunition was stored separately, and so on.

“Thank you so much. I think we need to start doing that too,” I said as our conversation was ending and indeed I have ever since.

It’s a subject worth raising, however awkward the conversation that follows may be, because 2 million kids in this country live in homes where guns are not stored safely and securely. So far this year, 59 kids have been hurt in gun accidents of one sort or another. On average, every 34 hours in our great nation a child is involved in an unintentional shooting incident, often with tragic consequences.

The National Rifle Association’s classic old argument, “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” takes on a far harsher edge when you’re talking about a 7-year-old accidentally killing his 9-year-old brother with a gun they found while playing in an empty neighboring house in Arboles, Colorado.

Two weeks after we learn this new parenting life skill in this oh-so-new century of ours, my husband Patrick is on the phone with a mom arranging a sleepover for Rosena. I hear him fumble his way through the gun question. From his responses, I assume the mom is acknowledging that they do have guns. Then there’s the sort of long, awkward silence that seems part and parcel of such conversations before Patrick finally says, “Well, okay, thanks for being so honest. I appreciate that.”

He hangs up and looks at me. “They do keep guns for hunting and protection, but they’re locked up and out of sight,” he tells me. “The mom says that the kids have never tried to get at the guns, but she understands the dangers.” (He had heard in her voice apology, embarrassment, and worry that the guns might mean no sleepover.)

I grimaced in a way that said: I don’t think Rosena should go, and he responded that he thought she should. The two of them then had a long conversation about what she should do and say if she sees a gun. She slept over and had a great time. A lesson in navigating difference, trusting our kid, and phew… no guns made an appearance. And we know more about our neighbors and our community.

Anything Can Be a Gun

My son Seamus, 5, received an Easter basket from a family friend. He was happy about the candy, of course, and immediately smitten with the stuffed bunny, but he was over the moon about what he called his new “carrot gun.” It wasn’t a toy gun at all, but a little basket that popped out a light ball when you pressed a button.

The idea was that you’d catch the ball, put it back in, and do it again. But that wasn’t the game my kids played. They promptly began popping it at each other. His little sister Madeline, four, was in tattle mode almost immediately. “Mom, Seamus is shooting me with his carrot gun!”

“Mom, Mom, Mom,” he responded quickly, “it’s a pretend play gun, not a real play gun. It’s okay.” He made popping noises with his mouth and held his hand as if he were grasping a genuine forbidden toy gun. It was an important distinction for him. He’d been a full-throated participant in the March for Our Lives in Boston on March 24, chanting with the rest of us “What do we want? Gun control! When do we want it? NOW!” for four hours straight.

At the march, he pointed out that all the police officers managing traffic and the flow of people were wearing guns on their belts.

“I see a gun, Mom,” he kept saying, or “That police officer has a gun, Mom.”

Repeatedly, he noticed the means to kill—and then four days after that huge outpouring of youth-led activism for gun security, Stephon Clark was indeed gunned down in his grandmother’s backyard in Sacramento, California. The police officers who shot him were looking for someone who had been breaking car windows in the neighborhood and they fired 20 shots into the dark in his direction. The independent autopsy found that he had been hit eight times, mostly in his back. Clark turned out to be holding only a cell phone, though the police evidently mistook it for a tool bar, which could have done them no harm from that distance, even if he had wielded it as a weapon.

Maybe the police saw a weapon the same way my 5-year-old son sees one. He can make a stick or just about anything else, including that little basket, into a “gun” and so evidently can the police. Police officers have killed black men and boys holding pipes, water hose nozzles, knives, and yes, toy guns, too.

Where Does the Violence Come From?

Parkland (17 killed, 14 wounded). Newtown (28 killed, 2 wounded). Columbine (15 killed, 21 injured). School shootings are now treated as a structural part of our lives. They have become a factor in school architecture, administrator training, city and state funding, and security plans. The expectation that something terrible will happen at school shapes the way that 3- and 4-year-olds are introduced to its culture. Part of their orientation now involves regular “shelter in place” and “secure-school” drills.

At my daughter’s preschool, the kids are told that they’re hiding from rabid raccoons, those animals standing in for marauding, disaffected white boys or men roaming the halls armed. As parents, we need to do more than blindly accept that these traumatic exercises are preparing our kids for the worst and helping them survive. Kids are vulnerable little beings and there are countless dangers out there, but they have a one-in-600 million chance of dying in a school shooting. We endanger them so much more by texting while driving them home from school.

After every episode of violence at a school—or in the adult world at a church, night club, concert, movie theater, or workplace like San Bernardino’s Inland Regional Center or the YouTube headquarters—there’s always a huge chorus of “why?” Pundits look at the shooter’s history, his (it’s almost always a guy) trauma, and whatever might be known about his mental health. They speculate on his (or, in the rare case of those YouTube shootings, her) political leanings, racial hatreds, and ethnic background. The search for whys can lead to hand wringing about hard-driving rock music or nihilistic video games or endemic bullying—all of which could indeed be factors in the drive to kill significant numbers of unsuspecting people—but never go far enough or deep enough.

Two questions are answered far too infrequently: Where do the guns come from? Where does violence come from?

Guns of all sizes and description are manufactured and sold in this country in remarkable numbers, far more than can be legally absorbed in our already gun-saturated land, so thousands of them move instead into the gray and black markets. Evidence of this trend shows up repeatedly in Mexico, where 70 percent of the weapons seized in crimes between 2009 and 2014 turned out to be made in El Norte. We have an estimated 300 million guns in this country, making us first by far in the world in gun ownership and some of them couldn’t conceivably be used for “hunting.” They are military-style weapons meant to tear human flesh and nothing but that—like the AR-15 that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz legally bought and used in his grim Parkland shooting spree.

This country, in other words, is a cornucopia of guns, which—honestly, folks—doesn’t have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment.

Where does the violence come from? I’ve already shared my inexperience with guns. Now, let me add to it my inexperience with violence. I don’t know what it’s like to have to react in a split second to or flee an advancing perpetrator. No one has ever come at me with a gun or a knife or a pipe, or anything else for that matter. And I count myself lucky for that. In a nation in which, in 2016 alone, 14,925 people were killed due to gun violence and another 22,938 used a gun to kill themselves, it’s a significant thing to be able to say.

And yet, I know that I’m the product of violence (as well as the urge, in my own family, to protest and stop it): the violence of white privilege, the violence of American colonialism, the violence of American superpowerdom on a global scale… and that’s no small thing. It’s a lot easier to blame active-shooter scenarios on poor mental-health screening than on growing up in a world layered with the threat of pervasive violence.

Power is about never having to say you’re sorry, never being held accountable. And that’s hardly just a matter of police officers shooting black men and boys; it’s about the way in which this country is insulated from international opprobrium by its trillion-dollar national security state, a military that doesn’t hesitate to divide the whole world into seven US “commands,” and a massive, planet-obliterating nuclear arsenal.

And don’t think that any of that’s just a reflection of Trumpian bombast and brutality either. That same sense of never having to say you’re sorry at a global level undergirded Barack Obama’s urbane dispassion, George Bush Junior’s silver spoon cluelessness, Bill Clinton’s folksy accessibility, George Bush Senior’s patrician poshness, Ronald Reagan’s aura of Hollywood charm, and Jimmy Carter’s Southern version of the same. We’re talking about weapons systems designed to rain down a magnitude of terror unimaginable to the Nikolas Cruzes, Dylann Roofs, and Adam Lanzas of the world.

And it doesn’t even make us safe! All that money, all that knowledge, all that power put into the designing and displaying of weapons of mass destruction and we remain remarkably vulnerable as a nation. After all, in schools, homes, offices, neighborhoods across the country, we are being killed by our kids, our friends, our lovers, our police officers, our crumbling roads and bridges, our derailing trains. And then, of course, there are all those guns. Guns meant to destroy. Guns beyond counting.

So what might actually make us safer? After all, people theoretically buy the kind of firepower you might otherwise use only in war and pledge allegiance to the US war machine in search of some chimera of safety. And yet, despite that classic NRA line—“The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun”—are we truly safer in a nation awash in such weaponry with so many scrambling in a state of incipient panic to buy yet more? Are my kids truly on the way to a better life as they practice cowering in their cubbies in darkened classrooms for fear of invading rabid “raccoons”?

Don’t you think that true security lies not in our arming ourselves to the teeth against other people—that is, in our disconnection from them—but in our connection to them, to the web of mutuality that has bound societies, small and large, for millennia? Don’t you think that we would be more secure and so much less terrified if we found ways to acknowledge and share our relative abundance to meet the needs of others? In a world awash in guns and fears, doesn’t our security have to involve trust and courage and always be (at best) a work in progress?

As for me, I’m tackling that work in progress in whatever ways I can—with my neighbors, my town, my husband, and most of all my children, educating them in the ways violence scars and all those weapons just increase our journey into hell, never delivering the security they promise."

Within a day of the massacre of men, women, and children in a Texas church, President Donald Trump made three claims. First, he maintained it wasn’t a guns problem. Second, he said the shooter was stopped by someone else with a gun. Third, he blamed mental illness. Together the statements made one thing very clear: There is no amount of violence or sympathetic victims that will ever shame today’s Republican Party to take action on guns. Ad Policy

The details are horrific. The details are always horrific. The shooter, a white male with a history of domestic violence, went in to First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, armed with an AR-15 style rifle. He opened fire. Victims included the 14-year-old daughter of the pastor, a 72-year-old, numerous young children, and a pregnant woman. One family hid in a bathroom, shots penetrating the walls. An 8-year-old ducked beneath a pew as his brother and two sisters were shot. After the killer had murdered 26 people, injured 20 more, and spread trauma throughout his community, he left the church. There he encountered at least one armed civilian, dropped his rifle, fled in his car, crashed, and seems to have shot himself in the head. A “good guy with a gun” did not stop the incident. The broken bodies lying in the church and the trauma of the survivors demonstrate clearly that the incident was not halted. Trump, unsurprisingly, claimed that “fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction.”

Trump’s comments on mental health are typical of Republican response to violence. He characterized the killer as a “very deranged individual” who has a “mental health problem at the highest level.” This was also his and Representative Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) response after the Las Vegas shooting. Republicans (and some Democrats) have been making comments like this for decades. On Monday in Japan, though, Trump added, “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country—as do other countries—but this isn’t a guns situation.”

That middle clause, “as do other countries,” is quite the tell. Trump regularly runs his mouth freely, revealing the subtext that lies beneath the usual GOP talking points. Trump isn’t wrong. Many countries have not adequately met the mental-health needs of its population. But linking acts of violence to people with mental health is gross stigmatization that belies the data. People with mental illness are vastly more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators of it. Related Article 4 Disabled People Dead in Another Week of Police Brutality David M. Perry

Still, let’s take Trump at his word here and agree that around the world other countries also have people with unmet mental-health needs. And yet among 171 nations of the world, the United States is the clear leader in mass shootings. It’s the guns. Of course it’s the guns.

Stigma is dangerous. When we spread the lie that mental illness leads to perpetrating mass murder, we push people to closet their conditions. Mental health, like all forms of health, requires maintenance and support. Secrecy just leads to vulnerability and self-harm. Even worse, the GOP, led by now-disgraced Representative Tim Murphy (R-PA), has frequently used high-profile incidents of violence to call for forced medication and easing the requirements for involuntary commitment. In other words, the GOP is more than willing to strip away liberties from people with disabilities in order to avoid talking about guns.

Just as we were processing the carnage in Texas, the news broke that Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo was crediting Stephen Paddock’s mass murder in Las Vegas on the killer’s becoming depressed after losing money. When white men kill, law enforcement, media, and elected officials seek out explanatory mental-health-based narratives to avoid talking about guns. Notice that the recent violence in New York generated no such talk, as the president and his lackeys quickly launched into anti-Islamic and anti-immigrant diatribes. This kind of prejudicial discourse is typical when people of color commit violence. Current Issue View our current issue

The emphasis on mental health is merely a craven deflection from the need to talk about guns. Our mental-health system needs a lot of help, though not to stop gun violence (only 3 to 5 percent of violent acts involve people with psychiatric disabilities, who otherwise make up about 18 percent of the population). The GOP spent the summer trying to defund community and medical-health supports in their attacks on health care.

Trump’s little slip, “as do other countries,” makes his agenda transparent. The problem is guns; Republicans know it; and they’re not going to do anything about it. The GOP has decided that the murder of children in church is a reasonable price to pay for the continued support of billionaire gun merchants and the NRA.

To stop, or even slightly slow the violence, we are going to have to elect different politicians."

In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, gun sales resumed a years-long sales slump that started before Barack Obama entered the White House. Stocks in all the major gun companies plummeted after the election, and sales have not come close to returning to Obama-era heights. Ad Policy

One way the gun industry has tried to revamp its image and boost sales is by presenting guns, particularly small handguns, as effective, common-sense tools for self-protection. Many gun manufacturers have shifted from heavily marketing military-style assault weapons to instead rolling out small handguns that are explicitly pitched as citizen self-defense weapons. This campaign has been aimed heavily at potential female customers—the National Rifle Association has a “NRA Women” program, which offers free training to “female gun enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels,” and on NRATV, there is a popular series called Armed & Fabulous. The NRA recently hired Dana Loesch as a spokesperson in an effort not to have only grizzled old men like Charlton Heston and Wayne LaPierre as the public faces of the group.

At the 2016 Republican National Convention, the NRA’s top lobbyist, Chris Cox, used his valuable prime-time speaking slot to drive this very pitch home. “Imagine a young mother at home with her baby, when a violent predator kicks the door in,” he said. “The police will do their best to get there quickly, but their average response time is 11 minutes. So the question is, should she be able to defend herself with a firearm in her own home? Of course.”

That view of guns—as a protection blanket for women—has never resembled reality, and a new study underscores how wrong it is. In 2015, women were over 100 times more likely to be murdered by a man with a gun than to use it to kill a man in self-defense.

The Violence Policy Center looked at FBI crime data from 2015, the most recent year available. It’s the first analysis of the 2015 data on female homicide victims. The study found there were 328 justifiable homicides committed by private citizens that year, and only 16 involved a woman killing a man with a gun. Conversely, there were 1,686 cases where a woman was murdered by a man with a gun. Those are only single-victim, single-offender incidents, and exclude mass shootings, so if anything it’s an undercount. (Domestic abuse that turns deadly can end up claiming many victims beyond the targeted woman, like the incident in Texas this month where a gunman showed up at his estranged wife’s house and killed her and eight other people who were attending a football party.)

Contrary to Cox’s formulation of a random, armed bad guy crashing through the living-room window, a vast majority of those 1,686 homicides were domestic in nature. Ninety-three percent of the female victims were murdered by a man they knew, and 64 percent were wives or “intimate acquaintances” of the man that killed them. (This does not include ex-girlfriends; the FBI does not break that down.)

Critics might point out that this study counts only justifiable homicides but not incidents where a woman may have otherwise used a gun to defend herself without killing the male attacker—either by non-fatally wounding him, or just waving the gun around. That’s a fair point, though on the flip side, this also doesn’t count the women who are non-fatally injured by men with guns, nor intimidated by them. Current Issue View our current issue

The study’s homicide-to-homicide comparison just buttresses a lot of social-science research that unambiguously states that the introduction of a firearm to a home only increases the chance someone will be killed, particularly a woman. A 1997 study in the Archives of Internal Medicine looked at women’s risk factors for violent death in their home, and found that the risk increased threefold when a gun was present inside the house. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that, not surprisingly, domestic incidents where a gun is used means it’s 12 times more likely that someone dies.

The high rate at which women are killed by guns is a uniquely American problem. In 25 high-income countries, America accounts for only 32 percent of the female population. But they are 84 percent of all female firearm homicide victims.

Sensible changes to the law could at least mitigate this violence, particularly since so much of it stems from domestic violence. But Republicans in Congress and the NRA have long opposed any such measures. In 2015, Senators Debbie Stabenow and Chuck Schumer introduced a measure that would, among other things, add “abusive dating partners, individuals under a court-imposed restraining order and convicted stalkers” to the list of people who cannot pass a federal background check for gun purchase. It did not become law. This year, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Representative Debbie Dingell introduced similar legislation in the Senate and House that would make people convicted of misdemeanor stalking crimes ineligible to purchase guns. Neither bill is expected to receive a vote."

Representative Elizabeth Esty’s blueprint for her first term in Congress changed as soon as Adam Lanza rampaged through Sandy Hook Elementary School. Elected five weeks earlier and not yet sworn in, she was suddenly thrust into a calamity that convulsed the nation. Ad Policy

Esty was already familiar with how outside events—shocking crimes in particular—could change a political career in unforeseen ways. As a freshman in the Connecticut Legislature in 2009, she voted to abolish the state’s death penalty. But as her first term unfolded, so did the trial of a man accused and then convicted of a brutal home invasion in her hometown of Cheshire. A woman and her young daughters were raped and murdered; they were apparently chosen at random by two career criminals.

The crime made international news and gripped the state, and Esty’s vote became an issue in her re-election campaign. M. Jodi Rell, the Republican governor at the time, vetoed the Legislature’s anti-capital-punishment bill and cited the Cheshire murders as the reason. A death-penalty verdict was handed down the same week as the election, and Esty lost her seat by two points.

But all of that was far from Esty’s mind on the morning of December 14, 2012, as she sat in a classroom at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Freshly elected to represent Connecticut’s Fifth Congressional District on a platform of bread-and-butter issues, Esty and some forty other incoming members of the House were receiving a training session on using social media.

Around 10 am, a Harvard staffer tapped her on the shoulder and said there’d been a school shooting in Connecticut. There was some initial confusion about exactly what had happened, and the staffer kept saying “Newton,” like the city outside of Boston, so Esty wasn’t sure even that the incident had occurred in her state. But it soon became clear that there had been an appalling number of deaths, and that it had happened in Newtown—right in her district.

“At that point, I just left the room, went to my hotel room, threw my things in a suitcase and drove straight to Newtown,” Esty told me over lunch there late this summer. The interview had been undramatic and upbeat to this point, but the tears began to well in her eyes. She described calling her mother and her minister on the two-hour drive home.

Esty had no staff and no experience representing the area in Congress, but she went directly to the command center at the firehouse adjacent to the school. Inside, some of her soon-to-be constituents were facing an agonizing wait as authorities methodically identified the twenty students and six teachers who had been killed by a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle. “Families were being notified one by one,” Esty said. “And I could hear them screaming in the other room.”

Soon, the whole world was there. “You could not walk two feet without hitting a national or international anchorperson. There were satellite dishes; there were gawkers. It was beyond horrific,” she said.

Once in Congress, Esty became a dogged proponent of tougher gun laws. She was named a vice chair of the Congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. She co-sponsored a raft of gun-violence prevention bills in the House, including the only gun-control measure to pass Congress after Newtown—a bill to provide $19.5 million to improve the federal background-check system, which passed this spring as an amendment to a Justice Department appropriations bill.

But twenty-one months after the shootings and with the midterm elections approaching, Esty is facing a situation that would have seemed absurd and even impossible in those days: her opponent, Mark Greenberg, opposes new federal gun laws.

Newtown was supposed to change everything—and for a moment, it appeared it had. Support inside Connecticut for stricter gun laws approached 60 percent in the months after the shooting. In April 2013, a package of reforms touted as the “toughest gun laws in the country” passed the Legislature with wide bipartisan support and was signed into law by Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy. But now, most polls show Malloy trailing his Republican opponent, Tom Foley, who opposes new gun laws. Foley won the GOP primary after receiving the backing of state gun-rights groups, defeating a fellow Republican and state senator who helped shepherd the post-Newtown gun laws. As for Greenberg, while he doesn’t crusade on the issue, he doesn’t hide his opposition to gun-law reform either—and while Esty is expected to hold her seat, she is one of twenty-five Democrats that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee considers at risk of an upset.

* * *

It certainly didn’t look like things would turn out this way. In the days after the shootings, almost everyone involved in the gun debate anticipated big changes. The National Rifle Association’s Wayne LaPierre may have blustered publicly against gun control, but as The New York Times later reported, the NRA’s top lobbyists were negotiating with the White House and Senate Democrats on background-check legislation under the assumption that it was inevitable. And the popular consensus was that tougher restrictions were on the way: FBI data showed that more guns were purchased on December 21, 2012, than on any preceding day, as people worried that it might be their last chance to buy whatever firearms they wanted.

But persistent misinformation and agitation by far-right members of Congress and gun groups even more rigid than the NRA slowly doomed the effort. Republicans who said they’d support background-check legislation started to waver, often citing bogus fears of a national gun registry that the bill explicitly forbade. The NRA began feeling the heat from groups like Gun Owners of America, which urged a no-compromise approach, and its lobbyists dropped out of the negotiations. By the time the bill reached the Senate floor, everybody knew it wouldn’t pass. And with no bipartisan Senate bill on his desk, House Speaker John Boehner was free to never talk about reform again.

The 2014 midterm elections reflect the same political indifference. In an election cycle with no overriding theme, gun control occupies a place somewhere alongside farm subsidies or the Export-Import Bank as an issue on the campaign trail. There are 435 House seats and thirty-six Senate seats being contested this fall, and aside from a few stray examples, it’s shocking how few candidates are talking about gun control. And most of the ones talking are opposed to reform: in West Virginia, for example, Republican Representative Shelley Moore Capito, who is running for the state’s open Senate seat against Democrat Natalie Tennant, took out a television ad proclaiming that “Obama tries to limit our rights to own a gun, and Tennant takes to the streets to campaign for him.”

Using Obama as a means to link Tennant to gun control is a curiously circuitous route; Tennant explicitly supports expanded background checks, which would seem a much more direct target. There are reasons, perhaps, for Moore Capito to tread lightly here: the Senate’s universal background-check legislation was famously co-sponsored by the state’s other US senator, Joe Manchin, who has remained relatively popular despite the millions of dollars in NRA ads targeting him during and after the Senate debate.

Does this mean that Tennant, for her part, is eager to engage on the issue? Not really. She makes her position on background checks clear on her website, but hasn’t made it a campaign issue.

This is the state of gun-control politics in 2014: candidates from both sides are approaching the issue with extreme caution. In Virginia, Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie makes only a passing mention of opposing gun control on his website. When the NRA blanketed Virginia with a pro-Gillespie mailer in late August, promising that the candidate would “strongly oppose and fight against [President Obama’s] anti-gun nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court,” area newspapers immediately speculated that the mailer “could have unintended consequences for Gillespie” as he seeks to win over moderate Virginia voters. But the incumbent, Senator Mark Warner, isn’t saying much about his vote for background checks either.

Indeed, it’s primarily outside groups that are inserting gun control into the midterm elections. The NRA and its gargantuan $250 million budget will surely be a big player once again, but Newtown spurred the creation of new (and well-funded) pro-reform groups. That’s the one bright spot in a political landscape that is otherwise frustrating for many activists and gun-violence victims: outside pro-reform groups are finally battling the previously unchallenged power of the NRA and learning how to target voters in more sophisticated ways. On the state level, there are bold ballot initiatives and signs of a real sea change on gun laws. And perhaps most important, what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School may have transformed a casual pro-gun-control constituency into a real political movement.

* * *

I met Pia Carusone at the Washington, DC, office of Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS), which was founded by former Representative Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, two months after the Sandy Hook shooting. Their office has fourteen staffers, mostly young people, and hopes to raise $20 million for the midterms. The conference room we sat in was covered with front-page articles about mass shootings from newspapers around the country. They all shared an eerie similarity: screaming headlines and pictures of people weeping or standing agape with hands over their mouths.

Carusone is the group’s senior advisor, and she acknowledged that candidates seemed loath to mention gun control this year. But that’s what she expected, she said: “This first cycle for us, and the first few years for us, we knew were going to be as much about educating the folks that are supporters of gun-violence prevention—educating them on how to talk about it, how to feel comfortable. Not just the elected officials, but the whole sort of infrastructure that stands behind those people: the media consultants, everybody.”

In the meantime, ARS is trying to figure out which voters should be targeted on the issue of gun control and how best to do it. Ninety percent of the public supports expanded background checks, but who among them would vote on that issue alone?

After sifting through the results of the 2013 statewide races in Virginia, Carusone thinks that ARS might have an answer: not only did independent women and non-college-educated women voters swing those contests; they were uniquely receptive to messages in favor of gun-law reform. (Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe, now the state’s governor, didn’t shy away from talking about gun control.) “For that group, it was a very big motivating issue,” Carusone said. And this could be big in the midterms: in the hotly contested state of North Carolina, for example, ARS found that almost 90 percent of suburban women favor background checks.

Accordingly, ARS has ramped up its outreach to women on specific issues like the links between guns, domestic abuse and violence against women. One of the group’s first ad buys, in the Arizona district that Giffords used to represent, features a mom whose daughter was shot dead “by a man with a criminal record.” The group has also been working to inform female voters that the gun lobby’s efforts to expand open-carry laws would allow weapons in libraries and daycare centers, among other places.

If this strategy of micro-targeting is successful in the midterms, ARS believes that it could lay the groundwork to make gun reform an even bigger issue in elections to come. “Let’s say [Colorado Senator] Mark Udall…doesn’t mention word one on gun safety,” Carusone said. “It would seem as though it didn’t really play a big factor. If I can show you that we moved a substantial amount of voters to the polls on behalf of him, on behalf of this issue—we could be the margin. If he wins by two points or something, and I could show you we moved two points, that would be a success for me.”

Other gun-law reform groups seem to be on the same page, if perhaps taking a more sledgehammer approach. Everytown for Gun Safety, an umbrella group that grew out of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns, took out a dramatic television ad in July targeting three Republican senators. In it, a man breaks into his ex-girlfriend’s house and points a gun at her head as she clutches a baby. A gunshot is heard as the screen cuts to black. The ad is tied to a Senate bill that would prevent domestic abusers from passing a background check for gun purchases. (Only spouses convicted of stalking are currently prohibited under federal law, not ex-boyfriends or domestic partners.)

The pro-reform strategy doesn’t always work—as is often the case with outside money, it can end up tainting the recipient. Bloomberg, through his Super PAC, wanted to make a splash in a local contest this summer and dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars into the Milwaukee County sheriff’s race. The controversial incumbent, David Clarke, had been running headline-grabbing ads advising residents to arm themselves instead of calling 911. Clarke won, and he quickly credited the backlash against big-city Bloomberg for the win: “He came in and thought he could spread a few hundred thousand dollars around to take a prized catch away,” Clarke declared on Fox News the morning after the election. “He didn’t understand the political climate on the ground here in Milwaukee County.”

But overall, there’s a real sense of optimism among the reformers, most of whom join a weekly conference call, hosted by Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, to plot strategy—a regular occurrence since at least the 2013 Senate debate. “I think we’re getting there. We’re in at the ground floor of this movement,” Carusone said. “We always knew it was gonna be a long, hard haul, but this is just not going to stop. That’s the cynical calculation the other side is making.”

* * *

An untold story of the post-Newtown debate over gun control is how much happened at the state level: while the national media deemed gun control impossible after Congress failed to act, eight states made significant or sweeping changes to gun laws, while only four states significantly weakened them, according to analysis by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Mark Follman at Mother Jones crunched the numbers and found that more than half of all Americans now live in a state with stronger gun control laws than existed before Newtown.

The 2014 midterms could bring about even more change. In Washington State, a ballot initiative to institute universal background checks is enjoying overwhelming support among voters. The campaign to pass the initiative has raised more than $7 million, including seven-figure donations from both Everytown and former Microsoft chair Bill Gates. A pro-gun group pushing another ballot initiative that would essentially negate any new background-check laws has raised only $1 million.

In Illinois, voters will decide on a nonbinding referendum calling for the state to expand background checks and to outlaw assault weapons. In Nevada, activists are gathering signatures to put a binding background-checks initiative on the ballot in 2016. This could become a crucial national focal point, since Nevada will be hotly contested by presidential candidates in both the primary and general elections that year.

Many people are getting involved outside the electoral and legislative arenas as well by joining a wide-ranging movement to keep guns out of public spaces. Chipotle, Target, Chili’s, Sonic and others have all agreed to ask customers not to bring guns into their stores. This movement counters a long-running NRA strategy of expanding the places that people can have guns by promoting open-carry laws. I met with Po Murray of the Newtown Action Alliance inside a Starbucks just up the road from the site of Sandy Hook Elementary School, which has since been demolished. Last year, local guns-rights groups planned to stage a pro-gun event there—but the Newtown Action Alliance persuaded Starbucks to shut down the store that day. Later, the group Moms Demand Action picked up the charge, and got Starbucks to ban guns in its locations nationwide.*

“There were many community members that were outraged about what might happen,” Murray said. He called the proposed pro-gun event “unbelievable—there are no words to describe the boldness of gun-rights groups.”

Ultimately, however, the biggest prospects for change reside in Washington, DC. About 32,000 annual gun deaths touch virtually every district in the country, and the capital city itself is intimately familiar with gun violence. Like some dystopian future of guns run amok, local authorities have installed sensors throughout the city that can pinpoint and triangulate frequent gunfire and direct police to its location. The Urban Institute looked at the reports that the system collected and found that 54 percent of the gunshots were within 1,000 feet of a school.

Still, Congress probably won’t act soon. A senior Senate aide told me that majority leader Harry Reid “strongly desires a first successful vote on the bill rather than a second unsuccessful defeat.” With the Democrats fighting just to hold on to the chamber, that makes it unlikely in the foreseeable future. And with the House very likely to stay Republican, it’s hard to imagine Speaker John Boehner feeling any pressure to act (though most observers agree that if he did bring a background-check bill to the floor, it would pass).

Esty, for her part, remains optimistic that she’ll return to the fight. Of all the donors who contributed through late July, every single one from Newtown gave to her campaign; not one donated to Greenberg, which is remarkable given how close her race was in 2012.

“I can’t afford to get discouraged or give up—that would be letting these folks down,” Esty told me. “And that would be letting the NRA win. That’s what they’ve always counted on. They’ve counted on people giving up and going home and not staying the course.”

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie answers a question during a campaign event in Manville, New Jersey, Monday, May 13, 2013. (AP Photo/Mel Evans) Ad Policy

On Friday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie refused to sign three closely watched gun control bills, including a ban on .50 caliber sniper rifles similar to one Christie himself called for earlier this year. Christie’s decision, announced late in the evening, indicates that his pivot from moderate governor to contestant in the GOP presidential primaries is underway, if after-hours and off the record.

Christie fully rejected the ban on .50 caliber rifles, five-foot-long snipers that can be loaded with palm-length cartridges designed to penetrate heavy armor a mile away; and that are, according to Christie, necessary for “recreational pastimes.” While Christie proposed outlawing the sale of these weapons in April, he wrote to the General Assembly that banning them outright would “serve only to confuse law-abiding gun owners with the threat of imprisonment.” In fact, the law would give gun owners a year in which to register, and then legally keep, any .50 calibers currently in their possession.

Christie carved up the two other bills and sent them back to the legislature with conditional vetoes. From a bill that supporters called a “national model” for overhauling how states conduct background checks and issue firearm permits, Christie cut provisions to digitally embed firearm permits in a gun owner’s driver’s license, to include private sales in the instant background check system and to require prospective gun owners to take a short safety course.

“None of the technology necessary for this system exists,” Christie said of the measure that would link firearm permits with state ID.

Christie also gutted a law requiring state officials to report data about lost and stolen firearms, along with those seized in association with a crime, to federal databases.

At a press conference today, gun control advocates criticized Christie for “put[ting] politics over safety” and for being “courageous for his place in the Republican Party, but not for the residents of New Jersey.” Even before the Sandy Hook shootings, 65 percent of New Jersey residents reported being “very concerned” about gun violence, and the same percentage put a higher priority on gun control than on maintaining an individual’s right to own a firearm. While Christie signed ten other gun-related measures into law last week, none were as crucial to advocates or as hotly contested within the pro-gun community as the bills he vetoed. Still, with his re-election approaching, Christie’s position in New Jersey is solid.

As my colleague George Zornick wrote earlier this month, it’s conservative Republicans nationwide to whom Christie will have to defend his record should he seek the presidential nomination in 2016, and a majority of these voters say they won’t vote for a candidate with whose gun policy they disagree. As governor of a state with some of the country’s strictest gun laws, Christie has already given the gun lobby plenty of fodder with which to attack him. So it isn’t clear that Friday’s vetoes will do much more to protect him from the far right than they will to damage his reputation as a straightforward and independent executive.

Speaking to the Republican National Committee the day before declining to sign the legislation, Christie offered a pre-emptive explanation for his gun control about-face: “I’m in this business to win,” he said. “I am going to do anything I need to do.”

This piece originally appeared in The Daily Pennsylvanian and is reposted here with permission. Ad Policy

There’s a joke that goes like this. A man walks into a bar in Georgia. Mistaking a man at the counter for the bartender, he asks him repeatedly for a shot. The man he’s asking finally turns to him and asks, “You sure you want it, man?” And the first man says, “Yeah, and make it a double.”

So the man at the counter raises his gun and shoots him twice.

There’s another joke that goes like this: since 2009, there have been, on average, two mass shootings in the United States every month (with mass shootings referring to the murder of four or more people by firearm in a single incident). According to the FBI, those shootings account for less than 1 percent of all firearm murders in the country.

Despite President Obama’s poor record on gun control, an area in which he has made little to no significant progress, his administration has been continuously charged with assaulting gun owners’ Second Amendment right to bear arms since he took office. Those accusations, though fictitious, have caused gun sales to skyrocket in recent years.

And, while the administration has done little to regulate gun use, the gun lobby and its supporters have pushed through a preponderance of legislation slackening those same regulations. Perhaps the most frightening of these efforts culminated on April 23, 2014, when Georgia Governor Nathan Deal signed the “Safe Carry Protection Act,” referred to by critics as the “guns everywhere bill.” The bill allows licensed gun owners in Georgia to bring firearms into a number of public buildings, including bars, churches and, at the discretion of individual districts, even schools.

The punch line for this joke is unclear. Maybe it’s the fear I often feel walking down the street at night, wondering which of the people walking past might suddenly draw a gun from a purse or coat pocket. Maybe it’s the fact that for the first—and hopefully last—time in my life, I woke up in my dorm bed two months ago to the sound of gunshots and then drifted back to sleep as a man died in front of Copabanana, less than a block away.

Maybe it’s the fact that soon, that fear won’t abate at all for Georgians walking into crowded, well-lit buildings, where a drunken debate or charged comment might translate into gunfire as suddenly as a confrontation in a dark alley. Maybe it’s the way the extreme, prejudiced opinions of certain citizens no longer abstractly threaten my liberty via their access to the voting booth but now more concretely threaten my life via their access to high-powered weapons.

Whatever the punch line is, I’m still waiting for it. Waiting for gun laws like this to start making sense, as yet another young man with a legally purchased firearm is carted off to prison or the cemetery, leaving behind him an unthinkable number of dead bodies and grieving families and gun rights advocates stepping forward to say, “It’s a shame, but crimes like this are unpreventable,” insisting that the only solution is to arm more people in hopes that next time someone will turn the gun on the shooter rather than another innocent.

I think the real punch line is our failure to grasp the simple truth that doing the same thing over and over will never produce a different result. Until we make a real move toward restricting firearm access, we’ll keep reading about these shootings in the morning news. We’ll continue crying over deaths we might have been able to prevent. We’ll continue fearing the next person to pick up a gun and punctuate his hatred and depression with a slug in the head of a coed, a secretary or a first grader.

The real punch line is that more than 11,000 people are murdered with a gun every year in the United States, and we have yet to close the loopholes that currently allow 40 percent of firearms to be sold without background checks.

I want to make it very clear: when I say gun control in this country is a joke, I don’t mean it’s funny.

It isn’t funny at all."

This past August, the Lafayette-based IND Monthly published a story about a 54-year-old man named Bill Winters, incarcerated at a medium-security prison in Epps, Louisiana. Winters, who is black, was arrested in June 2009, after he drunkenly entered an unlocked oncologist’s office on a Sunday morning, setting off a security alarm. When police arrived, he had rummaged through a desk drawer, and was in possession of a box of Gobstoppers candy. Winters was convicted of simple burglary a week before Thanksgiving, and given a seven-year prison sentence—hardly a slap on the wrist. But a few days later, the prosecutor in his case, Assistant District Attorney Alan Haney, sought additional punishment for Winters, under the state’s habitual offender law. Based on his record of nonviolent offenses, which went back to 1991 and ranged from cocaine possession to burglary, the trial court resentenced Winters to twelve years without any chance of parole. But Haney was still not satisfied. He appealed the ruling, arguing that the court had imposed an “illegally lenient sentence” and that the rightful punishment was life without the possibility of parole. Ad Policy

At a subsequent hearing, Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft estimated that Winters had been arrested more than twenty times, calling him a “career criminal who victimized a lot of citizens in our city.” But it seemed clear that he was more of a thorn in the side of law enforcement than a looming threat to society. His brothers, Dennis and James, testified that Winters had been homeless at the time of his offense and that he had a history of addiction; James had overcome his own drug problems and said that he would be willing to “take [Winters] in and work with him.” A former Lafayette police officer who had once worked at a correctional facility where Winters was held, said that although he did not know him well, Winters “didn’t cause problems” and had potential for rehabilitation. But this past summer, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision: “The state asserts that because of the defendant’s particular multiple offender status, the law mandates a minimum sentence of life in prison without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. We agree.”

Dennis Winters was incredulous when he heard the news about his brother. “What? This makes no sense,” he told IND Monthly. “I don’t understand what these people are trying to do. He’s not a violent person. He’s fragile. He wouldn’t hurt anybody, except maybe for himself. I just don’t get how they’re going to give him life for some Gobstopper candy.”

Today, Winters joins hundreds of Louisiana prisoners sent to die in prison after committing similarly nonviolent offenses, from drug possession to property crimes. The national numbers are tallied in a major new study released today by the American Civil Liberties Union, titled “A Living Death: Life without Parole For Nonviolent Offenses,” which documents scores of cases with echoes of Winters’s story. Across the country, defendants have been given life without parole for such crimes as having a crack pipe, “siphoning gasoline from a truck” and, in another Louisiana case, shoplifting a $159 jacket.

Tales of outsized sentencing for minor crimes may not surprise anyone familiar with the well-documented excesses of three-strikes sentencing in California, for example. But the ACLU’s report is the first to attempt to grasp the national numbers, specifically concerning nonviolent offenders sentenced to die behind bars. The report found 3,278 prisoners serving life without parole in 2012 for nonviolent crimes, of which 79 percent were for drug crimes. This is not the complete picture—Bill Winters himself is not among the prisoners covered—and crucially, only includes formal life-without-parole cases. It does not include life sentences where parole is a possibility—if largely only in theory, given the increasing reluctance of parole boards to free prisoners. It also does not include, say, 100-year sentences, or the kinds of stacked, decades-long sentences that are, in effect, permanent life sentences. “The number of people serving death-in-prison sentences after being convicted of nonviolent crimes is not known,” the report concludes, “but it is most certainly higher than the number of prisoners serving formal life-without-parole sentences for nonviolent crimes.”

Indeed, a report released earlier this year by the Sentencing Project found that one in nine prisoners in the US are serving a life sentence and that “those with parole-eligible life sentences are increasingly less likely to be released.” Including life with parole, the report estimated that “approximately 10,000 lifers have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.”

Determining what qualifies as “nonviolent” is similarly complicated. As the ACLU points out, “Although the term ‘violent crime’ brings to mind very serious offenses such as rape and murder, some jurisdictions define violent crime to include burglary, breaking and entering, manufacture or sale of controlled substances, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, or extortion.” In other words, the number of prisoners serving life without parole who are far from the “worst of the worst” is higher still.

* * *

Regardless of the exact numbers, and perhaps not surprisingly for the state known as the prison capital of the world, it is clear that Louisiana is home to a disproportionate number of these sentences. It also provides a dramatic illustration of the explosion of permanent life sentences over the past four decades: “In Louisiana, just 143 people were serving LWOP sentences in 1970,” the ACLU notes. “That number had increased to 4,637 by 2012.” The report found that Louisiana had the highest number of nonviolent offenders serving life without parole out of all the states: 429. Florida was a distant second, with 270. (Thanks to the drug war, federal prisoners accounted for the largest share at 2,074.)

Among the Louisiana prisoners highlighted in the report are Fate Vincent Winslow, who, while homeless, “acted as a go-between in the sale of two small bags of marijuana, worth $10 in total, to an undercover police officer;” Timothy Jackson, who stole a jacket from a department store in New Orleans, Paul Carter, convicted of “possession of a trace amount of heroin residue that was so minute it could not be weighed;” and Sylvester Mead, a Shreveport man who drunkenly threatened a police officer while seated, handcuffed, in the back of a patrol car.

Mead’s case, like Winters’s, shows the way in which prosecutors’ wishes consistently trump judicial power when it comes to sentencing people for such crimes. Not only did his trial judge oppose the initial charge of public intimidation, he made it repeatedly clear he opposed sending Mead to die in prison. Mead’s verbal offense “does not warrant, under any conscionable or constitutional basis, a life sentence,” he said. But Mead’s prosecutor appealed multiple times seeking a harsher sentence because of his old convictions. After his previous sentences were vacated by a higher court multiple times, Judge Leon L. Emanuel was bound by Louisiana’s mandatory sentencing statute to hand down a sentence of life without parole. “No matter how long this Court were to deliberate about this matter, it cannot fashion a legal result to explain that the life sentence without probation or suspension of sentence is unconstitutionally excessive,” he concluded.

Such statements from judges are not unusual, it turns out. “In case after case reviewed by the ACLU, the sentencing judge said on the record that he or she opposed the mandatory LWOP sentence as too severe but had no discretion to take individual circumstances into account or override the prosecutor’s charging decision,” the ACLU found. Mandatory sentencing schemes are certainly to blame—in Louisiana, they account for almost all—97.6 percent—of the surveyed nonviolent LWOP sentences. But while mandatory sentencing ties the hands of judges, such punishments do not impose themselves. Prosecutors have the power to seek or not seek them.

Bill Winters was not the first defendant to find himself in the crosshairs of Lafayette ADA Alan Haney. Indeed, in 2007, Haney created a “career criminal program,” as described by the local Daily Advertiser, to “identify repeat offenders all over Lafayette Parish.”

“We basically had to start this whole project from scratch,” he told the City-Parish Council in September 2010, according to the Advertiser. Thus far, he boasted, some forty-nine people had been sentenced as habitual offenders with the help of the initiative.

In the fall of 2009, the same year Winters was convicted for stealing Gobstoppers, a 29-year-old black man named Travis Bourda was convicted for possessing 130 grams of marijuana “with intent to distribute.” Writing to the ACLU, Bourda insists that no drugs were actually found in his posession and that his court-appointed lawyer “filed no motions, failed to investigate,” and “made no objections at trial.” His initial sentence of eight years was increased to fourteen after Haney filed habitual offender charges based on Bourda’s previous record, which included “carnal knowledge of a juvenile” when he was 19. Responding to Haney’s attempt to seek a sentence of life without parole for Bourda, the trial judge wrote: “I believe a life sentence under the circumstances…would be an unconstitutional sentence. I believe that fourteen years is more than enough considering the underlying charge was possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and that the amount of marijuana involved was not significant.”

But in 2011 the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed with Haney, vacating the fourteen-year sentence and imposing life without parole. Today, Bourda is serving his sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, famously known as Angola.

Angola prisoners were not allowed to receive visits or speak on the phone to the ACLU. But in response to the questionnaire sent out by attorney Jennifer Turner, who authored the report and corresponded with more than 600 prisoners, Bourda described himself as “the most miserable person there is.” He wrote that he was diagnosed as schizophrenic when he was 13 and that he hears voices that tell him to do things. In a separate, handwritten letter, he wrote to “share my thoughts about the Habitual Offender law,” which he describes as “the most unconstitutional law there is.”

“We paid our debts to society for the past crimes we committed,” Bourda wrote.” “…There is never any forgiveness once you have a record.” In his opinion, he added, “the prosecution is abusing his discretion on a certain race of people which we know to be black individuals.”

Whether or not prosecutorial discretion is to blame, Bourda’s observation about race is certainly supported by the numbers. The ACLU report shows, and Turner wrote to me in an e-mail, that “the racial disparity in life without parole sentencing for nonviolent crimes in Louisiana is staggering.” While the state would not provide figures according to race, the ACLU calculated that black prisoners “comprise 91.4 percent of the nonviolent LWOP prison population in Louisiana,” despite the fact that “Blacks make up only about one-third of the general population in the state.” Black defendants in Louisiana “were 23 times more likely than whites to be sentenced to LWOP for a nonviolent crime.”

There are many factors that could explain this. “The racial disparity can result from disparate treatment at every stage of the criminal justice system, including stops and searches, points of arrest, prosecutions and plea negotiations, trials, and sentencing,” Turner explains. She adds, “In Louisiana, it may also have to do with how prosecutors wield their enormous discretion in deciding whether to charge defendants as habitual offenders.”

I contacted Alan Haney’s office by phone and e-mail to discuss his Habitual Offender Division, but have not received a response. In the meantime, the ACLU report is only the most recent to cast a stark light on Louisiana’s sentencing excesses. While some recent reforms in the state have sought to mitigate some of Louisiana’s harshest sentencing statutes, they still preserve the power of the prosecutor to decide if and when to trigger mandatory sentences. In a report released by the Reason Foundation last month, which closely examines the state’s determinate sentencing laws and makes recommendations for reform, the authors found that a 2012 law signed by Governor Bobby Jindal to allow courts to waive mandatory minimums in some cases put all the power in prosecutors’ hands, giving prosecutors “much more power than they previously had.”

The ACLU also makes recommendations for reform. It calls on the states and federal government to get rid of laws that mandate or allow life without parole for nonviolent crimes, and exhorts state governors, as well as the Obama administration, to commute such disproportionate punishments. “Life without parole sentences for nonviolent offenses defy common sense,” it concludes, and “are grotesquely out of proportion to the conduct they seek to punish.”

In Bourda’s words, “I never committed a capital offense such as murder….I don’t deserve to be sentenced like a hard-core criminal.”

Law enforcement officials describe the United States as a one-stop shop for the guns sought by terrorists, mercenaries and international criminals of all stripes. And September 11 has not changed that in any significant way. In fact, Attorney General John Ashcroft has refused to permit the use of gun purchase records to track crimes, a practice that the FBI had previously used and that conceivably could help to identify terrorists. Nor did Ashcroft propose closing gun loopholes as part of the USA Patriot Act. The result of the lax US system, says McBride, is “an ongoing cycle” in which weapons bought here end up fueling violence abroad, and in which America is regarded as the firearms “shopping center for the world.”

Lobster Air and Gun Land

The story of a ragtag South Florida outfit called Lobster Air International illustrates just how easy US gun purchases can be. In the summer of 1998 Stephen Jorgensen began buying the first of what were eventually more than 800 MAK-90 semiautomatic rifles at a store called Gun Land in Kissimmee, Florida. He did not have a resale permit–known as a Federal Firearms License, or FFL–and he was not required to present one. But Jorgensen wasn’t stockpiling the guns for his personal use; he was taking them to Opa-Locka airport near Miami and loading them aboard a light airplane headed for airstrips in Venezuela and Colombia, via Haiti.

Jorgensen’s South American clients originally wanted AK-47s, but in the United States, the fully automatic AK-47 can be purchased from a dealer only with a Class 3 permit, which is difficult to obtain. The AK was modified in 1990 to get around the California Assault Weapons Ban–hence MAK-90, or “Modified AK 1990.” It is virtually identical to the AK-47 but costs only $200 to $300, compared with $1,000 to $3,000 for a Russian-made AK-47. It is exempt from the national Assault Weapons Ban, enacted after the California ban, because it has slight alterations that give it a hunting-rifle appearance. Jorgensen, a hefty man with an easygoing manner, says the distinction is absurd. “These weapons happened to be a loophole because they didn’t have a pistol grip on the stock. They had a thumbhole. How ridiculous!” The MAK-90 can use the same caliber bullet as the AK-47, and it can be converted to fully automatic with rudimentary mechanical skills; a number of websites offer kits and instructions.

The smuggling operation began when a lieutenant colonel of the Venezuelan Air Force asked Rafael Ceruelos if he knew anyone who could buy guns. Ceruelos, of Cuban origin, is a self-described import-export businessman who had already been doing business with the colonel, selling him aircraft parts through connections he had with an aircraft broker from Texas. Ceruelos speaks in a raspy voice, a more sophisticated version of Al Pacino’s gruff Tony Montana character from Scarface. He likes to use words like “friggin'” a lot. He says that he just wanted to keep his clients happy.

Ceruelos says the Texan hooked him up with Jorgensen, an old Vietnam War buddy in Tampa who could get weapons at a discount. In 1998 several meetings took place in Dallas, Miami and Caracas to orchestrate a deal, which included setting up Lobster Air to import lobsters to the United States from Haiti. According to Jorgensen, the Venezuelan colonel and the interests he represented put up the money to buy an Aero Commander aircraft. Jorgensen contracted boat operators to circle Haiti and collect lobsters from remote villages, but that part of the plan never went forward. Lobster Air was apparently not in the business of selling lobsters.

On January 3, 1999, US Customs agents, acting on what they thought was a drug tip, stopped the Aero Commander, bound for South America, on a runway at Opa-Locka. But there were no drugs; instead, the plane was loaded with seventy-eight disassembled MAK-90s inside blue gym bags, along with 9,000 rounds of ammunition. Customs and ATF sources now say that Lobster Air’s weapons were headed to Colombia’s FARC rebels, another group on the State Department’s terror list. But McBride, the retired ATF agent, says that “when guns are going into Colombia, there are a number of potential sources they could be going to, including the drug cartels, the various insurgency groups, paramilitary forces over there…. [It’s] very difficult to tell exactly where those guns were going to go, unless you were fortunate enough to get some confiscated and then have the traces run back.”

Jorgensen was detained and interrogated. Facing indictment on weapons and conspiracy charges, he quickly agreed to cooperate with what was now a US Customs-ATF investigation. Meanwhile, Ceruelos proceeded to concoct more business. Jorgensen, however, was recording their conversations for federal prosecutors. The Venezuelan customers needed 200,000 rounds of ammunition, so Ceruelos agreed that Jorgensen would buy the ammo at a local gun shop in 10,000-round increments, so as not to arouse suspicion. Jorgensen assured Ceruelos, “They don’t monitor buying the ammunition; you don’t sign, nobody knows you bought it. So that’s a fairly low risk.”

With the secret recordings in prosecutors’ hands, Jorgensen and Ceruelos were soon indicted–not for buying the guns, but for violating the Arms Export Control Act. Ceruelos served fifteen months and Jorgensen received only probation, thanks to his cooperation and what he describes as a “sterling military record.” It may be surprising to learn that buying hundreds of MAK-90s and thousands of rounds of ammunition that could supply US-designated terrorist organizations doesn’t raise any eyebrows. But there is simply no requirement for gun stores to report suspicious activity. If a customer buys more than one handgun in five days, the store must report the sales to ATF, but the MAK-90 comes with no such restriction. Nor does ammunition. Some gun-store owners say they voluntarily tip off ATF to suspicious buyers, usually after the sale is made and the money collected.

‘Bubba Did It’

When Gun Land’s owner, William Ben Woodall, answers the phone, he doesn’t use his real name. “Tell ’em Bubba did it,” he laughs. “Bubba” says there’s no limit to the number of guns that someone can buy in Florida. He says he’d probably call ATF if someone came in to buy hundreds of semiautomatic rifles, but that if the person “looked right and acted right” and passed the NICS test–the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which requires gun-shop owners to call ATF and check whether a client is a felon or is otherwise prohibited from buying guns–he’d have no problem. Such a purchase, he says, is ultimately a customer’s right. “Cars kill more people than guns,” he says.

Weapons sold over the counter can quickly find themselves bound by air for distant countries. Since September 11, 2001, Customs has stepped up its monitoring of outbound small aircraft, but such inspections are aimed more at stopping the delivery of components used in weapons of mass destruction, like triggering devices or plutonium, than at halting gun shipments. McBride says we should also be concerned about guns. Recalling a 1985 rampage by one guerrilla group, he says, “The M-19 raided and assaulted the Palace of Justice in Colombia, killing 115 people, eleven Supreme Court justices, and wiped out the Supreme Court of the country of Colombia. And these were guns that were subsequently traced back to the United States.”

McBride says South Florida investigators came to see a connection between purchases here and violence abroad. “We would see, all of a sudden, a rash of large gun purchases, a large quantity of gun purchases throughout South Florida. We would find that then, a month or two months later, we would see a coup take place in Haiti.” McBride adds that Florida is especially attractive to South and Central America, “because of our geographic location [and] the ease with which firearms can be secured here.”

Guns and the War on Terror

After September 11, Attorney General Ashcroft told the nation, “It’s our position at the Justice Department and the position of this Administration that we need to unleash every possible tool in the fight against terrorism, and to do so promptly.” The resulting USA Patriot Act includes broad changes in surveillance, information sharing and intelligence tools available to law enforcement. Although the “Patriot” part of the act’s title refers to “Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism,” the act contains no new provisions for the monitoring or control of firearms.

One tool became apparent in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks, when agents from ATF asked the FBI to cross-check a list of terrorist suspects against NICS records of approved gun purchasers. The records ATF wanted the FBI to examine were the normal background check records of potential gun purchasers, which are kept for ninety days. But when the FBI began its NICS checks, Attorney General Ashcroft and Justice Department officials stepped in and told the FBI it was out of bounds.

“This decision by the Attorney General was surprising in that he didn’t place officer safety and the security of the American people first,” says a former official at the Treasury Department, which oversees ATF. Kenneth James, recently appointed to the firearms committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, agrees. “If we have some form of identifying who of these terrorists may have had guns, that just makes our investigation and the people who are out there on the frontlines that much safer.”

Ashcroft defended his decision on legal grounds. “It’s my belief,” he said, “that the United States Congress specifically outlaws and bans the use of the NICS database–and that’s the use of approved purchase records–for weapons checks on possible terrorists or on anyone else.” But an internal Justice Department memo shows that Ashcroft’s own office of legal counsel believed otherwise and supported the longtime FBI practice of using NICS records in criminal investigations. “We see nothing in the NICS regulations,” the memo read, “that prohibits the FBI from deriving additional benefits from checking audit log records.”

Mathew Nosanchuk once worked for the Justice Department, where he became an expert on law enforcement’s use of NICS. He now works for the Violence Policy Center, a Washington-based gun-control group. Ashcroft, Nosanchuk says, is forcing the FBI and ATF to “conduct the post-September 11 investigation with one hand tied behind their backs.” Nosanchuk says Ashcroft’s stance “really underscores his allegiance to the agenda of the gun lobby.” The National Rifle Association’s position is that NICS “has serious flaws that must be corrected.”

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA and related pro-gun lobbyists contributed $48,900 to Ashcroft’s failed 2000 Senate re-election bid. Federal Election Commission filings indicate the NRA also spent $239,000 on independent TV and radio ads, billboards and bumper stickers supporting Ashcroft’s campaign. Later, the NRA Political Victory Fund spent more than $100,000 on an endorsement letter and $19,000 on bumper stickers at the time of Ashcroft’s Justice Department confirmation.

Law enforcement has increasingly found guns to be a critical source of evidence in its investigations of terrorists and other criminal groups. It was the suspects’ outdoor shooting activities that led to the October arrests of four alleged Al Qaeda trainees in Oregon and Michigan. As Ashcroft himself pointed out, members of the group “acquired various firearms and engaged in weapons training and physical training in preparation to fight a jihad.” Among the detainees swept up in the weeks after 9/11 were several members of Al-Fuqra, a domestic group suspected of at least seventeen firebombings and thirteen homicides in the United States. Three Al-Fuqra members were arrested and convicted of illegally buying assault rifles, pistols and AK-47 ammunition in rural Virginia. A prior weapons-violation warrant was used to detain last month’s Washington-area snipers until murder charges could be filed. (The Bushmaster rifle the snipers used is another modified weapon designed to avoid the Assault Weapons Ban.)

Even international criminals criticize America’s lax gun laws and say they inevitably lead to international trafficking. Conor Claxton, who was convicted of smuggling more than 100 guns from Florida to the Irish Republican Army in 1999, said the group did its shopping near Fort Lauderdale because “we don’t have gun shows in Ireland. You see things here like you never imagined.” Rafael Ceruelos, who has lived in Spain since serving time for his offenses, says, “The right to bear arms made sense 200 years ago but not now.” He adds, “As long as people can buy weapons in gun shops, there will be people from other countries who want to do business with them.”"

In a joint press conference with Mexico’s president Philippe Calderon, President Obama recently threw his support behind the Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and other Related Items, a long-stalled treaty often referred to by its Spanish acronym CIFTA.

“As President Calderon and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war,” said President Obama in Mexico City on the eve of the Summit of the Americas.

Thirty of the thirty-five members of the Organization of American States have ratified CIFTA since it was agreed upon in 1997. In an interview with Reuters Jonathan Winer, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who was the main negotiator of the treaty during the Clinton administration, said the treaty “is designed to help US law enforcement track abuses of firearms of criminals back to the last lawful sale so they can determine what went wrong. It is completely consistent with all US laws and does not ever impose a foreign law on a US person who has abided by US law.”

Although this treaty would do little to reform the domestic loopholes which allow countless guns onto our streets, CIFTA would at least signal to our allies in the OAS that we are serious about combating the drug violence that the US market both feeds and fuels.

Unfortunately, this small step towards tightening US gun control regulations is being stonewalled by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, in all likelihood because the National Rifle Association and other anti-gun control groups have lined up to oppose CIFTA, fearing that it could be a stepping-stone to more fundamental measures like Representative Bobby Rush’s comprehensive gun control bill. The tragedy is that CIFTA is so mild that even the NRA acknowledges that the bill “is not intended to restrict ‘lawful ownership and use’ of firearms,” but Reid needs real pushing for the legislation to succeed.

Most of the organizing around CIFTA to date has been staged by right-wing zealots unreasonably up in arms over this treaty. A Google search turns up scores of blog posts determined to raise alarms around the pending legislation with nary a progressive voice posting in favor of common sense and against unnecessary gun violence. But it’s time for those of us not in the thrall of the Second Amendment to offer vocal backing to this multilateral attempt to stop the flood of illegal weapons into Mexico and beyond.

1: THE BOMBINGS

The first bomb didn’t kill anyone. It was planted in the ground-floor parking lot beneath the Two Rivers Convention Center in downtown Grand Junction, Colorado—a dry, boom-and-bust mining town west of the Rockies where the snowcapped mountains give way to mesa and valley. In the morning the sun strikes gold on the sheer, striated walls of the sandstone cliffs that surround the Grand Valley, and in the evening the cliffs are ribboned with shifting periwinkle shadows. At 9 pm on Valentine’s Day, 1991, Dennis Lamb was leaving a vocational banquet for School District 51, crossing the Two Rivers parking lot, when an explosion blasted shrapnel into the back of his right calf. “I thought I’d been shot,” Lamb would recall. 1 Ad Policy

Three weeks later, on the morning of March 5, four members of the Gonzales family piled into the family van, parked outside their home in a neighborhood two miles northeast of downtown, to go to the mall. Twelve-year-old Maria Dolores Gonzales had stayed home from school with a headache, and her mother let her come along. When the van rolled forward, a bomb that had been hidden in the left rear wheel well exploded. Shrapnel rocketed through the vehicle’s carpeted floor and the plush back of Dolores’s seat, entering her back and instantly severing her aorta. When she failed to respond to her family’s panicked screams to get out of the van, they pulled her from the seat and blood pooled on the pavement. She died soon after.2

Three months later, Suzann and Henry Ruble had just finished dinner and were leaving the Feed Lot, a downtown restaurant just blocks from the Two Rivers Convention Center. “What is that thing over there?” Suzann asked, pointing to an object she thought looked like the pneumatic tubes drive-up banks used to have. “It looks kind of strange, don’t you think?” She drove over and Henry leaned out to pick it up. As he brought it up to his chest, Suzann recalled, “There was a big loud explosion. It lifted the truck and Henry dropped.” Ruble’s arms were blown off and his body mangled. He died instantly. Debris from this third and most powerful bomb was collected across the block.3

The next day, federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms descended on the town of roughly 30,000 to assist local investigators with what appeared to be a serial bomber. No one had taken credit, and the victims seemed chosen at random. The police were stymied, people were scared, and the pressure to find a culprit mounted. “We certainly don’t want to create hysteria or paranoia in the community,” a police lieutenant told the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel after warning people to check around their cars for bombs. “But we do want people to be aware that there is a person or persons out there with no regard for human life.”4

Investigators drew up a list of about 30 suspects, many of whom were known to local police to dabble in explosives—not an unusual hobby in a town of miners and ranchers. “People use dynamite. People work in the oil patch. People set bombs off for fun,” said Ellen Miller, a former correspondent for The Denver Post who covered the story. “I mean, seriously. People knew what pipe bombs were.” Then, in early July, police received a nervous call from a woman who worked at the Readmor bookstore on Main Street. A 28-year-old local man named Jimmy Genrich had asked them to order The Anarchist Cookbook, a manual that contains, among other things, instructions on how to make a pipe bomb. They refused to order the book and instead called the police, skyrocketing Genrich to the top of the list of suspects.5 Criminal Justice Prosecutors Keep Their Jobs by Putting People in Jail.

A covert detail was put on Genrich in mid-July, with two or more ATF agents following him around the clock. They sat in an unmarked car outside the boardinghouse where he lived alone on the top floor, sharing a bathroom with other residents, mostly single men; the house sat just over two blocks from the convention center. They followed him when he walked across the street, wending his way through a parking lot, down an alley, and into the back door of Suehiro’s, the Japanese restaurant on Main Street where he worked as a part-time dishwasher. They followed him when he left Suehiro’s at the end of his shift and walked to the Corral, a bar a few blocks away, where he drank hard and tried (and failed) to talk to girls. They followed him when he walked a few more blocks to the Cheers Lounge, where the girls danced for other men and wouldn’t talk to him. They followed him when he staggered back to his boardinghouse, drunk and angry, and they sat outside in the dark, all night, wakeful in case he should decide to go on one of his long nighttime walks. During the daylight hours, they saw his mother, a church organist named Sheila Greenlee, deliver his meals in a cooler.6 Jimmy Genrich, and thousands of others, have been imprisoned for decades because of untested “science.”

One morning in late July, local detective Bob Russell, a tall man with watchful blue eyes and military shoulders, showed up at the boardinghouse with two ATF agents. They wanted inside. Genrich cracked the door, got angry, and didn’t want to let them in. (Later he said Russell illegally put a foot in the door and wouldn’t allow him to close it, which Russell denied.) But he soon found himself sitting on his sagging brown couch talking to Russell, who stood over him while federal investigators looked through his belongings. Tucked under a radio on his dresser, they found a handwritten note scrawled on the back of an IRS envelope: “If I end up killing some stuck-up bitch don’t blame me. I’ve asked everybody I know for help, but no one listens…. I’ve tried making friends with these girls around here, but they just keep treating me like I’m not good enough to talk to. Valentine’s Day is coming and I still don’t have a sweetheart…. It’s been over a year now, and nobody has tried to help me yet. These girls still won’t even talk to me. Fuck you all. I’ll get even…. If I can’t be happy, I might as well kill one.”7 Current Issue View our current issue

They came back to the boardinghouse with a warrant and ransacked his room, as well as the home of his mother and his gentle, owl-eyed stepfather, Wallace Greenlee. They found no Anarchist Cookbook, no bomb-making instructions, and, despite thoroughly vacuuming carpets and furniture, no traces of gunpowder anywhere. All they came up with was a toolbox of electronics equipment, including some Buss-type stereo fuses like those in the bombs; a blue envelope with more handwritten notes in a similarly disturbing vein; and common household tools such as pliers and wire-strippers. They sent the tools to a forensic analyst in Maryland named John O’Neil. The hope was that if O’Neil could match marks made by Genrich’s tools to marks found on recovered bomb fragments, they would have the physical evidence they needed to arrest him. Meanwhile, federal agents started openly tailing Genrich everywhere he went, blue jackets with yellow ATF letters flapping like neon signage.8

By February 1992, nearly a year after the Valentine’s bomb, O’Neil said he had matched Genrich’s tools to all three bombs—plus an earlier, unexploded bomb from 1989, which had been found in the parking lot of the LaCourt Motor Lodge, right next door to the Two Rivers Convention Center. Investigators had used this bomb to figure out the other bombs’ unusual “signature” construction: a galvanized-steel pipe four to six inches long, covered at each end with distinctive “Coin”-brand metal caps, ignited by an internal motion-sensitive mercury switch that triggered a Buss-type fuse soldered to an Energizer Everlast battery. The district attorney, Steve ErkenBrack, convened the first grand jury that Grand Junction had seen in years, and Genrich was indicted on 10 counts, including multiple counts of first-degree murder. Grand Junction police chief Darold Sloan called it “the most comprehensive investigation in my 23 years in law enforcement.” All told, they spent more than $1 million. ErkenBrack is convinced they got the right guy. “The multiple bombings stopped,” he says, “as soon as we focused on Mr. Genrich and seized his tools.”9

During the trial, ErkenBrack and the trial judge, Nicholas Massaro, agreed that Genrich’s fate hung on the toolmarks, the only physical evidence that connected him to the bombs. In the early 1990s, few people challenged the foundations of forensic methods such as toolmark analysis. Since then, despite CSI-style portrayals of forensic analysts as crime-solving oracles, prominent scientists and criminal-justice experts have questioned many of the “pattern-matching” disciplines that rely on comparisons of bite marks, hairs, shoe prints, tire tracks, or fingerprints. These are different from, say, forensic DNA analysis, which relies on scientific principles like the known variations in the human genome. In contrast, pattern-matching examiners exercise an enormous amount of subjective judgment in determining what constitutes a match. In 2009 and 2016, major reports from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) blasted pattern-matching disciplines as barely science at all. Nonetheless, most of these forensic techniques are as widespread today as they were when Genrich was convicted.10

Calculating how many people might be incarcerated based on erroneous “matches” is notoriously difficult, but according to the Innocence Project, faulty forensic science was a factor in about half of all wrongful convictions in which the defendants were later exonerated by DNA testing. According to the National Registry of Exonerations, which looked at a larger set of cases that also included non-DNA exonerations and judged the factors differently, faulty forensics was a factor in 24 percent of wrongful convictions. One recent academic study, using its own methodology, found that faulty forensics was a factor in 34 percent of the wrongful convictions they examined. Many prosecutors and judges, however, insist there is no problem and that wrongful convictions are vanishingly rare. In 2007, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia cited a prosecutor claiming courts convict with an “error rate of 0.027 percent—or a success rate of 99.973 percent.” The prosecutor had divided the number of known exonerations over a 15-year period (a few hundred) by the total number of felony convictions in that period (15 million). It is wildly unlikely, however, that all wrongful convictions have been discovered. One academic study estimates that in capital cases—which receive far more post-conviction scrutiny than do other cases—one in 25 people set to be executed will have been wrongfully convicted. However you crunch the numbers, they are appallingly high, and could mean that thousands of people are behind bars partly because juries were swayed by unproven ”science.”11

Today, Genrich is 55 years old and has been in prison for nearly 25 years for crimes he says he didn’t commit. His latest appeal has been taken up by the Innocence Project, in the hopes of not only freeing Genrich, but getting the courts to recognize recent scientific challenges to forensic pattern-matching techniques that affect hundreds of thousands of people at all levels of the criminal-justice system. In our investigation, we comprehensively reviewed the literature on handheld toolmarks published in forensic trade journals, dug through past legal rulings, pored over nearly 7,000 pages of trial transcripts, and conducted dozens of interviews with prosecutors, defense attorneys, forensic practitioners, judges, academics, and scientists, from Grand Junction to the Department of Justice. What we found was a startling lack of scientific support for forensic pattern-matching techniques such as toolmark analysis; a legal system that has failed to separate nonsense from science even in capital cases; and a consensus among prosecutors all the way up to the attorney general’s office that scientifically dubious forensic techniques should be not only protected, but expanded. With Donald Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions at the helm of the DOJ, the nominal momentum for forensic-science reform spurred by the two major reports is slowing. Genrich’s case reveals a system that makes it nearly impossible to throw unproven forensic science out of courts and may be keeping thousands of innocent people behind bars.12

2: THE ORIGIN OF FORENSICS

On a bitterly cold Valentine’s Day in 1929, four men hired by Al Capone entered an unheated garage on Chicago’s North Side and ordered the seven men inside to line up against a brick wall. Two men in suits and two men dressed as police officers carrying Tommy guns unleashed a barrage of bullets into henchmen of the infamous Chicago mobster George “Bugs” Moran. The police were stymied until they raided Fred “Killer” Burke’s house and found guns they suspected might have been used in the massacre. Burke wouldn’t confess, and the guns were the best evidence linking him to the crime, so they sent the weapons to Calvin Goddard, a former physician and pioneer in the new field of “forensic ballistics” at one of the nation’s first crime laboratories. (His new method of matching bullet casings to guns had played a role in the controversial 1927 execution of Italian-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti.) Goddard fired “test” bullets from Burke’s guns and, using a “split-image” comparison microscope he had helped invent for the purpose, matched grooved marks left on the test bullets and casings to those on bullets and casings found at the crime scene.13

Goddard’s forensic ballistics is now known as “firearm and toolmark analysis,” and the field has since grown to include hundreds of examiners in crime labs nationwide. While making matches with household tools is less common, convictions have been secured in part based on marks left by knives, bolt cutters, bayonets, scissors, screwdrivers, pipe wrenches, or—as in Genrich’s case—pliers and wire-strippers. These marks are often harder to parse than those on bullets, because while all bullets fired from a gun follow the same path down the same metal barrel, toolmarks depend on multiple variable factors such as the angle and pressure with which a tool is applied to a surface, which may be hard or soft, spongy or brittle.14 “We don’t want to create hysteria but there is a person out there with no regard for human life.” — Grand Junction police lieutenant to the local newspaper

Firearm and toolmark analysis emerged out of a national push in the early 20th century to professionalize police investigative techniques at a moment when Americans were particularly enamored with science. Law enforcement borrowed terms from science, establishing crime “laboratories” staffed by forensic “scientists” who announced “theories” cloaked in their own specialized jargon. But forensic “science” focused on inventing clever ways to solve cases and win convictions; it was never about forming theories and testing them according to basic scientific standards. By adopting the trappings of science, the forensic disciplines co-opted its authority while abandoning its methods.15

Amid the swirl of new forensic techniques, the courts realized there had to be a gatekeeping mechanism to filter out quackery. In 1923, the DC Court of Appeals provided that mechanism in Frye v. United States. The judges rejected a doctor’s dubious claim that he could use a polygraph to detect when a person was lying from a rise in their blood pressure. In the ruling, the court said that in order for scientific evidence or expert testimony to be admitted, it must be offered by an experienced practitioner making inferences from a “well-recognized scientific principle” that has “general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.” In Frye, the judges deemed the scientists in the “particular field” relevant to polygraph use to include psychologists and physiologists—not just polygraph practitioners who would, presumably, be biased toward preserving the technique’s reputation. The effectiveness of Frye in keeping dubious science out of the courts depends on whom judges include in their definition of the “relevant scientific community.” But as the decades wore on, and the forensic disciplines gained influence, judges tended to restrict their definition of the “relevant scientific community” to the forensic examiners themselves. Judges began taking advice on what counted as good forensics from the very people who invented the techniques and made a living off of them.16

In the American criminal-justice system, where prosecutors regularly battle defense attorneys over what constitutes valid evidence, judges’ rulings on admissibility are the final word. Once a technique has made it into court and survived appeals, subsequent judges, most of whom have no scientific training and little ability to assess the scientific validity of a technique, will continue to allow it by citing precedent. Forensic examiners, in turn, cite precedent in order to claim that their techniques are reliable science. Prosecutors point to guilty verdicts as evidence that the science brought to court was sound. In this circular way, legal rulings—which never really vetted the science to begin with—substitute for scientific proof. This is Frye’s fatal flaw: Nowhere in this process is anyone required to provide empirical evidence that the techniques work as advertised. Frye aimed to keep pseudoscience out of the courts, but instead has helped create the perfect conditions to keep it in.17

3: THE TOOLMARK ANALYST

By the time Genrich went on trial, the high-profile case had so saturated the local news that it was moved to the town of Greeley, on the other side of the Rockies. Inside an imposing courtroom with walls built of rare Colorado white marble—the same white marble used for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the Lincoln Memorial—Genrich sat at the defense table waiting for a break in the day’s proceedings, when he would be allowed to play on the Game Boy that his public defender Roberta “Bert” Nieslanik brought him every day in her purse. He sat quietly next to co-counsel Greg Greer, who would occasionally reach out and place a hand gently on his arm. It was not clear to observers if Greer was comforting his client or subtly managing potential outbursts.18

Ten days into the grueling five-week trial, ATF toolmark examiner John O’Neil took the stand. When tools are manufactured, he explained to the jurors ensconced in the marble jury box, processes such as grinding and milling create unique microscopic traits that can be used to distinguish even mass-produced tools. “Microscopically,” O’Neil said, “we move from scratches to ridges and valleys. It becomes topography.”19

In the ATF lab outside Washington, DC, O’Neil had taken Genrich’s pliers and carefully scraped their open jaws across sheets of lead, copper, and aluminum to simulate the striated marks left behind when tightening a metal end cap. He had snipped pieces of copper wire similar to wires found in the debris swept up after the bombings. He then darkened the room and placed the samples side by side on his comparison microscope, overlaying the marks from his test cuts with the marks found on the debris. He would tilt the light source to the side, he said, to illuminate the “ridges and valleys,” to “follow the flow of that shadow line in and out of the striae.”20

In a dramatic video presentation—one of the first of its kind in the nation—he showed the jury exactly how he made his matches. The video started with a still frame: a split screen of the ends of two pieces of wire. On the right was the wire O’Neil had cut using Genrich’s red-handled needle-nose pliers. On the left was a scrap of insulated wire from the unexploded 1989 bomb found outside the LaCourt motel. Then the camera began to zoom in. “At 20 times its normal size,” O’Neil said, “you’re beginning to see some features of the topography…it has contours.” As it zoomed to 40, then to 80, he explained that he had to remove the light’s filter and bring its angle down “to see the shadows.” He pointed to two lines about a quarter of the way from the top of the screen that ran parallel to the cut. “And you simply find two lines similar to that in size and shape and follow them through and see if the rest of what you have falls in place.” He testified that this alignment was so improbable that Genrich’s tool must have cut the wire in the bomb, “to the exclusion of any other tool” in the world. He then proceeded to match Genrich’s wire-strippers to a wire found at the Valentine’s Day bomb site, and matched his yellow-handled slip-joint pliers to scratches on the distinctive “Coin”-brand end-cap fragments that had been found at the scene of the Feed Lot bombing and that had sliced through the aorta of Dolores Gonzales.21 “The bombings stopped as soon as we focused on Genrich.” — District Attorney Steve ErkenBrack

When Nieslanik first saw this evidence, she was concerned. “I thought it was going to be a science,” she says. Barely five feet tall, with a pixie cut and turquoise cowboy boots, she talks fast and rarely sits still. She is a tiny woman who takes up space. In preparation for trial, Nieslanik scoured the professional journals published by forensic practitioners to try and understand the technique. Nieslanik had majored in chemistry in college before switching to women’s studies, and she had worked as the chemistry and physics laboratory coordinator at Mesa College before going to law school, so she was familiar with basic scientific concepts such as experimental design and statistics. She understood that just because Genrich’s tool had made a particular mark, that did not prove it was the only tool that could make that mark. The wire-strippers and pliers in Genrich’s toolbox were incredibly common—Nieslanik said she owned a pair. So how could the examiner know that the marks were unique to this set of wire-strippers or that set of pliers?22

To her surprise, Nieslanik could find no scientific studies to back up the claims O’Neil was making. There was no standardized protocol to be followed. There were no criteria for how many points of similarity constituted a unique match. It seemed to be just O’Neil’s subjective judgment. Then Nieslanik discovered that O’Neil had not submitted most of his test cuts into evidence. (The judge, infuriated upon learning this, held O’Neil in contempt of court.) O’Neil had decided over 50 cuts “were of little or no value” because they didn’t match. “I thought, ‘They just cut and cut and cut until they get one that matches,’” Nieslanik says. She recalls turning to her co-counsel and saying, “Holy shit, this is not science. It’s just not science. It’s like voodoo.”23

Even though she was convinced the field was “voodoo,” Nieslanik followed legal protocol and requested an independent review of O’Neil’s work. “It’s a science that’s questionable,” she explains, “but you have to hire somebody that believes in it to advise you about it.” A team of two other toolmark examiners came to look over O’Neil’s work. By the time they arrived, he had already set up the evidence for them, marking his matches with blue dots, a practice that could bias any examiner’s analysis. But the other examiners only agreed with O’Neil’s match to the Valentine’s Day bomb. All the other marks, they said, were inconclusive.24

These conflicting results reinforced Nieslanik’s intuition that the technique was unreliable, so she decided on a risky tactic: not just to challenge O’Neil, but to question the premise of his entire field, one that had been accepted into court since the turn of the 20th century. She called up Don Searls, a math professor at the local university who was unfamiliar with toolmark analysis. Nieslanik sent him the few papers she could find describing the field. Searls, who consulted for aerospace and pharmaceutical companies on experimental design, including for a NASA Apollo mission, was shocked. He testified that the field of toolmark analysis “does not have a scientific basis” and could not provide “credible evidence.” He laid out how he would design a proper test, pointing out that several truly independent examiners—not ones who had blue dots arranged for them in advance—should test several tools of similar wear and tear, ideally without knowing which ones were the suspect’s.25

The prosecutor, ErkenBrack, countered with an analogy. “If I have a babysitter,” he said, “and I come home and somebody has been in the fudge and there’s a little tiny handprint on the plate, are you telling me that in order to be statistically valid, I need to get in four other three-year-olds to compare that handprint?” But ErkenBrack’s commonsense analogy is flawed in a way that gets at the heart of the issue. He would only have to distinguish between the 3-year-old’s hands and the babysitter’s hands. The problem for forensic pattern-matchers is much more difficult. Imagine trying to figure out which 3-year-old stole a cookie from a picnic table in a New York City park, where any toddler could have wandered by. O’Neil had to conclude that Genrich’s tools were the only ones in the world that could have made the marks.26

Claims like “to the exclusion of any other tool” need to be supported by scientific studies that answer two crucial questions. First, do tools leave unique marks? If this is true in principle, you’d need to test if the technique works in practice: How reliably can human examiners distinguish toolmarks under conditions that resemble casework? In other words, how often do they make errors?27

No human endeavor is perfect, yet many forensic examiners claim “zero” or near-zero error rates. In a widely cited 1984 paper in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, bite-mark examiners claimed a coincidental match would occur less than one in 10 quadrillion times. But when actually tested, even the most experienced examiners were wrong about one in six times, and in one study they struggled to distinguish a child’s bite mark from an adult’s. In 2009, the chief of the FBI Firearms-Toolmarks Unit wrote that a qualified examiner will “rarely if ever commit a false positive error (misidentification).” In practice, error rates for matching bullets to firearms can be dramatically higher: In 2008, the Detroit Police Department’s crime lab was shuttered when auditors found that its examiners made one error in every 10 cases. The head of the FBI’s fingerprint laboratory testified that its error rate was one in 11 million—because he knew of only one error in the FBI’s 11 million comparisons—but subsequent tests of fingerprint examiners show error rates ranging from one in 680 to one in 24.28 By adopting the trappings of science, the forensic disciplines co-opted science’s authority while abandoning its methods.

These overblown and largely imaginary numbers—and forensic testimony offered with the certainty O’Neil claimed—are dangerous, because they give a false sense of scientific precision to juries and contribute to wrongful convictions. When examiners testify that they can make a match “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty,” they are making what sounds like a statistical statement. Dr. Searls’s point was that they hadn’t done the studies required to back up such a statement, so there was no way for O’Neil to support his claims—the “match” was simply what he subjectively judged to be true. O’Neil, who is now retired and spends his time making rosaries, stands by his testimony as well as his decision to throw out the test cuts that didn’t match. “If I didn’t believe that I had found something, then I wouldn’t have testified to it.”29

But abstract arguments, while convincing to statisticians like Dr. Searls, do not have the same effect on juries as a video where they can see lines matching up. As deliberations started in the Genrich case, the jury was split 50/50 on the question of his guilt. They asked to see O’Neil’s video several times while deliberating. After an agonizing four days, they delivered the guilty verdict. “They all matched. It was a perfect match,” juror David Trujillo later told the local paper.30

4: “A FORENSIC COMMUNITY IN DISARRAY”

Over the past century, thanks to the 1923 Frye ruling putting judges in charge of evaluating science, dubious forensic techniques have proved devilishly difficult to expel from the courts. Consider bite-mark matching, which arose out of a single case in 1974, when Walter Edgar Marx was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Investigators had exhumed the body of the victim six weeks after she’d been buried, and three dentists matched a series of lacerations around her nose to a plaster cast of Marx’s bite. An appeals court acknowledged that there weren’t any scientific studies validating the technique, or showing that bite-mark examiners could reliably match a bite mark left on skin to a person’s teeth, but found the three dentists to have credible expertise matching dental remains from deceased people to patients’ dental records. The court inferred that looking at bite marks left in a cadaver’s skin was sufficiently similar. The judges seemed impressed by the methods, which included X-rays and 3-D models. In a final rebuke to science, the court ruled that not to allow the evidence would be to “sacrifice…common sense.” This case established the precedent for almost all subsequent rulings on bite-mark evidence, including the 1983 case of a Wisconsin man named Robert Lee Stinson, who was convicted in the rape and murder of a 63-year-old woman almost entirely on bite-mark evidence. Using a photograph of the victim’s body and a plaster cast of Stinson’s teeth, dentists testified that the marks matched “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.” The appeals court was convinced by the analysis: “the lateral incisor in the upper jaw was set back from the other teeth; all of the upper front teeth were flared; the lower right lateral incisor was worn to a pointed edge; the right incisor was set out from the other teeth on the lower jaw.” The dentists even compared Stinson’s bite to his twin brother’s. The judges concluded that the “bite-mark evidence in this case was sufficient to exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis of innocence,” upholding Stinson’s conviction.31

Twenty-three years later, DNA evidence exonerated Stinson. The 3-D models, the detailed descriptions of his incisors, the “moral certainty” of his guilt—everyone had been convinced. And everyone had been wrong. The scientific tide has since turned. Dentists have recanted their testimony and disavowed the method. The Texas Commission on Forensic Science called for a “moratorium” on bite-mark evidence. A study conducted by the president-elect of the American Board of Forensic Odontology revealed that 96 percent of the time, bite-mark examiners couldn’t unanimously agree on whether a bite mark came from a human, and the organization advised its members not to make identifications based on bite marks alone. And yet Stinson’s case still stands as precedent in Wisconsin courts, meaning other judges can cite it to admit bite-mark evidence. Its use is in decline, but there has never been a single ruling to exclude it.32

Shockingly, the Supreme Court didn’t weigh in on the admissibility of forensic evidence until 70 years after Frye, in 1993—about two months after Genrich was found guilty. The high court’s ruling mandated that judges allow only scientific evidence supported by testable claims, and that proponents of the evidence must be able to provide measures of how often examiners make mistakes. What’s now known as the Daubert standard is federal law and has been adopted by most states, but it has had little effect in criminal law because most judges still rely on precedent, assuming evidence was vetted in past cases. “Judges,” said Harry T. Edwards, chief judge for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, at a Harvard event last October, “believe that because we said it before, it must be right, and because these practitioners have been around for a long time, it must be right. In other words, history is the proof.” When it comes to booting flawed science out of criminal courts, “Daubert,” said Judge Edwards, “has largely been a failure.”33

In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences performed the most sweeping independent survey of the state of forensic science to date. It was a bombshell. “Much forensic evidence—including, for example, bitemarks and firearm and toolmark identifications—is introduced in criminal trials without any meaningful scientific validation, determination of error rates, or reliability testing to explain the limits of the discipline,” the report noted. Forensic examiners in pattern-matching disciplines, it concluded, had no scientific basis for making claims of certainty in court. Professional societies gave no guidelines for testimony. Labs had no standard accreditation or certification procedures. There had been little research on variability, reliability, or human bias. Judge Edwards, who co-chaired one of the report’s subcommittees, said at Harvard, “We found a forensic community in disarray.”34

While some in the forensic community dismissed the report, others embraced its recommendations, and for several years, a spirit of reform was in the air. The overall feeling was that more research was needed. “In forensic science,” says John Murdock, a preeminent former ATF firearm and toolmark examiner, “the research has been done by practitioners.” When we reached him by phone, Murdock was clearing his weekend schedule to participate in a large-scale study sent out by the FBI that required matching sets of fired bullets. He had also paid, out of pocket, to receive samples for a high-quality examiner proficiency test being conducted in the Netherlands using polymer replicas of bullets. He says this test is much more difficult than the relatively easy matching exams usually given by private companies. While these efforts are laudable, placing responsibility in the hands of working practitioners such as Murdock is not a feasible research strategy. Forensics lacks the infrastructure and the funding to support research. “It’s hard to create a research culture when you can’t afford research,” said Victor Weedn, a professor of forensic sciences at George Washington University and past president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. Many argue that the research shouldn’t be done by forensics examiners at all, but by academic scientists, who have university infrastructure and funding and can independently evaluate examiners’ claims.35 “Microscopically, we move from scratches to ridges and valleys. It becomes topography.” — toolmark examiner John O’Neil, testifying before Genrich’s jury in 1991

In 2013, the Department of Justice under President Obama established the National Commission on Forensic Science, an interdisciplinary advisory committee including forensic practitioners as well as prominent scientists and attorneys, as a way of “passing the torch in forensic reform from the National Academy of Sciences.” The commission met quarterly and made nonbinding recommendations to the DOJ, some of which were adopted, including a new code of professional conduct for laboratories and the recommendation to drop the phrase “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty” from examiner testimony—a dangerously misleading statement in the absence of empirical data. Grant funding for research was increased, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology established working groups for each forensic discipline to set standards for the field.36

Then, in 2016, Obama’s scientific advisory council, PCAST, comprising prominent scientists and experts in academia and industry, issued a follow-up report. The years of nominal reform had apparently had little substantive effect on getting unproven “science” out of the courts. “It has become increasingly clear in recent years that lack of rigor in the assessment of the scientific validity of forensic evidence is not just a hypothetical problem but a real and significant weakness in the judicial system,” the report concluded. One of PCAST’s most contentious conclusions was the lack of support for firearm and toolmark analysis. The council found a number of studies that “sought to estimate the accuracy of examiners’ conclusions” but said only one study that included 218 examiners was “appropriately-designed” according to basic scientific standards. Despite examiners’ claims of near-infallibility, that study found a false-match rate of one in 100. A vast body of research of widely varying quality suggests that matching bullets to guns may have a scientific basis, though examiners are nowhere near infallible. For a widespread technique like firearm analysis, the lack of empirical data for error rates was shocking.37

Because PCAST did not directly assess the skill of examiners who match marks from handheld tools like wire-strippers and pliers, we conducted our own review of the field and consulted with several leading toolmark examiners. We found a wealth of literature on the uniqueness of marks and the manufacturing process; a growing literature on quantifying the variability of striations; and results of examiner-proficiency tests. However, we found only a single study, from 2009, that tested toolmark examiners’ abilities in a controlled setting. The FBI tested eight of its own examiners analyzing marks left by screwdrivers. Promisingly, these eight examiners made no errors. But one small study, in which the researchers have a vested interest in the outcome, on one type of tool, is hardly a validation of the field, leaving the crucial question of error rates unanswered. Because firearms are a specialized type of tool, examiners point to firearms studies to support their work with handheld tools, but what seem like logical inferences don’t always hold up: Forensic dentists wrongly thought they could match bite marks because they could identify people from dental remains. Without empirical research, it’s difficult to say if handheld toolmark matching is more like firearms (i.e., needs more research) or more like bite marks (i.e., needs to be abandoned). Regardless, it’s wildly unlikely that examiners can make matches “to the exclusion of all other tools.”38

Rather than spurring a constructive debate about reform, PCAST dramatically widened a growing divide between mainstream academia and the forensic community. As defense attorneys reached for the reports to challenge forensic evidence in court, prosecutors rushed to defend one of their most powerful tools. Battle lines were drawn: Forensic examiners, law enforcement, and prosecutors gathered on one side, defense attorneys and mainstream scientists on the other. It was a perfect political storm.39

5: JIMMY GENRICH’S PAST

Sheila Greenlee wears a bright floral housedress at the dining-room table, smoothing her flyaway gray bob when she needs to gather her thoughts. She is prone to brief fits of giggling when her memory alights on places too painful to stay for long. A grand piano takes up most of the living room in the split-level home she shares with her husband, Wallace, the choir director at the Methodist church where she played the organ for so many years. Their modest house sits at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac on the southwest edge of town, just shy of the sheer-walled canyons of the Colorado National Monument. Sheila describes her son Jimmy as a shy young man who liked books and Nintendo video games. She also says he grew up poor and was abused as a child by his father, a violent drunk. Genrich had two brothers and one sister until his little brother Teddy had a swimming accident one Fourth of July. Genrich was 18 years old, and he was devastated by Teddy’s death.40

James Martinez, a childhood friend who grew up across the street and now owns a motorcycle- and car-repair shop, remembers Genrich as a nerdy kid who rarely spoke unless spoken to. “We were all scared of his father,” says Martinez. “I remember we’d be in his room, listening to AC/DC, and we’d all go out the window when his dad came home. Jimmy would protect his little brother, and get his ass kicked for it.”41

It seemed to Sheila, for a time, that her awkward son might be all right. After high school, Genrich moved to Phoenix to attend DeVry University, where he studied electronics (a fact made much of during the trial). When Martinez moved to Phoenix to work in a custom-hot-rod shop, Genrich was already there. “He had good grades. He was doing well. Where he fell into trouble might have been my fault.” Martinez shakes his head regretfully. “My best friends were all longhairs and bikers in bands.” He introduced the bikers to Genrich, who moved into a spare room in their rowdy house. “People thought he was weird,” says Martinez. “As he got older, he was still the nerd, but he turned into a man. He would say, ‘No woman will ever want me—I’m the ugliest guy in the room.’” His grades at DeVry plummeted and he struggled with a required English class, then eventually dropped out. He was drinking heavily and, Martinez says, picked up a meth habit from his biker housemates.42 “Holy shit, this is not science. It’s like voodoo.” — Genrich’s lawyer Roberta “Bert” Nieslanik on John O’Neil’s toolmark analysis

When investigators later questioned Martinez, he insisted he never saw Genrich making bombs. “I would have known,” he says. “He was living in my house. Jimmy was my friend, but he wasn’t that good of a friend where I would lie for him.”43

Genrich moved back to Grand Junction in July of 1989 and struggled to pull a life together. He worked various jobs, including a stint as a dishwasher at the Two Rivers Convention Center—a boss later described him as “the sole problem employee.” His boss at Suehiro’s, where he was also a dishwasher, told the Daily Sentinel he had a temper. “He would yell at me and leave. Then come back a few days later and say he’s sorry. I always gave him his job back because he’s a good person,” his boss said. “He’s very honest.”44

Genrich desperately wanted a girlfriend but was consumed by frustrations that girls wouldn’t “give him the time of day.” Sheila says he struggled with loneliness. “He craved it, and yet he didn’t want to be alone,” she says. “He used to say to me, ‘Mom, you have to help me find a girlfriend.’” Sheila and Wallace agree that he was increasingly “moody,” and he began to get into trouble for angry outbursts. They took him along on a car trip to Canada, to visit Sheila’s family, and he “threw rocks at cars because the people weren’t friendly.” Back in Grand Junction, Genrich was arrested for breaking the glass of an Albertsons exit door after he claimed employees snubbed him.45

On February 10, 1990, Sheila took her son to St. Mary’s hospital for an involuntary, 72-hour psychiatric evaluation. He had attempted suicide once before, as a teenager, when he swallowed a bottle of aspirin after a girl had rejected him. In an affidavit, later quoted by investigators in a search warrant, Sheila stated that her son “appears to be mentally ill and, as a result of such illness, appears to be a danger to himself or others.”46

There were more outbursts. In 1991, he furiously knocked books from shelves at the library after the librarians, he said, wouldn’t help him. At the Readmor bookstore, where his request for The Anarchist Cookbook made him the lead suspect, Genrich knocked books from shelves and spit on the windows. When asked why her son would want to order that book, Sheila sighs. “Knowing Jimmy, they were probably giving him a hard time.” Genrich later told an ATF agent he had tried to order it to “piss the lady off at the bookstore.”47

After the ATF started trailing him, Genrich met his future lawyer Bert Nieslanik by climbing the steps to the public defender’s office to ask if the agents were allowed to follow him. He complained about them to Nieslanik, to his mother, and to the agents themselves. He took to talking with the agents, sometimes getting into their car for an hour or more to vent his frustrations about his life and ask when they were going to start looking for the real bomber. One night, according to an ATF agent, Genrich came out of his boardinghouse and got into the car with a handful of photographs. “He had brought me pictures of some bookshelves…we were talking about the tools, and he was telling me about this woodworking project that he had…he asked if I wanted to come in and take a look at these pictures, and I declined that night, but he brought the pictures out. He showed me the pictures of bookshelves that he had made for his mom and, also, a postcard of Crazy Horse Monument, up in South Dakota, I believe.”48

Nieslanik says the attention from the ATF agents was a double-edged sword. Genrich had no one else to talk to, but having the feds follow him around made him a target for the town’s fears about the bombings—television-news cameras sometimes followed in the agents’ wake. One night, a man in the Corral attacked Genrich, bringing him to his knees. He was hurt and confused that the agents, who were there, did nothing to protect him. In July, ATF agent Larry Kresl took Genrich to lunch, then said he’d take him to the Job Services Center and help him find a job. Instead, Kresl took him to a room hung with grisly pictures of the victims’ bodies, and tried to elicit a confession. Genrich did not confess.49 “They all matched. It was a perfect match.” — David Trujillo, member of the jury that convicted Genrich, on the pattern-matching forensics

Four days later, agents followed him to Teddy’s grave and suggested Genrich commit suicide “so we can all go home.” After hearing of the agents’ behavior at trial, Judge Massaro said that “more repulsive governmental conduct, absent the infliction of actual harm, is difficult to imagine.”50

In August, a federal agent named Bill Frangis came to Sheila and Wallace’s home and told them the case against Genrich was “overwhelming.” Sheila agitatedly clasps and unclasps her hands on the dining-room table as she remembers. “If the locals got him,” she recalls Frangis telling her, “he would be put to death. But if the feds looked after him, he’d try to save him.” Sheila glances at Wallace, who regards her calmly. “He was charming,” she continues. “I made him tea. He acted like he was going to help us.” Frangis asked Sheila to wear a wire and try to get her son to confess. “I was stunned,” she says, “because I knew that he didn’t do it.” Once she heard about the death penalty, Sheila says, “I was terrified,” but she couldn’t bring herself to wear the wire. Wallace, sensing her agony, stepped in and offered to wear it. “It was just like, his life was in danger,” Wallace recalls in a soft voice. A few weeks later, the feds came back and taped a wire to Wallace’s chest. In a tearful conversation in the living room, while ATF agents sat outside in their car listening in, Sheila and Wallace told Genrich that they loved him, that they would love him no matter what, and that he just needed to tell them if he did it. Sheila says she was trying to save his life. “He looked at me and said, ‘Mom, do you believe I did that?’” Genrich did not confess.51

Before all this, Sheila says, “I believed in [law enforcement] wholeheartedly. I believed in them, A-one. Boy, has that changed. And I don’t say they’re all bad, by any means. But I can understand how they can twist things.”52

Martinez understands that Genrich comes off as “weird.” But, he insists, “He didn’t have a violent bone in his body. He never hurt anybody. He was the one getting hurt.” Martinez shakes his head. “He was like that puppy who’d been beat, and you look at him and their tail goes between their legs, and they’re hunched over. That was Jimmy. Intimidated, you know?” He is particularly skeptical they got the right guy because on April 14, 1989, when the unexploded bomb was found outside the LaCourt motel, Genrich had an ironclad alibi.53

6: REASONABLE DOUBT

One of the remarkable things about the Genrich case is that other than the toolmarks, it was built almost entirely on circumstantial evidence. There was no confession, no reliable eyewitness, no gunpowder, no DNA. Just an isolated, angry young man with a history of mental illness who made women uncomfortable and once asked about The Anarchist Cookbook, who lived in a messy 12-by-12 room with a toolbox and a pile of disturbing handwritten notes. If you believed this was the type of person to carry out a bombing, then the toolmark evidence confirmed what you already suspected to be true.54

But if you trusted the toolmarks, then you’d struggle to explain how O’Neil matched Genrich’s needle-nose pliers to a bomb he couldn’t have planted. On April 14, 1989, the day the unexploded bomb was discovered in the LaCourt motel parking lot, Genrich was 580 miles away, in Phoenix. Registers from Houle’s bookstore showed his handwritten entries recording stock being returned to publishers on the day the bomb was found. The store owner testified that Genrich had worked every day that week, including a six-and-a-half-hour shift on the day the bomb was found. Investigators scoured plane records and car-rental registries but could find no evidence he had left Arizona. The prosecution suggested the circular theory that Genrich could have had an accomplice who planted that bomb, because he couldn’t have set the bomb himself. There was, however, no evidence that pointed to an accomplice. It stretches the imagination to believe Genrich was the 1989 bomber and also to believe O’Neil’s toolmark analysis to be reliable.55

Laying out the evidence in the Genrich case in Polaroid shots provided to The Nation.

One of the key pieces of circumstantial evidence that convinced both the investigators and the jury was the unsettling handwritten notes. In his opening statement, ErkenBrack said, “Mr. Genrich was a very, very angry man, especially with women, but angry at everyone. You will hear Mr. Genrich said time and time again that he had a problem with women.” In the search-warrant affidavit, investigator Bob Russell writes that the Feed Lot bomb was placed near a car’s front right tire, and “this would be the side most ordinarily used by the female.” This logic falls apart a bit, however, when you consider that the Gonzales bomb was placed by a rear tire and the LaCourt motel bomb by the driver’s side. Judge Massaro noted that the bombs did not seem to have been placed in areas obviously frequented by women.56 “Judges believe that because we said it before, it must be right. History is the proof.” —Harry T. Edwards, chief judge for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals

And while the handwritten notes are undoubtedly disturbing, if looked at in a slightly different light, they don’t obviously point to a serial bomber. After Sheila had her son briefly committed, Genrich started seeing a therapist who encouraged him to write down his feelings instead of, as he told The Denver Post, “losing my temper.” According to Genrich, these were the notes the ATF agents found when they searched his home. “I don’t hate women, I really don’t…. I’d get drunk and pissed off, so I’d write it down instead of going out and getting into trouble,” he told the Post. The closest Genrich ever came to a confession was telling the ATF agents, “I’m not a bomber, but I should be a rapist.”57

When Nieslanik first met Genrich, she says, he “looked homeless, unkempt, agitated.” He had trouble making eye contact and seemed paranoid, but she says he wasn’t a bomber. “Cra-zy,” she singsongs, “but innocent.”58

Taken together, the circumstantial evidence against Genrich was ambiguous at best. He could have constructed the electrical circuit, but so could many other people in Grand Junction. He had Buss-type fuses in his toolbox, but no trace of gunpowder was ever found. The letters clearly threatened violence toward women, but the bombs seemed to target random strangers. He lived close to two of the bomb sites, and he was known to take long, meandering walks around town, but it would require steely nerve and a steady gait to carry a bomb with a hair-trigger switch two miles to the Gonzales home. Genrich asked for The Anarchist Cookbook after the bombings had already started. And if you read the book, you’d notice it does not include directions or a diagram that “describes precisely how you make the bombs that were used in this case,” as ErkenBrack claimed in court. Then there’s that ironclad alibi for the LaCourt motel bomb.59

So you’re left with toolmarks. The only match that all examiners agreed on was between a pair of Genrich’s red-handled wire-strippers and scratches left on a piece of baling wire found near the Valentine’s Day bomb. Baling wire, a farm fix-all as common as duct tape in Grand Junction, was not the type of wire included in the “signature bomb,” nor is it particularly well suited for a bomb circuit. In most cases that go to trial, there are multiple converging lines of evidence, but not in the case of Jimmy Genrich. If you believe O’Neil can trace shadow lines across a toolmark’s microscopic ridges and valleys until it all “falls in place,” then Genrich is guilty. But if you believe O’Neil had only to tilt the light just right to bring into view what he was seeking to find, then an innocent man may be in prison.60

7: PROSECUTORS AND NATIONAL REFORM

The 2009 NAS report that upended the nation’s confidence in long-trusted forensic techniques had an unlikely instigator: Jeff Sessions. In 2000, Sessions proposed a bill to increase funding for crime laboratories struggling with backlogs; the bill passed, but most of the money never materialized. Leaders in the forensics community lobbied until the Senate finally included $1.5 million in a 2005 appropriations bill to fund an NAS report “identifying the needs of the forensics community.” It was meant to provide the “basis for legislation” that a senator like Sessions could introduce again to secure more crime-lab funding.61

“He’s a former prosecutor,” says Erin Murphy, a professor of law at NYU and author of Inside the Cell: The Dark Side of Forensic DNA. “He was really interested in helping law enforcement basically use more forensics. He thought he was going to commission a study where they’d come back and say, ‘Well, we need 6,000 more bite-mark examiners and 400 more toolmark examiners.’ Instead, of course, they got the study they got, which basically said half of these sciences are garbage, the other half may have some basis but need more empirical work, there’s rampant overclaiming, there’s rampant bias. It was really a full-throated list of all of the problems in forensics.”62

Sessions rejected the study’s conclusions. “I don’t think we should suggest that those proven scientific principles that we’ve been using for decades are somehow uncertain,” he said in a Senate hearing after the report’s release.63 Attention from federal agents was a doubled-edged sword. Genrich had no one else to talk to, but being followed made him a target.

Prosecutors have a vested interest in resisting reform, because it could weaken one of their most powerful tools, threaten cases currently under way, and call past convictions into question. For years, the DOJ was aware that its hair-comparison examiners made mistakes, but the department did little to address the problem until a whistle-blower came forward in the early 1990s. During an eight-year review of 2,900 cases, the DOJ found several instances of potentially exculpatory evidence but only haphazardly notified defendants, if at all. This review remained secret until 2012, when The Washington Post broke the story that the department had never followed up on its mistakes. In 2015, the DOJ finally conceded that hair-comparison examiners gave flawed testimony in 96 percent of cases, including 33 of 35 death-penalty cases reviewed. Nine of those defendants had already been executed. One defendant served 28 years in prison before being exonerated by DNA testing. In court, the prosecution said it was a “one in 10 million” chance the hairs belonged to someone other than the defendant. One of the hairs turned out to be a dog’s.64

Trusting prosecutors to reform forensics presents a clear conflict of interest. Prosecutors at all levels work closely with forensic practitioners—some crime labs report directly to DA offices—and they see themselves as being on the same team. When that relationship is too cozy, unconscious cognitive bias can curdle casework (such as examiners unconsciously seeking evidence that confirms opinions held by law enforcement). While some communication between prosecutors and forensic practitioners may be necessary, practices designed to curb cognitive bias vary widely. Police departments frequently share crucial information about cases, so examiners know what their colleagues want them to find. Crime labs in at least a dozen states receive funding through court fees—but only when their analyses result in convictions. In the Genrich case, O’Neil was flown to Grand Junction to meet with prosecutors during the course of his analysis. ErkenBrack was even present in the lab for the retest. Prosecutors rely on examiners to solve crimes and win convictions.65

Still, prosecutors have a legal and ethical obligation not to present evidence they know isn’t true in court. Unfortunately, like judges, most prosecutors are not equipped to evaluate the scientific merit of forensic techniques, and even if they are acting in good faith, the incentives are all wrong. Prosecutors feel immense pressure to present forensic evidence to juries—many prosecutors believe juries can be reluctant to convict without it—a phenomenon dubbed “the CSI effect.” Bill Fitzpatrick, district attorney of New York’s Onondaga County and a past president of the National District Attorneys Association, says “people forget we are seekers of the truth,” but he has been a vocal opponent of efforts to limit forensic-expert testimony. “What are we going to say? ‘That fingerprint maybe came from that hand’? ‘That bullet maybe came from that gun’? No, we’d get no convictions.” Acknowledging the limitations of forensic techniques is perceived as opening the door to reasonable doubt.66

Scandals like the DOJ’s hair-comparison cover-up have shaken public confidence in forensic evidence and prosecutors’ willingness to own up to mistakes, yet many prosecutors maintain faith in a system shown repeatedly to fail. “There are many layers to protect the judicial process when we’re talking about scientific evidence,” says Mike Ramos, district attorney of San Bernardino County and another former president of the NDAA. “Every time I’ve used the scientific-based evidence, it has been tested. They do an analysis, and that’s brought before the jury—‘here’s how it was done, here’s how it was tested’—to make sure that it was based on a protocol that has been used, and has gone through the tests, through all of the layers.” In any case, this reasoning goes, the defense can challenge any claim in an evidentiary hearing, as well as cross-examine expert witnesses, and, in the end, there’s a jury to decide. “We still have a system in place that I believe works,” says Ramos. “The last thing we want to do is convict someone who’s innocent.”67

When asked if there were any conflicts of interest in prosecutorial agencies such as the DOJ overseeing forensic-science reform, Ramos said, “I don’t see a bias.”68

One of the NAS report’s first recommendations was that reform be independent of prosecutorial agencies. It suggested a new federal agency, the National Institute of Forensic Science, an independent body (a bit like the FDA) that would encourage empirical testing of forensic techniques before they enter the courts, establish mandatory lab accreditation and examiner certification, and standardize expert testimony. Judge Edwards, who co-chaired one of the NAS committees, said at the Harvard event last October, “One of our most important recommendations was not having forensic science reform in DOJ. Prosecution is not consistent with a culture of science. We unanimously viewed that DOJ had to be kept out of it.”69

The independent body suggested by the NAS was never created, and the DOJ has pushed back against independent reform. When Obama suggested PCAST look into forensic science, co-chair Eric Lander, a biologist at MIT and Harvard and leader of the Human Genome Project who also serves on the board of the Innocence Project, took the idea to the DOJ: “They had a fit,” he said at Harvard last October. “‘You realize this could jeopardize existing cases and past convictions?’” Reform that acknowledges long-standing problems with forensic evidence would, indeed, be deeply disruptive. It could mean that some people who have committed crimes would go free, but it would also mean that innocent people would be freed, and that serious flaws in the justice system could be corrected.70

When the report was issued, Attorney General Loretta Lynch disavowed its conclusions: “While we appreciate their contribution to the field of scientific inquiry,” she said, “the department will not be adopting the recommendations related to the admissibility of forensic science evidence.”71

Two months after being sworn in as attorney general, Sessions allowed the National Commission on Forensic Science to expire and suspended the ongoing review of examiner-testimony standards. A new Justice Department Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, established by executive order to “support law enforcement” and “restore public safety,” now oversees forensic science at the national level. Sessions has appointed a new senior adviser on forensics to lead an internal Forensic Science Working Group in conducting a “needs assessment of forensic science laboratories that examines workload, backlog, personnel and equipment needs of public crime laboratories,” as well as to “strengthen the foundations of forensic science.” In public statements, Sessions has returned to his rhetoric of the early 2000s: The purpose of forensic-science “reform” is to reduce crime-lab backlogs, and should be run by law enforcement and forensic practitioners. Prosecutors applauded Sessions’s move to put the DOJ back in charge.72

It’s still unclear how the DOJ will handle its newfound mandate, but Sessions’s pick to lead the internal Forensic Science Working Group offers a clue. Ted Hunt, a Missouri prosecutor, was a member of the now-defunct National Commission on Forensic Science, where he voted against many reform measures, including crime-lab oversight measures and scientific evaluations of forensic methods. Although the DOJ revived its review of expert-testimony standards last August, Hunt was also one of just two members of the NCFS to oppose dropping the misleading phrase “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty” from examiners’ testimony.73

Hunt has stayed out of the limelight since his appointment, but records we obtained from recent meetings are revealing. In a meeting of the federal judiciary’s Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence, Hunt blasted PCAST for its “narrow” definition of science and called PCAST’s insistence on empirical research methods “wrong and ill-advised.” At an October meeting at the National Academy of Sciences, he stated that “the jury is still out on bite marks,” inspiring at least two other participants to state firmly that “the jury is not out” on bite marks. Further, Hunt declared that how best to establish a method’s scientific validity amounts to a “difference of opinion.” At that point in the meeting, an MIT sociologist, Susan Silbey, felt compelled to speak up. She began reading out loud the requirements from PCAST’s report, such as having sufficient sample sizes and blinding subjects from the test. “PCAST is requesting basic scientific research methods. I teach scientific methodology every Friday at 9 am. This is what I teach in my class.”74

Both Hunt and the DOJ declined to comment on whether they support dropping the scientifically dubious phrase “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty” from examiner testimony. When asked if he thought prosecutors might have reasons to resist reforms that soften the language of examiners’ claims in court, Hunt replied, “I can unequivocally say that I don’t know of any prosecutor who would consciously choose to offer unreliable evidence or rely on faulty statements of probative value—whether forensic or not. The prosecutor’s duty is to seek justice, not win convictions.” While internal discussions about reform are clearly ongoing, the prosecutorial community’s stance seems to be, basically: “trust us.”75

Judge Edwards, who helped write the 2009 NAS report and watched Silbey deliver her rebuke, took stock at the Harvard meeting. “Part of our worst fears have been realized…[the] DOJ is now the self-anointed leader of the forensic science reform. Which is a disaster.”76

8: THE FUTURE OF FORENSICS

When Genrich learned that his case was going to be taken up by the Innocence Project, he was thrilled. Unlike most of the cases the nonprofit takes on, there is no DNA evidence that could exonerate him (there rarely is in bombing cases). Instead, his new team of lawyers is arguing that the scientific consensus around toolmark evidence has changed. Leading scientists at the NAS and PCAST say toolmark matching has not yet proved to be a scientifically reliable method, and they agree that the kind of testimony O’Neil gave is scientifically indefensible. The Innocence Project argues that this constitutes “newly discovered evidence” and that Genrich deserves a new trial. Thirty-six prominent scientists, legal scholars, and forensics experts have signed an amicus brief in support.77

“The legal concept of newly discovered evidence including a change in science,” says Chris Fabricant of the Innocence Project, who is litigating Genrich’s case, “is in my view a no-brainer. It was presented to a jury as infallible, and today we know it’s not. There is an obligation—an ethical, a legal, and a moral obligation—to go back and correct the record where exaggerated claims may have led to a miscarriage of justice.” When Bert Nieslanik called up the statistician on a hunch that the science was flawed, she was a voice in the wilderness. There was no scientific consensus to support her. Fabricant says that “in a way, she was ahead of her time.”78

Genrich’s appeal is among the first of a new flurry of post-conviction challenges based on the lack of research to support the pattern-matching forensic disciplines. The Innocence Project has filed appeals challenging bite marks and shaken-baby syndrome and, just last December, filed an amicus brief in a Maryland firearm case. Yet only two states—California and Texas—have passed statutes stating that a change in scientific consensus alone can constitute “newly discovered evidence.” These special statutes were advanced because higher courts have proved skittish about granting new trials when the scientific evidence used to convict has since become controversial or even discredited. In one case, the California Supreme Court failed to grant the defendant a new trial even when the bite-mark examiner recanted his testimony over 10 years later. That maddening ruling spurred the new California law, and only after its passage did the court finally exonerate the wrongfully convicted man. In states without special statutes, such as Colorado, appeals face a much tougher uphill battle to create new precedent that could be used to keep scientifically flawed expert testimony out of courtrooms in the future.79

The rulings on cases such as Genrich’s will arrive at a critical moment for American criminal justice, which is on the cusp of an explosion of next-generation forensic techniques. Like so many other aspects of modern life, criminal justice is becoming automated. Artificial intelligence predicts criminal “hotspots” so police can be there at the ready. Software sold at $60,000 a pop to police departments helps them analyze minute amounts of DNA in complex mixtures from multiple people. The new field of digital forensics promises new techniques to parse large amounts of data. These technologies, by and large, are sold by for-profit companies, which means their algorithms are proprietary trade secrets. Their inner workings are invisible to lawyers mounting a defense. Juries will hardly be equipped to decide for themselves what weight to give a piece of sophisticated, impenetrable science presented as forensic evidence. Says Murphy, the NYU law professor, “Some of the bad habits of the first generation—the secrecy, the government bias, the overclaiming, the stretching without offering empirical support, the failure of judges to curb that behavior—that is going to be on steroids.”80 CRIMINAL JUSTICE Prosecutors Are Banding Together to Prevent Criminal-Justice Reform Jessica Pishko

Recently, a few intrepid judges have acknowledged that the problems with forensic science can’t be ignored any longer. In 2016, Judge Catherine Easterly, on the DC Court of Appeals, wrote in a robbery case involving a firearm, “As matters currently stand, a certainty statement regarding toolmark pattern matching has the same probative value as the vision of a psychic: it reflects nothing more than the individual’s foundationless faith in what he believes to be true.” Murphy, who signed on to the amicus brief supporting Genrich’s appeal, says favorable rulings like Judge Easterly’s could help change the legal landscape. “The more a court of high regard makes a ruling that says this is not a legitimate science, or this practice that stands in courtrooms across America…won’t stand in our state, people notice,” she says. “Lawyers making those arguments can say, ‘Look it’s not just me with my tinfoil hat, the Supreme Court of Colorado agrees.’”81

When Nieslanik, who is now retired, heard about the NAS and PCAST reports, her response was, “What took them so long?” Genrich has now been in prison for nearly a quarter century, and there is still a deeply troubling disconnect between what constitutes scientific proof and what is accepted as legal evidence. “We weren’t proving Jimmy’s innocence,” Nieslanik says. “We were really focused on ‘this isn’t a science.’ I can tell you from doing triple-digit jury trials, the jurors really want concrete evidence. Because it’s a very hard decision to make. And that’s why scientific evidence is so dangerous when it’s not a real science, because it is persuasive.”82

Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article did not clearly differentiate between the methods of the three exoneration studies described. The Innocence Project, the National Registry of Exonerations, and an academic study by Gould et al. each looked at different sets of cases and used different methods to determine whether faulty forensics was a factor in exonerations. The article also inaccurately described John Murdock’s employment and his participation in an FBI study. He formerly worked for ATF, not the FBI; he was working on a study sent out by the FBI, not a proficiency test. The text has been corrected."

Bigotry and national security have, sadly, close and old ties in American history. National-security concerns mixed with anti-Semitism delayed our acceptance of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. Racism combined with panic after Pearl Harbor led to the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans. This year, in the name of national security, we have allowed at least 117 people to die in the desert rather than welcome them across our southern border, and over the past decade have wrenched at least 2 million people from their families with a record-setting pace of deportation. Throughout our history, these kinds of inhumane policy choices have been sold with dehumanizing rhetoric about those we define as threats. Ad Policy

So while Donald Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States is shameful, it’s best understood as the extreme expression of a dangerous theme in American politics—one that has dominated the Republican primary. It’s in this context that 11 of the 13 GOP presidential candidates oppose allowing any Syrian refugees into the country at all. The two who think otherwise—Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz—would admit only the Christian ones. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whose standing in the polls has risen in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings, has said that even Syrian orphans under the age of 5 represent a potential danger and should be turned away.

More Americans put terrorism at the top of their concerns today than at any time since 9/11, according to a recent poll by The New York Times. There is no denying the threat posed by the Islamic State and those whom it inspires—a threat felt most acutely by Muslims in Syria and Iraq, we must stress. But as Robert Dear reminded us when he killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic just days before Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik murdered 14 in San Bernardino, extremist violence comes in many forms. According to a study by the New America Foundation, more Americans have been killed in domestic terrorist attacks by right-wing zealots than by jihadists since 9/11.

What all of these attacks have in common is neither religion nor national identity, but weaponry. The terror that most urgently threatens our safety today is that of guns. Commentators are now debating what constitutes a “mass shooting.” One standard counts any incident in which four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire; by this measure, there have been 353 mass shootings in 350 days so far this year. Another counts only those incidents in which four or more people are killed; by this measure, there have been 22 mass shootings so far this year in the United States—a world-leading statistic. But whichever number you choose, it’s still too many, and it doesn’t even take into account the daily toll of individuals killed by gun violence. More than 400,000 people were killed by guns between the 9/11 attacks and 2013, the most recent year for which data are available. We are so awash in shooting deaths that these lost lives don’t even register as news.

The firearms industry’s defenders, posing as civil libertarians, have responded to growing calls for more gun control by peddling the idea that no amount of regulation will guarantee that killers can’t kill. This truism is hardly a reason to make mass murder easier. It’s no reason to allow the legal possession of high-capacity magazines designed to facilitate rapid, indiscriminate firing. It’s no argument against universal background checks as a basic provision for purchasing a deadly weapon, no justification for the fact that it’s easier to buy a gun than to cast a vote in some states.

Americans are rightly concerned about violence, whether that comes in the form of terrorist attacks or quotidian shootings. The Trumps of the world would like us to channel this fear into irrational bigotry; it would be better harnessed as outrage against the firearms industry’s grasp on our lawmakers. Until our political leaders find the courage to fight a war on guns, we will all live with the daily threat of gun terror."

Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association (NRA), has famously claimed that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.” Ad Policy

Much of today’s opposition to stronger gun safety regulations rests on the gun lobby’s Hobbesian vision of self-sufficient, heavily-armed citizens standing up to vicious thugs. This Die Hard argument is constantly parroted by politicians and conservative pundits. But the statistical reality is that for every justifiable homicide in the United States—for every lethal shooting in defense of life or property—guns are used to commit 34 murders and 78 suicides, and are the cause of two accidental deaths, according to an analysis of FBI data by The Washington Post.

LaPierre, a career lobbyist, has no clue what it’s like to use a firearm in anger. But The Nation spoke to several people who do—including combat veterans and former law enforcement officers—and who believe that the NRA’s heroic gunslinger mythology is a dangerous fantasy that bears little resemblance to reality. Retired Army Sergeant Rafael Noboa y Rivera, who led a combat team in Iraq, says that most soldiers only function effectively after they’ve been exposed to fire a number a times. “I think there’s this fantasy world of gunplay in the movies, but it doesn’t really happen that way,” he says. “When I heard gunfire [in Iraq], I didn’t immediately pick up my rifle and react. I first tried to ascertain where the shooting was coming from, where I was in relation to the gunfire and how far away it was. I think most untrained people are either going to freeze up, or just whip out their gun and start firing in that circumstance,” Noboa said. “I think they would absolutely panic.”

Those interviewed for this article agreed that the key distinction isn’t between “good guys” and “bad guys,” because intentions are less important than the rigorous—and continuous—training that it takes to effectively handle firearms in high-stress situations.

Dr. Pete Blair, an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas State University and director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center (ALERRT), has studied mass shooting incidents and trains law enforcement personnel to respond to active-shooter situations. The cops who go through his course conduct live-fire exercises using real firearms which are re-chambered to fire “soap rounds” that leave only welts when they hit. For every justifiable homicide in the US, guns are used to commit 34 murders and 78 suicides.

Blair’s trainees run through a number of real-world scenarios—“force on force training” that’s designed to “inoculate” officers against the problems people naturally encounter in high-stress situations. That stress response, says Blair, includes “tunnel vision, audio exclusion and time dilation,” and one would expect people who weren’t trained in these situations to “freeze up or not know what to do, and to have difficulty performing actions correctly.”

Weekend-long tactical training courses for civilians are growing in popularity. But these courses offer only a shadow of what’s required, says David Chipman, a former agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Chipman, who spent several years on the agency’s SWAT team, says, “Training for a potentially deadly encounter meant, at a minimum, qualifying four times a year throughout my 25-year career. And this wasn’t just shooting paper—it meant doing extensive tactical exercises. And when I was on the SWAT team we had to undergo monthly tactical training.”

Tactical officers typically receive training in “judgmental shooting,” which includes knowing when it’s prudent to hold their fire, and “blue-on-blue awareness,” which drills into them the importance of considering whether other cops are present, including officers who aren’t in uniform. They’re trained to overcome tunnel vision by looking not only at their target but also maintaining an awareness of who or what is behind it. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

“The notion that you have a seal of approval just because you’re not a criminal—that you walk into a gun store and you’re ready for game-day—is ridiculous,” says Chipman.

A case in Texas two weeks ago highlights the risks of civilians intervening in chaotic situations. Police say that as two carjackers struggled with the owner of a car at a gas station in northeast Houston, a witness decided to take action into his own hands. He fired several shots, but missed the perpetrators and shot the owner of the car in the head. He then picked up his shell casings and fled the scene. Police are still looking for the shooter.

The potential for that kind of outcome is why most police agencies strongly recommend that concealed carry holders only use their weapons as an absolute last resort, and not intervene in robberies or other crimes in which they’re not directly involved. David Chipman notes that even police officers are told that if they encounter a crime in progress while off-duty, “maybe the best thing to do at that time is not to take lethal action but instead try to be the best witness you can be.”

Not pulling a weapon is often the wisest course of action in active-shooter situations. While a number of conservatives declared that Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, the scene of a mass shooting last week, was a gun-free zone, the truth is that several concealed carry holders were present, and they wisely decided to leave their guns holstered. Veteran John Parker later explained to MSNBC, “We could have opened ourselves up to be potential targets ourselves, and not knowing where SWAT was… if we had our guns ready to shoot, they could think that we were bad guys.” “I think there’s this fantasy world of gunplay in the movies, but it doesn’t really happen that way.” —Retired Army Sargeant Rafael Noboa y Rivera

David Chipman says the Secret Service’s history is instructive. “Here’s an agency that has all the weaponry that they could ever need, all the training that they could ever need, and they’ve never fired a weapon in defense of a president during an assassination attempt. You’re trained to throw your body in front of the protectee, not to open fire. Just look at the picture taken immediately after Reagan was shot and count the guns in that photograph. They’re all being held by highly-trained experts and not one of them fired. They didn’t shoot [would-be assassin John] Hinckley. And that’s because you’re likely to do more harm than good in that situation.”

The gun lobby and some conservative politicians have seized on a “study” by Davi Barker, a conservative blogger, which purports to show that when a “good guy with a gun” is present during a mass shooting, an average of 2.5 people die, but in similar situations where nobody is armed, there are an average of 18 deaths.

It’s provided the basis for claims that gun-free zones are, in former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee’s words, “sitting duck zones.” But Barker later admitted that his methodology entailed analyzing “10 shootings I found listed on some timeline somewhere.… I honestly don’t even remember where.” And Pete Blair from Texas State notes that by definition, shootings with fewer than four casualties aren’t “mass shootings,” and incidents with as many as 18 casualties are exceedingly rare. Blair acknowledges the possibility that shooters may be more likely to seek out places they see as soft targets, like gun-free zones, but adds, “Trying to prove that is difficult to do.” A firearm makes a person almost twice as likely to become the victim of a homicide and three times more likely to commit suicide.

Blair co-authored a study for the FBI that looked at 185 mass shooting events over a 13-year period. It found that while around one-in-five were stopped by civilians before police arrived, in only one case was it done by a typical “good guy with a gun” (professionals—an off-duty cop and an armed security guard—used their guns to stop two others). In most cases Blair and his colleague studied, civilians ended a rampage by tackling the assailant.

None of this has prevented the gun manufacturers’ lobby from insisting that more guns make a society safer. And many Americans have come to believe it. According to the Pew Research Center, the share of gun owners who cite “protection” as “the main reason they own a gun” almost doubled between 1999 and 2013, from 26 percent to 48 percent.

But a large body of empirical evidence finds the opposite to be true. Last year, epidemiologists at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted an extensive analysis of data from 16 previous peer-reviewed studies, and found that having access to a firearm makes a person almost twice as likely to become the victim of a homicide and three times more likely to commit suicide. Previous research has shown that countries with higher rates of gun ownership also have higher rates of gun deaths and states with more guns have higher homicide rates. (The gun lobby’s side of the scholarly debate rests largely on the discredited and allegedly fraudulent work of economist John Lott.)

Rafael Noboa y Rivera scoffed at the idea, adding that he’s personally wary of “untrained yahoos” who “think they’re Wyatt Earp.”

“Despite what we see on TV, the presence of a firearm is a greater risk, especially in the hands of an untrained person,” says David Chipman, the former ATF agent. “Someone can always say, ‘If your mother is being raped by 5 people, wouldn’t you want her to have a gun?’ Well, OK, if you put it that way, I’d say yes, but that’s not a likely scenario. The question is: If you see someone running out of a gas station with a gun in their hand, do you want an untrained person jumping out and opening fire. For me, the answer is clearly ‘no.’”

Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this piece incorrectly stated that last week’s shootings in Oregon ended when the shooter was tackled."

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada speaks to reporters following the Democratic policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) Ad Policy

In the wake of the horrific mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, support for re-banning assault weapons grew exponentially inside and outside of the Beltway. It's only natural when an AR-15 is used to slaughter twenty schoolchildren and six educators, only months after another was used to shoot seventy-one people inside a movie theater.

Yesterday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel—seen as recently as 2006 recruiting pro-gun Democrats to run in House races—said that Newtown was a “tipping point, a galvanization for action.” He’s now calling for an assault weapons ban, expanded background checks, and is ordering Chicago municipal pension funds to divest from all gun manufacturers.

Indeed, it was a tipping point. Five days after the shootings, President Obama stood in the White House briefing room and explicitly called for another assault weapons ban, and Vice President Joe Biden is expected to recommend one this week. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she’d introduce a strong bill in the Senate, and all the pieces looked to be in place.

But in the past twenty-four hours, there have been disturbing signs of pre-emptive surrender by key Democrats on the assault weapons ban.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told a PBS affiliate in Las Vegas that he didn’t think the assault weapons ban could pass the House, and thus he wanted would “focus” on what could. His comments echoed many pro-gun talking points about Hollywood and violent video games, and Reid openly tried to throw cold water on the gun-control movement:

“We have too much violence in our society, and it’s not just from guns. It’s from a lot of stuff. And I think we should take a look at TV, movies, video games and weapons. And I hope that everyone will just be careful and cautious. […] “Let’s just look at everything. I don’t think we need to point to anything now,” he said. “We need to be very cool and cautious. […] “I think that the American people want us to be very cautious what we do. I think they want us to do things that are logical, smart, and make the country safer, not just be doing things that get a headline in a newspaper.”

On Monday, Representative Mike Thompson—appointed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to head the House’s gun violence prevention task force—also signaled surrender on the assault weapons ban, according to Politico:

Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Democrats’ gun violence task force, said the magazine ban and universal registration requirement would be far more effective than an assault weapons ban without the political cost. “Probably the most recognizable thing you can say in this debate is ban assault weapons,” Thompson said. “But the other two issues” – forbidding high-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring universal registration for gun purchases – “those two things have more impact on making our neighborhoods safe than everything else combined. Anytime you try and prohibit what kind of gun people has it generates some concern.”

It’s not that Reid and Thompson are necessarily wrong in their political calculus—maybe an assault weapons ban can’t pass the House.

But publicly dooming the effort before it starts is self-enforcing, and repeats a Democratic proclivity that has frustrated progressives to no end: heading into negotiations and votes with a pre-compromised position.

Americans favor an assault weapons ban 58-39, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll released Monday. The president is about to stick his neck out and propose it, and then push for it in the weeks to come. Moreover, as Thompson and Reid both correctly noted, it’s the headline-grabbing issue here: rampages with assault weapons are what is driving the momentum on gun control.

Democrats would naturally be wise to push forward aggressively on the ban, as they have mostly done up to this point. If they fail, they fail. At least they’d likely be able to wrest more concessions from the GOP on background checks and high-capacity magazine bans during the legislative battle, and potentially force Republicans into a difficult vote where they would effectively be supporting military style weapons on the street.

Yet, it appears Reid and Thompson—absolutely key figures in the legislative battles in the Senate and House respectively—want to drop the assault weapons ban from the legislative agenda. It’s not yet clear that they will, but even signaling a lack of confidence is damaging to both the legislative prospects for meaningful gun control, and for public attitudes and activist motivation. And it’s not the debate demanded by what happened in Newtown.

In the wake of the mass shooting in suburban Virginia last week that left House majority whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and three others wounded, conservatives have been furiously waving the bloody shirt. With left-wing hate filling half the screen, Sean Hannity blamed Democrats, saying they “dehumanize Republicans and paint them as monsters.” Tucker Carlson claimed that “some on the hard left” support political violence because it “could lead to the dissolution of a country they despise.” Others have blamed seemingly anything even vaguely identified with liberalism for inciting the violence—from Madonna to MSNBC to Shakespeare in the Park. Ad Policy

This is all a truly remarkable example of projection. In the wake of the shooting, Erick Erickson wrote a piece titled, “The Violence is Only Getting Started,” as if three innocent people hadn’t been brutally murdered by white supremacists in two separate incidents in just the past month.

In the real world, since the end of the Vietnam era, the overwhelming majority of serious political violence—not counting vandalism or punches thrown at protests, but violence with lethal intent—has come from the fringes of the right. Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project says that “if you go back to the 1960s, you see all kinds of left-wing terrorism, but since then it’s been exceedingly rare.” She notes that eco- and animal-rights extremists caused extensive property damage in the 1990s, but didn’t target people.

Meanwhile, says Beirich, “right-wing domestic terrorism has been common throughout that period, going back to groups like to The Order, which assassinated [liberal talk-radio host] Alan Berg [in 1984] right through to today.” Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told NPR that “when you look at murders committed by domestic extremists in the United States of all types, right-wing extremists are responsible for about 74 percent of those murders.” The actual share is higher still, as violence committed by ultraconservative Islamic supremacists isn’t included in tallies of “right-wing extremism.”

A 2015 survey of law-enforcement agencies conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that the police rate antigovernment extremists as a greater threat than reactionary Islamists. The authors wrote that “right-wing violence appears consistently greater than violence by Muslim extremists in the United States since 9/11, according to multiple definitions in multiple datasets.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, “Sovereign Citizens”—fringe antigovernmentalists—launched 24 violent attacks from 2010 through 2014, mostly against law enforcement personnel. When Robert Dear shot and killed three people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015, it became the latest in a series of bloody attacks on abortion providers dating back to Roe v. Wade in 1973. In the 30 years that followed that landmark decision, providers and clinics were targeted in more than 300 acts of violence, including arson, bombings, and assassinations, according to a study by the Rand Corporation.

But while the extreme right has held a near-monopoly on political violence since the 1980s, conservatives and Republicans are no more likely to say that using force to achieve one’s political goals is justified than are liberals and Democrats. That’s the conclusion of a study conducted by Nathan Kalmoe, a professor of political communication at the University of Louisiana. In 2010, he asked respondents whether they agreed that various violent tactics were acceptable. Kalmoe found that less than 3 percent of the population strongly agreed that “sometimes the only way to stop bad government is with physical force,” or that “some of the problems citizens have with government could be fixed with a few well-aimed bullets.” He says that while “there were tiny [partisan] variations on these specific items,” they weren’t “statistically significant on average.”

Ideology alone isn’t a significant risk factor for violence. “There’s a much stronger factor of individual personality traits that predispose people to be more aggressive in their everyday lives,” Kalmoe says, “and we see that playing out with people who engage in political violence.” Mass shooters are often found to have had histories of domestic violence, and that was true for James Hodgkinson, the shooter who attacked the congressional baseball practice in Virginia. Kalmoe says, “we often see that violent individuals have a history of violence in their personal lives. People who are abusive, or who have run afoul of the law in other ways, are more likely to endorse violence.”

Political animosity is similarly bipartisan. According to Pew, roughly the same number of Republicans and Democrats—around half—say they feel anger and fear toward the opposing party.

Which raises an important question: If red and blue America fear and loathe one another equally, and a similar number believe that political violence is acceptable, then why is there so much more of it on the fringes of the right?

Part of the answer lies in a clear difference between right and left: For the past 40 years, Republicans, parroting the gun-rights movement, have actively promoted the idea that firearms are a vital bulwark against government tyranny.

.@Judgenap: Why do we have a Second Amendment? It’s not to shoot deer. It’s to shoot at the government when it becomes tyrannical! —Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 23, 2016

Call it the Minutemen theory of gun rights. While the Second Amendment was framed to protect government-organized militias at a time when we had a very small standing army, the right has promoted the idea that it’s “America’s first freedom,” integral to defending our other rights, since the 1960s.

It’s become ubiquitous, from the militia movement that arose in the 1980s and has seen a resurgence in recent years, to the armed standoffs at the Bundy Ranch and the Malheur National Wildlife refuge. It animated Timothy McVeigh to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, as well as the 2013 Los Angeles airport shooting spree, a 2014 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left two cops and one civilian dead and a number of less dramatic acts of violence.

The belief that democratic government rests on the Second Amendment has become widespread among Americans; one poll found that about two-thirds believe that “their constitutional right to own a gun was intended to ensure their freedom.” But Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of several books on the politics of guns, says that’s a modern idea. While “there’s a long tradition of some in America feeling deeply mistrustful of our government—and there have been incidents throughout our history where people took up arms against the government—the more specific idea that there’s a right to rebel, or that somehow you can keep the government under control by taking up weapons, found its first serious expression in a law review article published in 1960. And the idea really took hold among a subset of Americans and a subset of gun owners, who argue to this day that this was part of the purpose of the Second Amendment. They talk about the Minutemen and the Revolutionary War and the Declaration of Independence. The idea really took hold in the 1970s and 1980s when the NRA itself began to use this same kind of rhetoric.”

It’s also infused right-wing politics beyond the gun lobby. Watering the “tree of liberty” with the “blood of patriots and tyrants” is a common theme in Tea Party circles, where the Gadsden flag—don’t tread on me!—and loose talk of revolution blend seamlessly with mainstream anti-tax ideology and disdain for liberals. While a handful of Democrats competing in red states have run ads featuring them firing weapons, it’s become almost universal in Republican campaigns, where it not only marks a candidate’s opposition to gun-safety legislation but also signals that he or she is ready to wage war against the Washington establishment.

War as a metaphor for politics isn’t limited to the right, but it has become a constant in conservative discourse. “The first shots of the second American civil war have already been fired,” said Alex Jones earlier this month. “We are in a clear-cut cultural civil war,” according to Newt Gingrich. Pat Buchanan offered that we’re “approaching something of a civil war,” and said that it’s time for Trump to “burn down the Bastille.” “You ain’t got any idea of the war that’s raging outside the four walls of the church,” religious-right activist Dave Daubenmire told a crowd of antigay protesters last weekend. “Don’t you understand what’s going on? Don’t you know it’s a war? Don’t you know they want your children? Don’t you understand that those same people singing ‘Jesus loves you this I know’ want to kill us?” Then there’s the quasi-apocalyptic prepper mentality, which holds that we’re on the brink of social collapse so you’d better buy gold and stock up on ammo for when the shit inevitably hits the fan.

Nathan Kalmoe says that there’s “an important distinction to make between people who have more conventional views, versus people who have much more extreme views.” He thinks that, whether on the left or the right, those who are at least somewhat close to the mainstream “probably have a greater commitment to nonviolent approaches to politics and are socialized into nonviolent norms of how participation is supposed to work.” But on the right those lines have become blurred in recent years—Glenn Beck’s goldbuggery, the ravings of the “alt-right” and the Minutemen theory of gun rights have all become features of the larger conservative landscape, even if they’re not quite mainstream.

Kalmoe says that rhetoric alone “isn’t the main cause of political violence, but violent language and vilifying opponents can nudge people in ways that make them think and act more aggressively in politics.” He conducted an experiment that first measured subjects’ aggressive personality traits. Then he exposed them to two imaginary political ads, one that employed mildly violent political rhetoric and one that used neutral language, and he found that those subjects who had already displayed a penchant for aggressive behavior were far more likely to support political violence after being exposed to the violent rhetoric. So it’s not that violent rhetoric causes real-world violence so much as it can “make people who behave aggressively in real-life more likely to endorse violence against political leaders.”

Liberals believe that mature institutions and the separation of powers are what keep tyranny at bay, not an AR-15. If James Hodgkinson looked around himself and saw a president who acts as if he’s above the law and a Congress that’s working in the dark to strip away health insurance from millions of people to finance tax cuts for the wealthy but is unwilling to perform its oversight duties, and decided that he would stand up to tyranny with an assault rifle, he would have taken a theme that’s exceedingly common on the right to its bloody logical conclusion."

Race dominated the coverage of the 2014 shooting of John Crawford. Crawford was a young black man gunned down by white cops in a Beaverton Creek, Ohio, Walmart as he talked to his girlfriend on the phone while absentmindedly holding a BB gun he had grabbed from a store shelf. Ohio is an “open-carry” state where it’s perfectly legal to walk around with a loaded AR-15. Ad Policy

What got less attention is that less than two weeks before the shooting, the officer who shot Crawford had been trained to respond to “active shooter situations” by shooting first and asking questions later.

According to The Guardian, officer Sean Williams and his colleagues were “taught to keep in mind that ‘the suspect wants a body count’ and therefore officers should immediately engage a would-be gunman with ‘speed, surprise and aggressiveness.’” At that training, they were told to imagine that a crazed gunman was threatening their own relatives.

Dispatchers led Williams and his partner to believe that an active-shooter situation was underway. Store surveillance video showed that Crawford was shot and killed just seconds after police made contact with him, and probably had no idea what was happening. They followed their training, acting with speed, surprise, and aggressiveness.

Thanks in large part to pressure brought by Black Lives Matter activists, some police experts are calling for a complete overhaul in the way cops are trained, both as cadets and during the “in-service” training they receive over the course of their careers. There are no national standards for training police, and the amount and quality of their instruction varies from agency to agency. But a survey of 280 police departments conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), a Washington, DC–based think tank, found that American cops are given extensive preparation for using violence, and very little guidance on how to avoid it.

The median police recruit in the United States will receive 129 hours of instruction on defensive techniques and using his or her gun, baton, OC-spray, and Taser. That cadet will receive another 24 hours of scenario-based training, drilling on things like when to shoot or hold fire. The median trainee also gets 48 hours of instruction on constitutional law and his or her department’s use-of-force policies.

But that same future police officer will receive only eight hours of training in conflict de-escalation. And despite the fact that a quarter of the 838 citizens shot dead by police this year showed symptoms of mental-health issues, according to The Washington Post, the median cadet gets only eight hours of training in crisis intervention.

The study paints a similar picture with in-service training. A total of 59 percent of a cop’s time is spent on using their weapons or defending themselves. That’s more than four times as much time that he or she will spend on de-escalation and crisis intervention. Almost all of the agencies surveyed offer their cops continual training with firearms, but over a third offer zero in-service instruction on conflict de-escalation.

Chuck Wexler, PERF’s executive director, tells The Nation, “The reason that’s important and significant is that the way officers are trained makes them dependent on the strategies they’ve learned. So if they’ve spent a lot of time on firearms and what we call less-lethal weapons, to the detriment of de-escalation and crisis intervention, they’re much more likely to use a higher level of force than might be necessary.” The median police recruit gets only 8 hours of training in conflict de-escalation.

Wexler and his colleagues have studied policing in the United Kingdom, where most officers are unarmed. While he acknowledges that the environment in which those cops operate—American police not only shoot many more citizens than those in other Western democracies, they’re also a lot more likely to be shot—he says we can nonetheless gain some important insights from how they work.

“What we’ve learned in England and Scotland is the importance of communication, of engaging and slowing things down in certain circumstances,” says Wexler. “There are times when you get called to a situation where someone is obviously distraught or emotionally disturbed and they might have a knife or a stick or a rock, and that’s where we need to slow things down, maintain a safe distance and call in additional resources. And most importantly, we need to start at a lower level of force and begin to communicate.” He adds: “With a mentally ill person, the worst thing you can do is shove a gun in their face and start barking orders at them. It’s counterproductive.”

Wexler thinks our lightning-fast, high-tech culture is part of the problem. “Some of the officers coming out of police academies approach these situations asking themselves, ‘Which of my technologies can I use to get this person under control? Should I use a gun, or should I use a Taser or a baton or whatever.’ They’re not thinking, ‘What do I have here, what is the situation? How can I take this person who’s at a very high level of anxiety and try to bring them down to earth?’”

Mass shootings, which seem to be an everyday occurrence in the United States, heighten the tension between how police are trained and how they should ideally behave. Before the Columbine massacre, patrol officers were trained to secure the area around an active-shooter incident and call in specialized tactical officers—SWAT teams. Since then, cops have been taught to seek out and neutralize a suspected gunman. But as common as they seem, those mass shootings only represent a tiny fraction of police calls, and the training for those incidents runs counter to the training for scenarios cops encounter more frequently.

In August, PERF issued a report calling for a radical “re-engineering” of use-of-force training. It detailed how the instruction officers receive, the ways that their performances are evaluated, and the culture of American policing combine to undermine what might be considered best practices.

From a cadet’s first day at the police academy to a veteran cop’s daily briefings, it’s hammered into most officers’ heads that their first job is to get home safely every day. While police obviously need to protect themselves, the job requires some risk, and this constantly repeated message leads many officers to see citizens as threats—and to view themselves as “warriors” rather than “guardians” of their communities.

Police are taught to be assertive, establish their authority and immediately take control of a situation. Failing to get that done may be seen as a sign of weakness. Many agencies evaluate cops in part on how many calls they answer, which is another incentive to react to events quickly rather than taking stock of a situation and taking a step back when it’s appropriate to do so.

Another example is the “21-foot rule.” It originated in a 1983 article in SWAT magazine arguing that a knife-wielding suspect could close a 20-foot gap in the time it takes for an average cop to draw his or her weapon, take aim and fire. According to PERF’s report, cops say “the 21-foot rule is a part of police culture, handed down informally from one officer to another, or mentioned in training, over the generations.” The author of the article, a Salt Lake City cop, urged his fellow officers to use defensive tactics to stay outside of that 21-foot zone, but police officials interviewed by PERF staffers say that over the years many cops took it to mean that there’s a 21-foot “kill zone” where deadly force is justified. “Instead of protecting officers’ safety,” reads the report, “the rule has been cited to justify the use of deadly force in incidents when other tactics might have allowed a resolution of the situation without deadly force.”

An institution’s culture isn’t easily moved, but training is a good place to start. In August, a number of prominent Black Lives Matter activists released a comprehensive set of policy proposals they called “Campaign Zero.” It calls for a laundry list of changes to how police are trained, with a new emphasis on avoiding implicit racial bias and improving cops’ relationships with the communities they serve. It also calls for officers to undergo extensive training in “crisis intervention, mediation, conflict resolution and rumor control.”

The good news is that with so much focus on policing, some departments are reexamining their use-of-force policies—and their training regimes—and talking openly about the distinction between turning out “warriors” and “guardians.”

Elk Grove, California Police Chief Robert Lehner told PERF, “The concept of police officers as warriors, whether we like it or not, has run through our profession, certainly for the almost 40 years I’ve been in it.… I think we need to confront this issue.” He says his department has stopped using firearms and use-of-force training programs designed by SWAT, “whose tactical perspective is necessarily different than routine patrol.”

A number of departments are now deploying psychiatric social workers along with specially trained officers when they get calls to deal with people suffering from mental illness.

After the killing of Eric Garner, the NYPD required all 35,000 of its cops to undergo a three-day in-service training program—it typically offers eight-hour sessions—that included a day of de-escalation tactics and techniques. Chief Matthew Pontillo explained, “We focus on the impact of high-emotion, high-stakes encounters and what that does to an officer’s stress level, what the flow of adrenaline does, what they can expect, and how they can mitigate against that. Unnecessary use of force is often tied to an officer’s adrenaline or anger, so you have to know how to control that.”

Some are reexamining their hiring practices in an attempt to weed out potentially bad cops from the start. Thomas Hongslo, chief of the Lenexa, Kansas police department, told PERF that his agency goes “to great lengths to ensure that we’re hiring people…who mix well with the community. We look for empathy, for compassion, and I think that goes to the guardian model of policing. We’ve had people come in who could do the job, but they were warriors, and they were in the job for a different reason.”

This kind of thinking won’t be evident on the streets overnight, and many of the country’s 18,000 police agencies are hunkered down in a defensive crouch rather than reexamining how they serve their communities. But with continued pressure, it might lead to a real paradigm shift down the road."

The first thing I noticed about all the folks at town halls and presidential events “caught” with loaded guns by the media over the past week was the suspiciously high percentage of former Ron Paul supporters among them. Both the guy in New Hampshire carrying a semiautomatic pistol and a sign referencing Thomas Jefferson (“It’s Time to Water the Tree of Liberty” by the blood of patriots and tyrants) and one of the demonstrators strapped with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle in Phoenix campaigned for Paul last year. William Kostric, the man packin’ in Portsmouth, appeared on Chris Matthews’s Hardball the next day; the Phoenix gunman had actually arranged in advance with local police and media to expect him, so his appearance was more of a stunt than anything else, a provocative demonstration of “gun rights” carried out in a legalistic, thoroughly Ron-Pauly way. Ad Policy

And whatever you think of Ron Paul and his remarkably enthusiastic fans, it’s hard to see them as a serious lynch mob (though they did chase Sean Hannity out of his restaurant and through the New Hampshire night during the primaries, chanting “Fox Lies!”). They may be nothing more than reckless provocateurs, as Rick Sanchez’s interview with the Viper Militia-linked blogger who helped arrange the Arizona stunt shows:

Their real interest is in political theater. They even have an almost Yippie-ish sense of humor about it. If anything, their wet dream would be to go to an Obama rally, see someone else pull a gun, and then shoot that person to stop an assassination, thereby proving the necessity of the Second Amendment and becoming an overnight hero to millions.

That, and getting a few minutes airtime on Hardball or CNN.

In fact, these guys and most of the dozens of other Americans who’ve been bringing guns to public meetings about healthcare reform are really just responding to a media-wide casting call for crazies that went out after an angry woman accosted Republican Representative Mike Castle at a June 30 town hall in Delaware, demanding to see Barack Obama’s birth certificate. It took a few days for television to grasp the potential political impact of that snippet of Flip camera video, but once they did, it and similar scenes of Americans Gone Wild have become almost daily features on cable.

Clearly, the idea is to suggest that there’s a veritable Whiskey Rebellion brewing out in the heartland, one mightily provoked by Obama’s plan to extend health insurance to every citizen. It doesn’t matter that the Birthers have been dismissed, derided and thoroughly disproved. In fact, much of the opposition to healthcare reform has long since moved on from that obviously hopeless argument–the real point is they’ve united dispirited conservatives and captured television’s attention away from the beautiful Obamas in favor of angry, ill-informed and terrified white people.

Think of it as our nation’s Dirty Harry moment–bringing a gun to a political debate is equivalent to saying, “So do ya, punk?” It’s an intimidating gesture, a warning to politicians that they must heed the vehemence on the right. And it both frightens and dissuades progressives, discouraging their participation in the debate. But you don’t get more votes just because you pull the lever on the machine harder. Like a cowboy shooting off his six-gun in the night, these people want to start a stampede, but so far they’re all hat and no cattle. Politics, like stand-up, is about timing, and after six weeks of escalating (but still relatively tiny) demonstrations by increasingly wacko people, there has in fact been very little violence and no gunplay at all. This thing is fading like the Birthers down to the hard-core, Cheneyesque extreme.

Now, I’m not saying we can forget that Timothy McVeigh was wearing one of those “The Tree of Liberty Must be Watered” T-shirts the day he blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Weaponizing the debate over healthcare is terrifically dangerous. Politically, though, it’s a very risky bluff for the GOP. Because the minute one of these guys fires his gun in anger at a town hall, wounding or killing a congressperson or another demonstrator, the political dynamic will shift completely.

So call them on it, again and again. Nominating Barack Obama in the first place was calling Republicans out on their sotto voce racist Southern Strategy, the dog-whistle politics that allowed suburban moderates to vote with overt racists without acknowledging they were doing so. Pulling the trigger would be worse than shouting the word that rhymes with it: remember, this is a television show.

And anyway, with just forty votes in the Senate, Dirty Harry needs to reload."

The US military has reopened a criminal investigation into some of the most serious accusations of war crimes against US forces in Afghanistan since 2001. As The New York Times reported last week, the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command will again investigate allegations that a Special Forces team was involved in the murders of at least 17 civilians in Afghanistan in 2012 and 2013. The question now is why the investigation has dragged on for so long—and whether there has at any point been a coverup by members of the military. Ad Policy

Even amidst a war that has been marked by repeated human rights abuses committed by US and Afghan soldiers (and, to an even greater extent, by the Taliban), the Nerkh killings stand out. Unlike cases of deranged soldiers’ acting without their superiors’ knowledge or consent—such as the Panjwai massacre in 2012, where SSgt. Robert Bales massacred 16 civilians in one night in their homes, or the Arghandab “kill team,” where a small group of soldiers murdered unarmed Afghans and cut off their body parts as trophies in 2010—the crimes in Nerkh were allegedly committed by an elite military unit in the course of its campaign against local insurgents. Moreover, the incidents were repeatedly investigated by the US military command in Afghanistan, which exonerated the team, until findings by the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross pushed it to belatedly request a criminal inquiry in July 2013. ""The murders of Afghan civilians in Nerkh were allegedly committed by an elite US military unit.""

As I revealed in my 2013 investigation of the killings for Rolling Stone, the unit in question is Operational Detachment Alpha 3124, a unit of the Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group, which was deployed to Nerkh District of Wardak Province between the fall of 2012 and March 2013. ODA 3124 was eventually forced out by President Hamid Karzai in response to repeated demonstrations by locals, who claimed that the Special Forces team had murdered, tortured, and disappeared local residents. After the team left the area, locals discovered human remains buried outside the base, which they said belonged to 10 missing men who had been arrested by the Americans.

Not long afterward, a video surfaced of one of ODA 3124’s Afghan interpreters beating Sayid Mohammad, one of the disappeared ten. The interpreter, named Zikria, was later arrested in May 2013, by Afghanistan’s intelligence service. To date, the only public statement he’s given was when I visited him in September 2013 in Kabul’s notorious Pul-e-Charki prison. Though he was known under his nom de guerre, Zikria Kandahari, he told me his real name was Zikria Noorzai, which he had tattooed on his arm in green ink.

From the start, Zikria’s relationship to the US military has been a matter of contention and speculation. For example, the Times has repeated claims by Afghan officials that Zikria was an American citizen, that he and the other interpreters had used the cover of a mine-clearing charity, and that a CIA paramilitary unit was involved.

In fact, Zikria and two other interpreters who worked for ODA 3124 in Nerkh told me that they had been hired and paid directly by the Special Forces team. (A US military spokesperson told me that he was an “unpaid interpreter” who was not on contract at the time of the incidents.) All of them had served multiple times with the Special Forces, and Zikria said it was his third stint with ODA 3124, whose team sergeant knew him from previous deployments and had requested him this time. He also denied being a US citizen.

In our interview and in his statements to Afghan investigators, Zikria had refused responsibility for the killings, and instead blamed specific members of the Special Forces. He did admit to beating Sayid Mohammad. “A few days before my friend had been hurt by an IED so I got emotional, I started punching and kicking him,” he told me. “I brought him back to the base in my truck and the ODA said okay, you’re done.” He said he handed over Mohammad to the Green Berets, and that he later saw his corpse in a body bag. ""The way the killings happened showed that a single interpreter couldn’t have done them on his own.”

Regardless of Zikria’s culpability in the incidents—and multiple people told me they saw him torture and kill residents of Nerkh—he remains the only person who has been convicted in connection with the deaths and forced disappearances in Nerkh. Moreover, his case appears to have been handled by Afghan authorities in a way intended to deflect further investigation. According to both him and his lawyer, Zikria was convicted of treason—an ironic charge, given that he was working for the US Army—and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, a conviction that was upheld by Afghanistan’s Supreme Court in August 2014. According to a family member, Zikria was moved in recent months to the Parwan Detention Facility at Bagram Air Field, which was transferred fully to Afghan control in December 2014.

“The decisions were not fair, because the courts couldn’t provide any evidence to prove the involvement of Zikria in the killing,” Najla Raheel, his lawyer, said. “Even the [Afghan intelligence service] has said that the Americans were involved in the killing, because it was the Americans who commanded Zikria…. I think the way the killings happened showed that a single interpreter couldn’t have done them on his own.”

* * *

Who, then, is responsible for the Nerkh killings? In my 2013 story, which unearthed new eyewitness testimony and photographic evidence, I reviewed the allegations in detail, and drew the following conclusions. For nine out of 10 of the disappeared men, there was overwhelming evidence from witnesses—in many cases, an entire village in broad daylight—that they were initially taken by the US military. A number of locals also claimed to have experienced torture in custody and witnessed summary executions by the Special Forces and their translators. They identified specific individuals they said were responsible from photo arrays that I constructed, which used pictures from ODA 3124 team members and interpreters’ public Facebook profiles, mixed with photos of random Special Forces soldiers and Afghans pulled from Google Images.

Taken individually, the abuses they recount are so extreme as to be hard to believe, but in aggregate they form a consistent and credible pattern. This was also the conclusion of the UN and ICRC investigations into the killings, whose full findings were provided to the US military but never made public, though the UN summarized its findings in a July 2013 report. Similar allegations were also reported by Reuters and the Times.

In several instances, the individuals attempted to report their allegations to the US military. While I was in Nerkh in 2013, I learned of a man named Qandi who had been arrested by the Special Forces and was still being held at the main detention center in Bagram. Qandi was eventually released on October 12, 2013, and spoke to me about his experiences in an interview last week.

Though Qandi said he was around 55 years old, he looked much older. He used to ride a bicycle to work before his arrest, he said. Now he walked in halting, frail steps and had a tremor in his left hand. Qandi, who worked as a cashier at the Wardak office of the Ministry of Information and Culture, was arrested at his house in early November 2012 by US soldiers and their Afghan interpreters. He said was taken to the Special Forces base in Nerkh and held there for 45 days, where he was accused of working with the insurgents. He claimed he was tortured into making false confessions by American soldiers and their Afghan interpreters, including Zikria, and that they subjected him to beatings, shocks with a taser, mock drownings, as well as sexual abuse. “They kicked me in the testicles and then tied my penis with a plastic rope,” he said. “It was tied for eight days, and I was suffering very badly from pains in my belly and bladder.”

He also claimed to have witnessed Sayid Mohammad and other prisoners being beaten to death in the presence of American soldiers. “Only once, they took me to a tent for treatment,” he said. “When they took me there, they brought Sayid Mohammad there and they killed him in front of me by beating him, and when he died the soldiers pushed me to the ground onto his blood.” (On May 21, 2013, the Times reported that Sayed Mohammad’s body had been found buried outside the base.)

Qandi said that he and other prisoners were treated by an Afghan woman who spoke English with the American soldiers and seemed to be working for them. One day, he was cleaned up, given a fresh change of clothes, and then transferred to Bagram by helicopter. There, he was assigned detainee number 5794. He said he was given proper medical care and not abused, and told both his US interrogators in Bagram and the ICRC that he had been tortured and had witnessed murders by the Special Forces in Nerkh. ""They killed him in front of me by beating him; when he died the soldiers pushed me to the ground onto his blood.""

* * *

If allegations such as Qandi’s are true, how could a small unit like ODA 3124 have carried out such extensive crimes over an extended period without their superiors being aware, even as witnesses turned up in Bagram?

According to the US military, allegations of wrongdoing by the Special Forces in Nerkh were first reported up the chain of command in November 2012. As pressure from the Afghan government mounted over the following four months, the US military conducted three separate investigations into the allegations, all of which exonerated its soldiers of any wrongdoing. During this period, at least five individuals were detained by US forces in Nerkh and then subsequently disappeared.

The third investigation, carried out jointly with the Afghan government and completed in March 2013, was led by a senior officer, Brig. Gen. Michael L. Howard. I have since spoken to several US and Afghan officials who were familiar with the investigation and told me that Howard seemed more intent on clearing US soldiers than on getting to the bottom of the allegations. According to a senior Afghan officer at the Ministry of Defense who was privy to the investigation’s reports, the investigation team visited the Special Forces team in Nerkh, who flatly denied having any of the missing people in custody, or knowing anything about their fate—and the US military shifted blame onto Zikria, who had by then had fled the area, and would not be captured by Afghan intelligence for another two months. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

At the time of Brig. Gen. Howard’s investigation, Qandi was in custody at Bagram prison, where he said he told US military interrogators about the torture he had suffered and murders he had witnessed in Nerkh. And during that same period, Zikria was still in touch with members of ODA 3124, according to his own admission and publicly viewable Facebook messages.

Yet, like the previous two investigations, Howard’s cleared the US military of any wrongdoing. “The inquiries found no reliable evidence to substantiate misconduct by ISAF or US forces relating to the detainees or reported deaths in Nerkh,” Col. Jane Crichton, a US military spokesperson, told me in October 2013.

How could three US military investigations have failed to find the evidence that was unearthed not only by reporters such as myself but by the UN and ICRC? At best, it represents staggering incompetence. At worse, it raises the possibility that US military officials may have deliberately suppressed or ignored information that would have led to a more timely criminal investigation.

In any case, on July 17, 2013, almost four months after ODA 3124 left Nerkh, the US commander in Afghanistan, General Joseph Dunford, notified the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command (CID) about new and “unresolved allegations” in the ICRC and UN reports, according to the military. This triggered a criminal investigation by the CID, one that would operate independently but whose findings would ultimately be forwarded to back to the military command for a decision about whether or not to prosecute.

The criminal investigation got off to a seemingly slow start. None of the witnesses that I interviewed prior to publishing my story in November 2013 had ever been contacted by the US military. According to a former UN official directly familiar with the CID investigation, it wasn’t until late December 2013 that military investigators began interviewing witnesses from Nerkh, via video calls conducted at a UN compound.

Those interviews were concluded in early 2014, the former UN official said. That August, the investigation was complete and “pending case review,” according to CID. “During the case review process, information and leads were identified that demand further investigation,” Christopher Grey, a CID spokesperson, said. He declined to comment on the specific reasons for reopening the investigation. “We are fully committed to investigating the allegations until we are confident that we have exhausted all leads and pertinent information before closing the investigation.”

* * * How could three US military investigations fail to find the evidence unearthed by reporters, the UN, and ICRC?

The constant shuffle of investigations casts doubt on whether justice will ever be done in the Nerkh killings, and is consistent with the US military’s terrible track record of investigating allegations of war crimes against its own members in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In August 2014, Amnesty International published a damning report on the US military justice system in Afghanistan. It investigated 10 cases where there was “credible evidence of unlawful killings of civilians” by international military operations—including the Nerkh incidents—that involved at least 140 civilian deaths, 50 of them children. None of the cases have led to prosecutions of US service members. In nine of them, none of the witnesses had been interviewed by military investigators.

Giving the lack of transparency and a fully independent prosecution in the US military justice system, it is perhaps not surprising when the military fails to hold itself to account. Pointing to the system’s “structural flaws,” Amnesty noted that:

“It is, in significant ways, a system of self-policing. Yet troops have scant incentive to report possible violations up the chain of command, and many reasons not to. Commanders, too, have little reason to push investigations forward, particularly in cases in which the commander’s own conduct or judgment might be called into question.”

The report also brings up the military’s struggle to stem sexual assault in its ranks, which raises a striking point: If the military’s justice system has failed American servicewomen who have been sexually assaulted—as has been amply documented in the press and by Congress—then what hope do Afghans have when they are the victims of war crimes?

“There is no sign of justice for us here in Afghanistan,” said Neamatullah, whose two brothers were arrested by US forces during the Amarkhel raid on November 20, 2012, and subsequently disappeared. Months later, he had identified human remains buried outside the base as his brothers’, based on their clothing. “You’re the ones who made Zikria what he was. He was nobody without you.”"

“The sovereign is he who decides on the exception,” said conservative thinker Carl Schmitt in 1922, meaning that a nation’s leader can defy the law to serve the greater good. Though Schmitt’s service as Nazi Germany’s chief jurist and his unwavering support for Hitler from the night of the long knives to Kristallnacht and beyond damaged his reputation for decades, today his ideas have achieved unimagined influence. They have, in fact, shaped the neo-conservative view of presidential power that has become broadly bipartisan since 9/11. Indeed, Schmitt has influenced American politics directly through his intellectual protégé Leo Strauss who, as an émigré professor at the University of Chicago, trained Bush administration architects of the Iraq war Paul Wolfowitz and Abram Shulsky.

All that should be impressive enough for a discredited, long dead authoritarian thinker. But Schmitt’s dictum also became a philosophical foundation for the exercise of American global power in the quarter century that followed the end of the Cold War. Washington, more than any other power, created the modern international community of laws and treaties, yet it now reserves the right to defy those same laws with impunity. A sovereign ruler should, said Schmitt, discard laws in times of national emergency. So the United States, as the planet’s last superpower or, in Schmitt’s terms, its global sovereign, has in these years repeatedly ignored international law, following instead its own unwritten rules of the road for the exercise of world power.

Just as Schmitt’s sovereign preferred to rule in a state of endless exception without a constitution for his Reich, so Washington is now well into the second decade of an endless War on Terror that seems the sum of its exceptions to international law: endless incarceration, extrajudicial killing, pervasive surveillance, drone strikes in defiance of national boundaries, torture on demand, and immunity for all of the above on the grounds of state secrecy. Yet these many American exceptions are just surface manifestations of the ever-expanding clandestine dimension of the American state. Created at the cost of more than a trillion dollars since 9/11, the purpose of this vast apparatus is to control a covert domain that is fast becoming the main arena for geopolitical contestation in the twenty-first century.

This should be (but seldom is considered) a jarring, disconcerting path for a country that, more than any other, nurtured the idea of, and wrote the rules for, an international community of nations governed by the rule of law. At the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899, the U.S. delegate, Andrew Dickson White, the founder of Cornell University, pushed for the creation of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and persuaded Andrew Carnegie to build the monumental Peace Palace at The Hague as its home. At the Second Hague Conference in 1907, Secretary of State Elihu Root urged that future international conflicts be resolved by a court of professional jurists, an idea realized when the Permanent Court of International Justice was established in 1920.

After World War II, the U.S. used its triumph to help create the United Nations, push for the adoption of its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and ratify the Geneva Conventions for humanitarian treatment in war. If you throw in other American-backed initiatives like the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, and the World Bank, you pretty much have the entire infrastructure of what we now casually call “the international community.”

Breaking the Rules

Not only did the U.S. play a crucial role in writing the new rules for that community, but it almost immediately began breaking them. After all, despite the rise of the other superpower, the Soviet Union, Washington was by then the world sovereign and so could decide which should be the exceptions to its own rules, particularly to the foundational principle for all this global governance: sovereignty. As it struggled to dominate the hundred new nations that started appearing right after the war, each one invested with an inviolable sovereignty, Washington needed a new means of projecting power beyond conventional diplomacy or military force. As a result, CIA covert operations became its way of intervening within a new world order where you couldn’t or at least shouldn’t intervene openly.

All of the exceptions that really matter spring from America’s decision to join what former spy John Le Carré called that “squalid procession of vain fools, traitors… sadists, and drunkards,” and embrace espionage in a big way after World War II. Until the creation of the CIA in 1947, the United States had been an innocent abroad in the world of intelligence. When General John J. Pershing led two million American troops to Europe during World War I, the U.S. had the only army on either side of the battle lines without an intelligence service. Even though Washington built a substantial security apparatus during that war, it was quickly scaled back by Republican conservatives during the 1920s. For decades, the impulse to cut or constrain such secret agencies remained robustly bipartisan, as when President Harry Truman abolished the CIA’s predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), right after World War II or when President Jimmy Carter fired 800 CIA covert operatives after the Vietnam War.

Yet by fits and starts, the covert domain inside the U.S. government has grown stealthily from the early twentieth century to this moment. It began with the formation of the FBI in 1908 and Military Intelligence in 1917. The Central Intelligence Agency followed after World War II along with most of the alphabet agencies that make up the present U.S. Intelligence Community, including the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and last but hardly least, in 2004, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Make no mistake: there is a clear correlation between state secrecy and the rule of law—as one grows, the other surely shrinks.

World Sovereign

America’s irrevocable entry into this covert netherworld came when President Truman deployed his new CIA to contain Soviet subversion in Europe. This was a continent then thick with spies of every stripe: failed fascists, aspirant communists, and everything in between. Introduced to spycraft by its British “cousins,” the CIA soon mastered it in part by establishing sub rosa ties to networks of ex-Nazi spies, Italian fascist operatives, and dozens of continental secret services.

As the world’s new sovereign, Washington used the CIA to enforce its chosen exceptions to the international rule of law, particularly to the core principle of sovereignty. During his two terms, President Dwight Eisenhowerauthorized 104 covert operations on four continents, focused largely on controlling the many new nations then emerging from centuries of colonialism. Eisenhower’s exceptions included blatant transgressions of national sovereignty such as turning northern Burma into an unwilling springboard for abortive invasions of China, arming regional revolts to partition Indonesia, and overthrowing elected governments in Guatemala and Iran. By the time Eisenhower left office in 1961, covert ops had acquired such a powerful mystique in Washington that President John F. Kennedy would authorize 163 of them in the three years that preceded his assassination.

As a senior CIA official posted to the Near East in the early 1950s put it, the Agency then saw every Muslim leader who was not pro-American as “a target legally authorized by statute for CIA political action.” Applied on a global scale and not just to Muslims, this policy helped produce a distinct “reverse wave” in the global trend towards democracy from 1958 to 1975, as coups—most of them U.S.-sanctioned—allowed military men to seize power in more than three-dozen nations, representing a quarter of the world’s sovereign states.

The White House’s “exceptions” also produced a deeply contradictory U.S. attitude toward torture from the early years of the Cold War onward. Publicly, Washington’s opposition to torture was manifest in its advocacy of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the Geneva Conventions in 1949. Simultaneously and secretly, however, the CIA began developing ingenious new torture techniques in contravention of those same international conventions. After a decade of mind-control research, the CIAactually codified its new method of psychological torture in a secret instructional handbook, the “KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation” manual, which it then disseminated within the U.S. Intelligence Community and to allied security services worldwide.

Much of the torture that became synonymous with the era of authoritarian rule in Asia and Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s seems to have originated in U.S. training programs that provided sophisticated techniques, up-to-date equipment, and moral legitimacy for the practice. From 1962 to 1974, the CIA worked through the Office of Public Safety (OPS), a division of the U.S. Agency for International Development that sent American police advisers to developing nations. Established by President Kennedy in 1962, in just six years OPS grew into a global anti-communist operation with over 400 U.S. police advisers. By 1971, it had trained more than a million policemen in 47 nations, including 85,000 in South Vietnam and 100,000 in Brazil.

Concealed within this larger OPS effort, CIA interrogation training became synonymous with serious human rights abuses, particularly in Iran, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Brazil, and Uruguay. Amnesty Internationaldocumented widespread torture, usually by local police, in 24 of the 49 nations that had hosted OPS police-training teams. In tracking torturers across the globe, Amnesty seemed to be following the trail of CIA training programs. Significantly, torture began to recede when America again turned resolutely against the practice at the end of the Cold War.

The War on Terror

Although the CIA’s authority for assassination, covert intervention, surveillance, and torture was curtailed at the close of the Cold War, the terror attacks of September 2001 sparked an unprecedented expansion in the scale of the intelligence community and a corresponding resurgence in executive exceptions. The War on Terror’s voracious appetite for information produced, in its first decade, what the Washington Post branded a veritable “fourth branch” of the U.S. federal government with 854,000 vetted security officials, 263 security organizations, over 3,000 private and public intelligence agencies, and 33 new security complexes—all pumping out a total of 50,000 classified intelligence reports annually by 2010.

By that time, one of the newest members of the Intelligence Community, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, already had 16,000 employees, a $5 billion budget, and a massive nearly $2 billion headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Maryland—all aimed at coordinating the flood of surveillance data pouring in from drones, U-2 spy planes, Google Earth, and orbiting satellites.

According to documents whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked to theWashington Post, the U.S. spent $500 billion on its intelligence agencies in the dozen years after the 9/11 attacks, including annual appropriations in 2012 of $11 billion for the National Security Agency (NSA) and $15 billion for the CIA. If we add the $790 billion expended on the Department of Homeland Security to that $500 billion for overseas intelligence, then Washington had spent nearly $1.3 trillion to build a secret state-within-the-state of absolutely unprecedented size and power.

As this secret state swelled, the world’s sovereign decided that some extraordinary exceptions to civil liberties at home and sovereignty abroad were in order. The most glaring came with the CIA’s now-notorious renewed use of torture on suspected terrorists and its setting up of its own global network of private prisons, or “black sites,” beyond the reach of any court or legal authority. Along with piracy and slavery, the abolition of torture had long been a signature issue when it came to the international rule of law. So strong was this principle that the U.N. General Assembly voted unanimously in 1984 to adopt the Convention Against Torture. When it came to ratifying it, however, Washington dithered on the subject until the end of the Cold War when it finally resumed its advocacy of international justice, participating in the World Conference on Human Rights at Vienna in 1993 and, a year later, ratifying the U.N. Convention Against Torture.

Even then, the sovereign decided to reserve some exceptions for his country alone. Only a year after President Bill Clinton signed the U.N. Convention, CIA agents started snatching terror suspects in the Balkans, some of them Egyptian nationals, and sending them to Cairo, where a torture-friendly autocracy could do whatever it wanted to them in its prisons. Former CIA director George Tenet later testified that, in the years before 9/11, the CIA shipped some 70 individuals to foreign countries without formal extradition—a process dubbed “extraordinary rendition” that had been explicitly banned under Article 3 of the U.N. Convention.

Right after his public address to a shaken nation on September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush gave his staff wide-ranging secret orders to use torture, adding (in a vernacular version of Schmitt’s dictum),“I don’t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.” In this spirit, the White House authorized the CIA to develop that global matrix of secret prisons, as well as an armada of planes for spiriting kidnapped terror suspects to them, and a network of allies who could help seize those suspects from sovereign states and levitate them into a supranational gulag of eight agency black sites from Thailand to Poland or into the crown jewel of the system, Guantánamo, thus eluding laws and treaties that remained grounded in territorially based concepts of sovereignty.

Once the CIA closed the black sites in 2008-2009, its collaborators in this global gulag began to feel the force of law for their crimes against humanity. Under pressure from the Council of Europe, Poland started an ongoing criminal investigation in 2008 into its security officers who had facilitated the CIA’s secret prison in the country’s northeast. In September 2012, Italy’s supreme court confirmed the convictions of 22 CIA agents for the illegal rendition of Egyptian exile Abu Omar from Milan to Cairo, and ordered a trial for Italy’s military intelligence chief on charges that sentenced him to 10 years in prison. In 2012, Scotland Yard opened a criminal investigation into MI6 agents who rendered Libyan dissidents to Colonel Gaddafi’s prisons for torture, and two years later the Court of Appeal allowed some of those Libyans to file a civil suit against MI6 for kidnapping and torture.

But not the CIA. Even after the Senate’s 2014 Torture Report documented the Agency’s abusive tortures in painstaking detail, there was no move for either criminal or civil sanctions against those who had ordered torture or those who had carried it out. In a strong editorial on December 21, 2014, the New York Times asked “whether the nation will stand by and allow the perpetrators of torture to have perpetual immunity.” The answer, of course, was yes.Immunity for hirelings is one of the sovereign’s most important exceptions.

As President Bush finished his second term in 2008, an inquiry by the International Commission of Jurists found that the CIA’s mobilization of allied security agencies worldwide had done serious damage to the international rule of law. “The executive… should under no circumstance invoke a situation of crisis to deprive victims of human rights violations… of their… access to justice,” the Commission recommended after documenting the degradation of civil liberties in some 40 countries. “State secrecy and similar restrictions must not impede the right to an effective remedy for human rights violations.”

The Bush years also brought Washington’s most blatant repudiation of the rule of law. Once the newly established International Criminal Court (ICC) convened at The Hague in 2002, the Bush White House “un-signed” or “de-signed” the U.N. agreement creating the court and then mounted a sustained diplomatic effort to immunize U.S. military operations from its writ. This was an extraordinary abdication for the nation that had breathed the concept of an international tribunal into being.

The Sovereign’s Unbounded Domains

While Presidents Eisenhower and Bush decided on exceptions that violated national boundaries and international treaties, President Obama is exercising his exceptional prerogatives in the unbounded domains of aerospace and cyberspace.

Both are new, unregulated realms of military conflict beyond the rubric of international law and Washington believes it can use them as Archimedean levers for global dominion. Just as Britain once ruled from the seas and postwar America exercised its global reach via airpower, so Washington now sees aerospace and cyberspace as special realms for domination in the twenty-first century.

Under Obama, drones have grown from a tactical Band-Aid in Afghanistan into a strategic weapon for the exercise of global power. From 2009 to 2015, the CIA and the U.S. Air Force deployed a drone armada of over 200 Predators and Reapers, launching 413 strikes in Pakistan alone, killing as many as 3,800 people. Every Tuesday inside the White House Situation Room, as the New York Times reported in 2012, President Obama reviews a CIA drone “kill list” and stares at the faces of those who are targeted for possible assassination from the air. He then decides, without any legal procedure, who will live and who will die, even in the case of American citizens. Unlike other world leaders, this sovereign applies the ultimate exception across the Greater Middle East, parts of Africa, and elsewhere if he chooses.

This lethal success is the cutting edge of a top-secret Pentagon project that will, by 2020, deploy a triple-canopy space “shield” from stratosphere to exosphere, patrolled by Global Hawk and X-37B drones armed with agile missiles.

As Washington seeks to police a restless globe from sky and space, the world might well ask: How high is any nation’s sovereignty? After the successive failures of the Paris flight conference of 1910, the Hague Rules of Aerial Warfare of 1923, and Geneva’s Protocol I of 1977 to establish the extent of sovereign airspace or restrain aerial warfare, some puckish Pentagon lawyer might reply: only as high as you can enforce it.

President Obama has also adopted the NSA’s vast surveillance system as a permanent weapon for the exercise of global power. At the broadest level, such surveillance complements Obama’s overall defense strategy, announced in 2012, of cutting conventional forces while preserving U.S. global power through a capacity for “a combined arms campaign across all domains: land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace.” In addition, it should be no surprise that, having pioneered the war-making possibilities of cyberspace, the president did not hesitate to launch the first cyberwar in history against Iran.

By the end of Obama’s first term, the NSA could sweep up billions of messages worldwide through its agile surveillance architecture. This included hundreds of access points for penetration of the Worldwide Web’s fiber optic cables; ancillary intercepts through special protocols and “backdoor” software flaws; supercomputers to crack the encryption of this digital torrent; and a massive data farm in Bluffdale, Utah, built at a cost of $2 billion to store yottabytes of purloined data.

Even after angry Silicon Valley executives protested that the NSA’s “backdoor” software surveillance threatened their multi-trillion-dollar industry, Obama called the combination of Internet information and supercomputers “a powerful tool.” He insisted that, as “the world’s only superpower,” the United States “cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies.” In other words, the sovereign cannot sanction any exceptions to his panoply of exceptions.

Revelations from Edward Snowden’s cache of leaked documents in late 2013 indicate that the NSA has conducted surveillance of leaders in some 122 nations worldwide, 35 of them closely, including Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, former Mexican president Felipe Calderón, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After her forceful protest, Obama agreed to exempt Merkel’s phone from future NSA surveillance, but reserved the right, as he put it, to continue to “gather information about the intentions of governments… around the world.” The sovereign declined to say which world leaders might be exempted from his omniscient gaze.

Can there be any question that, in the decades to come, Washington will continue to violate national sovereignty through old-style covert as well as open interventions, even as it insists on rejecting any international conventions that restrain its use of aerospace or cyberspace for unchecked force projection, anywhere, anytime? Extant laws or conventions that in any way check this power will be violated when the sovereign so decides. These are now the unwritten rules of the road for our planet. They represent the real American exceptionalism."

I remember very clearly the first rape victim I ever met. It was in the autumn of 1992 in a small town near Zagreb. She was a Muslim from Kozarac, in Bosnia. After a few months in a detention camp, she came with a group of refugees to Zagreb. Selma (not her real name) was in her mid-thirties, with short brown hair and a blue eyes. Ad Policy

She told me her story in a low voice, almost in a whisper. She was in her house with her two children and her mother when a group of Serbian paramilitary soldiers entered her yard. They said they were looking for arms, but there were no arms in her house. They were after something else.

Angrily, one man grabbed her and pushed her in her bedroom. Then the others joined him, too. “Then they did it to me.” Selma simply said, looking down at her hands, ” I could not face my children for a long while afterwards…. I was washing and washing and washing, but their smell did not go away. Imagine, they did it to me in my own marital bed,” she said.

I detected a trace of despair in her words. She did not cry, not any longer. But she felt ashamed and the shame stayed with her; she had to learn to live with it, as did her husband.

On June 20, the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution classifying rape as a weapon of war. Human rights groups hailed the vote as historic, but it is no legal remedy. Though raped women were recently legally recognized as victims of war in parts of the Bosnian federation that protection does not extend to Republika Srpska.

While working on my book, They Would Never Hurt a Fly, about Balkan war criminals on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia in The Hague, I came across the “Foca case.” In 1992, Dragoljub Kunarac, Radomir Kovac and Zoran Vukovic, three Serbs in the Bosnian city of Foca, imprisoned young Muslim girls, tortured them, kept them as sexual slaves and raped them. But the men did not really understand why they were being tried.

One of them defended himself by saying: “But I could have killed them!” From his own prospective, he actually saved their lives. Rape? What kind of crime this is compared with killing people?

This case is important because on February 22, 2001, Florence Mumbal the International Criminal Tribunal judge from Zambia, found them guilty. The three were the first men in European legal history to be sentenced for crimes against humanity–torture, slavery, outrages upon human dignity and the mass rape of the Bosnian Muslim women.

This sentence recognized that sexual violence is an extremely effective weapon of ethnic cleansing. It not only shames violated women, but also humiliates their men, who cannot protect them. Sexual violence destroys the whole community because the stigma stays with them, not forgotten, not forgiven.

At the trial of the three defendants in the Foca case, was one particular witness, the mother of a 12-year-old girl taken prisoner by Radomir Kovac, who raped her and then sold her to a Montenegrin soldier for 100 euros. The girl was never seen again. Her mother came to confront the perpetrator and to witness against him. But when she took the stand, no words came out of her. Just a sound, the unbearable howl of a mortally wounded dog.

The UN Security Council resolution on rape will not bring this woman’s daughter back. But it is nonetheless historic because, finally, sexual violence is recognized as a weapon, and can be punished. No longer can a man defend himself by saying that he could have killed a women he had “only” raped. We know now, as we knew even before the passage of this resolution, that rape is a kind of slow murder."

Before “Bikini” became the name of a piece of female attire, it was the name of an atoll, part of the 1,156 islands and islets making up what is now the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). In 2010, at RMI’s request, Bikini was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List because of its historic importance as the site of twenty-three nuclear tests conducted by the United States between 1946 and 1958. There were sixty-seven US tests in the Marshall Islands altogether. Ad Policy

Now RMI has invoked the aid of another UN agency: the International Court of Justice in The Hague (not to be confused with the International Criminal Court). Last April, in an extraordinary and commendable act of chutzpah, RMI sued all nine states currently possessing nuclear weapons—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, France, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea—accusing them of violating their duty to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of those horrific weapons.

The theory of the case is based on three distinct but overlapping principles. Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, each party “undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.” The 1996 advisory opinion of the ICJ in the nuclear weapons case asserted that “there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.” The addition of the words “and bring to a conclusion” was important and made clear that just negotiating, without reaching a specific objective, was not enough. Customary international law also supports the legal obligation to eliminate nuclear weapons.

In some ways the NPT obligation, being treaty based, is the strongest arrow in RMI’s bow. But there is a small problem: four of the accused states (India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea) are not members of the NPT. The obligation proclaimed by the ICJ and that flowing from customary international law are applicable to every country in the world. But there is another problem: of the nine accused states, only three—India, Pakistan and the UK—are subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ. (The United States, which was a great promoter of the ICJ in its early years, renounced compulsory jurisdiction in 1985 while the case involving military and paramilitary operations against Nicaragua was pending).

RMI has asked the other six states to submit voluntarily to the court’s jurisdiction, but it remains to be seen whether any of them will do so. In the three cases actually pending, India and Pakistan have advised the court that they intend to file objections, and the UK is expected to follow suit. At this point it is not known exactly what the objections are or will be, but it stands to reason that the court will have to be satisfied that there is a genuine legal dispute between the plaintiff state and the defendants in order to proceed. In this respect RMI can argue that, as a member of the international community, it has the right and duty to enforce an obligation of fundamental and universal importance. It can also argue that, given the planetary consequences of a nuclear war, it can be adversely affected by such a war, no matter where it takes place.

The latter argument is not as farfetched as it may seem. Last December, the government of Austria sponsored the third of three conferences in two years on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. Each was attended by about 125 to 150 governments and was largely ignored by the mainstream media. The Summary of Findings of the Vienna Conference included the following paragraph:

The impact of a nuclear weapon detonation, irrespective of the cause, would not be constrained by national borders and could have regional and even global consequences, causing destruction, death and displacement as well as profound and long-term damage to the environment, climate, human health and well-being, socioeconomic development, social order and could even threaten the survival of humankind.

RMI is represented at the ICJ by Tony deBrum, the country’s foreign minister, and Phon van den Biesen, a Dutch lawyer experienced in ICJ litigation. They are backed by a team of international law experts who are taking the cases very seriously. A substantial number of civil society organizations are supporting the cases, including the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy in New York and the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation in Santa Barbara.

One effect of the RMI initiative is to throw a spotlight on the policies of the nuclear weapons states, which claim to be committed to a nuclear weapons–free world while showing not the slightest willingness to reach that goal. Reduction, which can go on forever, is fundamentally different from elimination, which reaches an end point. The legal obligation to conclude negotiations for complete nuclear disarmament is not met by shrinking a nation’s nuclear arsenal from 600 to 300 weapons, as France has done, nor by the agreement between the United States and Russia to reduce the stockpile of deployed long-range nuclear warheads each to 1,550 by 2018, as was done in the New START Treaty negotiated in 2010. One might add that the deterioration of relations between these two countries has made further reductions unlikely for the foreseeable future—not to mention the fact that, according to a projection by the Monterey Institute, the United States plans to spend about $1 trillion over the next three decades to modernize its nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles.

The Marshall Islands initiative may be a long shot, but it is not a fool’s errand. It is a cri de coeur by a people who, like the hibakusha of Japan, have experienced the barbarism of nuclear weapons on their own bodies and their own lands. It comes at a time when the members of the NPT, at the upcoming quinquennial review conference, may at long last decide to take concrete measures toward nuclear disarmament, or face the possibility of seeing the treaty disintegrate. Many civil society organizations will do their utmost to bring about the former. It also comes at a time when too many policy-makers, having lived so long with nuclear weapons, are beginning to regard them as just another kind of weapon, instead of the uniquely atrocious one that it is. To them, the Marshall Islanders are saying what the nuclear scientist Joseph Rotblat said to whoever was willing to listen when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995: “Remember your humanity.”

Yesterday, Gary Samore, president of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), published a column on the website of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), arguing that even if talks between the P5+1 and Iran collapse, “Iran’s ability to produce nuclear weapons in the near term is severely constrained by political and technical factors.” Ad Policy

But Samore seems not to have contacted his office with that sensible sounding message. “It’s time to come down like a ton of bricks on this regime,” Gabriel Pedreira, communications director of UANI, told The Algemeiner, a US Jewish news outlet, on the same day. “We want an economic blockade if real change doesn’t come about. We haven’t seen a single concession from the Iranians, nor has even one centrifuge been destroyed,” said Pedreira.

That’s not what Samore, Pedreira’s boss, wrote. “Despite the impasse over the scale and scope of Iran’s enrichment program, the negotiators have made progress on several other issues, such as converting the Fordow enrichment facility to a research and development facility and converting the Arak heavy water research reactor to produce less plutonium,” said Samore.

And as for Pedreira’s argument that an “economic blockade” would be helpful? Samore acknowledged that a new interim agreement, presumably to be considered if the P5+1 and Iran are unable to meet the November 24 deadline for a comprehensive agreement, would be “resisted by some in Iran” if it is perceived that “it gives away too much nuclear capability without getting enough sanctions relief in return.”

In other words, an “economic blockade,” as Pedreira puts it, would give Iran’s hardliners ammunition to oppose a new interim agreement, which might be exactly what UANI wants.

The organization expressed “disappointment” with the November 2013 Joint Plan of Action, complaining that the agreement “provides disproportionate sanctions relief to Iran,” and has consistently opposed rollback of sanctions as part of an interim deal.

Indeed, both Mark Wallace, UANI’s CEO, and UANI’s mysterious benefactor, billionaire Thomas Kaplan, have expressed more hardline views than Samore, who served in the Obama administration as the president’s Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction until last year.

But the divergence between Samore’s column, in which he is ID’d with his Belfer Center affiliation instead of UANI, and UANI’s contradictory statements the same day, raises questions about how much leadership Samore is offering to the organization and whether his role is more than purely ceremonial. Either way, Samore should probably phone his (UANI) office."

In 1934, the National Rifle Association’s lobbyist testified in front of the House Ways and Means Committee about President Franklin Roosevelt’s National Firearms Act. “I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons,” the lobbyist said. “I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.”

The NRA testified, under oath, in favor of the nation’s first federal gun control bill.

Eighty years later, the organization believes not only in “the general practice of carrying weapons” but also, as Ronald Reagan once wrote, that the Second Amendment “appears to leave little if any leeway for the gun control advocate.”

The NRA’s dramatic turnabout, and its decades-long campaign to change American hearts, minds and gun laws, is the subject of Michael Waldman’s compelling new book, The Second Amendment: A Biography. Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Law and Justice at the New York University School of Law, explains that the authors of the Second Amendment never intended to create an “unregulated individual right to a gun” and explores why, today, we think they did. Published three days before the rampage in Isla Vista, California, that killed six and wounded thirteen, the book shows how we got to this moment of routine gun violence—and offers a way out.

After George W. Bush’s tough talk about the “axis of evil” unnerved allies–and forced the Administration to dispense assurances it was not about to go halfcocked after Iran, Iraq and North Korea–the White House has once again supplied the international community reason for the jitters, thanks to its new Nuclear Posture Review. The classified report, first revealed by The Los Angeles Times and then front-paged by The New York Times, is the Pentagon’s master plan for developing and deploying nuclear weapons. The document, which lists contingencies in which nuclear arms might be used, notes that the United States might have to resort to nuclear weapons during “an Iraqi attack on Israel, or its neighbors, or a North Korean attack on South Korea or a military confrontation over the status of Taiwan.” (The latter, of course, would be a confrontation with China.) The report also states, “Iran, Syria and Libya are among the countries that could be involved in immediate, potential or unexpected contingencies” that would require “nuclear strike capabilities,” and it states that the United States could launch a nuclear assault to destroy stocks of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological and chemical arms.

The report certainly will not bolster Bush’s image abroad, for it will cause people to wonder if–shades of Ronald Reagan!–this administration is planning for winnable nuclear wars against nations that do not possess nuclear weapons. This leak will also probably cause headaches for Vice President Dick Cheney when he travels to the Middle East this week. He’ll want to talk war on terrorism, and the heads of state might be more interested in his ideas about targeting nuclear weapons in their neighborhood. The report is also the latest step in what seems to be a Bush administration campaign to undermine a key foundation of the international nuclear nonproliferation order.

The prospect of using–or preparing to use–nuclear weapons against nations that do not possess them has long been a delicate matter. Nobody expects the Pentagon not to plan for the horrific possibility of nuclear war with another nuclear-armed state. But since 1978 the United States has tried to reassure the world that (more or less) it would not launch nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear-weapon nation. The point of this declaration was to encourage non-nuclear states to sign and abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Washington would have a difficult time pressing other nations to forego nuclear weapons, if it reserved the right to blast these countries with its own nuclear arsenal.

This US position–known as “negative security assurances” in arms-control parlance–came with loopholes. Here’s how Secretary of State Warren Christopher described it in 1995: the United States “will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons except in case of an invasion or any other attack on the United States, its territories, its armed forces or other troops, its allies, or on a state towards which it has a security commitment, carried out or sustained by such a non-nuclear-weapon state in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon state.” That is, if a non-nuclear state that has signed the NPT finds itself in an armed conflict with the United States on its own (without being in league with a nuclear-weapon state), then the United States could not hurl nuclear bombs at it.

Now for the rub: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and North Korea have each signed the NPT. Which means that in a mano-a-mano war against, say, Iraq, U.S. war-managers could not go nuclear.

This policy restriction has been a sore point for conservatives for years. Several weeks before the Nuclear Posture Review earned headlines, John Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, took a significant, but little-noticed, swipe at negative security assurances. In an interview with Arms Control Today magazine, Bolton, for years a right-wing opponent of many arms treaties, was asked if Warren Christopher’s 1995 statement remained the policy of the Bush administration. Bolton replied, “I don’t think we’re of the view that this kind of approach is necessarily the most productive.” He noted that the administration’s emphasis was not “on the rhetorical” but on “the actual change in our military posture,” which would be “embodied in the outcome of the Nuclear Posture Review.”

The interviewers from Arms Control Today pressed him, asking, “So, right now, the Bush administration would not make a commitment to non-nuclear-weapon states…that it would not use nuclear weapons?” Bolton answered: “I don’t think we have any intention of using nuclear weapons in circumstances that I can foresee in the days ahead of us. The point is that the kind of rhetorical approach that you are describing doesn’t seem to me to be terribly helpful in analyzing what our security needs may be in the real world, and what we are doing, instead of chit-chatting is making changes in our force structures.” (Making changes? You bet.)

In his responses, Bolton did not acknowledge the role of negative security assurances in the NPT process. It was as if he believed such statements were nothing more than conversational niceties. Which might be true from the perspective of other nations. But if these nations are going to be encouraged by such statements from Washington, then these declarations have great value.

Bolton is the Bush administration’s key person–its soul–on arms control issues, and his remarks seemed to mark an abrupt turn-about in a long-standing policy on a highly sensitive topic. But the administration tried to dance its way out of the corner. Shortly after the interview, during the daily briefing of State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, a reporter asked Boucher to explain Bolton’s comments and wondered, “Are you now prepared to nuke un-nuked countries?” Boucher claimed “Bolton was reiterating…a policy that the United States government has had since the 1970s.” This was exactly wrong. Bolton had dismissed that policy. Then Boucher repeated the statement that Christopher had issued in 1995. So policy reversed was unreversed.

But maybe not. Boucher added a caveat, noting that the U.S. “will do whatever is necessary to deter the use of weapons of mass destruction against the United States, its allies, and its interests.” He asserted that “those kind of statements have been made repeatedly since the 1970s,” and he quoted a 1996 remark from then-Defense Secretary William Perry, who said that if the United States was attacked by chemical weapons, “we could have a devastating response without the use of nuclear weapons, but we would not forswear that possibility.”

In covering for Bolton and claiming nothing had changed, Boucher appeared to have stretched the weapons-of-mass-destruction loophole. He was not only saying, as Perry did, that nuclear weapons could be used in retaliation after a chemical weapons attack against the United States; he was warning that nuclear arms might be used preemptively to prevent such an attack. And that is indeed the policy contained in the new Nuclear Posture Review. If the United States has (or says it has) reason to believe a non-nuclear-weapon state is amassing biological weapons for use against the United States, then that country qualifies for the nuclear hit list.

Bolton, despite Boucher’s spin, was indeed speaking for an administration that does not see merit in declaring we-won’t-nuke-the-un-nuked in order to enhance nonproliferation efforts. As Bush’s disregard of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty demonstrated, this crowd is drawn more to unilateral force decisions than to multilateral nonproliferation endeavors. The more worrisome portions of the Nuclear Posture review may only be what-ifs. But in nuclear diplomacy, what-ifs and words do count. The Bush administration’s new weapon plan is a shot against the nations he has rhetorically targeted but also a strike against governments and diplomats that take nuclear nonproliferation seriously."

In Oslo on December 10, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) and was accepted on behalf of the Campaign by its executive director, Beatrice Fihn, and by Setsuko Thurlow, an ICAN campaigner and survivor of the 1945 Hiroshima bombing. Both spoke for the thousands of campaigners in over 400 organizations and more than 100 countries around the world who succeeded this fall in working with friendly governments to move a majority of states at the United Nations to adopt a treaty to prohibit to ban nuclear weapons, making their possession, use, or threat of use unlawful. Ad Policy

The ceremony opened with a piercing fanfare by four trumpeters, their horns hung with crimson banners, from a stone balcony high up in the sunlit-filled, mosaic-covered Oslo City Hall over a distinguished crowd below that included a former Peace Prize laureate; ambassadors and other government officials, including the prime minister of Norway and the mayor of Hiroshima; movie stars and rock stars; as well as several hundred grassroots ICAN campaigners from every corner of the globe. As the trumpets sounded, the king and queen of Norway and the crown prince and princess strode down the red-carpeted aisle, followed by members of the Nobel Committee and the two ICAN speakers.

It has been just 10 years since ICAN first launched its astonishing campaign to ban nuclear weapons, just as chemical and biological weapons have been banned as well as land mines and cluster bombs. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has now closed a legal gap in the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that only requires “good faith efforts for nuclear disarmament” by the then-five existing nuclear weapons states—the United States, Russia, UK, France, China. ICAN organized a series of three major conferences in Norway, Mexico, and Austria together with government leaders, scientists, lawyers, and other experts, including representatives from the International Red Cross, a critical actor in this journey to ban the bomb. It was the International Red Cross who contributed a unique statement about the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons in 2000 that changed the global conversation about these devastating instruments of mass destruction.

Instead of nuclear weapons’ being described in abstract terms, with references to strategic security needs and deterrence policies, a conversation dominated by the nuclear-weapons states and by US nuclear allies in NATO, as well as Japan, Australia, and South Korea (none of whom support the new treaty), there has been a shift in how nuclear weapons are discussed. There is a a growing realization that these military and security concepts fail to acknowledge the catastrophic humanitarian consequences that would result from any use of a nuclear weapon. The new conversation was given a great boost by the Vatican, which participated in the UN negotiations and held a subsequent nuclear-disarmament conference this month to discuss its newly announced policy change from one that supported the concept of “deterrence” for the use of nuclear weapons in “self-defense” to a new policy declaring that nuclear weapons must never be used under any circumstances.

Despite the nearly 50-year-old NPT promise by the nuclear-weapons states for nuclear disarmament, ICAN Executive Director Fihn, in her acceptance speech, reminded us that “at dozens of locations around the world—in missile silos buried in our earth, on submarines navigating through our oceans, and aboard planes flying high in our sky—lie 15,000 objects of humankind’s destruction,” adding that “it is insanity to allow ourselves to be ruled by these weapons.”

Fihn went on to note that critics of ICAN’s success in closing the legal gap in the NPT with the new ban treaty describe its campaigners as “the irrational ones, idealists with no grounding in reality. That the nuclear-armed states will never give up their weapons.”

But we represent the only rational choice. We represent those who refuse to accept nuclear weapons as a fixture in our world, those who refuse to have their fates bound up in a few lines of launch code. Ours is the only reality that is possible. The alternative is unthinkable. The story of nuclear weapons will have an ending, and it is up to us what that ending will be. Will it be the end of nuclear weapons, or will it be the end of us? One of these things will happen. The only rational course of action is to cease living under the conditions where our mutual destruction is only one impulsive tantrum away. Current Issue View our current issue

Fihn also exclaimed, to enthusiastic applause, “Man—not woman!—made nuclear weapons to control others, but instead we are controlled.”

They made us false promises. That by making the consequences of using these weapons so unthinkable it would make any conflict unpalatable. That it would keep us free from war. But far from preventing war, these weapons brought us to the brink multiple times throughout the Cold War. And in this century, these weapons continue to escalate us towards war and conflict. In Iraq, in Iran, in Kashmir, in North Korea. Their existence propels others to join the nuclear race. They don’t keep us safe, they cause conflict…. But they are just weapons. They are just tools. And just as they were created by geopolitical context, they can just as easily be destroyed by placing them in a humanitarian context. That is the task ICAN has set.

Fihn called on all nations and each of the nine nuclear weapons states individually to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, saying,

The United States, choose freedom over fear.

Russia, choose disarmament over destruction.

Britain, choose the rule of law over oppression.

France, choose human rights over terror.

China, choose reason over irrationality.

India, choose sense over senselessness.

Pakistan, choose logic over Armageddon.

Israel, choose common sense over obliteration.

North Korea, choose wisdom over ruin.

She also asked the nations “who believe they are sheltered under the umbrella of nuclear weapons, will you be complicit in your own destruction and the destruction of others in your name?” And she called on all citizens to “Stand with us and demand your government side with humanity and sign this treaty,” noting that “no nations today boast of being a chemical weapons states” or “argue that it is acceptable, in extreme circumstances, to use sarin nerve agent” or “to unleash on its enemy the plague or polio. That is because international norms have been set, perceptions have been changed. And now, at last, we have an unequivocal norm against nuclear weapons.”

Setsuko Thurlow, an ICAN campaigner who survived the bombing of Hiroshima as a 13-year-old, spoke next, bearing witness to the excruciating pain and terror she saw all around her as she escaped from the rubble she was buried under in the bomb’s aftermath, where so many of her schoolmates died and where so many of her family were lost as well. She reminded us that “in the weeks, months and years that followed, many thousands more would die, often in random and mysterious ways, from the delayed effects of radiation to this day, radiation is killing survivors.”

She acknowledged the suffering and willingness to bear witness not only of the Hibakusha, as Japanese refer to the survivors of the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also of others who suffered from the nuclear age, including peoples “whose lands and seas were irradiated, whose bodies were experimented upon, whose cultures were forever disrupted” in places with “long-forgotten names” like Mururoa, Ekker, Semipalatinsk, Maralinga, Bikini.

Through our agony and the sheer struggle to survive—and to rebuild our lives from the ashes—we hibakusha became convinced that we must warn the world about these apocalyptic weapons. Time and again, we shared our testimonies. But still some refused to see Hiroshima and Nagasaki as atrocities—as war crimes. They accepted the propaganda that these were “good bombs” that had ended a “just war.” It was this myth that led to the disastrous nuclear-arms race—a race that continues to this day. Nine nations still threaten to incinerate entire cities, to destroy life on earth, to make our beautiful world uninhabitable for future generations. The development of nuclear weapons signifies not a country’s elevation to greatness but its descent to the darkest depths of depravity. These weapons are not a necessary evil; they are the ultimate evil.

Thurlow went on to say:

On the seventh of July this year, I was overwhelmed with joy when a great majority of the world’s nations voted to adopt the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Having witnessed humanity at its worst, I witnessed, that day, humanity at its best. We hibakusha had been waiting for the ban for seventy-two years. Let this be the beginning of the end of nuclear weapons. All responsible leaders will sign this treaty. And history will judge harshly those who reject it. No longer shall their abstract theories mask the genocidal reality of their practices. No longer shall “deterrence” be viewed as anything but a deterrent to disarmament. No longer shall we live under a mushroom cloud of fear. To the officials of nuclear-armed nations—and to their accomplices under the so-called “nuclear umbrella”—I say this: Listen to our testimony. Heed our warning. And know that your actions are consequential. You are each an integral part of a system of violence that is endangering humankind. Let us all be alert to the banality of evil.

Both speakers received standing ovations for their moving addresses and calls to action, and, with a room filled with hundreds of grassroots campaigners, the thunderous applause for the speakers was noted to be highly unusual for a Nobel award ceremony. The legal requirement for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to enter into force and to be binding on its signatories is that it must be ratified by 50 nations. To date, 56 countries have signed the treaty and four nations have ratified it in their legislatures.

To get involved in the ICAN campaign, visit http://www.icanw.org. There is a Parliamentary Pledge there that you can use to enroll your member of Congress or Parliament in calling for your nation to support the ban treaty. In the nuclear-weapons states and in the US nuclear alliance with NATO states and Australia, South Korea, and Japan in the Pacific—the “nuclear umbrella” states—grassroots efforts are under way to begin the stigmatization of their nuclear weapons and policies with a divestment campaign from nuclear-weapons manufacturers, since the treaty prohibits any “assistance” for nuclear weapons.

There have been demonstrations in Buchel, Germany, where activists have read the new treaty aloud to military personnel at a military base where US nuclear weapons are kept. Four other NATO countries also have US nuclear weapons on their bases—Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Turkey. This activity is banned under the treaty’s prohibition on any “possession” of nuclear weapons. See the new treaty here."

On Saturday morning, people in Hawaii awoke to emergency alerts on their phones. ballistic missile threat inbound to hawaii. seek immediate shelter. this is not a drill. Ad Policy

There was no incoming missile. But it took the authorities 38 minutes to send another message alerting people that it was a false alarm. Before that, people were relying on Twitter for information. Some hid in their bathrooms, some went to public spaces, others just huddled where they were. Families called each other to say goodbye.

Those 38 minutes of terror reflect only a tiny fraction of the emotional trauma caused by nuclear weapons. These weapons have a legacy of anguish, pain, and suffering. From the horror experienced by the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, to the torment of those whose lands and waters nuclear weapons were tested upon in the ensuing decades, to the fear of the entire world held in the grip of possible nuclear annihilation, these weapons have scarred our global community. They will scar us further if we allow this situation to continue—until they kill us.

The sentiment expressed by many Hawaiians in the days following was that they had no idea where to go or what to do. They were not prepared for nuclear war. How could they be? There really is no way to prepare for a nuclear blast, nor for the radioactive fallout. Shelters, iodine pills, or duck-and-cover routines can only get you so far. If multiple nuclear weapons are exchanged, all of the preparation could can dream of would not be sufficient.

We are also not emotionally prepared. From the 1950s to the ’80s, the threat of nuclear war was part of our cultural experience. Films, books, and television programs exposed the risks and the possible consequences of the nuclear arms race. Activism against the bomb was at an all-time high: In 1982, 1 million people marched in Central Park to demand nuclear disarmament. Today, most people rarely think about nuclear weapons. With “fire and fury” back in the headlines, this may be changing, but we are still largely in collective denial about the risks.

We have been taught that these weapons are not meant to be used. We are taught that they protect us from conflict, war, and further nuclear proliferation. This lethal myth is based on the premise that in order to maintain international peace and security, we need certain countries to wield the capacity to slaughter civilians, incinerate cities, and destroy the entire planet. We believe that nuclear war will never happen, that nuclear weapons prevent it.

But many of us—including the majority of the world’s governments—understand that the only way to prevent nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons. The alert in Hawaii could have prompted a nuclear war. So could a tweet from a president with a bruised ego. And so could any number of things. As then–UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in 2013, “There are no right hands for wrong weapons.” Current Issue View our current issue

It is in this spirit that 122 governments voted to adopt a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons on July 7, 2017. While the nuclear-armed states currently oppose it, this treaty offers an alternative to nuclear war.

It prohibits the use, threat of use, and possession of nuclear weapons, and sets out a process by which states with such weapons can join and eliminate their arsenals. Significantly, it recognizes that any use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to international humanitarian law. It puts nuclear weapons on the same legal footing as the other weapons of mass destruction (biological and chemical). The treaty makes no attempt to justify the possession or use of these weapons and makes no arguments in favor of deterrence doctrines. Nuclear weapons have been granted an exception for far too long. The 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was supposed to lead to disarmament: The nuclear-armed states agreed to eliminate their arsenals in exchange for the rest of the world agreeing never to develop them. But while proliferation has been limited, the nuclear-armed have failed to deliver on their disarmament commitments. Some have reduced the size of their arsenals only to invest billions of dollars into modernizing them. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons takes a new approach: outlawing these weapons for everyone, under all circumstances.

What happened in Hawaii should spur us to action to eliminate this threat once and for all. We must not wait for a real incoming missile to blast apart a beloved city, to incinerate our—or anyone else’s—families and friends. We should use this moment as a wake-up call.

Disarmament will not be easy. But what is more of a hassle: engaging in the work of eliminating nuclear weapons, or losing entire cities, continents, the planet?"

Throughout history, war has brought death not only in battle but also from starvation and disease. In pre-industrial conflicts, marching armies trampled crops, seized food supplies, pressed young farmhands into military service and starved out cities under siege. Large groups of soldiers, traveling over great distances and living together cheek-by-jowl in makeshift and unhygienic conditions, spread epidemics, causing further suffering. In the Thirty Years’ War, from 1618 to 1648, up to a third of the population of Germany is estimated to have died from this deadly combination of causes. World War I was the first international conflict in which more troops were killed by enemy action than by disease. In the same conflict, more than half a million Germans died from malnutrition as a result of an Allied blockade of Germany’s overseas food supplies. Epidemics have rarely been a weapon of war, one reason being that they have a habit of spreading without regard to which side their victims are fighting for. But starving out the enemy always has. Ad Policy World War II and the Battle for Food. By Lizzie Collingham. Penguin Press. 634 pp. $36. Food Fights by Richard J. Evans

The combatant nations of World War I learned through logistical error and terrible suffering the importance of securing adequate food supplies in a prolonged armed conflict. Not least as a result of this experience, as Lizzie Collingham shows in her superb new study The Taste of War, these same nations went to considerable lengths to keep their armies and civilian populations alive and well fed during World War II. For Germany and in particular its leader, Adolf Hitler, the memory of mass malnutrition and starvation during the earlier conflict was an ever-present trauma. From early in his political life, Hitler wanted to conquer “living-space” for Germany in Eastern Europe and draw on the huge grain resources of Ukraine to feed the German armed forces. The Nazis had no intention of repeating the mistake of World War I, when rationing was introduced too late to save the situation. Indeed, although Collingham claims that rationing was introduced in Germany in August 1939, it had already been in place for two years before that. Already by the mid-1930s, military and arms industry conscription, the requisitioning of huge tracts of agricultural land for military purposes and the imposition of foreign exchange controls to curb food imports had led to a dramatic fall in food pro-

duction and a concomitant rise in food prices. In 1936 prices were frozen, and on January 1, 1937, rationing was introduced for butter, margarine and fat; consumption of coffee and citrus fruit was restricted early in 1939. The German economy was on a war footing long before the war began.

Hitler managed to keep people at home in Germany reasonably well fed until the later stages of the war. Collingham reckons that around 40 percent of the bread and meat eaten by the armed forces and civilians in the Reich was produced in the occupied territories or by laborers deported from these countries to work on German farms. Her claim that “in Germany the population only began to experience hunger after May 1945,” however, rests on too easy an acceptance of postwar memories, when many Germans blamed the Allied occupation for failing to feed the German population. Food supplies in Germany had already begun to break down in the fall of 1944, as the armed forces lost control over Eastern Europe with the westward advance of the Red Army, and road and rail communications within Germany were being severely disrupted by Allied bombing. The Nazi regime cut domestic bread rations from 12,450 grams in May 1944 to 9,700 in August, 8,900 in December, and 3,600 in April 1945. The meat ration was reduced from 1,900 grams to 550 over the same period. Nobody could live on what they were officially allowed to buy; a huge black market, run by escaped foreign workers, emerged, with gangs engaged in regular shootouts with the Gestapo. The incidence of diseases like tuberculosis, boosted by malnutrition and debilitation, rose sharply in 1944. And indeed, Collingham concedes that there were “worsening food shortages in Germany’s cities until, in the last months before the Allied victory, the supply system broke down.”

If food shortages were bad in Germany, they were catastrophic in Eastern Europe. Germany, as Collingham notes, “exported wartime hunger to the countries it occupied.” Beginning with a “hunger plan” hatched by the leading civil servant in the Food Ministry, Herbert Backe, and expanding in scope and ambition into the “General Plan for the East,” devised at the behest of SS chief Heinrich Himmler, Nazi food policy envisaged the deliberate starvation of between 30 and 45 million Slavs (Collingham’s claim of 100 million seems exaggerated), its effects to be accelerated by denying them access to medical care. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, cities like Kharkov, bombed and blasted by air attacks and house-to-house fighting, were left without basic facilities such as water, sewerage, gas and electricity. The infrastructure was destroyed. The occupying German forces banned civilians from entering or leaving the city. The retreating Soviet forces had already implemented a scorched-earth policy, denying the incoming Germans food by burning or ruining all the warehouses stockpiled with grain, corn, flour and vegetables. Half the population was evacuated; those who remained were condemned by the Soviets as traitors. “There are no stores,” wrote a contemporary living in the city, “no markets, no shops of any kind…. The town is void of eatables like a desert.” By the end of 1942 a third of the remaining 450,000 inhabitants were dead, almost all of them from starvation. In Leningrad (present-day St. Petersburg), besieged for more than two years by German forces under orders to starve the city out rather than take it by storm, with all the heavy military losses that would imply, at least a million people died of starvation, and there were widespread reports of people eating dead bodies in their desperation to stay alive.

The mass murder of “useless eaters” began as early as September 1939, as the invading Germans crammed Poland’s Jews into unsanitary and overcrowded ghettos, where they were forced to live on what were literally starvation rations. In the Warsaw ghetto one observer saw only “nightmare figures, ghosts of former human beings” suffering from “emaciation and sickliness.” Desperate inhabitants fought over scraps, losing all human dignity. Thousands died every week; altogether as many as 100,000 starved to death, according to Collingham, though many of the dead had in fact succumbed to diseases such as typhus that were a consequence more of lack of public hygiene than lack of food. Worse was to come. Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union was followed by massive victories and the capture of millions of prisoners of war, who were herded into makeshift enclosures in the open and left to starve to death. Cases of cannibalism were reported here too. Collingham says that 2.35 million died, but this is an underestimate: the generally agreed-on figure is as high as 3.3 million.

The invasion and war in general had an enormous impact on the Soviet Union. Collingham estimates that a third of all people worldwide who died during the war lived in the Soviet Union. Fully 15 percent of the Soviet population did not survive the war—eighty-five people for every Briton or American dead. Around 9 million Red Army combatants were killed, a reflection, among other things, of Stalin’s callous disregard for life as he forced his generals time and again to throw their troops into the fray. In Moscow in 1942, after the German assault had been turned back, it was said that “the sight of men and women falling dead of starvation on [the] streets became too commonplace to attract crowds.” The disruption of communications caused by the German invasion meant that troop rations, meager at the best of times, could be interrupted for days on end. Red Army soldiers became expert foragers, digging up crops, stealing peasants’ honey and potatoes, requisitioning animals and killing them to eat. Some would make a stew of boiled nettles or pine needles to ward off scurvy.

Not only peasants but also town-dwellers suffered. The entire economy was geared ruthlessly to war production. Civilian production virtually collapsed. This happened not least because everything, including food production and distribution, was entirely state-run. Nevertheless, the regime squeezed the agricultural sector into supplying not only the armed forces but also munitions and armaments workers and their families with food, above all with bread, handed out in factories rather than in distribution centers to ensure it went to sustain the war production effort directly by feeding the workers first. People marginal to war production—the elderly, the sick, the disabled, the very young—were denied the basics of existence and died. Overall perhaps as many as 3 million Soviet citizens perished from starvation during the war, though this figure is difficult to square with Collingham’s claim that the total number of civilian dead in the Soviet Union was as high as 20 million.

The United States, worried about the Soviets’ ability to survive under such conditions, shipped huge quantities of food under the lend-lease agreement. An American officer who accompanied one shipment was shocked by the sight of groups of “starved wretches” who gathered on the quayside where shipments were being unloaded to scoop up and eat on the spot “raw meat, scraps or steaming chicken guts thrown out with the [American] ships’ galley garbage.” But however bad life may have been under the Soviet regime, it was far worse under German occupation. Death awaited Red Army soldiers who surrendered, so they fought on. Hunger did not destroy morale. The Soviet Union was “fighting on empty” but it continued to fight, ultimately all the way to victory. The German submarine fleet’s attempt to stop American supplies from reaching the northern seaports of the Soviet Union scored some successes, but ultimately it succumbed to the Allied convoy system, the superiority, in the end, of Allied intelligence and decrypting ability, and the inadequacies of the U-boat fleet. And the situation slowly improved: by 1943 the Soviet Union was receiving more lend-lease food than Britain.

Yet it was not just the Germans who used food as a weapon and tried to deny it to their enemies. The drive for self-sufficiency bolstered by the capture of food-producing areas abroad was part of Japanese military thinking as well. Manchuria, already occupied in the 1930s, was seen as ripe for settlement by Japanese farmers, coercing the existing Chinese and Korean peasants into selling their land cheaply. But the settlement plan was not a success, and Japan’s heavy reliance on imported food meant that when the war in the East began at the end of 1941, supplies were quickly cut off by the Allies, just as conscription and a drastic fall in the deep-sea fishing catch caused a fall in domestic Japanese agricultural output.

Japanese forces abroad depended almost entirely on food supplies from the occupied areas. But just as the harshness of German occupation policy in Europe alienated food producers and caused a fall in production, so too the Japanese massacres of Chinese farmers, particularly in the rice-growing areas of Malaya, combined with the conscription of farm labor for road and railway building and the imposition of a huge indemnity on the Chinese population in southern Burma, left the remaining peasants unwilling to work and determined to hide their produce from the conquerors.

Compounding the disaster, the Japanese tried to introduce regional self-sufficiency in an area where food supplies depended crucially on inter-regional trade. The American blockade established in 1943 administered the coup de grâce to the Asian rice trade, with American submarines sinking increasing quantities of Japanese shipping. Malnutrition became starvation; starvation became famine. In Manila the price of rice increased tenfold between 1941 and the middle of 1943; by the end of 1944 it was forty times more; by the middle of 1945 it had increased fourfold again. Chaos and mismanagement were more to blame for this situation than any deliberate policy of starvation on the part of the Japanese. But like the Germans, the Japanese prioritized their own survival over that of those they ruled.

Collingham explains that the Japanese high command began the war in the belief that the “Japanese army [could]…continue fighting without food, if they had strong morale.” But hunger often saps morale and undermines the fighting spirit, as the Japanese troops were to discover; and in the Asian theater of war, there was no threat of annihilation by the enemy to keep them going, as there was for the Red Army in Europe. As Collingham notes, “During the course of its war with China and America the Japanese military went from being one of the best-fed armed forces in the world to a state of miserable starvation.” Over the decades nutritional experts had devised an innovative and highly effective dietary regime involving non-Japanese food as well as the basic staple of rice (mixed with barley to provide vitamin B). But the disruptive effects of the war with China and then the American blockade forced a halving of the military food ration; and this was still twice as much as the food ration allowed to Japanese civilians.

As American submarines disrupted supply lines, Japanese soldiers on the Pacific islands were particularly badly affected, with 15,000 starving to death on Guadalcanal alone. The survivors who surrendered were emaciated, suffering from scurvy, “thin as thread,” as their commander noted. Ninety percent of the 158,000 Japanese troops in New Guinea died of starvation and tropical diseases, and there were widespread reports that they were killing and eating some of the prisoners they took. In the Philippines 400,000 out of nearly half a million Japanese troops starved to death. The American blockade proved a highly effective weapon. On the other side of the globe, the Germans harbored hopes that similar measures would be able to starve out the British. The story of the Battle of the Atlantic, when German submarines sought to cut off supply lines from North America to the United Kingdom, has been told many times, but usually from the naval angle; Collingham gives it a fresh look by focusing on what the ships carried rather than on how they got their cargo across the ocean. More than half the calories consumed by the British were contained in imported food, but administrative confusion, a prewar depression in the shipbuilding industry and the diversion of the fastest merchant ships to war uses such as carrying troops all created severe bottlenecks in the food supply within two years of the outbreak of the war, if not earlier.

By the winter of 1942–43, the U-boat menace had aggravated the situation. Around 860,000 tons of shipping were lost in November 1942 alone, amounting to 9 percent of food shipments to Britain. Further problems were caused by the diversion of resources to supply the Allied landings in North Africa. “The country never realized how nearly we were brought to disaster by the submarine peril,” noted the wartime Minister of Food Lord Woolton in his memoirs. Yet improvisation usually got food to the right places when supplies failed to arrive. The British did not starve.

It was a different story across the far-flung territories of Britain’s overseas empire. The Middle East Supply Centre successfully reorganized trade and agriculture in the region to ensure that people continued to be fed despite the arrival of large numbers of British troops. Similar efforts were not undertaken elsewhere, however. In the absence of rationing or price controls such as had been imposed in Britain, rising demand caused by the need to buy up supplies for British troops fueled inflation, which soon put many foodstuffs out of reach of the poor in parts of the empire. Food supplies were cut off by wartime activity—some African colonies, for example, had depended heavily on imported rice from Burma and other British territories in the Far East, now no longer available because of the Japanese invasion of those countries. A drought in East Africa made things worse and famine ensued, spreading beyond British territories to claim 300,000 lives in Rwanda alone. Isolated island territories such as Mauritius were particularly vulnerable, and their inhabitants began to suffer severe malnutrition.

• • •

Worst of all was the situation in Bengal. The complacent and inefficient colonial administration in India did nothing to curb inflation, speculation and hoarding, even when Burma fell to the Japanese, depriving the subcontinent of 15 percent of its rice supply. Provincial governments in India reacted by banning the export of food to other provinces, strangling the machinery of trade in food in what one food controller called an outbreak of “insane provincial protectionism.” The winter rice harvest of 1942 failed because of a fungal disease that spread rapidly in unusually warm and humid weather. No measures were taken to impose rationing or force hoarders to disgorge supplies, for fear of provoking political dissent in the economic elites who were benefiting financially from the situation.

Churchill ordered a 60 percent cut in military and civilian shipping to the Indian Ocean, commenting that Indians should not take food supplies that could be used by the mother country. Thus Britain as well as Germany exported food shortages to its empire. Even if this was not, as with Germany, the product of a deliberate policy of starvation, the result was much the same: famine victims poured into Calcutta in the summer of 1943, a vast, slow, dispirited noiseless army of apathetic skeletons, as one observer described them. As many as 3 million people may have died from starvation and from diseases, such as cholera, associated with the movements of large numbers of people across the country.

The government imposed strict censorship to stop news of the famine from spreading, and it was only when Viscount Wavell was appointed viceroy of India in September 1943 that decisive action was taken. Worried about morale among the Indian troops charged with the recapture of Burma, Wavell overrode the disastrous policy of regional protectionism and introduced an effective system of rationing and distribution. Even so, Wavell had to overcome considerable resistance from Churchill and the government in London. Surprisingly, perhaps, the memory of the famine played almost no part in the Congress Party’s demand for Indian independence after the war; most of its leaders were in prison and did not witness the severity of the disaster. And the Indian elites who backed independence had been partly responsible for the famine themselves, as they had occupied prominent positions in provincial administrations during the war, above all in Bengal, where the famine was concentrated.

Meanwhile, other parts of the British Empire were mobilized to increase food production for the war effort. Australia doubled the amount of land devoted to vegetable farming and supplied vast quantities of dried and canned foodstuffs to the American forces in the Pacific. The United States itself had such enormous surpluses of food that it was able to provide a rich diet to the Pacific islands when it won them back from the Japanese. “We fed the Japanese,” one Tuvaluan islander put it; “the Americans fed us.” GIs, sailors and marines poured into the islands, spending liberally and fueling a rapid rise in prosperity. Yet as the conflict subsided, there was hunger everywhere, especially in the defeated nations. By the end of the war, indeed, food production in Europe had fallen to 36 percent of its prewar levels.

The desperate situation in the Soviet Union was made worse by the failure of the harvest in 1946. A year later perhaps 2 million Soviet citizens had died from starvation and associated diseases. In many places rationing remained in place well into the 1950s. The Americans viewed deprivation in Germany as a punishment for the crimes of Nazism, and stopped food relief from entering the country until they realized that a discontented and depressed population might become nostalgic about Hitler or could succumb to the lure of communism, as Stalin, even at the cost of his own population’s survival, sought to gain support in satellite states and the Soviet zone of occupied Germany by pouring in food. Only gradually, as the world economy recovered and then began to boom, did the situation improve.

Examining in detail the role played by food in the greatest of all political conflicts, the Second World War, was a brilliant idea on Collingham’s part. The Taste of War is breathtaking in its breadth and scope, global in coverage and yet anchored in detailed research. Despite the inevitable mistakes and inaccuracies of detail, which should be corrected in the paperback reprint, this is a book that anyone interested in the role played by control of food supplies in the war will want to read. Much of the material is fresh and compelling, and many of the individual vignettes, anecdotes and quotations are heartrendingly moving in their depiction of the immensity of the suffering many people had to endure.

Yet by looking everywhere for the impact of the “battle for food,” Collingham’s book has an inbuilt tendency to downplay other aspects of the conflict. Often this involves picking out one side in a controversial area simply because it supports the argument that food supplies were of crucial historical importance. For example, the sharp acceleration of Germany’s mass murder of Jews in the late spring and early summer of 1942 was justified by some German officials as necessary because of the critical position of food supplies to the German forces and civilian population at the time. Yet it is possible that the officials were simply providing what seemed to them to be a convenient military rationalization for an ideologically motivated policy. After all, there is evidence that senior SS officers had already decided in the autumn of 1941 that Europe’s Jews were to be taken to the east: the first large-scale gassing facilities began to be constructed in October and November of that year; the Wannsee Conference, held early in 1942 after several weeks’ postponement, already envisaged the ultimate extermination of the world’s Jews. All this was driven by the paranoid belief of the Nazi leadership that Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin were puppets of an international Jewish conspiracy against Germany that had to be stopped at any price.

It would be unfortunate if readers took away from this impressive book only the belief that the battle for food “shaped the events of World War II,” to quote the promotional copy, or that “access to food drove both Nazi Germany and imperial Japan to occupation.” Other, more significant factors were involved; the food supplies of Eastern Europe, for instance, were important to the Nazis principally as a way of securing Germany for the greater struggle with the United States that lay ahead. The Taste of War is a book, then, that has to be read in conjunction with other histories of the war; it views the conflict from one angle only, and the war needs to be seen in the round."

In addition to highlighting the embarrassing degree to which the American media are seduced by displays of American military might, their rush to embrace President Trump’s decision to launch a military attack against Syria on April 6 has also crowded out dissenting voices from the administration’s claim that it was the government of Bashar al-Assad that was responsible for the chemical-weapons attack in Khan Sheikhun, which killed over 80 people and injured hundreds. Ad Policy

By firing 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air base in Syria, and killing five Syrian soldiers and nine civilians in the process, President Trump was able to transform himself in the eyes of the media from an object of derision into, in the words of erstwhile Trump critic Elliot Abrams, “Leader of the Free World.”

Dissent from what amounts to a new party line has been noticeably absent. As the investigative journalist Robert Parry recently observed, “All the Important People who appeared on the TV shows or who were quoted in the mainstream media trusted the images provided by Al Qaeda–related propagandists and ignored documented prior cases in which the Syrian rebels staged chemical weapons incidents to implicate the Assad government.”

Former British ambassador to Syria Peter Ford told the BBC last week that he seriously doubted that Assad was the culprit. “Assad,” said Ford, “may be cruel, brutal but he’s not mad. It defies belief that he would bring this all on his head for no military advantage.” Ford said he believes the accusations against Syria are “simply not plausible.”

And so, on what evidence and intelligence was Trump’s decision based upon?

On April 11, the White House released a declassified four-page report meant to prove its case against Assad and serve as a belated justification for the Tomahawk attack on Syria’s Shayrat air base.

The report, which was authored not by US intelligence agencies but by the White House under the supervision of national-security adviser H.R. McMaster, says that “The United States is confident that the Syrian regime conducted a chemical weapons attack, using the nerve agent sarin, against its own people in the town of Khan Shaykhun in southern Idlib Province on April 4, 2017.”

The report relies on “open source” videos for proof of its claim that a “chemical munition landed not on a facility filled with weapons,” as the Russians and Syrians have claimed, “but in the middle of a street in the northern section of Khan Shaykhun. Commercial satellite imagery of that site from April 6, after the allegation, shows a crater in the road that corresponds to the open source video.”

Yet the administration’s report has come under withering scrutiny from Dr. Theodore Postol, a professor emeritus of science, technology, and national-security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who once served as a scientific adviser to the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon.

Postol’s exhaustive critique of the White House report notes that “The only undisputable facts stated in the White House report is the claim that a chemical attack using nerve agent occurred in Khan Shaykhun, Syria.” And yet, according to Postol, “the report contains absolutely no evidence that this attack was the result of a munition being dropped from an aircraft. In fact, the report contains absolutely no evidence that would indicate who was the perpetrator of this atrocity.”

Postol writes that “The only source the document cites as evidence that the attack was by the Syrian government is the crater it claims to have identified on a road in the North of Khan Shaykhun.” Yet his analysis of the photographs of the crater provided by the White House “clearly indicates that the munition was almost certainly placed on the ground with an external detonating explosive on top of it that crushed the container so as to disperse the alleged load of sarin.”

And so, “In order to cover up the lack of intelligence to supporting the president’s action, the National Security Council produced a fraudulent intelligence report.” Postol concludes that the “report is completely undermined by a significant body of video evidence taken after the alleged sarin attack and before the US cruise missile attack that unambiguously shows the claims in the WHR [White House Report] could not possibly be true.”

The Nation spoke to Postol over the weekend.

“What I think is now crystal clear,” he said, “is that the White House report was fabricated and it certainly did not follow the procedures it claimed to employ.”

“My best guess at the moment is that this was an extremely clumsy and ill-conceived attempt to cover up the fact that Trump attacked Syria without any intelligence evidence that Syria was in fact the perpetrator of the attack…. It may be,” he continued, “that the White House staff was worried that this could eventually come out—a reckless president acting without regard to the nation’s security, risking an inadvertent escalation and confrontation with Russia, and a breakdown in cooperation with Russia that would cripple our efforts to defeat the Islamic State.”

“If that is not an impeachable offense,” Postol told The Nation, “then I do not know what is.”

It is entirely possible, of course, that dissenting voices like Postol’s and Ambassador Ford’s may ultimately be proved wrong, and that Assad was indeed behind the chemical-weapons attack.

Indeed, if it is true, as CNN reported on April 13, that the “US military and intelligence community has intercepted communications featuring Syrian military and chemical experts talking about preparations for the sarin attack in Idlib,” then that would be hard, if not impossible, to explain away. Meanwhile, US officials are not backing away from their claim that there is “no doubt” that the Syrian government ordered the attack.

But at this early stage, questions such as those posed by Postol and Ford should be aired by the US media, not ignored. And, given that the US intelligence community has seemingly kept its distance from the administration’s claims, a serious investigation into what exactly took place is all the more necessary.

Robert Parry writes, “it remains a mystery why this intelligence assessment is not coming directly from President Trump’s intelligence chiefs as is normally the case, either with an official Intelligence Estimate or a report issued by the Director of National Intelligence.”

Philip Giraldi, a former CIA case officer and Army intelligence officer, told radio host Scott Horton on April 6 that he was “hearing from sources on the ground in the Middle East, people who are intimately familiar with the intelligence that is available, who are saying the essential narrative we are hearing about the Syrians and Russians using chemical weapons is a sham.” Ready to Fight Back?

Giraldi also noted that “people in the both the agency [CIA] and in the military who are aware of the intelligence are freaking out about this because essentially Trump completely misrepresented” what had taken place in Khan Sheikhun. Giraldi reports that his sources in the military and the intelligence community “are astonished by how this is being played by the administration and by the US media.”

Given the seriousness of the questions raised by Giraldi, one can’t help but wonder if the administration’s motives for launching the missile strike were motivated by considerations other than those which they have aired thus far. What exactly was the rush? The findings of an investigation into the attack by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is expected to be released in only two weeks’ time.

In the meantime, according to a report from the April 5 meeting of the UN Security Council, the UN’s high representative for disarmament affairs, Kim Won-soo, informed the council that “the information on the reported 4 April use of chemical weapons in Khan Shaykhun, in Syria’s Idlib Governorate, was still coming in.” The high representative could also not confirm who carried out the attack, though both sides of the six-year-long Syrian war have been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons.

Yet, in spite of all this, Trump, perhaps sensing political advantage, rushed to execute a unilateral and illegal military response. The fact that he did so raises serious questions about his judgment, as well as the judgment of all the pundits who applauded him.

But perhaps the enthusiasm that greeted Trump’s missile strike was misplaced. Ambassador Ford warns that “Trump has just given the jihadis a thousand reasons to stage fake flag operations, seeing how successful and how easy it is with a gullible media to provoke the West into intemperate reactions.”

It hardly needs saying that highlighting these dissenting voices is not tantamount to excusing Assad’s heinous human-rights record or his previous attacks, which have killed countless innocent Syrians. Rather, it is to draw attention to the failure of the US media, which have once again abdicated their responsibilities by ignoring the serious questions and allegations raised by Postol, Giraldi, and Ford about the White House’s intelligence relating to the chemical-weapons attack in Syria."

Yesterday, an outspoken white atheist murdered three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We don’t yet know for sure whether this was a hate crime or whether the killer, Craig Stephen Hicks, had some other motivation; police have said the crime may have grown out of a dispute over parking. We do know that had Hicks been a Muslim and his victims atheists, few would be waiting for all the facts to come in before declaring him a terrorist. We know that there would be the usual calls for other Muslims to condemn the killings, coupled with the usual failure to take note of the many Muslims who did. And we know that demands for Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins to distance themselves from Hicks are largely facetious, because no one really blames them. Violence perpetrated by Muslims is almost always seen as part of a global conspiracy, whereas white men like Hicks are usually seen as isolated psychopaths. Ad Policy

There is, of course, some truth there. An organized jihadist movement exists; an organized cadre of terroristic atheists does not. Yet in the United States, Islamophobia has been a consistent motivator of violence. Hicks’s killing of Yusor Mohammad, her husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, should not be treated like a man-bites-dog story, a reversal of the usual pattern of terrorism. After all, Muslims in the United States are more often the victims of ideological violence than the perpetrators of it.

According to the latest FBI statistics, there were more than 160 anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2013. Mosques and Islamic centers have been firebombed and vandalized; seven mosques were attacked during Ramadan alone in 2012. Several Muslims, or people thought to be Muslim, have been murdered or viciously attacked. In 2010, a white college student and self-described patriot tried to slash the throat of Bangladeshi cab driver Ahmed Sharif. The white supremacist who slaughtered six people in a Sikh temple in 2012 may have thought he was targeting Muslims. So, apparently, did Erika Menendez, the homeless New Yorker who pushed a man named Sunando Sen in front of a subway train that same year.

In most cases, the perpetrators have been disaffected, disaffiliated losers rather than part of any movement, but they’ve picked up broader currents of hatred and conspiracy theorizing. (The same can be said of some lone-wolf Muslim terrorists like Man Haron Monis, the fraudster and criminal who took hostages in Sydney last year, or the Tsarnaev brothers, who bombed the Boston marathon in 2013.) We don’t yet know if Hicks was driven by lonely fanaticism, but if he was, he’s not as much of an anomaly as he might at first appear. Explicitly atheist violence is unusual, but Hicks still fits the profile of the most common type of American terrorist: a white man with a weapon and a grudge."

The Donetsk Whodunnit: Ukraine and Russia Blame at Each Other for Shooting Down Malaysian Jet

Soon after the horrific news began circulating that a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 had crashed in eastern Ukraine, both the Kiev forces and pro-Russian rebels fighting there agreed that the plane had been shot down. But explanations of who shot it down—and why—immediately began diverging wildly in what has become the latest battle in the information war that has been waged between Ukraine and Russia since protests began in Kiev in November. The 295 people killed in the crash could not temper the politicized finger-pointing. Ad Policy

American and Ukrainian authorities said the plane had been hit by a surface-to-air missile, and speculation immediately centered on the Buk (otherwise called a “Gadfly”) missile launcher that Kiev said the rebels had used to shoot it down. Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the Ukrainian interior minister, wrote on his Facebook account shortly after the crash that “terrorists shot down a passenger plane with a Buk missile that Putin kindly gave to them.… The cynicism of Putin and his terrorists knows no bounds!” He called on the United States and Europe to “help us with everything you can.”

For his part, Vladimir Putin refrained from saying who might have shot down the plane in a segment broadcast on Russian television, but noted that Ukraine “bears responsibility” for the downing of an airliner on its territory.

The rebels immediately began denying their involvement and blaming the Ukrainian military. On Twitter and in interviews, Alexander Borodai, the Muscovite who heads the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, maintained that the rebels did not have weapons capable of hitting an airplane at the height Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was traveling, above 32,000 feet.

“It was shot down by the Ukrainian military. I think this is a deliberate provocation,” Borodai said, using the term that both sides have employed to explain many murky incidents over the four months of fighting in eastern Ukraine.

But the rebels by their own admission do have these missiles, as Russian news agencies reported at the end of June. The Donetsk People’s Republic Twitter account even posted a photo of the missiles at the time. A correspondent in eastern Ukraine for Russian state-controlled channel Rossiya-24 later reported that the militia does possess Buk launchers, but that they’re “all undergoing repair.”

Pundits in the Western media quickly joined Gerashchenko in claiming that Moscow had provided the pro-Russian militia with the advanced missile launchers. The Ukrainian representative to the United Nations went further, promising to “present the evidence of Russian military involvement into the Boeing crash.” But Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said allegations of Russian involvement “stupidity,” and the rebels had said in June that they captured the Buk missiles from a Ukrainian air-defense base near the village of Oleksiivka.

The Ukrainian intelligence service released an intercepted recording it said showed Russian rebels admitting to downing the plane, but dismayed that it had turned out to be a civilian flight. Similarly, a deleted post on a social network page that has published statements by the rebels’ military leader, Muscovite Igor Strelkov, praised the downing of the plane, also under the assumption it was a military flight.

Meanwhile, increasingly wild versions of events began to appear. Representatives of the neighboring Lugansk People’s Republic told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that unnamed witnesses had seen a Ukrainian fighter jet attack the Boeing 777.

Russian defence analyst Igor Korotchenko, editor of the National Defence journal, said on Rossiya 24 and RIA Novosti it was “obvious” that MH17 had been accidentally shot down by poorly trained Ukrainian government forces while checking the battle readiness of a Buk missile launcher. But Western military experts on CBS News and elsewhere argued that taking down the plane with a Buk would require extensive training and a careful shot.

RT and other Russian media began quoting a confidential source at Russian Aviation arguing that Ukrainian forces had been trying to down Russia’s presidential plane, which he or she said had passed through a certain airspace near Warsaw shortly after the Malaysian airliner had.

Among Twitter accounts supporting the rebellion in Ukraine, it was common knowledge Ukrainian forces had shot down the airliner, only their goal had been to draw Western forces into the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Rossiya 24 hinted at a similar conclusion when in between segments on the downed Boeing 777 it broadcast a recap of Siberia Airlines Flight 1812, which the Ukrainian military admitted to accidentally shooting down over the Black Sea in 2001.

Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst and columnist for the independent Novaya Gazeta, said the fact that the rebels had shot down a Ukrainian military An-26 transport aircraft on Monday at about 20,000 feet—one of three military aircraft they downed this week—proved that they had acquired more powerful weaponry.

“The most plausible explanation is, of course, it was the rebels with Russian help, or Russian volunteers on the side of the rebels,” who shot down Malaysia Airlines flight 17, Felgenhauer said. “That’s more plausible than all other shit being circulated.”"

While you were lighting your candles to Selena’s memory this morning to mark the 20th anniversary of her death, it probably did not occur to you that The Nation, in that memorable spring of sadness and sorrow, might have had something to add to the national outpouring of grief and commemoration. Well, think again, because we did. The issue of May 29, 1995, carried an essay, “Selena Aside,” by Mexican-American writer Ana Castillo. The not-so-veiled dig at Kurt Cobain was perhaps gratuitous, but if the editor of The Almanac were to be honest with himself and readers, he would have to admit that the soundtrack to the film Selena was a standard in his CD wallet (ask your parents) long before he knew about Nirvana or had even considered that teen spirit might have a distinctive smell. Ad Policy

For an instant…the time it takes to witness a meteorite streak across the sky—if you’re lucky, if you have the presence of mind to look up at that instant—a talented and vibrant, ambitious and hard-working young performer enchanted her public and gave us the gifts of her many talents. But perhaps her greatest gift was the hope her example gave to thousands of young people who adored her and emulated her style. Unlike the male rock star who, having killed himself, gave his fans a taste of ultimate fatalism, Selena’s life, not death, offered joy to so many who admired her—from field workers to the urban unemployed, poor brown and countless others who elsewise may have given over to despair. Because of her example and because of the ground she broke, although exoticized, relegated to subculture status, perceived as foreign in the country of her birth yet sticking stubbornly to the language of her heart, I am certain that the void she has left will be filled with a new Selena. And we will welcome her. We need her. As all past great civilizations—Greek and Maya alike—adored their self-styled gods and goddesses, their nobility (gods and nobility often being one and the same), we will adore our new Selena, as much or even more than the one that just passed. We won’t, one hopes, dethrone the next one so quickly, so rudely, picking off and disposing of our heroes, our all-too-human deities, like lint off our coat sleeves. Next time, perhaps we won’t feel our craving for our very own homemade goddess’s immortality so urgently that we love her to death.

After defending such clients as Sacco and Vanzetti and Charles Ponzi (yes, that Ponzi), my paternal grandfather, a lawyer and Jewish Italophile, published in 1930 a slim book, Italy and Your Senses, which is not, as the title suggests, a poetic tribute to Italian art, topography or people but rather a valentine to Benito Mussolini, whom he considered the resurrection and the light. I mention this to show that while my grandfather’s infatuation with Mussolini was extreme, he was not alone. Italy’s fascist prime minister was one of the country’s great tourist attractions in the Roaring Twenties, for Mussolini was a charismatic showman–after all, he liked to pose, à la Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, without his shirt. No matter that his political philosophy was hollow at the core, as Frances Stonor Saunders points out in her superb new book, The Woman Who Shot Mussolini, or that between 1922 and 1943 Il Duce sent at least a million people to an early grave. He remained, for a very long time, the darling statesman of the conservative press and the fashionable fascists of Europe, although they conceded that he might be a bit hasty and brutal. Still and all, according to the British ambassador to Italy, Mussolini was ""like any other gentleman."" The King of England decorated him with the Order of the Bath, and Austen Chamberlain, the British foreign secretary (whose half brother was Neville, future prime minister and champion of the Munich accord), considered Mussolini a sincere, charming patriot, and certainly preferable to any other ""Italian."" Sure he was a dictator, the foreign secretary admitted, but one simply could not ""apply British standards to un-British conditions."" As Saunders acidly comments, Chamberlain’s remark ""contained all the narrowness and smugness of an imperial conceit."" Not so the epigraph in Saunders’s new book: ""There is such a thing as a moral atmosphere."" Those are the words of Violet Gibson, who happens to be the woman who shot Il Duce in 1926, although she only nicked his nose. Indeed, a moral atmosphere pervades Saunders’s often poignant tale of the Irishwoman, labeled mad, who possessed both gumption and a pistol, which she tried to use to change the course of history. Yet there is nothing tendentious about The Woman Who Shot Mussolini; rather, its wit and modesty, especially on the question of why Gibson did what she did, make the book a beguiling detective story and, as such, a meditation on the limits of biography. How much can we know about another person? In the fall of 1924, Violet Gibson arrived in Rome carrying a revolver. She intended, or so it seems, to kill the Pope–even though, born into a prominent Protestant household in 1876, Gibson had converted to Catholicism at 26. But she also deplored what she considered the pontiff’s Faustian pact with fascism, for Gibson’s Italy was the land of Fra Angelico, not of thugs dressed in black. And just the preceding spring Giacomo Matteotti, leader of the United Socialist Party, had been abducted, brutally beaten and then stabbed to death; his body was taken to the outskirts of Rome, sexually assaulted and then tossed into a ditch. The crime outraged Italians and much of the world; yet Mussolini suavely denied having anything to do with the assassination, although it was widely accepted that the murderers had acted on his behalf. Gibson took lodgings in the convent of Our Lady of Lourdes but spent most of her time visiting the Colosseum and Trastevere, on the west side of the Tiber, to help poor people, as she later told her Mother Superior. Trastevere was also known as a watering hole for Catholic dissidents, and it was later suspected that Gibson might have been trafficking in radical politics. A member of the Anglo-Irish elite who had been presented as a debutante at the court of Queen Victoria, Gibson was the daughter of Lord and Lady Ashbourne. Her father, the conservative lord chancellor of Ireland, had drafted the Land Purchase Act of 1885 so that Irish tenants could acquire land on favorable terms. It wasn’t exactly home rule. The lord chancellor’s son Willie, Violet’s eldest brother, would have none of it. A nationalist, a liberal and a Catholic, just unlike his father, Willie in turn influenced the young Violet in her conversion to a Christian socialism that owed much to George Tyrrell, an Irish Jesuit theologian, and Ernesto Buonaiuti, both of them modernists committed to social reform and compassion above and beyond papal autocracy. Yet a restless Violet Gibson fit the profile of the neurasthenic, that handy catch-all nervous disorder usually associated with unfulfilled women. (Virginia Woolf is a strong presence in Saunders’s book, although it’s a stretch to compare Woolf’s madness with Gibson’s.) In her youth, Gibson had briefly flirted with Christian Science, theosophy and the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Relatively affluent, she shuttled between London and Europe. During World War I she became a pacifist, though whatever political activism she may have undertaken was interrupted by a series of illnesses: Paget’s disease, a subsequent mastectomy, appendicitis and peritonitis. Then in 1915 Gibson met John O’Fallon Pope, an American Jesuit at Oxford who preached the need to demonstrate a love of Jesus through action, not words. That seems, in retrospect, to have set her on the royal road to Rome. Still, she was unwell, and after the sudden death of her brother Victor in 1922, Violet suffered what seems to have been her first breakdown. In 1923 she attacked her housekeeper’s daughter with a knife, though she insisted she had been acting on behalf of ""God and his Church."" Violet Gibson subsequently landed in Rome, where in the convent she tried to shoot herself in the heart. Never a good aim, the bullet lodged in her shoulder bone. ""I wanted to die for the glory of God,"" she confided to a friend, but having failed she needed to find another way to serve him. Saunders speculates that the signing of the Locarno Pact with France, Germany, Britain and Belgium later that year, with its refusal to stand against Italian fascism, may have prompted Gibson to set her sights on Mussolini instead of herself (again) or the Pope. Thus it was on what Saunders calls ""a normal Fascist morning,"" April 7, 1926, that the 50-year-old Violet Gibson, wearing a shiny old black dress, carried a revolver wrapped in a black veil to the Campidoglio, where she shot Benito Mussolini at point-blank range. Gibson said she did it to glorify God. ""A strange God, this,"" dryly comments Saunders, ""who tells Violet Gibson to shoot Mussolini and then instructs the bullet not to kill him."" God notwithstanding, did Gibson act alone? If not, who were her accomplices? The Italian police, after her suicide attempt, had confiscated the revolver she had brought from England. How had she contrived to find another? Was she, like Willie, involved in Irish revolutionary politics? How to explain the balance in her bank account, which exceeded the annual income she received from her father’s estate? Was she insane or feigning madness in order to avoid punishment? And, as Saunders puts it, can someone ""who pretends to be mad claim to be sane?"" The prime investigator of the Gibson case was chief superintendent Epifanio Pennetta, a methodical man without an overt political agenda but one on whom much was lost. Though he could not imagine that Gibson had no help, by assuming she acted lucidly he at least dignified her more than the British Foreign Office, which thought her nuts. Yet Pennetta was unquestionably handicapped by his inability to speak English; he could not communicate with Gibson or read her few papers and her notebook, should he have wanted to understand her state of mind, which apparently did not much concern him. Fortunately, Gibson’s inner life interests Saunders, who nonetheless refuses to reduce it to facile formulations and thus confronts the central biographical paradox so succinctly stated by Emily Dickinson: ""Biography first convinces us of the fleeing of the Biographied."" The more we pursue the lives of others, the more they slip away, private, mysterious, elusive. As Saunders acknowledges, ""We see, but we see across an impassable distance, another human being, passing from one room to another."" Plus, in the case of Violet Gibson, even the public record of her life is obscure. Before she cocked her pistol at the Campidoglio on that ""normal Fascist morning,"" she left no trail of canceled checks, newspaper articles, photographs, personal letters, diaries or discarded lovers, all the detritus out of which a life is recomposed. And after the shooting and subsequent investigation, she receded into history, a mere footnote, if that, in the annals of Italian fascism, where she is typically dismissed as a demented Irish spinster. Unruffled by the scant historical documentation, Saunders places unknowingness at the center of her book, and it’s a wise unknowingness comfortable with seeing through a glass darkly. ""By any definition,"" she notes, Violet must be considered mad, at least some of the time, but this does not mean that the whole of her life should be rewritten to fit this conclusion. She was attached to the idea of sacrifice and martyrdom, but this cannot be solely ascribed to religious mania. In the political world around her (to which she paid deep attention), this notion acquired elevated status in the passion narratives of Giacomo Matteotti, the priests George Tyrrell and Ernesto Buonaiuti, the Irish republicans who took part and died in the 1916 Easter Rising. In the summer of 1926, more certain of diagnosis than Saunders, the Italian psychiatrists questioning her reached their verdict: chronic paranoia. This helped the British Foreign Office strike a deal; Gibson would be certified insane so she could avoid a full trial. (The defense: no one in her right mind would want to kill Mussolini.) Her passport impounded, she would be delivered to the British authorities and, without her consent, confined in a madhouse for the rest of her life."

How do you beat a sitting vice president in a presidential nomination contest? There’s no established game plan, because no one’s ever done it. It’s the sort of history Bill Bradley is aiming to make by challenging Al Gore. As his campaign has received positive reviews–mostly because of his fundraising prowess–Bradley has been pressing his case with his personal tale: Small-town Missouri boy becomes basketball hero becomes cerebral senator. (Gore has “been in federal government all his life,” Bradley jeers.) Bradley’s policy thrusts have been few; he promises more come fall. He has twice tried to strike in bold fashion. In June he proposed an antigun package that included measures surpassing those discussed in Congress, such as registration of all handguns. In July he delivered an impassioned speech at the National Press Club decrying big money in politics. But boasting tougher positions than Gore on lobbyists, guns and money won’t be enough to wrest the Democratic Party from Gore. How’s he going to win over traditional Democratic voters–unionists, African-Americans, enviros, pro-choice advocates, Clinton loyalists? Ad Policy

There are few, if any, major Democratic constituencies where Bradley starts with an advantage. Among African-Americans–20 to 25 percent of the Democratic primary electorate–Gore is quite popular, according to polls. In a recent survey conducted by David Bositis, a senior analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, 69 percent of black respondents held a favorable impression of the Vice President; only 17 percent held an unfavorable one. Bradley registered favorably with 41 percent and unfavorably with 11 percent. “Bradley has no better record from the point of view of the black community than Gore does,” Bositis observes, “and due to his association with Bill Clinton, Gore is seen as having a better policy.” Bradley’s speeches declaring race the paramount issue in America do not resonate, Bositis says. “Bradley has done nothing except talk. And what is he best known for in his years in the Senate? The 1986 tax reform. I liked [Reagan Treasury Secretary turned Chief of Staff] Don Regan’s plan better than Bradley’s. Neither was populist, but Bradley’s made Regan’s plan worse from an income-distribution point of view.”

Sentiment in the Congressional Black Caucus is with Gore, according to caucus members’ aides. “I’ve talked to people within the caucus about Bradley’s race speech,” says one, “and no one thinks much of it.” Jesse Jackson, who has made no endorsement, is widely judged by Jackson-watchers to be leaning toward Gore.

Bradley is having difficulty vying with Gore for institutional labor support. During the years they overlapped in the Senate, Gore rated slightly higher on the AFL-CIO’s scorecard (88 to 84 percent). Both support free trade in a manner that irritates unions. “When Bradley was in the Senate, he was Mr. Free Trade, and the industrial unions hated him,” says a labor lawyer who witnessed clashes between Bradley and union officials. “There’s not enough of a difference between Gore and Bradley for labor leaders to turn against Gore. Many of them think they already have a relationship with Gore.”

In February Bradley spoke before leaders of the AFL-CIO. “He missed an opportunity,” says Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union. “He did not make a clear and convincing case for what he believed in, what he would do if he were President and how he could win.” In May Bradley addressed an SEIU gathering and left a better impression. He emphasized that he’d been a union rep when he played basketball, and he discussed issues important to labor. “He made our members realize there was going to be a competitive primary,” Stern notes. Yet Gore, according to Stern, talked more than Bradley about policy and issues of interest to the union members. “It’s enormously hard to imagine at the [union] leadership level a Bradley endorsement,” Stern adds. “The interesting question is whether Bradley will connect with union members. Will his proposals in the fall seem significantly different from Gore’s?”

The debate among union honchos has not been Gore versus Bradley but when to endorse Gore. Some ask why not now? Others–especially the industrial trade unions that dislike the Clinton/Gore trade policies–are not yet ready to swallow that hard. “Bill Bradley is not a factor here,” notes an AFL-CIO official. “I’ve heard no one express any deep interest in Bradley.” Gore has pocketed several labor endorsements. The Communications Workers of America and the International Association of Firefighters declared their support. So did the Iowa chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. (Gerald McEntee, the president of AFSCME, is a die-hard Clinton/Gore booster.) The United Automobile Workers chapter in Iowa also endorsed Gore, but the national headquarters revoked the endorsement. (Bradley backers cited this as a positive omen, but the UAW leaders acted from concern that their prerogative had been usurped.) Most of the opposition within the AFL-CIO to an early endorsement of Gore is tactical, with union leaders arguing that the federation should hold out for a bone or two from the Clinton/Gore Administration in return for their seal of approval. That hasn’t stopped Bradley aides from hailing the delay in the AFL-CIO endorsement as proof that Bradley’s on the move.

Mark Smith, the president of the Iowa AFL-CIO, maintains that there are progressive unionists yearning for an alternative to Gore: “But I don’t see Bradley providing that at this point.” Referring to the closing of a major Sara Lee plant in Iowa–a move that will toss 625 people out of work–Smith exclaims with disgust, “Neither of them are dealing with this question.”

Eric Hauser, Bradley’s press secretary, argues that Bradley can be competitive within the labor and African-American communities. Why? Bradley has spent “a lot of time” talking with the SEIU, Hauser says, and African-Americans realize that race is “an essential issue for Bradley.” But, he adds, “we’re not trying to segment voting blocs. We’re trying to run on a higher level.”

Bradley’s record on choice and the environment is so close to Gore’s that he has no special claim in appealing to Democrats on those terms. “This Administration has been so supportive of reproductive rights,” says Julie Burton, executive director of Voters for Choice, “that you will find most pro-choice leaders unwilling to go against the status quo. But should Bradley win the nomination, the pro-choice community would not be unhappy.” Environmental advocates recall that Bradley had a very green voting record in the Senate, but they are not likely to flock to him over Gore. “We understand who the Vice President is, and he understands who we are,” says a senior environmental lobbyist. “You’re not going to attack a sitting vice president who’s done more for you than any other vice president. There won’t be a fight in the environmental community over this.”

In this pre-pre-season of presidential politics, Bradley may be faring best among Democratic activists and players worried about Gore’s chances in a matchup with George W. Bush. “Gore looks like a loser, so I’m helping Bill Bradley,” explains a prominent Democratic fundraiser. “But the Democratic primary electorate is still very much for Gore. For now Bradley is getting support from outside that group.”

Will Bradley, in the end, rely on the electability argument (he has a better shot at Bush than Gore) and his I’m-a-fuller-person-than-Gore sales pitch? Or might he take a shot at stirring up Democratic voters on the basis of policy differences with Gore? “There is a huge void that Bill can fill,” says Senator Paul Wellstone, who has endorsed Bradley. “Right now, Bill’s doing a lot of connecting with people, getting support less on issues and more on people liking him. Post-Labor Day, the question will be, how strong will he come out on mobilizing issues? Guns and campaign reform are not enough. I expect to see him take strong stands on kids and education, urban policy, healthcare and the right to organize.”

To succeed, Bradley will have to do an end run around the leaders of the traditional Democratic constituencies and the party itself–blow past them the way Gary Hart surprised former Vice President Walter Mondale in the early phases of the 1984 Democratic primary. Given Gore’s anticipated strength in the South and the fact that one-fifth of the convention delegates will be so-called superdelegates–elected officials and party leaders presumably loyal to Gore–Bradley will need a lot of force (votes, that is) to overcome the institutional obstacles. Mondale, it should be noted, did recover sufficiently to beat back the Hart threat–and Mondale was an out-of-office, uncharismatic number two to a failed President less popular than Bill Clinton. To have a prayer, Bradley–a wonkish, less-than-dynamic Democrat of mixed ideologies–is going to have to become an insurgent candidate, in style or substance, of historic caliber."

Charles Guiteau was unhappy with the way the civil service treated him, so he shot President Garfield. Ad Policy

It is very seldom that an event of any kind is accepted by the public as a lesson or source of instruction on any definite point to the degree to which the attempt on Presi-dent Garfield’s life has been. Hardly any one who has spoken or written about it has confined himself to a simple expression of horror or sympathy. Nearly every one finds a moral in it, and the moral is that our system of appointment to office must be changed. We do not think we have taken up a newspaper during the last ten days which has not in some manner made the crime the product of ‘the spoils system.” There has hardly been an allusion to it in the pulpit which has not pointed to the spoils system as the fons et origo mali. In fact, the crime seems to have acted on public opinion very like a spark n a powder-magazine. It has fallen on a mass of popular indignation all ready to explode. It did not, we now plainly see, find the public ignorant or indifferent regarding the abuses of the civil service. The attempt on the President’s life has not been treated as proof that there is something grievously wrong with our mode of appointing to office, because it is nothing of the kind. A crazy fellow might conceive himself aggrieved by the working of the best conceivable mode of appointment to office, and proceed to avenge himself by assassination. He might, for instance, think himself unjustly dismissed for gross incom-petency or misconduct, or he might think that promotion had been withheld from him which he had fairly earned, or that in a competitive examination he had been unjustly marked. The act of a madman or a weak-minded man never proves anything except that the man is mad or weak-minded.

Guiteau’s offence has, therefore, not, been accepted as evidence of something which people doubted or did not know, but as a striking and dreadful illustration of the wroking of an evil of which they had known for a long time. The extraordinary unanimity of the expressions of opinion about the origin of the crime, and the wideness of the area over which they have been uttered, and the almost complete absence of any counter opinion, show very clearly how small and uninfluential that portion of the public which is inter-ested in the perpetuation of the spoils system really is. Nobody, so far as our observa-tion has gone, has come forward in its defence. No man or newspaper has ventured to deny the connection of Guiteau’s crime with the system. All the other inferences from it have been a good deal gainsaid; but nobody has risen up to maintain that as “it was the best civil service on this planet,” it was absurd to condemn it because a man who had unsuccessfully tried to enter it had sought to avenge himself by an attempt on the Presi-dent’s life. Nor has any one come forward and declared that, inasmuch as it is “as good as the civil service of any European country,” Guiteau’s crime no more suggested the need of alteration in it than in that of Great Britain or France. Nor do any of the philoso-phers who used to declare that the spoils system was a useful, original, and purely American system, peculiarly adapted to the needs of a democratic country, now pro-claim that it would be as silly to propose changing it because a disappointed office-seeker had tried to murder the President, as it would be to propose abolishing universal suffrage because there were occasional frauds at the elections. These various classes of defenders of the spoils system undoubtedly exist: we have heard from them fre-quently within the last five years through one channel or another; but they are now si-lent. Not one of them has lifted up his voice to protest against the gross perversion of the popular indignation which must to them certainly seem involved in the use now made of Guiteau’s crime by the civil-service reformers.

This shows two things: one is that they are conscious of their numerical weakness, and the other is that, though they love the spoils system as much as ever, they will never venture to defend it before an aroused and attentive public. Their speeches and articles on its behalf are all addressed to a public which they suppose to be apathetic or indif-ferent.

If we are right in assuming that Guiteau’s crime has satisfied the American people not that the civil service needs reforming — for that they knew already — but that something must now be done to reform it, the question, “what they are going to do about it,” is one that must by this time be suggesting itself to thousands. It is hardly possible that the ex-citement about the President’s condition will be allowed to die out without doing some-thing toward turning away the attention of the whole class to which Guiteau belongs — the class of shiftless, crackbrained adventurers — from the public service as a means of livelihood. It ought to be so organized and administered that the Guiteaus, when “down on their luck,” or “clean broke,” would no more think of a Government office as a last re-source than of the pastorate of an up-town church. But no such change will be effected in it — no change of any kind will be effected in it — if the people content themselves with dolorous denunciation. We must have action that will result in legislation. Those, then, who are most impressed by the bearing of the Washington tragedy on the question of civil-service reform should, now that their minds are beginning to be relieved of anxiety about the President’s condition, make action of some sort an expression of their thank-fulness for his recovery. To prepare for action they must ask themselves what they seek; and when they have found out, they ought to seek it with all their might.

Two bills were introduced into the last Congress dealing with the whole question of ap-pointments and removals from office and promotions in office, and with the assess-ments of officeholders. They were carefully drawn. No objection, so far as we know, has been made to their constitutionality or to their practicability. In fact, they have not been opposed by anybody in Congress, but they will never be passed as long as Congress-men do not believe that the public wants them passed. Probably ninety-nine hundredths of those who during the past six weeks have been inveighing against the spoils system have no knowledge whatever either of this or of any other attempt to abolish the spoils system, and have never sought, and are not now seeking, any information on the sub-ject. Had these rules been in force during the last year President Garfield would during the last four months have had all his time for the real duties of his office, as would the members of his Cabinet. The rows within the party about offices would never have oc-curred. There would have been no “Stalwarts” or “Half-Breeds,” and no Guiteau. There would have been no deadlock at Albany. There would have been no Platt and no Conk-ling such as we now see them. There would have been none of the scandal and dis-grace which the crime of July a has brought on popular government, The popular inter-est which has ever since the inauguration been mainly centred on a series of degrading personal quarrels would have been bestowed on the score of questions of the highest national interest which are now vainly awaiting solution.

The Fund for Mrs. Garfield

The profound sympathy universally felt for the President and his family makes any criti-cism of a movement to give that feeling a substantial expression seem at the first blush a little ungracious. Nevertheless, the suggestions as to the proposed fund for the benefit of Mrs. Garfield made in the letter, from a prominent member of the Chamber of Com-merce, published in the Evening Post last Saturday, contain food for reflection on the part of the gentlemen engaged in promoting the subscription. As the writer says:

“Every man of generous feeling has had his emotions gratefully quickened by the movement started in the Chamber to raise a liberal fund to be given to the wife and chil-dren of the President of the United States under the impending danger which threatens them, and no one wishes to say a word that may tend to repress so benevolent a pur-pose.”

But the movement, which appeared a natural and spontaneous outburst as long as the chances seemed to be that the President would die, begins to wear a somewhat differ-ent aspect now that his recovery has become probable. The correspondent suggests an objection to the proposed fund, derived from the constitutional prohibition of any in-crease of the President’s salary during the period for which he was elected, and the de-nial to him of all right to receive “any other emolument from the United States or any of them.” He points out that it was the intention of these clauses to secure the President from all sinister exterior influence (and, we may add, from the suspicion of any such in-fluence), and asks whether we may not, under the effect of the generous impulse in-spired by the calamity, and by the suffering of the President and his family, be in danger of violating at least the spirit of this law. He suggests that a private agreement ought to have been made between the donors of the money that, in case of a fatal termination, the proposed sum should be given to the family of the President, and that this intention might have been communicated to him “without giving names that could embarrass him in the future, or impair his official or personal independence.” But even this, he thinks, “might give the President serious trouble hereafter, and prove a curse rather than a blessing.”

It is, in fact, clear that the President’s recovery will make his relation to the fund a very peculiar and delicate one, and on many accounts it is for his interest and that of the pub-lic that this should be frankly discussed by the press in advance. In the event of the President’s death the whole matter would become one exclusively of taste and senti-ment. If Congress should neglect to make a suitable provision for the President’s widow, there can he no doubt that a call for a popular subscription would he heartily responded to; and even if it should not neglect to do this, the question of making her a substantial gift, which, in our opinion, could not be too large, would he one entirely between the do-nors and herself. No public interests of any kind would be affected. The differences be-tween this and the case of the President’s recovery have seemed so obvious to one or two of the subscribers that they have made their subscriptions conditional upon his death. In case of his recovery it will, of course, be very difficult to distinguish between a gilt to the President and a gift to the President’s wife. The plan of putting the money in trust does not remove this difficulty. A substantial addition to the resources of the one is practically a substantial addition to the resources of the other.

The change in its form from a private to a national subscription can have little or no ef-fect upon this. It necessarily remains, as it originated, a fund set on foot by a number of well-known capitalists. That these gentlemen are simply animated by a generous sym-pathy does not alter this fact it is just this association that renders it the duty of the President’s friends to point out the inferences that will be drawn from it hereafter. Among the subscribers are men interested in the promotion by legislation at Washington of pri-vate enterprises of all sorts. This legislation must come before the President for ap-proval or disapproval, and it is of the utmost importance not merely that he should be subject to no private bias in favor of the promoters of such enterprises, but that he should not he open to any suspicion of such bias. The general sympathy with him in his present critical condition should not blind us to the fact that his acts will hereafter be criticised with all the fierceness and ingenuity that party spirit can supply, and that the acceptance of money by his wife at the hands of men who are knocking every year at the doors of Congress for favors will be a handle for his enemies which they will not ne-glect to use. Human nature being what it is, no matter how high the reputation of a President for integrity may he, it is impossible to prove to the satisfaction of one who doubts it that his signature or veto of a bill is unaffected by the recollection of a pecuni-ary benefit derived from its promoters and it is this impossibility which made all the Presidents who had occupied the White House down to General Grant’s time so sensi-tive on the subject of gifts. It is safe to say that the admirers and well-wishers of the President will do well to proceed very cautiously in the matter. While they can afford to disregard all criticism of their own motives in starting the subscription, they certainly cannot afford to disregard the criticisms to which the scheme, if carried out, is sure to subject the President. If he recovers, the necessity and duty of making a pecuniary pro-vision for his family will not seem so obvious as it did when he appeared to be lying at the point of death, and the objections to such a provision by means of a fund such as is now proposed will seem every day more clear and distinct. It would be a very serious embarrassment to him."

Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Ad Policy

Hundreds stood in silence at the steps of the county courthouse while Christian Carter, a recent high-school graduate and organizer of his school’s walkout for gun violence, read from a poem by Antwon Rose, the 17-year-old black teenager who earlier that week was shot in the back by police as he ran away from them, unarmed. This story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words. For more Student Nation, check out our archive.

“I am confused and afraid / I wonder what path I will take / I hear that there’s only two ways out / I see mothers bury their sons / I want my mom to never feel that pain,” he read, and the crowd let out a collective groan. “I am confused and afraid.”

Shortly after responding to a shooting the night of June 19, East Pittsburgh police spotted a car they say resembled one seen leaving the scene with bullet holes in its rear windows. When police pulled the car over to conduct a traffic stop, Antwon and another young man ran from the car. An East Pittsburgh police officer shot Antwon three times in the back as he ran away unarmed, as a harrowing video taken by a witness showed. The officer responsible for the shooting, recently identified as Officer Michael Rosfeld, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Police later determined the car carrying Antwon prior to his death was a jitney, or informal cab, and had no involvement in the prior shooting.

The rally’s organizers—which, among several, included Youth Power Collective, a group launched by the organizers of Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts high school’s walkouts to protest gun violence—called for an open investigation into the circumstances that led to Antwon’s death. The speakers made frequent reference to the history of gun violence and police violence in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

Summer Lee, Democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, reminded the crowd that five other students in the Woodland Hills School District have lost their lives to gun violence since September 2017. Attorney Joel Sansone, who in 2014 represented 18-year-old Jordan Miles after three undercover police officers wrongfully arrested him as he walked to his grandmother’s house, beating him until his face was swollen and bruised, reminded those who had gathered about the long-running epidemic of police violence in the city.

“It was almost 20 years ago that I stood by the coffin of a 12-year-old black boy named Michael Ellerbe. Not far from here, they shot that boy in the back. He was unarmed. All he had in his pocket was a piece of candy,” he said. “I’ve been in this struggle for 35 years. There was no crowd for Michael Ellerbe. There was no crowd for Jordan Miles. You people are here because you know what’s happening,… I’ve been waiting 35 years for you people,” Sansone told the crowd. “Where have you been?” Current Issue View our current issue

The night before, hundreds of protesters had shut down Braddock Avenue, the street in front of the police station in Pittsburgh East, where Rose had been shot. By 7 pm, all traffic on the street had stopped. Confused motorists exited their cars to observe the growing numbers accumulating at the intersection, where the protesters made speeches and led chants. They stayed long into the evening, even after the rain began to pour. “Minorities, and not just black people, but minorities feel like the police are the biggest terrorist group in the nation,” Taylor Williams, 23, told The Nation. “It feels like we back in the 1800s, and we modern day slaves.”

A volunteer trauma response team led by Rev. Paul Abernathy in partnership with the Allegheny County Health Department provided “psychological first aid,” to the members of the impromptu protest. “In the aftermath of gun violence, our communities are held hostage to their own fears, the uncertainty, certainly the wounds that run very deep,” he said. “[It’s] not just one incident, but another chapter in a very long, sad story”

At the rally the following afternoon, where Rose’s poem was read, activists called on Pittsburghers to vote District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. out of office. “This is a referendum on District Attorney Stephen Zappala,” Jasiri X of 1Hood Media told the crowd, calling him to account for failing to bring charges against police officers accused of using excessive force in the past, and charging the unarmed black survivors of police violence instead.

In 2012, Zappala declined to press charges against three police officers accused of brutally beating Jordan Miles in 2010, while Miles’s charges, later dismissed by a judge, included resisting arrest and aggravated assault.

Similarly, Zappala did not charge the police officers responsible for shooting and paralyzing unarmed black man Leon Ford during a 2012 traffic stop, but did charge Ford with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, escape, and resisting arrest. Ford was acquitted of the aggravated assault charges, and Zappala ultimately dropped the others.

The organizers also called for a county-wide civilian police oversight board, citing the vast bureaucratic complications and loopholes that come with the county’s 130 self-governing municipalities.

The demographics of registered voters have impacted the legal system, activists pointed out. “I had a jury of all white people,” said Leon Ford, who addressed the crowd in an emotional speech. “A jury pool of over 100 people and zero African Americans. Some people told me it was a conspiracy. When I asked them if they were registered to vote, they said no. So how you gonna be on my jury pool if you ain’t registered to vote?”

The mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh’s Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, had stood in the rain at the protest the night before. “I knew the young man. He actually appeared in my campaign commercial. He volunteered at my wife’s store, the Free Store in Braddock,” he said. “The folks here are understandably angry and upset, and they’re taking it to the street. And I think only good can come from that.”

Fetterman’s campaign ad features Antwon alongside a young man Fetterman said he considers a “fourth son.” Now, he said, the image of him and Antwon side by side is a testimony to “the tragedy of their divergent paths.”

“[That young man] is heading to George Washington University this fall on a full scholarship,” he said. “And we’re out here grieving [Antwon’s] death.”"

Magdiel Sanchez, a 35-year-old Latino man, was sitting on his porch in Oklahoma City on Tuesday night as two law-enforcement officers approached his house. He got up and walked toward them, when, according to news reports and a statement, the officers noticed he was holding a metal pipe. They started giving him “verbal commands” to lie down, then one fired his Taser and the other shot him in the chest with his sidearm. Sanchez died. Officers later claimed not to have heard neighbors shouting that Sanchez was deaf and couldn’t hear their commands. Ad Policy

The police were there because allegedly Sanchez’s father had been in a hit-and-run (injuring property, not people, if the accusations are true). Sanchez carried the pipe, neighbors said, to ward off dogs. He was deaf and reportedly developmentally disabled. In a statement, the ACLU said, “Magdiel Sanchez was shot at his own home, without having committed any crime, and in front of neighbors who knew he was deaf trying to communicate to the police that what they were about to do was wrong.”

Sanchez is far from the first deaf or disabled person to be killed or brutalized by police. It happens almost every day. According to The Washington Post, police have shot 165 people in mental-health crisis in the first 263 days this year (and 715 total). When you add people like Sanchez and individuals with invisible, undiagnosed, or unrevealed disabilities, the numbers start to get much higher. In a white paper I co-wrote in 2016 for the Ruderman Family Foundation, I noted that disability-rights advocates routinely argue that a third to a half of all people killed by police are disabled. Most of those people, especially in cases where police clearly misused lethal force, turn out to also be marginalized by race, class, gender orientation, or other factors that intensify vulnerability.

Sanchez is actually the second high-profile killing of a disabled person just this week (and the fourth probable case, with Eric Alvarez, possibly in mental-health crisis, killed on a Los Angeles highway, and naval officer Nicholas Perkins killed outside his home in Washington after he would not put down a long gun). Georgia Tech campus police killed Scout Schultz, a trans and intersex activist who had been expressing suicidal thoughts. They had called 911 to report themselves as a person with a knife and possibly a gun. After police shot and killed Schultz, the officers found only a closed Leatherman multi-tool. The specifics of each case matter. Each victim’s life deserves to be mourned. Most cases are more like the Perkins situation than the Sanchez one. Still, when it comes to body count, this was a pretty typical week. Related Article Disability-Rights Activists Are the Real Heroes of the Health-Care Fight John Nichols

I first wrote about disability and policing for The Nation in 2013. I’m not sure anything has improved since then. The people who have been working on this the longest, people like the lawyer Talila Lewis and the organization HEARD and artist and activist Leroy Moore, remain unfunded, even as organizations pour money into trainings for cops. But police don’t need training to choose not to shoot folks like Sanchez. They just have to stop treating noncompliance as a justification for escalation.

Another story of police force and disability, thankfully not involving a fatality, made news this week. The abuse of Connor Leibel, a white, autistic teenager, perfectly demonstrates the ways that escalation in the face of noncompliance puts disabled people in danger every time they encounter the cops. In fact, what I call the cult of compliance puts everyone in danger, if not equally.

Leibel was walking down the sidewalk in an affluent part of Buckeye, Arizona. He first appears on the body cam video as he’s shaking a string in a mild rhythmic motion with his left hand. Officer David Grossman of the Buckeye police department, steps out of the car and approaches the boy, asking him what he’s doing. “I’m stimming,” he says. “I stim with a string.” Within a few minutes, Grossman has Leibel down on the ground, cuffed. “I’m OK, I’m OK,” the boy says to himself, but eventually starts to scream. Later, other officers would arrive, find Leibel’s caregiver nearby, and restore order. Leibel suffered bruises and abrasions. Grossman, reportedly a DUI recognition expert, has claimed in his report that he thought the boy was on drugs. Buckeye Police did not respond to requests for comment. Current Issue View our current issue

I took this video particularly personally. My son, a 10-year-old with Down syndrome, also likes to shake things as he stims. His hands are often wrapped around plastic “Mardi Gras” beads, shaking in a kind of circular motion. It’s mesmerizing to watch. He has a pattern that moves the beads from a spin to a drop straight down and then into a slight circle. It’s not typical behavior, but it’s quintessential to my son’s identity. It should not be criminalized.

I reached out to Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. Via e-mail, she told me that stimming is normal. “If you’ve ever tapped your fingers against a counter while you were waiting, congratulations, you’ve stimmed. Autistic people tend to stim more often and more intensely. Stimming helps us process the sensory input we’re gathering, stay calm and grounded in an overwhelming universe, and express joy, distress, or whatever we might be feeling.”

Bascom notes that stimming is often treated as aberrant or undesirable behavior by authority figures—not just police, but also teachers and parents. “That said, and this is important,” she continued, this case is not about lack of awareness regarding autism. “Regardless of why he was stimming, this young man should never have been approached at all. ‘Bouncing around’ isn’t a crime. Being autistic in public isn’t a crime. There was absolutely no justification for this young man to be stopped, and obviously no reason for him to have been restrained or slammed to the ground.”

Alex S. Vitale, author of The End of Policing, agrees. He told me that, beyond the issues of disability and policing, “This all starts as a self-directed search for drugs. And since drugs are conceived of [as] automatically dangerous and illegal, the police approach people as dangerous and a threat to be controlled. As soon as the young person said, ‘I’m fine,’ that should have been the end of it.” Both he and Bascom, as well as numerous other experts I consulted from the disability-rights and police-reform movements emphasized that this is not a matter of lacking training, but rather the criminalization of any behavior deemed abnormal or undesirable.

Back to Sanchez, we see similar patterns of police conduct, this time with horrible, lethal, consequences. Sara Nović‏, who identifies as Deaf and is an assistant professor of creative writing at Stockton University, told me via e-mail that the killing emerged from a “perfect storm of communication anxiety for many d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing people.” It’s hard to talk to strangers, especially when the stakes are high. It was also dark. She notes, “Even the most skilled deaf communicators/lipreaders struggle in the dark. It is only natural that Sanchez would try to get closer so he could see what was going on, especially because he’d had no involvement in the traffic incident they were investigating. He was sitting on his porch minding his own business; he’d done nothing wrong.” But he didn’t—couldn’t—comply with orders, so a police officer killed him.

So what do we do? When incidents like these happen, departments and some advocates often focus on two deeply troubling solutions: training and registries. Both are based on the idea that police just don’t recognize disability when they see it, or don’t know what to do if they recognize it. Instead, we need to reframe policing, decriminalize noncompliance, and remove police from as many situations as possible.

In abstract, training is a fine thing. Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training was developed in the 1980s in Memphis and has now spread around the country. I’ve sat through many hours of CIT training in states such as Texas, Maryland, and Illinois. The quality of instruction varies, but the curriculum is constant: Hours spent describing disabilities, what it’s like to be disabled, and then some (actually pretty good) role-playing exercises. Many states have implemented developmental-disability specific training, including (as noted in The New York Times), autism programs. It’s good for police to know what a mental-health crisis is, that autistic people might not look you in the eye, and how to find resources.

At the same time, trainings send the message that the problem is behavior in cases related to disability, rather than core issues related to quick escalation. If a person with autism shouldn’t be brutalized for shaking a string, neither should a drug user. If a deaf person shouldn’t be shot for not hearing commands, neither should a person wearing ear buds. These trainings are also not free, and every dollar spent on policing could be spent elsewhere. A year ago, the Department of Health and Human Services gave Chicago a million dollars to address trauma in the communities. The city spent most of it on police training, not on the communities.

The second suggestion, registries of disabled people, is even more concerning. There have long been advocates for making lists of disabled people to give police more information, but people should not have to hand their names to the police to be guaranteed basic civil rights. Most recently, an app called Vitals has been making news. It allows police to read personal data off an chip that one can wear. “It’s the Mutant Registration Act,” said Rebecca Cokley, former executive director of the National Council on Disability, referring to a bill from the comic series X-Men that required individuals with super powers to lodge their identities with the government.

Instead of training police to grant people they recognize as disabled specific rights, victims like Leibel and Sanchez demonstrate the need for police to operate with a baseline of presumption of compliance. When significant threats emerge, as does tragically happen, officers will need to respond. But when Sanchez walked forward, surely the officers could have stepped back. When the autistic boy was shaking his string, the officer could have just decided not to cuff a child, even if he didn’t recognize the word “stimming.” There are so many ways to improve the situation without asking for specialized training.

At least four disabled people died at the hands of police this week. One previous case of unjustified police violence came to light. Except for the brief media attention of the Sanchez and Leibel cases, that’s a pretty normal week. It’s unlikely anyone will be held accountable, except possibly in the situation where Leibel, a white teenager in an affluent neighborhood, was brutalized. There, the combination of powerful video, a compelling victim, widespread coverage, and a good lawyer might help. In the other cases, the multiply marginalized status of the victims plus the lethality of the encounter will make accountability difficult, if not impossible. And then next week, alas, the same types of stories will play out again, and more people will die."

Kill the Messenger, a movie starring Jeremy Renner, just opened, about the life and death of Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Gary Webb, who committed suicide in 2004. Webb came late to the Iran/Contra scandal, long after most of the mainstream media had moved on. In 1996, he wrote a three-part series for the San Jose Mercury News, “Dark Alliance,” that exposed the distribution network, which included the Nicaraguan Contras, responsible for supplying the cocaine that helped kick off South Central Los Angeles’s crack epidemic. Ad Policy

The allegations were not new. Earlier, in the 1980s, Robert Parry and Brian Barger reported on the story for AP, which was picked up by then freshman Senator John Kerry, who in 1988 released an extensively documented committee report showing the ways the Contras, backed by Ronald Reagan’s White House, were turning Central America into a transshipment point for Colombian cocaine, using the drug revenue to fund their war on the Sandinistas. Webb’s report specifically looked at what happened to cocaine once it entered the United States.

Rather than follow up on Webb’s findings—and on Kerry’s and Parry’s earlier investigation—The New York Times, The Washington Post and, especially, the Los Angeles Times went after Webb, destroying his reputation and driving him out of the profession and into a suicidal depression.

I haven’t seen Kill the Messenger yet, but there’s no doubt that it sides with Webb. That seems to have unsettled David Carr, the media critic for The New York Times. Last week, in an anguished, deeply ambivalent assessment of Webb’s legacy, Carr admitted that the thrust of what Webb wrote about “really happened,” making passing reference to Kerry’s “little-noticed 1988 Senate subcommittee report.” Carr tentatively suggests that perhaps journalists should have better spent their energy reporting the larger story, rather than relentlessly fact-checking Webb. At the same time, though, he presented the campaign that ultimately drove Webb to his death as a “he-said-she-said-who-can-ultimately-say?” matter of interpretation, given ample space to Webb’s tormentors, like Tim Golden, who wielded the hatchet for The New York Times, and the odious Jerry Ceppos, the executive editor of the San Jose Mercury News who, faced with unrelenting pressure from the big boys in NY, LA and Washington, betrayed Webb.

Such is the state of media criticism that Carr could make notice of Kerry’s “little-noticed” Senate report without pointing out the obvious: it was “little-noticed” because newspapers, like his, little noticed it. Alexander Cockburn, Carr isn’t. Maybe he was trying for understated irony. As many of Webb’s defenders have noted, if journalists had put half the passion into following up the implications of that report that they put to discrediting Webb, we’d know a lot more about the darkest side of America’s national security state. Peter Kornbluh: “If the major media had devoted the same energy and ink to investigating the contra drug scandal in the 1980s as they did attacking the Mercury News in 1996, Gary Webb might never have had his scoop.”

Carr’s worst offense against Webb—other than not mentioning that Webb had won a Pulitzer Prize, for his work with a team of reporters investigation the 1989 San Francisco earthquake—is that he blames Webb himself for his downfall: “Mr. Webb was open to attack in part because of the lurid presentation of the story and his willingness to draw causality based on very thin sourcing and evidence. He wrote past what he knew.”

No. Webb was open to attack because the Los Angeles Times alone assigned seventeen reporters to leverage the inherent mysteries of the national security state to cast doubt on Webb. As Nick Schou, author of the book, Kill the Messenger, on which the movie is based, writes, “Much of the [Los Angeles] Times’ attack was clever misdirection, but it ruined Webb’s reputation: In particular, the L.A. Times attacked a claim that Webb never made: that the CIA had intentionally addicted African-Americans to crack.”

Webb won’t be vindicated by the movie Kill the Messenger because he has already been vindicated by serious nonfiction reporters, like Schou and others. And by history itself. Webb was documenting one aspect of the blowback that we all have been living with from Iran/Contra, which is really just shorthand for Reagan’s broader set of Central American policies. Central America was the place the national security state got its groove back after Vietnam, and the repercussions are ongoing: among them, the rise of Salvadoran and Honduran transnational gangs, the drug war, which has turned the Colombian-Central American-Mexican corridor into a war zone, the 2009 Honduran coup, and this summer’s exodus of Central American child refugees.

Did Webb write “past what he knew”? Of course he did. He was writing about the covert activities of the rogue National Security Council and CIA and their shadowy relations with drug runners! As John Kerry complained in 1998, after being allowed to read a classified CIA investigation, launched as a result of Webb’s reporting: “Some of us in Congress at the time, in 1985, 1986, were calling for a serious investigation of the charges, and C.I.A. officials did not join in that effort…. There was a significant amount of stonewalling. I’m afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld.” “Scant proof,” sniffed Golden, in his New York Times take-down of Webb.

Webb provides a fascinating account of his “hours-long conversations with editors that bordered on the surreal” in an essay titled “The Mighty Wurlitzer Plays On,” in which they relentlessly presented him with unprovable hypotheticals: “’How do we know for sure that these drug dealers were the first big ring to start selling crack in South Central?’ editor Jonathan Krim pressed me during one such confab…. ‘Isn’t it possible there might have been someone else and they never got caught and no one ever knew about them? In that case, your story would be wrong.’ I had to take a deep breath to keep from shouting. ‘If you’re asking me whether I accounted for people who might never have existed, the answer is no,’ I said.”

Schou writes that because “Webb shot himself in the head twice—the first bullet simply went through his cheek—many falsely believe the CIA killed him.” Webb was apparently depressed that he couldn’t get a job that paid enough to let him keep his house.

But staring too long into the abyss that is Iran/Contra is bad for one’s mental health. The artist Mark Lombardi drew constellation-like renderings of the paramilitary and para-financial scandals, scandals that have increased in frequency with the spread of neoliberalism. These include Iran/Contra, BCCI and Harken Energy, Savings and Loan, many of them involving the Bush family. Lombardi too killed himself, in 2000.

It is easy to fall down the rabbit hole, or into a James Ellroy novel, trying to draw the connections. Iran/Contra is like the Da Vinci Code of the national security state, and reading any one paragraph of the Kerry Committee Report can send minds reeling:

In a June 26, 1987 closed session of the Subcommittee, Milian Rodriguez testified that in a meeting arranged by Miami private detective Raoul Diaz with Felix Rodriguez, he (Milian) offered to provide drug money to the Contras. Milian Rodriguez stated that Felix accepted the offer and $10 million in such assistance was subsequently provided the Contras through a system of secret couriers.

Félix Rodríguez is, of course, the Cuban exile CIA agent who hunted down Che Guevara in Bolivia. The relationship of narcotics and covert ops goes back at least to the Opium Wars of the nineteenth century, but a key moment in the Cold War history of that relationship took place with the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which broadcast the Cuban drug mafia throughout all of the Americas, allying their interests with anti-Castro counterrevolutionaries and CIA spooks. That alliance mutated and metastasized, infecting different places at different times, including Colombia, Bolivia, Panama, Honduras and South Central Los Angeles.

Inevitably, the reporting of Webb and the art of Lombardi raise the specter of conspiracy. But conspiracy theorists, in their worst, most compulsive form, are obsessed with proving the detail, establishing the single link, after which everything will make sense. Webb and Lombardi, in contrast, stepped back to see the bigger picture and consider the moral meaning of the connections they were making."

Last week, Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the US State Department, was asked if she had comment on “Israeli soldiers at checkpoints targeting Palestinian soccer players.” She said, “I haven’t seen that. Obviously, we spoke to our concerns [about checkpoint violence] again, in the same Human Rights Report about certain actions and behavior…. I will check that out.” Ad Policy

“Checking out” what is happening to Palestinian soccer players would be well advised, and not only for Ms. Psaki. Last week, I received what could best be described as an overwhelmingly hostile response to my article on a recent shooting by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) of two youth soccer players, and how this could affect the extremely perilous position Israel finds itself in the international soccer federation, FIFA. My piece went through the Palestinian Football Association’s very underreported push to get Israel removed from FIFA. Their appeal has been gaining support and will be raised formally at FIFA’s meeting in Brazil. The second part of my article centered around the aforementioned recent shooting of two young soccer players in their feet outside of an IDF checkpoint. The IDF claimed that the two young men had a bomb, something that they deny. My article aimed to show that this incident, alongside the jailing, injuring and killing of prominent members of the Palestinian national soccer team would have the effect of adding fuel to the movement to have Israel removed from FIFA.

I expected to get the typical barrage of hate mail from the usual suspects: the darkest corners of the Internet that believe on principle that Palestinian life is cheap if not entirely without value. At most, these e-mails are as nettlesome as spam.

The part of the response that was truly jarring however was the numerous private queries I received from prominent members of the media. I am choosing to keep their identities private because their correspondence to me was private and I will respect that. The queries contained no curiosity about Israel’s possible expulsion from FIFA. They all instead openly doubted that the shooting of the two young men had even taken place. Was I sure this really happened? When I pointed to my initial sources, the response by numerous people was, “Do you have any sources that are not Palestinian?” One person, writing for a major sports website, sent me numerous queries that I did not respond to, and then when the facts of the shooting appeared in the Israeli paper Haaretz, said to me, “Forget previous queries. I see news of the shooting on Haaretz. Never mind.” The assumption of mendacity affixed to Palestinian sources spoke volumes.

The other part of my story that people accused of being untrue was my theory that members of the Palestinian soccer community are being targeted for violence by the Israeli state. This was described to me as “laughable,” “ridiculous,” and one even said that they would reach out to The Nation directly to agitate for dismissal.

Yes it is certainly true that I don’t have a document signed by Benjamin Netanyahu calling for a systematic attack on the Palestinian national team. What I do have are names: real people, with real families, whose lives and deaths are testament to a story that needs to be told.

There was Ayman Alkurd. He was a 34-year-old member of the Palestinian national soccer team. Alkurd was killed during the 2009 Operation Cast Lead when a missile was sent into his home in Gaza. There was Wajeh Moshtahe, another national team member. He was killed in his home during Operation Cast Lead as well. He was only 24. There was Shadi Sbakhe, another national team member who suffered the same fate. All three, in fact, died within seventy-two hours of one another. They reminded many, at the time of their deaths, of Tariq Al Quto, described by the BBC as “a talented midfielder,” who was killed by the IDF in 2004.

Then there are the imprisoned. We can start with Omar Abu Rios, the former starting goalkeeper for the national team. He was arrested at age 23 for allegedly being part of an attack on Israeli troops at the Amari Palestinian refugee camp near Ramallah. He was, according to Chairman of the Palestinian Football Association Jibril al-Rajoub, “arrested at work and taken to an unknown location.” Rajoub appealed directly to FIFA chief Sepp Blatter on Rios’s behalf, saying that his arrest “was in total disregard of all agreements signed by the Israeli side and in direct violation to the simplest right of our players.”

There was also Muhammad Nimr, a top 23-year-old striker and national team member, who had his house destroyed by the IDF and was then jailed without charges being filed. Nimr’s story echoed that of another striker, Zakaria Issa, who had been jailed for sixteen years before being released in 2013 when he was struck with terminal cancer.

Then there was Mahmoud Sarsak. Sarsak was a defender on the national team who was arrested and jailed without charges while trying to cross a checkpoint in order to join his teammates. His plight became an international cause when the Palestinian national team member went on a three-month hunger strike while being held in an Israeli prison. He was released in July 2012. As he said at a meeting in England upon his release, “Israel actively attempts to stop sportsmen and women competing, and there are a large number of athletes in prison…. Since 2008 we have seen Israel detain a number of sportsmen who were arrested under the administrative detention laws—meaning no charges need be brought. They never have to go to trial.”

This is reality for the Palestinian national team: four dead by Israeli munitions and—at least—three jailed in Israeli prisons without trial over the last decade. I have no idea whether people will see this as constituting a “targeting” of the Palestinian soccer players. I do believe that it is our job as sports journalists to ask the questions. There can be no doubt that we would press for more information if those killed and jailed were members of the Spanish national team, the German national team, the Brazilian national team or, heaven forfend, the US national team. Israel’s future in FIFA should depend on its answering these questions, but they only get answered if they are asked.

Yes, it is understandable why looking to FIFA for any kind of moral guidance is laughable. The locations of the next two World Cups, Russia and Qatar, contain enough human rights violations to keep Amnesty International busy until the next century. But attacks on athletes themselves need to be, pardon the expression, a red line for all international sporting bodies: a red line no country should be allowed to cross."

Newly-minted New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is engaged in a political and ideological charm offensive — moving left from the centrist (and in some cases Republican-lite) position she occupied as a member of the House.

Gillbrand, who was a National Rifle Association ally during her term as a representative from upstate New York, is now saying she will work with New York Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, a potential 2010 Democratic primary foe, to pass gun-control legislation.

And, under pressure from Latino legislators, the senator who was appointed last week by New York Governor David Paterson to fill Hillary Clinton’s vacant seat has begun to moderate anti-immigrants stances that led the newspaper El Diario to editorialize: “If Gov. David Paterson wanted to deliver a slap to immigrant New Yorkers, he effectively did so with his appointment yesterday of Representative Kirsten Gillibrand.”

It seems that Gillibrand, concerned about the threat of a Democratic primary challenge and the potential loss of progressive support in a fall race, is showing some willingness to move away from her Blue Dog Democrats stances.

Labor unions, which will be key to Gillibrand’s success or failure, should seek some clear commitments now on trade policy.

As a member of the House, Gillibrand voted with the Bush administration for trade legislation and amendments that were harmful to workers, farmers, the environment and communities in the U.S. and countries with which it trades.

For instance, in 2007, in one of her first trade votes as a member of the House, Gillibrand backed the Peru free trade agreement that was ardently backed by the Bush White House. She did so despite the fact that her more responsible Democratic colleagues — including upstate New York members such as Maurice Hinchey and Louise Slaughter — argued and voted against it.

Speaking of free trade agreements along the lines promoted by the Clinton and Bush administrations, Hinchey has said, “Because they hold our trading partners to much lower standards than are required in the United States, FTAs cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs and erode the bargaining power of our workers.”

Of the Peru agreement, in particular, Oregon Congressman David Wu said, “I regret that I cannot vote for this bill tonight because it does not put human rights on an equal footing with environmental and labor protections.”

In urging a “no” vote on the Peru plan, Michigan Congressman Dale Kildee said, “I appeal especially to my fellow Democrats not to turn their backs on those American workers who suffer from the export of their jobs. They want a paycheck, not an unemployment check.”

Gillibrand rejected that appeal as a member of the House.

She needs to be pressed, now, to make a clear commitment to oppose trade deals that disregard human rights, worker rights and the best interests of communities in the U.S. and abroad. And the labor unions that the new senator will soon be asking for endorsements ought not tender them until they are certain Senator Gillibrand will cast more responsible trade vote than did Congresswoman Gillibrand."

The mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando raised a pressing question—why are civilians so easily able to purchase military-style weapons capable of immense destruction? The public is rightly horrified at the killing power Mateen wielded. At one point he fired 24 shots in nine seconds, and took 49 lives in a remarkably short period of time. Some survivors had calves and forearms blown off entirely by Mateen’s assault rifle. Polls show support for an assault weapon ban ticked up 13 percent after the shooting, with a majority of Americans (57 percent) now supporting one. Ad Policy

Hillary Clinton is speaking to this issue—on Monday, she once again called for the reinstitution of a federal ban on the sale of assault weapons, telling CBS This Morning, “We’ve got to keep weapons of war off our streets.”

In Washington, however, Clinton is standing nearly alone. There will be no imminent movement on assault weapons in Congress, and none of the major gun control groups that have been ascendant since Newtown even have a position on an assault weapons ban.

Senate Democrats did score a rare victory in the gun control fight late Wednesday, after Republicans in the chamber agreed to a vote on two pieces of gun-control legislation following a 14-hour filibuster launched by Senator Chris Murphy. Though the situation is still fluid, as of Thursday morning Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is prepared to allow votes on two bills: one that would deny gun sales to people who are or have been on the terror watch list, and another that would expand federal background checks for gun purchases to online sales and gun shows.

The prospects of the latter bill passing are almost nil (similar legislation couldn’t even clear 60 votes right after Newtown, when Democrats held the chamber), and then it’s not clear the bill targeting suspected terrorists will pass either. This might please civil libertarians, who have well-founded concerns about that legislation.

If Democrats also wanted to push on assault weapons, there are bills at the ready. Representative David Cicilline filed a bill in January, co-sponsored by 125 of his colleagues, that would institute an assault weapons ban. Democratic leadership in the House won’t press for a vote, however. Minority whip Steny Hoyer told The Hill that while a ban on assault weapons was the “surest” way to have prevented what happened in Orlando, “We also know that that legislation is going nowhere.” LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Speaker Paul Ryan surely wouldn’t allow a vote on Cicilline’s legislation, but Democrats could make an issue of it if they chose. They could file for a discharge petition, for example, a parliamentary procedure that allows for the body to force a vote if enough people sign on. A petition on the assault-weapons ban likely wouldn’t get enough signatures to force a vote, but at the least it would put members on the record for or against assault weapons.

According to a congressional source close to the talks, many House Democrats were actively discussing a discharge petition this week. But it doesn’t appear that it will happen.

In the upper chamber, Senator Dianne Feinstein has repeatedly introduced legislation that would ban assault weapons. It received a vote after Newtown, but failed. Senate Democrats The Washington Post earlier this week they may revive that bill, though there are no specific plans so far.

Hoyer is not wrong that an assault weapons ban would go “nowhere” (though neither will legislation closing the gun-show loophole). But lawmakers have an understandable tendency to work towards only the most immediately achievable goals.

That’s not generally true of outside pressure groups—and yet, none of the major pro–gun control organizations are joining Clinton’s call either. None of the three most politically active groups—the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Americans for Responsible Solutions, founded by former Representative Gabby Giffords, nor Everytown for Gun Safety, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s organization—even have an official position on whether assault weapons should be banned.

A spokesman for the Brady Campaign told The Nation the group believes “the single greatest opportunity” to cut gun deaths in half by 2025 “is by taking sensible steps to keep all guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, terrorists, felons, and dangerously mentally ill people by closing the terror gap, expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales, and shutting down the ‘bad apple’ gun dealers.” He added that the Brady Campaign does “value the important conversations taking place about keeping weapons of war off our streets.”

Similarly, representatives for Everytown for Gun Safety, which figures to be a major player in the 2016 television ad wars on gun control, confirmed to The Nation that the organization “take[s] no position on types of firearms.” Kate Folmar, the group’s deputy communications director, added, “It’s important to note that despite the focus on [assault weapons] after major events, they are not used in the majority of mass shootings and not in the big picture of gun violence in America. Handguns are the problem.”

Folmar is right on both counts, though, as she added, assault rifles “put the ‘mass’ in mass shootings.” They are not used in the majority of shootings where four or more people are shot at once, but they are the hallmark of headline-grabbing mass shootings like Orlando, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Columbine.

Assault weapons are also a huge financial boon to the larger gun industry. Gun sales were actually in a decades-long decline until somewhat recently, due to the declining popularity of hunting and an aging population of gun owners. Between 1980 and 2000, the US population grew 24 percent while small domestic arms production fell 33 percent.

The industry turned this around by pressing for concealed carry laws, aggressively marketing guns to young consumers—and by ramping up the production of assault weapons and marketing them as ultra-cool products that the average consumer can own to be just like police or members of the military. (This campaign is aided by the apocalyptic language increasingly used by both the NRA and now Donald Trump painting guns as necessary instruments in future combat against terrorists, illegal immigrants, and criminals.)

As Shooting Wire put it in 2008, after several years of expanded sales of assault weapons, “if you’re a company with a strong line of high-capacity pistols and AR-style rifles, you’re doing land office business. If you’re heavily dependent on hunting, you are hurting.”

That makes assault weapons a very useful pressure point for taking on the entire gun industry, not to mention a useful preventive measure against spree killings with double-digit casualties. (These events also boost overall gun sales, it should be noted.)

But for now at least, it appears Clinton will be a lonely voice pushing to ban assault weapons among the institutional gun control movement."

Cleveland—The National Rifle Association sent its top lobbyist, Chris Cox, onto the stage at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night. Keeping with the theme of the proceedings—scary people are coming to kill you—Cox told a little parable: Ad Policy

Imagine a young mother at home with her baby, when a violent predator kicks the door in. He’s a three-time loser who was released from prison early because some politician wanted to show their compassion. What’s she going to do? She’ll dial 911, and pray. The police will do their best to get their quickly, but their average response time is 11 minutes. So the question is, should she be able to defend herself with a firearm in her own home? Of course. Friends, that question is on the ballot in November.

Nothing Hillary Clinton is proposing, or conceivably would propose, would prevent that woman from legally purchasing a gun. But that aside, Cox’s tale was a huge backfire that eviscerated the NRA’s case for more gun ownership and looser laws.

This hypothetical violent predator, after having committed three crimes, could still easily purchase a gun today if he knows how to use Craigslist or find a local gun show. That’s because Republicans in Congress, backed by the NRA’s aggressive lobbying efforts, defeated a legislative package in 2013 that would have expanded universal background checks to online and person-to-person sales. Cox clumsily tried to avoid this point by not actually saying this “three-time loser” was armed, even though it would have made a better story. But it would have further underlined his accidental pro–gun control argument.

Moreover, public-health researchers have reached an inescapable conclusion: More guns means more women die. Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to die from being shot than women in other high-income countries.

The chance of anyone being murdered in a random home invasion like the one Cox depicts are one in several million. It’s vastly more likely this predator would have been the woman’s husband or boyfriend. From 2001 to 2012, 6,410 women were murdered by an intimate partner with a gun, which is more than all US the combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan during those years combined. LIKE THIS?

Cox’s intended message was that if the woman had a firearm, she could fend off this attacker. But the self-defense function of women who have guns has never been demonstrated by social science, and research shows the mere presence of a gun during a domestic incident makes murder 500 percent more likely.

The NRA has actively blocked several fixes that would make it harder for domestic abusers to get weapons. Federal laws keep abusive husbands from passing a firearm background check, but doesn’t do the same for abusive dating partners. More women are killed by boyfriends or dating partners than husbands. Republicans, at the urging of the NRA, have blocked changes to federal law.

Cox actually performed a public service by raising the issue of women who are killed by firearms. He just had exactly the wrong plan for fixing it."

Mysterious sniper attacks began occurring all around the Washington, DC, metro area on this day in 2002, a development which, after the attacks of the previous September and the subsequent (though entirely unrelated) scare, scared the daylights out of everybody. They turned out to be the work of a man named John Allen Muhammad and his young accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, whose ultimate goal was the establishment of a terrorist training camp for African-American orphan boys on the Canadian border. The real consequence, however, besides the murders, was the further blurring of the lines between the police and the military, as Patricia Williams wrote in this column from a month after the attacks began, “Home on the Range.” Ad Policy

On other fronts, a sniper is on the rampage in Washington, a tortured ghost for whom the war on terror seems not to be enough. The FBI calls in Army reconnaissance planes to try to find him. This is touted as a fair response under the circumstances, but in the process we Americans quietly witness the ultimate conflation of army and police. Given the reorganization of police power over the past year, it seems almost anticlimactic, reasonable, desirable. And given the urgency of current events, we seem to have abandoned all thought of other, less constraining alternatives. Who needs gun control, goes the popular logic, when we can have the gloriously panoptic control of the military aerially surveilling suburban shopping malls? And, hey, is it really so different from those surveillance cameras the Giuliani administration installed all over Manhattan?… Sometimes things get so crazy that people simply cannot hear through the mass panic of the moment. As we ride out the heightened troubles of these times, as our domestic fears become conflated with international terror, let us work hard not to fall back on the models that have betrayed us so often, of cowboys, of careless verbiage and of blind faith in the culture of guns.

For years, the National Rifle Association has pressed candidates for local and national offices to answer questions about gun control policy. The highly publicized results, which help form a candidate’s often sacred “NRA rating,” not only affect races in the short term but help shape policy long after as politicians are hemmed into a particular position on guns before even taking office. Ad Policy

Now, a leading pro-gun control group is launching a counter-effort: Everytown for Gun Safety, funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will soon present federal candidates in the 2014 midterms with a ten-part questionnaire about gun control policy. Bloomberg has committed to spending $50 million on the midterms, and the questionnaire is a good starting point for evaluating where candidates stand.

In many cases, this is the first time these candidates will be asked in detail about gun control policy. Among the questions, which you can read in full here:

Does the candidate support closing the gun show loophole?

What about loopholes that allow people to buy guns online without a criminal background check?

Does the candidate support increased penalties for straw purchases and gun trafficking?

Should the size of ammunition clips be restricted? (There is no baseline given).

Some of the questions are traps, in a sense, for candidates who normally hew close to the NRA line and oppose any restrictions on gun rights whatsoever. For example, one question asks if the candidate supports laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who have been convicted of stalking or of abusing a dating partner. (Current federal law only prohibits gun ownership by people convicted of spousal abuse, but not domestic violence more generally.) Any sensible answer to the question would be yes, and a “no” answer is a campaign ad waiting to happen.

Other questions are clearly designed to build political support among potential members of the next Congress for things like expanded background checks or even smaller-bore policy items like increased funding for the federal background check database.

But there is one curious omission, especially for a group whose name is supposed to recall the horror of the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut: no question asks about an assault weapons ban. There was notable state-level action around restricting assault weapons after Newtown, but congressional Democrats dropped this from last spring’s major gun control legislation. Apparently Everytown for Gun Safety isn’t too interested in pushing Congress forward on this issue."
