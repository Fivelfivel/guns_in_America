An analysis published Friday confirms the state of American gun policy science is not good, overall.

The nonprofit RAND Corporation analyzed thousands of studies and found only 63 that establish a causal relationship between specific gun policies and outcomes such as reductions in homicide and suicide, leaving lawmakers without clear facts about one of the most divisive issues in American politics.

The analysis is notable for its depth, if not for its overall finding — RAND spent two years and $1 million dollars on the project, which, beyond the analysis, also included a survey of gun policy experts and the construction of a research database on state gun laws.

For decades, social scientists and other researchers have pointed to a profound, and purposeful, lack of federal funding for gun research and a lack of federal data-gathering on guns as enormous impediments to studying gun violence. The federal government has spent much less on research into gun violence than on similarly lethal issues, such as motor vehicle crashes, liver disease and sepsis.

""Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn't find any evidence,"" says Andrew Morral, a behavioral scientist at RAND and the leader of the project.

They found, for example, no clear evidence regarding the effects of any gun policies on hunting and recreational gun use, or on officer-involved shootings, or on mass shootings or on the defensive use of guns by civilians.

There were some categories with better data, however, Morral says. There is relatively strong evidence, for example, that policies meant to prevent children from getting access to firearms — such as laws that require guns to be stored unloaded, or in locked containers — reduce both suicide and unintentional injury and death.

Previous work has also found that places that require a permit (issued by law enforcement) for the purchase a firearm do reduce violent crime.

There is also some evidence that prohibitions against purchase by people who have been diagnosed with mental illness reduce violent crime, and that ""stand your ground"" laws, which allow citizens who feel threatened in public to use lethal force without retreating first, lead to an increase in violent crime.

In general, however, good studies were few and far between, the RAND researchers say.

To help bridge the data gap for scientists, RAND has now compiled an open-source database of state-by-state gun laws going back to 1979. A similar, unrelated database run out of Boston University was published last year.

""Given the lack of data in the firearm research field, [the RAND database] will be a welcome addition, and I'm sure it will be valuable to researchers,"" says Dr. Michael Siegel, the physician who leads the Boston University project. He notes that, since it launched, the Boston database has been most helpful for journalists writing about gun violence.

""It's funny because I didn't actually think about that as a purpose of the project when we started it,"" says Siegel, ""but it seems to have become the primary use of the database so far (in addition to use by other researchers).""

The RAND team also surveyed 95 gun policy experts from across the political spectrum about what they thought the effects of 15 different gun policies would be on 12 outcomes. The policies included universal background checks, bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanded mental illness prohibitions, minimum age requirements and required reporting of lost or stolen weapons.

Many of the policies are now being considered by state and federal lawmakers, after a man used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school in February.

The vast majority of the specialists RAND surveyed agreed that the primary objectives of gun policies should be reducing suicides and homicides, and that protecting privacy, enabling hunting and sport shooting and preventing mass shootings were secondary priorities.

""That was a surprise, actually,"" says Morral. ""I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values — or that it's a values problem, in any case. But that's not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order.""

However, those surveyed varied widely in their predictions about how different policies would affect each outcome.

""Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts,"" says Morral. ""And the facts are sparse."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption George Frey/Getty Images George Frey/Getty Images

An increasing number of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, want more gun regulation, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll that surveyed people in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting.

Three-quarters of people polled said gun laws should be stricter than they are today. That's an increase — in a short period of time — from October 2017, when NPR conducted a similar survey in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Then, 68 percent said gun laws should be stricter than they were.

The poll also found widespread bipartisan support for a range of gun-control policies, including:

requiring background checks for all gun buyers (94 percent),

adding people with mental illnesses to the federal gun background check system (92 percent),

raising the legal age to purchase guns from 18 to 21 (82 percent),

banning bump stocks (81 percent),

banning high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds (73 percent) and

banning assault-style weapons (72 percent).

The only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by President Trump — the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools.

The poll also found that while nearly every gun policy was supported by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, the one exception was arming teachers.

There was a clear-cut partisan gulf — 68 percent of Republicans favored the idea of training teachers to carry guns compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Arming teachers was by far the most polarizing policy suggestion; the poll found a 50-point divide between Republicans and Democrats.

Trump's in sync with his base

The president's outspoken criticism of schools as gun-free zones and his recent rhetoric calling for a comprehensive gun bill suggests he's acutely aware of how his base voters feel about gun policies — and the growing desire, even among Republicans, for some sort of stricter gun-control legislation.

""We see in this study, a majority of Republicans saying that they are supportive of a variety of different gun-control measures, many of which Trump mentioned explicitly in his [White House] briefing,"" said Chris Jackson, director of the public polling team at Ipsos. ""And that's in contrast to a lot of Republican elected officials, who have taken a much more Second Amendment absolutist stance.""

Although Trump remains friendly with the National Rifle Association and its leadership, he's recently shown a willingness to challenge GOP orthodoxy on guns.

In a televised White House meeting with legislators Wednesday, Trump surprised (and angered) many of his fellow conservative lawmakers with his ad-hoc approach to gun-control policy. He questioned his fellow Republicans' relationship with the NRA and dismissed a concealed carry provision that conservatives wanted as a trade-off for some restrictions.

""They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,"" Trump told GOP lawmakers at that meeting, adding, ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.""

Trump suggested he was open to expanding background checks and possibly raising the age to purchase an AR-15. (Both popular measures, according to the NPR/Ipsos poll).

""President Trump is actually closer to where the Republican base is on the issue of guns than a lot of Republican elected officials,"" Jackson said. ""And I think this is something that Trump has done a lot through his political career; he often times finds himself closer to the Republican base than the establishment does.""

Of course, the president has a history of adopting popular opinions and speaking to the polls, and then subsequently reversing his position and reverting to a more traditionally conservative attitude, as he did with his initial support for a bill that would protect DACA recipients from deportation.

Americans want Congress to act

Any hope for a quick legislative answer to the gun debate fell apart in the Senate Thursday. And although the Senate now has no plans to vote on gun legislation in the near future, the NPR/Ipsos poll finds that a majority of Americans (78 percent) say Congress needs to do more to address gun violence.

But the intensity for congressional action lies with the Democrats — 93 percent of whom want more action, compared to 68 percent among Republicans.

Loading...

Jackson said the biggest change he's noticed since the October survey is the overall importance people are giving to the gun debate. Crime/gun violence is now the No. 1 issue worrying Americans. (Last October, it was terrorism).

The shift since last fall is largely because more Democrats and independents say they're concerned about guns, but Republicans shifted some as well.

And the poll found Americans are currently saying guns will be an important factor in their vote this November. Roughly two-thirds, or 63 percent, said so.

Traditionally, gun control is one of those issues that's dominated by a small slice of the electorate — an energized group of committed gun-rights activists.

But the political winds may be shifting.

""This data indicates there's actually an increasing energy on the side of gun control,"" Jackson said. And ""given that guns have become very partisan, that may have really significant results in the midterms.""

And there are signs the NRA's influence among voters may be declining. The NPR survey shows a decreasing number of Americans overall (led by a shift in Democrats' attitudes) said the NRA represents their views — just 36 percent overall down from 43 percent in October.

Guns are still partisan

There are still some major disagreements along party lines that reflect the overall gun debate in the country.

On the question of whether the country would be safer if more people carried guns, there was a huge divide, for example — 55 percent of Republicans felt the country would be safer, compared to just 15 percent of Democrats.

Loading...

And likewise, when people were asked whether they believed the premise that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun — there was a split along partisan lines — 71 percent of Republicans agreed, compared to 24 percent of Democrats.

The split over Trump's handling of the Parkland shooting situation seems to mirror his overall approval rating and shows how much partisanship affects people's perspectives — 71 percent of Republicans approved of how the president handled the aftermath of the school shooting, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats.

The poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Robert Cianflone/Getty Images Robert Cianflone/Getty Images

Australia says it collected more than 57,000 illegal firearms during a three-month amnesty last year – the first such program since tough gun laws were enacted in the wake of the country's worst mass shooting in 1996.

The amnesty, which ran from July through September, netted almost 2,500 semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons that were the target firearms legislation beginning in 1996 that banned private ownership of such rifles.

Unregistered firearms are illegal in Australia and owning one carries a penalty up to 14 years in jail and a US$225,000 fine.

""Taking these unregistered firearms off the streets means they will not fall into the hands of criminals, who might use them to endanger the lives of innocent Australians,"" Law Enforcement Minister Angus Taylor said Thursday.

Among the more unusual weapons recovered were a rusting anti-armor rocket launcher, a German machine gun dating from World War I and a muzzle-loading pistol produced circa 1860.

The largest number were surrendered in New South Wales — 24,831, while Queensland handed in 16,375; Victoria 9,175 and South Australia 2,825, with Tasmania, Western Australia and the Northern Territory accounting for the rest, officials said according to 9 News.

Last year's amnesty was meant to absorb some of the country's estimated 260,000 illegal guns in circulation – although the figure could be much higher, officials say.

In 2016, Chris Dawson, the head of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, said that outlaw biker gangs and Middle Eastern crime groups were thought to be responsible for illegal gun trafficking, according to The Age newspaper.

Australia's response to the April 28, 1996, massacre in Port Arthur, Tasmania, is widely viewed as a model that those in favor of stricter gun measures say the U.S. could emulate.

The Port Arthur shooter used an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle – the same weapon that has been featured in a number of mass shootings in the U.S., including the one last month that resulted in 17 deaths at a Parkland, Fla., high school.

In the decade before the Port Arthur massacre, which killed 35 people, there had been about ten mass shootings in Australia; however, in the 16 years since changes to gun laws were fully enacted in 2002, the number of such crimes has fallen precipitously. The homicide rate has also dropped, although some experts debate whether changes in gun laws are the only factor.

As NPR wrote in 2012, ""The new laws [in Australia] prohibited all automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and imposed strict licensing rules. Even paintball guns need a permit. There are also background checks and lengthy waiting periods for all purchases.""

In a 2017 interview with NPR's Here & Now, former Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who was in office when the tougher gun laws were passed, said they show that a country ""can have a sensible policy on guns and reduce the number of people being killed by guns and the gun massacres.""

However, as we reported in 2013, the efficacy of gun-buyback programs in the U.S. – similar to Australia's gun amnesty, but with a monetary incentive — has been questioned.

""Getting at the weapons you really want is not easy,"" William Woodward, director for training and technical assistance at the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told NPR. ""Years ago, when they first tried gun buybacks, they ran into the same problem. People brought in guns that were broken so they could get the cash, or they'd go out and get someone else's gun to turn in — but not the one they were planning on using."""

Updated at 7:40 p.m. ET

Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods say they won't sell guns to customers under 21, and both are putting new restrictions on ammunition sales.

Dick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest sports retailers in the U.S., has announced it is immediately ending its sales of military-style semi-automatic rifles and is requiring all customers to be older than 21 to buy a firearm at its stores. Additionally, the company no longer will sell high-capacity magazines.

Walmart, which ended sales of modern sporting rifles such as AR-15s in 2015, has announced that it is raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21. The company notes that it does not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories.

Walmart is also removing items from its website ""resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys"" — like the air gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was shot by a Cleveland police officer who thought the 12-year-old was armed.

Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack announced the firm's decision on ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday, the same day that survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School returned to class. Stack said the 19-year-old gunman allegedly behind that massacre, which claimed 17 lives and wounded many more in Parkland, Fla., had purchased a firearm from the retailer last November.

While that the weapon — a shotgun — was not used in the shooting, the CEO said the revelation deeply affected Stack and his colleagues at Dick's.

""We did everything by the book. We did everything that the law required, and still he was able to buy a gun,"" Stack said. ""When we looked at that, we said the systems that are in place across the board just aren't effective enough to keep us from selling a gun like that.

""And so we've decided we're not going to sell the assault-type rifles any longer.""

The company, which operates more than 715 locations, already had pulled assault-style weapons from Dick's stores after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting; now it will also stop selling the weapons at its subsidiary Field & Stream stores.

Stack said the decision to eliminate assault-style rifles is permanent.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims and their loved ones,"" the company said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We have tremendous respect and admiration for the students organizing and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country.

""We have heard you. The nation has heard you. ... The systems in place are not effective to protect our kids and our citizens.""

The statement asserted the company's support for the Second Amendment but continued, ""we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic.""

In addition to changing its own policies, the company issued a plea to elected officials to enact ""common-sense gun reform,"" specifically calling for the following regulations:

Ban assault-style firearms

Raise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21

Ban high-capacity magazines, as well as bump stocks — gun accessories that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate like fully automatic weapons

Require universal background checks that include relevant mental health information and previous interactions with the law

Ensure a complete universal database of those banned from buying firearms

Close the private sale and gun show loopholes that waive background checks

With their moves, Dick's and Walmart join a host of major companies that made changes in reaction to the Parkland shooting. As NPR's Amy Held reported last week, many other high-profile companies — from MetLife Insurance and First National Bank of Omaha to Symantec and Hertz — have ended their corporate partnerships with the National Rifle Association.

Those moves have not been without controversy.

Earlier this week, for instance, Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle threatened to ""kill any tax legislation that benefits"" Delta Air Lines after the company ended its own relationship with the NRA. Delta, which is based in Atlanta, had announced two days earlier that ""we will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website"" — a decision Cagle described as an attack on conservatives.

Asked about the potential for pushback among gun rights advocates, Stack acknowledged the move ""isn't going to make everyone happy. But when we look at what those kids and the parents and the heroes in the school, what they did, our view was: If the kids can be brave enough to organize like this, we can be brave enough to get these [firearms] out of here.""

""We're staunch supporters of the Second Amendment,"" he added. ""I'm a gun owner myself. We've just decided that based on what's happened and with these guns, we don't want to be part of this story."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

Updated at 3:05 a.m. ET Friday

Plans for a speedy Senate vote on gun legislation crumbled Thursday as Senate leaders announced plans to move on to long-planned banking legislation, while congressional Republicans struggle to make sense of President Trump's wishes on guns.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Thursday that the Senate will move on to the banking bill after voting on several nominations this week. McConnell said he hopes to vote on changes to the background check system for most gun purchases but did not provide a timeline or any further details.

""We'd love to do that at some point,"" McConnell said. ""I'm hoping there is a way forward.""

The lack of commitment is the surest sign yet that Congress does not plan to quickly address gun access, despite pressure from the White House and survivors of last month's deadly shooting at a Florida high school.

There is no plan for any action on gun legislation ahead of the two-week Easter recess at the end of March. The Senate will next take up Idaho GOP Sen. Mike Crapo's bipartisan legislation to ease bank regulations. The Senate also plans to vote this month on Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman's legislation to combat sex trafficking, and Congress must pass a sweeping spending package by March 23.

There is no room in the agenda for guns, unless senators reach agreement on legislation that could move through the Senate via an expedited process known as unanimous consent. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who is opposed to any new restrictions on gun rights, said he did not believe that kind of consensus was within reach. ""Look, we've got a lot of disagreement on the Republican side, and I would be surprised if something moved anytime soon,"" he said.

Widespread confusion

The sharp departure was the result of widespread confusion on Capitol Hill over guns. Republicans spent the day Thursday struggling to respond to a set of vague instructions Trump laid out during a televised meeting at the White House.

That meeting followed a familiar pattern for many lawmakers who are trying to write and pass legislation that can meet Trump's shifting approval. Even many Republicans responded to the White House meeting with confusion and frustration over the lack of clear guidance from the president.

Over the course of the hourlong broadcast Trump seemed to embrace plans to expand background checks and increase age limits for purchasing long gun rifles, positions generally anathema to congressional Republicans. He also suggested pre-emptively taking guns away from potentially dangerous people, a policy that might draw significant legal challenges.

""I don't know, you saw it, right? It was wild,"" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a Republican. ""I think the president is going to have to narrow his list of what he'd like to see addressed and figure out what's realistic.""

The disconnect between Trump and congressional Republicans on core philosophical issues on display this week, coupled with the lingering partisan anger between the two parties following the failed immigration talks, is quickly lowering already dim expectations that 2018 will result in much legislative output.

Adding to the confusion, however, Trump and Vice President Pence met Thursday with Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm. The president tweeted that it was a ""Good (Great) meeting ..."" and Cox said in a tweet after the meeting that ""POTUS & VPOTUS support he Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control.""

The only must-pass measure on the agenda is the spending bill still being drafted to finalize the appropriations process for the year that, once passed, will free up lawmakers to focus their efforts on what is quickly overtaking Capitol Hill: the battle for control of Congress in the midterm elections.

Republicans say they all agree that something needs to be done to curb gun violence, but there is little, if any, consensus on the best way to do that while still maintaining gun rights. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters Thursday that he is not inclined to support any of the numerous gun-related bills that have been floated in recent days.

""I'm not inclined to do anything right now except to see what comes up,"" Shelby said. ""We all are interested in our children being safe in schools; we're all interested in the communities being safe. It's how do we get there?""

Trump often acknowledges that it's hard to pass any legislation in Congress, let alone laws to curb gun rights. But many lawmakers, including some Republicans, say Trump's own statements make the already difficult task of passing gun legislation even harder.

The meeting concluded with Trump asking lawmakers to go back and talk about the extensive list of proposals floated at the meeting, and without a White House endorsement of any specific plan.

""Element of unpredictability""

Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Ryan Costello told NPR's Morning Edition that he worries that kind of broad directive makes it harder for Congress to focus its attention on specific legislation that could pass and eventually become law.

""There's still an element of unpredictability on what the White House is willing to lean on from a gun safety reform measure,"" Costello said. ""There was a bit of contradiction in what he said.""

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of the leading lawmakers working on a proposal to update the criminal background check system, shared similar concerns Wednesday after the meeting adjourned. Cornyn told reporters that it is his experience that passing these measures is harder than it sounds.

""I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,"" Cornyn said. ""He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.""

Shock at tariff announcement

Republicans still reeling from the fallout of Trump's conflicting comments during Wednesday's gun meeting were again taken by surprise Thursday with the White House announcement of impending tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The decision upends long-standing GOP orthodoxy on trade policy and provoked fears among senators of a trade war with China and other traditional allies that threatens to harm the U.S. economy more than tariffs promise to help.

""Every time you do this you get a retaliation, and agriculture is the No. 1 target,"" said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kansas. ""I think this is terribly unproductive for the ag economy."" China is already signaling it could retaliate against U.S. sorghum exports. Kansas is the country's top sorghum producer.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the president's decision is counter to the view of the Senate GOP Conference, which has in prior meetings urged Trump not to impose these tariffs. ""I think every Republican is pretty well on the same side of the page from that standpoint, resisting what [Trump] and his trade advisers were talking about,"" Johnson said. ""We have been talking to the administration almost in a unanimous fashion, warning against protectionist measures, warning against these types of tariffs."""

Updated at 7:52 p.m. ET

In a freewheeling meeting with lawmakers on efforts to curtail gun violence, President Trump appeared to throw his support behind a number of conflicting measures, including some that are opposed by the powerful gun lobby.

Conservatives and allies of the president were angered by such signals on Wednesday, while others have begun to sound the alarm that Trump is continuing to demonstrate an unfamiliarity with basic policy proposals and a misunderstanding of the legislative process.

During the gathering at the White House of both GOP and Democratic lawmakers, the president showed an openness to expanding background checks, possibly raising the age to purchase AR-15 rifles and also overriding due process, if necessary, to take guns away from mentally ill people or those who have been red-flagged as potential dangers, as the admitted shooter in Parkland, Fla., two weeks ago had been.

Trump bluntly told GOP lawmakers that any effort to include a concealed-carry reciprocity measure with a gun bill would effectively sink its chances — which is because of firm opposition from Senate Democrats. But there were other moments where the president showed a naiveté of the lawmaking process, claiming that it would be easy to get 60 votes for a bill to pass the Senate, suggesting merging some incompatible ideas and chiding lawmakers for being too beholden to the National Rifle Association — a group from which he has enjoyed broad support and with whose leaders he remains particularly chummy.

The fallout from the meeting already has one pro-Trump news website turning on the president.

""Trump the Gun Grabber: Cedes Dems' Wish List— Bump Stocks, Buying Age, 'Assault Weapons,' Background Checks..."" was the headline on Breitbart News afterward.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters the White House meeting did little to advance the debate in Congress over legislation aimed at curbing gun violence.

""It's still unclear to me what can actually pass, and my experience is these things are harder to do than they sound. So I think we'll sleep on it and see where we are tomorrow,"" he said.

The president repeatedly challenged long-standing GOP orthodoxy on gun policy in Wednesday's meeting, leaving legislators bewildered by what happens next and what, precisely, Trump actually supports.

""I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,"" Cornyn said. ""He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.""

Emphasis on comprehensive legislation

Trump underscored that he wants a bill that will address many issues he believes has contributed to mass shootings over the past few decades, ranging from background check loopholes to mental health legislation.

""We can really get there but we have to do it,"" Trump said at the outset of the meeting.

There are two major bipartisan Senate bills the president seized upon and even suggested could be merged. First, he voiced support for the effort by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., which failed in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, that would have expanded background checks.

Trump expressed disbelief that such a bill didn't pass after such a devastating attack that killed 20 young children and six adults. And one reason it failed, he chided, was that then-President Barack Obama didn't sufficiently support it — despite the fact that Obama spent considerable time and political capital to back its passage, calling it ""a pretty shameful day for Washington"" when it fell just six votes short of the 60 needed to advance in the Senate.

Trump asked what that bill did to address raising the age from 18 to 21 for some firearm purchases like AR-15s, which have been used in several deadly shootings. Toomey responded that it didn't currently address it, to which Trump retorted that was because ""you're afraid of the NRA.""

Toomey spokesman Steve Kelly later pointed out in a statement that the NRA downgraded Toomey's rating and refused to back his re-election bid after his bill with Manchin and that he has never taken any money from the group since becoming a senator, which ""demonstrated that he is not afraid of the NRA or any other special interest group.""

The second bill Trump signaled his support for is the ""Fix NICS"" bill proposed by Cornyn and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., which would improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and, they hope, flag people who shouldn't be able to purchase guns.

Murphy, who has been a leading voice for gun control especially after the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., complained that they haven't been able to get anywhere significant in the past few years because ""the gun lobby has a veto power.""

""If all we end up doing is the stuff that the gun industry supports, then this just isn't worth it,"" Murphy said.

He also argued that implementing universal background checks is critical, citing statistics that gun murders in states with such checks have dropped by over one-third. Currently, background checks at gun shows and for Internet sales aren't federally mandated. The NRA has opposed such an expansion.

Later on, Trump again posited he would be willing to buck the NRA if necessary — despite the fact he has repeatedly assured the lobbying group he is a loyal ally, had lunch over the weekend with the group's leaders and said earlier in the meeting that he is a ""big fan"" of the group.

""They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,"" Trump said, latter adding that, ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.""

Trump also suggested merging the assault weapons ban bill that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has proposed with the Manchin-Toomey and Cornyn-Murphy bills.

""Dianne, if you could add what you have also — and I think you can — into the bill,"" Trump said at one point.

Any effort to ban assault weapons or AR-15 rifles would be a nonstarter with the NRA and Republicans.

Feinstein was visibly amused, exclaiming, ""Joe, are you ready?"" as the West Virginia senator hung his head.

And Trump also pushed back against House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. — who was shot and critically wounded last June during a congressional baseball practice — when he talked about the House's efforts to attach concealed-carry reciprocity across state lines to the Cornyn-Murphy bill.

""Steve, it's very hard to add the one thing that you want. ... Let's consider it for a separate bill,"" the president said.

""Take the gun first, go through due process second""

One of the more surprising stances Trump took appeared to flout due process for gun owners.

After Vice President Pence began to talk about how he and the president had conversations with governors earlier this week, Trump interjected that people should ""take the firearms first and then go to court"" if there is a concern about someone having a gun and potentially being unstable or likely to commit violence.

""A lot of times by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures, I like taking the guns early,"" Trump continued.

The president cited multiple warnings that lawmakers had about the Parkland shooter that went ignored by law enforcement.

""Take the gun first, go through due process second,"" Trump said.

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic, was not amused by such a suggestion.

""Strong leaders don't automatically agree with the last thing that was said to them. We have the Second Amendment and due process of law for a reason,"" Sasse said in a statement after the meeting. ""We're not ditching any Constitutional protections simply because the last person the President talked to today doesn't like them.""

At last week's Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump warned the crowd that it was Democrats who would ""take away your Second Amendment ... which we will never allow that.""

Doubling down on arming teachers

Trump did reiterate his support for one measure the NRA has heavily backed — arming some teachers and school personnel, ending gun-free school zones as a way to solidify school security.

""You've got to have defense too,"" the president said in his opening remarks. ""You can't just be sitting ducks, and that's exactly what we've allowed people in these buildings to be.""

""They're not going to come in when they know they're going to come out dead,"" Trump later added, though he did seem to suggest it could be an issue left up to individual states.

Some lawmakers, such as Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., and Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., spoke in support of such a proposal. Others, including Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., who represents Parkland, said he and many others oppose such measures.

Will any of this matter?

While the meeting did show that there could be some consensus reached on these issues, Trump has often thrown his support behind measures, only to see those endorsements walked back later by White House staff or contradicted by the president himself. That's on top of the fact that the president often appears highly influenced by the last person he talked to about an issue. So anything Trump appeared to get behind or suggest at the meeting should be taken with a grain of salt.

A similar bipartisan meeting happened in early January on efforts to field a comprehensive immigration bill that would address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In that meeting, Trump suggested he would sign any bill lawmakers sent him and that he would take any heat and expected backlash from the anti-immigration wing, which has been a major bloc of support for the president.

But later Trump insisted that any bill contain not only funding for his border wall but cuts to legal immigration, which was a nonstarter with Democrats and even some Republicans. Ultimately, many proposals failed earlier this month in the Senate.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. — a sometimes critic, sometimes ally of Trump's — expressed some skepticism after the meeting and also issued a warning.

""If the president has another one of these sessions and he doesn't follow through, it's going to hurt him. It's going to hurt the Republican Party,"" Graham told CNN. ""I've seen this movie before. If it ends up like immigration he's done himself a lot of harm.""

Cornyn also said many of Trump's comments would not sway the debate. ""I wouldn't confuse what he said with what can actually pass. I don't expect to see any great divergence in terms of people's views on the Second Amendment, for example.""

Cornyn is still supporting his incremental, bipartisan bill co-authored with Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, to improve the current background check system. But without broad agreement in the Senate, the legislation could easily get bogged down in more controversial gun debates.

""It's pretty clear to me that we're not going to get that consent agreement, so that means [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] is going to have to make a decision on how to proceed and how much floor time he's willing to commit to this,"" Cornyn said.

Earlier in the week Cornyn expressed hope that Congress could act on the bill this week, but he said Wednesday it is clear that will not happen. Like many lawmakers, he was candid that this gun debate may again yield no tangible legislative results.

""I think the deadline is going to be the next mass shooting. It's only a matter of time, and if we don't do something I think there's going to be a heavy price to pay,"" he said.

The Texas Republican added: ""I don't want to meet another family who lost a loved one in a mass shooting and think we could have done something which would have prevented this, but we didn't do it because we didn't act."""

A well-liked social studies teacher barricaded himself in a classroom and fired a handgun at Dalton High School, which plunged students and faculty into a lockdown and subsequent evacuation, according to the AP.

No students were in the classroom. The only injury was to a student who hurt her ankle running away, tweeted the police in Dalton, which is about 90 miles north of Atlanta.

Police confirmed that the teacher was Jesse Randal Davidson, 53. He taught social studies, and served as play-by-play voice of the school's football team. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Davidson had been at the school since 2004, and was recognized as the school's ""top teacher"" in 2012.

The incident occurred two weeks after a shooting incident at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., left 17 dead, and as its survivors are igniting a new debate over gun control around the United States.

After that shooting, both the National Rifle Association and President Trump have suggested that arming teachers could discourage would-be shooters from entering schools. ""We have to have offensive capability to take these people out rapidly before they can do this kind of damage,"" Trump said last week.

As NPR has reported, ""many educators are uncomfortable with the idea, and worry that it could put students in further harm and deter people from entering the field of teaching, which is already facing shortages.""

The AP reports:

""The teacher was taken into custody without incident after a 30- to 45-minute standoff with officers, police spokesman Bruce Frazier said. ... ""Police noted that Davidson didn't appear to want to hurt the students or faculty. He fired the gun at an exterior window when the principal tried to enter the classroom. ... ""The shooting happened about 11:30 a.m. during Davidson's planning period. At first, students tried to get into the classroom, but they couldn't. The students told the principal, who tried to enter. ""'I didn't get the door open very far, but he slammed the door and hollered ""Go away, don't come in here."" He had some nonsensical noises that were made as well,' Principal Steve Bartoo said. ""Bartoo returned a short time later and put his key in the door 'and again he slammed the door before I could open it and he said, ""Don't come in here, I have a gun.""' ""That's when Davidson fired and the school was placed on lockdown, authorities said.""

Students of the class took to social media to discuss the incident, including Chondi Chastain, who told the AP that she was scheduled to have Davidson's class later that afternoon. ""I dare you to tell me arming teachers will make us safe,"" she tweeted to the NRA.

Davidson has been charged with ""aggravated assault, carrying weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of gun during commission of a crime, and disrupting public school,"" according to Dalton Police.

Students are excused from coming to Dalton High School Thursday, but faculty and police will be there. The school will resume classes on Friday."

High school students across the United States have been leading the call for more gun control since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

Some have called them the ""voice of a generation on gun control"" that may be able to turn the tide of a long-simmering debate.

But past polling suggests that people younger than 30 in the U.S. are no more liberal on gun control than their parents or grandparents — despite diverging from their elders on the legalization of marijuana, same-sex marriage and other social issues.

""Sometimes people surprise us, and this is one of those instances that we don't know why,"" says Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of Gallup.

Over the past three years, his polling organization asked the under-30 crowd whether gun laws in the U.S. should be made more strict, less strict or kept as they are now. On average, people between the ages of 18 and 29 were 1 percentage point more likely to say gun laws should be more strict than the overall national average of 57 percent.

""Young people statistically aren't that much different than anybody else,"" Newport says.

'What a whole generation feels'?

Polling by the Pew Research Center last year came to similar conclusions: 50 percent of millennials, between the ages of 18 and 36, said gun laws in the U.S. should be more strict. That share was almost identical among the general public, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew.

Pew did find significant differences between millennials and older generations on two gun control proposals — banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The results showed that a greater share of millennials — both Republicans and Democrats — are more conservative when it comes to those bans compared with Generation Xers, baby boomers and members of the silent generation.

""What we're hearing now in the immediate aftermath of Parkland might not be representative of what a whole generation feels,"" Parker says.

To be clear, many demographers argue that millennials make up one part of today's generation of young people. Some say that millennials include people born in the 1980s and all the way through 2000.

The teenage high school activists who have been organizing since the Florida shooting, they say, are part of a separate group some call ""Generation Z."" Pollsters generally don't count the views of those under 18, so there probably won't be national polling on this group until more of these young people are officially adults.

'A more progressive generation'?

Still, for 19-year-old Abigail Kaye, who considers herself a millennial, these polling results about her peers come as a shock.

""I think that's surprising because I feel like we're a more progressive generation,"" says Kaye, who attends the University of Delaware.

Kaye says she remembers hearing about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., when she was growing up about a couple hours away in Scituate, R.I.

""We've grown up more, I think, with this kind of gun violence, so you'd think maybe we'd push for more regulations,"" she adds.

The poll findings also surprised some members of Students for the Second Amendment, a club at the University of Delaware.

The club's treasurer, Jordan Riger of Lutherville, Md., 22, says that after taking an National Rifle Association course on pistol shooting when she was 18, she has seen firearms as tools for self-defense. But she thinks many of her millennial peers don't.

""We are living in a time right now where we're seeing a lot more of these mass casualties,"" Riger says. ""I think when people don't know that much about firearms, when they see it on the news used in horrible fashion, that's like all they associate it with.""

Sitting outside a student center on the University of Delaware's campus, Cahlil Evans of Smyrna, Del., 20, says while he doesn't need a gun, he can understand why people would want hunting rifles and handguns. He draws the line, though, for assault-style rifles.

""There's no need for these high-caliber rifles that pierce through walls,"" Evans says. ""People can say they use them for hunting or whatever, but why do you need a weapon with such high caliber that it would pierce through the animal and like eight trees behind it?""

Still, 22-year-old Jeremy Grunden of Harrington, Del., says he is encouraged to hear that millennials are less likely to support banning assault-style weapons.

""I base what we need off of what the military has,"" says Grunden, who is president of Students for the Second Amendment at the University of Delaware. ""When it comes to ... the Second Amendment, we're supposed to be a well-armed and well-maintained militia and all that. Quite frankly, we need that and plus more."""

In Florida, state lawmakers continue to debate gun control. Gov. Rick Scott urged Republicans and Democrats to come up with legislation by the end of next week, when the legislative session ends.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Let's turn to Florida now, where the state Senate is holding a rare Saturday session. Members of the legislature are considering a number of gun and school safety measures following last month's shooting in Parkland. Sascha Cordner from member station WFSU has been following the debate in Florida and the ideas dominating the conversation.

SASCHA CORDNER, BYLINE: Lawmakers in Florida's capitol have been saying they want to pass some form of legislation since the parents and student survivors from Parkland began demanding it shortly after the shooting. Legislators have been considering whether to include things like a ban on bump stocks and raising the minimum age for a person to buy any firearm to 21. But provisions like those had one representative, Jay Fant, pointing to the Second Amendment.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAY FANT: This level of infringement upon our most sacred and highest regarded law is tremendously out of place. Instead, focus on the more positive pieces of the legislation proposed.

CORDNER: Like allowing designated teachers to carry firearms if they are deputized and complete law enforcement training. Incoming Florida House Speaker Jose Oliva says it's part of a school marshal program, another idea that's kept coming up during this debate.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOSE OLIVA: Those coaches, those teachers who threw themselves in the line of fire - if they could have had a way to defend themselves and their students, I think - I think that they would have wanted that.

CORDNER: Fant and Oliva our part of the GOP majority controlling the Florida statehouse. Among Democrats, the debate revealed opposition that goes beyond the specific provisions currently on the floor. Representative Kamia Brown is a member of the black legislative caucus.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KAMIA BROWN: While a vast majority of our teachers are wonderful people, there could be situations where guns are actually used against minority students because a teacher says that he or she fears for her life and the safety of others. In this bill, there is no exception to the already-law ""stand your ground"" included. Teachers authorized to carry up under this marshal program will be able to stand their ground when they are threatened by any student - not just an active shooter - and avoid all civil and criminal liability.

CORDNER: For decades, Republican majorities in the Florida legislature have not taken up gun restrictions and have instead passed pro-gun measures like strengthening ""stand your ground."" But there is now more movement on toughening Florida's gun laws. Governor Rick Scott took to the House floor Thursday to urge lawmakers to pass something before the end of the 2018 legislative session.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RICK SCOTT: As you all know, two weeks ago, Florida changed. Seventeen people in our state that didn't deserve to die died. It's horrible this would ever happen anywhere. And when you talk to the families, you just can't imagine what they're going through.

CORDNER: Representative Katie Edwards-Walpole is a Democrat. She says it's time for all sides to work past their differences.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KATIE EDWARDS-WALPOLE: And I would just ask that going forward that those individuals who can't get with it and be a part of this bipartisan compromise and work towards a solution - get the hell out of the way.

CORDNER: And the Florida legislative session ends Friday, so lawmakers have just the coming week to find that solution.

Donald Trump won the backing of the National Rifle Association and many gun owners by opposing limits to the Second Amendment's right to bear arms. But since his election and in the early months of his presidency, Trump has not been good for the gun business.

Shares of publicly traded firearms companies have fallen. The pro-gun president nicking the fortunes of the industry he vowed to protect may seem illogical on its face.

But the slump makes complete sense when seen through unusual economics underlying the gun business. Most businesses are influenced by things such as interest rates and consumer confidence.

In the gun industry, politics and fear matter. And they matter a lot. Over the last two years, there was plenty of both to go around amid terror attacks and school shootings. And, of course, there was the presidential race, which Hillary Clinton was heavily favored to win.

Guns and ammunition sold fast. The FBI processed a record number of background checks on potential gun buyers in 2016. (Background checks are considered the best available proxy for gun purchases since overall sales numbers are not made public.)

Analysts say when gun purchases quickly spike a clear connection can be made to fear, politics, or both. Sales jump when people are fearful for their personal safety following tragedies such as school shootings or domestic terror attacks. Buyers snap up firearms when politicians respond to those events by calling for stronger gun control. And sales are higher with a Democrat in the White House is in position to pick Supreme Court justices.

Since Trump's election, background checks have fallen three straight months from year-ago levels. And shops like Nova Firearms in McLean, Va., have detected a notable drop in sales of certain types of weapons such as AR-15 military-style semi-automatic rifles. During the heat of the campaign, says salesman Tom Jenkins, the shop couldn't keep those weapons in stock. Customers were worried the rifles would be singled out for a ban by Hillary Clinton.

""During the political crisis we had dozens of them downstairs, and then there would be zero. And it would go again and then go again. And right up to the election, literally, brought them in, brought them up and sold them.""

Since Trump's victory those guns aren't moving nearly as fast, says Jenkins, pointing to five AR-15 style weapons on a rack behind the counter of the shop. He says it's a certain type of customer whose buying decisions are influenced by politics.

""The hunter doesn't care who's president. The revolver shooter or the target shooter or the competition shooter really didn't care who was president. It's the self-defense market and the people think certain guns may be tied to politics.""

Jenkins is an ex-cop, former military, a public radio fan, and one of those rare people who talks about Trump's victory without glee or despair.

""It was interesting because it was a shock for pretty much everybody, whether you're on the conservative side or liberal side,"" he says. ""It was like, what's going to happen now?""

One answer to that question became apparent immediately. ""What happened probably quicker than anything is that the gun-related stocks were in freefall,"" says James Hardiman, an equity research analyst who follows the firearms industry for Wedbush Securities.

On the day after the election shares of gun maker Sturm Ruger fell 14 percent. And the price of Smith & Wesson, which has since changed its name to the generic sounding American Outdoor Brands, fell 15 percent. Shares of both companies are still down, in contrast to the overall stock market, which has enjoyed big post-election gains. All of this points to that weird dynamic in the gun business.

""I think people that follow this industry know this well, but maybe people that don't, it's a little counterintuitive, but generally Democrats are very good for gun sales,"" Hardiman says.

The fear that Democrats will make it a lot harder to buy guns has never been very likely, according to Hardiman. And the idea that they will ban guns altogether — he calls that pure fantasy.

""Nonetheless it's fantasy that has worked in the favor of the gun industry for quite some time,"" he says.

Those fears essentially melted away with Donald Trump's victory.

Over at Nova Firearms, Tom Jenkins says politics aren't driving the business right now. Customers are choosy. The basics of supply and demand are at work.

""And so for the first couple of months after the election no one's in a hurry anymore,"" he says."

Updated at 8:30 p.m. ET

The Air Force says a mistake allowed Devin Patrick Kelley to buy guns. On Sunday Kelley opened fire on a small church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

The former airman had an assault-style rifle and two handguns — all purchased by him, according to federal officials — when he shot and killed 26 people.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Texas Department of Public Safety via AP Texas Department of Public Safety via AP

He also had a known record of domestic violence. In 2012, while he was in the U.S. Air Force, he was court-martialed for assaulting his then-wife and stepson. He served a year in confinement at a Naval facility in California after a plea bargain.

Under federal law, his conviction disqualified him from legally possessing a firearm. But there was an apparent breakdown in getting information about his conviction to the proper federal database.

""Initial information indicates that Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations,"" said Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek in an email.

Top Air Force brass have ordered a complete review of the case.

Kelley purchased four guns over a four-year period beginning in 2014, according to federal officials; all those purchases were made after his court-martial conviction and discharge.

An official at the Pentagon tells NPR's Tom Bowman that a mistake resulted in neither the arrest nor the conviction being listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the database that would have flagged him as ineligible to purchase a firearm.

""This was mishandled by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, where Kelley was serving when he was arrested,"" Tom reports. ""An investigation is now underway, and the Air Force is taking it very seriously, said the source.""

""The Service will also conduct a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly. The Air Force has also requested that the Department of Defense Inspector General review records and procedures across the Department of Defense,"" said Stefanek.

Retired Col. Don Christensen, who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force at the time of Kelley's general court-martial, tells NPR that the case was serious.

""He fractured his baby stepson's skull,"" Christensen says.

Kelley accepted a deal, pleading guilty to a charge of assault on his wife and to a charge of ""intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm"" on the child, Christensen says. His crimes were punishable by up to five years confinement (the military equivalent of a prison term). As part of the deal, Kelley received an 18-month cap on his confinement and was ultimately sentenced to 12 months.

Kelley's punitive discharge — a bad conduct discharge — did not prohibit him from owning a gun, as a dishonorable discharge would have.

But under federal law, anyone convicted of ""a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"" is prohibited from possessing a firearm. The same is true for anyone convicted of ""a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" under a provision that allows no exception for the military or law enforcement.

Kelley's conviction qualified under both categories, Christensen says.

NPR's Martin Kaste reports that Academy Sports & Outdoors, a store that sold Kelley guns, says it ran a background check on Kelley twice in the past two years. Kelley passed each time, the company says.

If Kelley's convictions were never uploaded into the system, that could easily explain how he passed. But even if they had been uploaded, there might still have been trouble getting information into the right hands — there's a sort of language barrier between military and civilian justice systems, Christensen says, with different terms for the same kinds of crimes. If the military described a general court-martial for assault, with a sentence of one year, the civilian authorities might ""never realize"" it was a domestic violence conviction punishable by five years, he says.

In general, there are some ""gaping holes"" in the current background check system, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reported last year, which can allow people who should fail background checks to buy guns anyway. And if Kelley had purchased a gun from a private seller, he wouldn't have had to pass a background check at all, Martin notes.

Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says Kelley applied for a license to carry a gun and was rejected, Martin reports. He notes that Texas requires a background check but also has additional training and tests that Kelley may not have completed.

As NPR has previously reported, mass shootings are often linked to domestic violence. In fact, in a majority of mass shootings, the shooter's current or former partner, or another family member, is among the victims."

Updated at 5:14 p.m.

An FBI examination of the windshield of the Amtrak train that derailed last week in Philadelphia, killing eight people, has found no evidence of damage that could have been caused by a firearm, the National Transportation Safety Board says.

But, the agency said in a statement, ""The NTSB has not ruled out the possibility that another object may have struck the windshield.""

As we reported May 15, one of the assistant conductors on Amtrak Train 188, traveling between Washington and New York, told investigators that just prior to the crash she heard a radio transmission from the train's engineer that the locomotive had been struck.

At the time, NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said the agency had seen damage to the left-hand lower portion of the Amtrak's windshield. The engineer has no memory of what happened after the train passed North Philadelphia station. The NTSB says the train was traveling at 106 mph when it made the turn rated for 50 mph.

Commuter service between Philadelphia and New York City had been halted for a week after the derailment. But on Monday morning, trains began rolling. The Associated Press reports:

""Amtrak resumed service along the corridor with a 5:30 a.m. southbound train leaving New York City. The first northbound train, scheduled to leave Philadelphia at 5:53 a.m., was delayed and pulled out of 30th Street Station at 6:07 a.m. ""About three dozen passengers boarded the New York City-bound train in Philadelphia, and Mayor Michael Nutter was on hard to see the passengers and train off. ""All Acela Express, Northeast Regional and other services were to also resume.""

Amtrak President & CEO Joe Boardman said in a statement: ""The safety of our passengers and crew remains our number one priority. Our infrastructure repairs have been made with the utmost care and emphasis on infrastructure integrity including complete compliance with Federal Railroad Administration directives."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images

Gov. Jerry Brown has signed new gun control legislation for California, enacting bills that limit magazine capacity to 10 bullets; require a background check for those purchasing ammunition; and restrict the lending of firearms, among other effects.

In signing the bills, Brown said he wants ""to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.""

Two of the bills close the ""bullet button loophole,"" as member station KPCC reports:

""The loophole refers to the sale of 'California legal' firearms that don't fall under California's ban of guns with detachable magazines. ""To get around the law, manufacturers created versions of firearms that feature a button that can be pushed with a small tool — for instance the tip of a bullet — to release an empty magazine and insert a new one.""

Another bill that will now become law tries to limit ""straw purchasing,"" the practice of a person buying a gun legally with the intent of giving or selling the weapon to someone else. In addition to making it a misdemeanor to file a false report about a gun being lost or stolen, the new law will prohibit the purchaser from buying another gun for 10 years.

As KPCC reminds us, the classification of a gun as an ""assault weapon"" is a legal designation in California:

""Legislators established the 'assault weapon' as a new classification of firearm in 1989. Following a court challenge in 2000, the law was upheld. Gun owners could keep their assault weapons provided they registered with the state before Jan. 23, 2001.""

The legislation was signed almost exactly seven months after husband-and-wife shooters Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. In April, a relative of the murderers was charged with providing the guns they used.

All of the bills Brown signed were sponsored by Democrats — and so were the five bills that he vetoed, although one of those, which makes it a felony to steal a gun, was also sponsored by Republican Assemblywoman Melissa A. Melendez.

In rejecting that bill, Brown said a similar measure is already slated to appear as a state ballot issue in November.

Brown vetoed another bill that would make it a misdemeanor not to report the loss or theft of a gun, saying he doesn't believe the measure would help stop gun traffickers. He added that the bill wouldn't make irresponsible people become responsible.

Another bill that sought to classify the body of a firearm as a firearm, thus closing a loophole that has allowed unfinished gun frames or receivers to be sold under less scrutiny than a finished gun would require, was deemed to have wording that was too vague."

Renee Montagne and Ari Shapiro Discuss the Ruling on 'Morning Edition' Listen

Q&A: D.C. Gun Ban Overturned; What's Next? The Supreme Court ruling doesn't mean that anyone can now buy and own a handgun in Washington, D.C. Those who want a gun will still need to obtain a license. Read what else to expect as a result of the court's decision.

U.S. Gun Laws: A History The Supreme Court's decision on the right to bear arms is the latest milestone in the long history of U.S. gun legislation. Read our selected timeline of key laws.

Interpreting the Second Amendment The decision to overturn the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns is the Surpeme Court's first conclusive interpretation of the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791.

This is a great moment in American history. It vindicates individual Americans all over this country who have always known that this is their freedom worth protecting. Read the NRA's Full Statement

While we disagree with the Supreme Court's ruling, which strips the citizens of the District of Columbia of a law they strongly support, the decision clearly suggests that other gun laws are entirely consistent with the Constitution. Read Helmke's Full Statement

In a dramatic moment on the last day of this term, the Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to self-defense and gun ownership.

For most of the last century, the interpretation of the Second Amendment has been that the right to bear arms is a collective right, such as with military service; Thursday's ruling says gun ownership is also an individual right.

The 5-4 ruling grows out of a Washington, D.C., case in which a security guard sued the district for prohibiting him from keeping his handgun at home. In the District of Columbia, it is a crime to carry an unregistered firearm, and the registration of handguns is prohibited. The rules are so strict, they essentially regulate handguns out of existence. The regulations were intended to curb gun violence in the capital city.

The ruling struck down the ban on constitutional grounds, saying it flew in the face of the constitutional right to bear arms.

An Individual Right

The precise meaning of the Second Amendment — ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"" — has long been a subject for debate. In a decision nearly 70 years ago, the justices suggested it was a collective right, not an individual right to bear arms. This is the first time the court has defined the amendment so definitively.

The two sides in this case viewed the Founding Fathers' intentions very differently. The majority of the justices said the amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that firearm for lawful purposes, such as self-defense in the home. The dissenting justices said the amendment protects only the right to possess and carry a firearm in connection with militia service.

""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapons whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. But it did allow for individuals to have guns for lawful purposes, such as hunting and defending themselves, he said. The majority clearly saw the individual right to own a gun.

Other Restrictions Remain

The ruling will leave intact many of the restrictions in place at the federal and state level, such as bans on a felon's right to keep a gun, and bans on assault weapons and sawed-off shotguns.

But Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissent, said that the ruling leaves it to future courts to define the actual details of the right to bear arms. This should be the business of state legislatures, he said, and the court should stay out of it. Law-abiding citizens will be permitted to keep guns at home, but that doesn't address how state legislatures might want to regulate or curb gun ownership.

The court also struck down Washington's requirement that firearms be equipped with trigger locks.

In a separate dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said, ""In my view, there simply is no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the Second Amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime-ridden urban areas.""

Mixed Reactions

The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision.

""Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,"" he said. He also took a thinly veiled shot at the presumptive Democratic nominee, Sen. Barack Obama.

""Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness, today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right — sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly.""

Obama signaled his approval of the ruling in a statement Thursday.

""Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country,"" he said, adding that ""what works in Chicago may not work in Cheyenne,"" but the decision reinforced that ""if we act responsibly, we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe.""

Gun rights supporters hailed the decision. ""I consider this the opening salvo in a step-by-step process of providing relief for law-abiding Americans everywhere that have been deprived of this freedom,"" said Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association.

The NRA said it will file lawsuits in San Francisco, Chicago and several of its suburbs challenging handgun restrictions there based on Thursday's outcome.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a leading gun control advocate in Congress, criticized the ruling: ""I believe the people of this great country will be less safe because of it,"" she said.

D.C.'s Law

The capital's gun law was among the nation's strictest.

Dick Anthony Heller, 66, an armed security guard, sued the district after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his home for protection in the same Capitol Hill neighborhood as the court.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in Heller's favor and struck down Washington's handgun ban, saying the Constitution guarantees Americans the right to own guns and that a total prohibition on handguns is not compatible with that right.

The issue caused a split within the Bush administration. Vice President Dick Cheney supported the appeals court ruling, but others in the administration feared it could lead to the undoing of other gun regulations, including a federal law restricting sales of machine guns. Other laws keep felons from buying guns and provide for an instant background check.

Scalia said nothing in Thursday's ruling should ""cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons or the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.""

The law adopted by Washington's city council in 1976 bars residents from owning handguns unless they had one before the law took effect. Shotguns and rifles may be kept in homes if they are registered, kept unloaded and either disassembled or equipped with trigger locks.

Opponents of the law have said it prevents residents from defending themselves. The district says no one would be prosecuted for a gun law violation in cases of self-defense.

Switzerland has an entrenched gun culture that is embraced by most of its 8 million citizens, some of them as young as 10 years old.

Every Swiss community has a shooting range, and depending on who is counting, the alpine country ranks third or fourth in the number of guns per capita.

""You can walk into a cafe in a town where there is a shooting festival and you'll see rifles hanging on the hat rack. It's just incredible. It's just proliferation all over the place, but it's all for a peaceful purpose,"" says Stephen Halbrook, a Virginia-based lawyer who has argued cases for the National Rifle Association.

Halbrook, who has written books on Swiss history, is a frequent visitor to Switzerland and takes part in shooting contests there.

At a shooting range in the town of Dielsdorf outside Zurich, school-aged children like 11-year-old Greta Wolff are introduced to target shooting, a popular Swiss sport.

The sixth-grader — who immigrated to Switzerland with her family from Germany, where guns are far more restricted — is one of the best shots at a recent practice session. She and the other children use air guns to learn proper handling and technique before graduating to real guns.

Firing a gun was easier to learn than playing the piano, says Greta, who is also an accomplished swimmer: ""You have to be sure you stand still and breathe properly before you release the trigger.""

Her father, Markus Wolff, who also shoots for sport, says his daughter first learned to shoot more than 18 months ago after seeing her older brother do it.

Their enthusiasm is music to the ears of Rene Koller, a Swiss army veteran and collector who owns hundreds of guns and heads youth training at the Zurich Shooting Sports Association.

""These days there are too many hobbies available,"" Koller says. ""We have to work hard to get children to take up shooting sports.""

Lower Death Rate Than In The U.S.



But the Swiss — like Americans — are grappling with the question of gun control these days after shooting attacks like one on Feb. 27 that killed four people in a factory outside Lucerne.

Firearm deaths in Switzerland take place at just one-seventh the rate that they occur in the United States. But researchers say guns are often used in suicides and crimes of passion in Switzerland.

Interest in gun ownership is waning, partly due to the shrinking size of the conscripted militia that serves as Switzerland's army. Men between the ages of 20 and 30 report for training and are issued military weapons, which they keep at home.

It's a tradition that some historians say kept the Nazis from trying to overrun Switzerland during World War II.

Gun control advocates argue Swiss authorities have lost track of too many of these military-issued guns, which account for most of the 2.5 million-plus guns in Switzerland.

As well, says Susan Peter, who is the director of the Zurich Women's Shelters Association, one-fifth of her clients report being threatened with guns kept at home by their male spouse or partner.

""It's not a private problem when someone in the family is killed, it's a public problem,"" she says. ""The Swiss government has the responsibility to protect people.""

There's also pressure on the Swiss government to adhere to the Schengen agreement. The accord opens borders between 26 European countries, but makes buying and owning guns more difficult than the Swiss are used to.

In Europe, ""there is a mandate to register all guns and to have a central electronic registration,"" explains Halbrook, the Virginia-based lawyer. ""Germany just announced it was the first to do so — that was on Jan. 1 this year — and others are supposed to follow suit.""

Pro-, Anti-Gun Lobbies Spar

Strengthened by local shooting attacks and Swiss research on violence, a growing anti-gun movement in Switzerland is also pushing for increased gun control.

Marcel Zwahlen, a professor of epidemiology, was one of the key researchers on a study presented recently by the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern.

The study reviewed 158 Swiss murders and suicides that took place between 1991 and 2008. It found 90 percent of the cases involved firearms.

Zwahlen says that owning a gun in Switzerland is easier than owning dogs or cars — but shouldn't be.

""It's OK to regulate how you are allowed to have it, how you should use it and that this gets checked,"" he says.

Lawyer Hanspeter Uster agrees. The former justice minister from the Swiss canton, or state, of Zug was shot in the chest by a gunman who stormed the regional assembly there in September 2001. The assailant killed 14 people before turning the gun on himself.

It's certainly important that all these weapons are secured, legally speaking, Uster says.

""Having them registered in each Swiss state and having those states share the data is also important,"" he says. ""We need laws passed to make this happen as well as a committed government.""

But the Swiss equivalent of the NRA, ProTell, rejects any new restrictions. Named after Swiss folk hero William Tell, who used a crossbow to target his enemies, the group argues that there are plenty already, including a crackdown in the past 18 months on the purchase and transport of ammunition.

""You can't register weapons that are in the hands of criminals so it doesn't help you prevent a tragedy, you know?"" says ProTell Vice President Hermann Suter. He, like many Swiss, blame local gun violence on criminals from other countries, as well as the mentally ill who aren't supposed to own guns.

The majority of Swiss voters appear to agree that gun control is not the way forward. In February 2011, nearly 57 percent of them voted against storing military-issued guns in armories rather than at home. The reason? Suter says they saw it as undermining trust in Swiss soldiers."

The lead designer of the world's most popular firearm has died. Mikhail Kalashnikov, who helped invent the AK-47, was 94. David Greene talks to New York Times reporter C.J. Chivers, and author of The Gun, about the myths surrounding Kalashnikov and the weapon he made famous.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

1947 was the year the most notorious weapon in history was born. That is the Avtomat Kalashnikov, or AK-47. Today, millions of them - maybe 100 million - are in use. The man who helped bring the weapon to the world - Mikhail Kalashnikov - has now died, at age 94.

Joining me now is C.J. Chivers. He's a reporter for The New York Times and author of ""The Gun,"" a book about the AK-47. Chris, welcome back to the program.

C.J. CHIVERS: Thanks very much for having me.

GREENE: Can you tell me how you define Mikhail Kalashnikov's role in history?

CHIVERS: Well, there's sort of two takes on that. The one is a very popular take - that, you know, a light bulb went off in his head and he then, you know, through this momentary epiphany, sat down at a workbench and developed the weapon that became the most abundant firearm ever made.

It's really a lot more complicated than that. He was part of a state-directed design process where a lot of different people's ideas came together, and then his name was lent to it. And then he spent the next several decades, you know, essentially promoting the weapon, and refining the weapon with other design teams.

And sort of died yesterday a folk hero in Russia, and for much of the world. But also a little more complicated than that, in that there are a large number of people who see him as someone who lent his name to a killing machine and didn't show a whole lot of remorse.

GREENE: Yeah. A killing machine that, I mean, is used in conflicts everywhere. It's used by gangsters. I mean, can you just remind us - give us a sense how prolific this weapon really is.

CHIVERS: Well, no one really knows the precise numbers because this weapon was made in many countries; almost all of them secretive governments living in secretive times, and most of the transfers have been nontransparent. But there is this strong sense somewhere on the order of 100 million of these have been made.

GREENE: A lot of guns.

CHIVERS: A lot more than any standing army ever needed. And there's peculiar reasons for that. It's not just that the rifle was a well-conceived piece for what it was intended to do. It's that its production was hooked up to planned economies, and so it was made whether anyone ordered or bought them - or not.

GREENE: Well, is there something about it that makes it so popular, compared to other guns that might be available?

CHIVERS: There's a lot of things. I mean, its essential features are a compromise of many different firearms that come together in a way that make it very easy to use. It was well-conceived, and it's designed to be very reliable. I mean, it gets knocked on a lot for not being a very good-looking rifle, for the people who care about those things. But in practical terms, it was produced to very good standards.

It has excellent chrome finish on the inside, and an exterior coating that resisted rust. And all of these things came together to make it long-lasting. And you add that into the raw numbers of them that were made, and then were made by, you know, brittle states that in many cases fell apart and lost custody of their weapons, or were cash starved and sold them; and between the abundance and its own inherent qualities, it's a natural to show up in most anyplace where there's a war.

GREENE: You mentioned that Mikhail Kalashnikov does not feel remorse. I mean, given this legacy of death from this weapon, explain that emotion to me.

CHIVERS: He's a pretty complicated figure, with a very complicated past. He was born a peasant and as a child, his family suffered under the collectivization programs of the Soviet Union. And his family was driven to Siberia, and their home was burned to the ground. And his father died in the first winter in Siberia; his brother was in prison for seven years. And he rose to this pretty incredible ascension inside the Soviet arms bureaucracy. The same system that had destroyed his family was the system that rewarded him. So he did express remorse, at times. But other times, it was more than tempered with a pretty fierce pride in what he'd helped create.

GREENE: C.J. Chivers is a reporter for The New York Times, and also author of the book ""The Gun,"" about the AK-47, and we were talking to him about the death of Mikhail Kalashnikov. C.J., thanks so much for joining us.

CHIVERS: Thanks for having me.

David Strickroth does steady business at High Impact Tactical Firearms in Upland, Calif. It's a small shop, as gun shops go, with several dozen firearms hanging on the olive green walls and sitting in a glass display case below. He typically sells one or two guns a day.

Recently, though, things have picked up: ""Now I'm selling six or seven a day,"" Strickroth says.

The reason? Strickroth uses the word ""panic,"" but describes it more as angst that gun owners and would-be owners are feeling over the rhetoric of the presidential election, the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency and the potential for more regulation in California — a state that already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country.

""Doesn't matter what side somebody's on,"" Strickroth says. ""It's just that what's said [during the election] generates an angst in people that makes folks either feel 'I've got to get rid of this' or 'I've got to go get me one.' ""

That angst is not just limited to the Golden State, though.

The FBI processed more than 2.3 million background checks nationally last month — those background checks being the best available proxy for gun sale numbers. That was the most ever for the month of October and an increase of more than 350,000 background checks compared to the same month last year.

Gun shops around the country are seeing record sales. Others are offering pre-election sales. Major gun manufacturers Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. are reporting huge jumps in earnings. In its earnings report, Sturm, Ruger & Co. wrote that the ""stronger-than-normal industry demand during the summer [was] likely bolstered by the political campaigns for the November elections.""

As large as the recent surge in gun sales is, the trend is not new. Gun and ammunition sales jumped sharply after both of the last presidential elections, fueled by fears that an Obama presidency would lead to restricted access to firearms. Sales have also jumped following mass shootings and moments when gun control rises to the top of the national conversation.

October marked the 18th month in a row that the number of FBI background checks set a monthly record, putting 2016 on track to shatter the previous annual record.

Sales and angst have ramped up in recent weeks as the election grows closer.

The National Rifle Association has spent more than $26 million on advertising promoting Republican nominee Donald Trump and warning against Clinton, according to The Wall Street Journal. Most of those ads have been directed at swaying voters' opinions in battleground states like North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. One of the more recent ads shows a woman reaching for a gun case during a break-in, only to have it disappear.

""Hillary Clinton could take away her right to self-defense,"" a voice in the ad says. ""And with Supreme Court justices, Hillary can. Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.""

Clinton, for her part, has denied those accusations repeatedly on the campaign trail.

Her campaign has promised to expand background checks for gun sales; to keep guns from the hands of violent criminals, domestic abusers and the severely mentally ill; and to oppose the gun lobby. She has also promised to address gun deaths. But Clinton has refuted claims that she would do away with the Second Amendment.

""I respect the Second Amendment,"" Clinton said in the last presidential debate. ""I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with reasonable, common-sense regulation.""

Strickroth, the California gun store owner, says that many people are not convinced. He hears from gun owners and enthusiasts who are afraid that they'll lose their right to own certain types of firearms if Clinton becomes president.

Personally, he doesn't believe that will happen. Strickroth is no fan of Clinton and won't be voting for her on Tuesday, but he says that any restrictions on people's Second Amendment rights will ""eventually [get] to the court and the court will say, 'No, you can't do that,' "" he says.

He references the uproar and fear that followed the 1968 Gun Control Act and the last two presidential elections and gestures around his gun shop. ""I'm still here,"" he says."

Wyoming has the highest per capita suicide rate in the nation. Guns are also a big part of everyday life: The state has one of the highest rates of gun ownership.

It's not hard to find someone in the state who's been directly affected by a suicide in which guns were the lethal means. BJ Ayers has not one but two of those very tragic stories, and she has turned her grief into action.

""I got involved, I guess, volunteering, or ... just learning about suicide after Brett's death. And then when Beau died in August of 2009 — he was 26 — I just really felt compelled to do something,"" she says.

She started a suicide prevention nonprofit called the Grace For 2 Brothers Foundation. It's named after Brett, her 19-year-old son who took his own life in 2005; and Beau, her oldest son, who killed himself in 2009. Both shot themselves.

""I can say, 'Woulda, coulda, shoulda,' or ... 'If only.' But I can't go back and do that,"" she says. ""I think it's very important for people to realize that having that access to a firearm can be very tragic, and in our family, it was.""

Suicide isn't easy to talk about. In a state like Wyoming, its connection to guns makes it even tougher.

""It's not that we want to take the gun away from the gun owner,"" Ayers says. ""We know that we have responsible gun owners in Wyoming. Wyoming is a gun state. We're rich in that history.""

But the simple fact is a gun is used in about three-quarters of all suicides in the state. Nationally, guns are used about 50 percent of the time. Yet in Wyoming, Ayers says, you have to divorce guns and suicide.

""I think gun control is at one end of a very long table, and access to lethal means is at the other end of that very long table, and I think they're two different things,"" she says.

Ayers says suicide prevention has to be focused on firearm safety. That is, requiring that locks be included with all gun purchases. Much of her work is also in education. She stresses to people that guns should be locked away in homes, and she teaches everyone how to talk to people who may be suicidal, and get them immediate help. She's not alone in the effort.

YouTube

A broad suicide-prevention campaign launched recently by the Wyoming Department of Health includes dramatic public service announcements. Ayers and her story are also featured prominently in a series of Web videos. She also tells her story traveling around the state as one of Wyoming's four suicide-prevention coordinators.

Ayers says the suicide problem is starting to be talked about more. And for Ayers, that talk is not just about the tough subject of access to guns. Her son Brett refused to get help when he was battling his mental illness.

""I think we have a cultural norm here in Wyoming, where, for lack of a better word, you know, 'Cowboy up ... Be tough,' "" she says. ""It's not OK to get help, and that's what we want to break. We want to break that stigma and realize that it's OK.""

One way Grace For 2 Brothers is trying to break that stigma is through an annual suicide-prevention walk in Cheyenne. The first one in 2010 drew a crowd of a couple hundred. Next month, Ayers expects more than 700 people."

Firearms have been in the news again as calls for increased gun control measures resurface. But the gun industry has been going through it own ups and downs — just last week when firearms giant Remington said it would file for bankruptcy. And they aren't the only company facing increasingly difficult challenges as market demands shift.

Michael Cargill owns and operates Central Texas Gun Works, a gun store in Austin.

He shows a Ruger 308, saying ""these were very difficult to get while Obama was in office.""

His inventory is fully stocked, a far cry from how it was a few years ago, when he'd have to beg and plead with manufacturers to get him the inventory when the demand was high. Now the tide has turned.

""Now they are offering wonderful deals,"" Cargill says. ""You buy six of these you get one gun free.""

Cargill says he still moves a lot of product, but the prices are lower than they were before, and that has to be hurting the manufacturer. It all goes back to a boom in the industry that started nearly a decade ago, when sales that hit a 60-year high.

Jurgen Brauer, an emeritus professor of economics at Augusta University in Georgia who studies the arms market, says the rise in gun sales during the last decade is unprecedented.

""We go from about 1,000 weapons per 100,000 people per year, to just about 3,000 weapons per 100,000 people per year. So that's a tripling of the market in the last 10 or 12 years. That's a dramatic increase,"" Brauer says.

And Brauer's analysis lines up with what the federal government has seen. According to the FBI, 8 million background checks for firearm purchases were run in 2005. That number skyrocketed to 25 million in 2017. Analysts concluded the sales boom was this perfect storm — a mixture of regulatory fears on the part of buyers, military technology trickling into the civilian gun market, and also consumers simply having more buying power in the aftermath of a recession.

""Part of it, certainly after the financial crisis had ended is recovery of the U.S. economy. So incomes are recovering and its only to be expected as people have more disposable income that people buy all kinds of things, and if you are interested in firearms you buy firearms,"" Brauer says.

And the gun industry reaped the benefits: The National Shooting Sports Foundation released a report showing that between 2008 and 2016, the arms and ammunition industry saw an 81 percent increase in jobs, and a 137 percent increase in wages for workers.

But all is not well in the firearms market. Gun companies have recently seen a sharp decline in sales something many refer to as the ""Trump slump."" Robert Farago, a gun enthusiast and blogger for the website The Truth About Guns, says gun companies made a critical mistake during 2016.

""The gun manufacturers ramped up production,"" he says. ""They figured this is it – the motherlode we are gonna get another one just like we did the Obama surge. We are gonna get a Hillary surge. It didn't happen.""

""So you put those two together, you have a 40 percent increase in production and a 20 percent decrease in demand and you have sliding prices and you also have people buying guns who say 'I've had enough now, I've bought enough guns,' so the market has gone down because of that.""

And financial reports show this pretty clearly. The stock price for American Outdoors, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, was at a five-year highs right before the 2016 election. Since then, the company's stock has plummeted by nearly 70 percent. Ruger, another gun manufacturer, followed a similar trajectory, with its stock dropping by 40 percent in the same time period.

This has caused some companies to explore lines of business other than firearms, such as clothing, camping equipment and firearm accessories. One salvation for gun companies is the market for highly-regulated items, such as short-barrel rifles and suppressors. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives requires hefty amounts of paperwork for buyers of these items. James Willi, an attorney in Austin, specialized in helping customers with that paperwork. It soon turned into a business.

""Some of the dealers started seeing my work, and they started asking me if I wouldn't mind occasionally doing a gun trust for one of their customers,"" Willi says. ""And occasionally the phone would ring. And then little by little the phone would begin to ringing and more dealers started asking if I didn't mind doing trusts for their customers as well.""

The ATF keeps tabs on items like suppressors. In 2014, about 600,000 suppressors were registered. Last year that number ballooned to over 1,300,000. Willi says however that it's still a small market for companies to rely on.

Meanwhile, the firearms industry is hoping to mitigate some of those barriers for potential customers. Last year a bill known as the Hearing Protection Act was introduced in the House of Representatives. That law would make it easier to buy suppressors. Likewise, companies have recently found a way to work around a ban on short-barrel rifles by creating an accessory that, once attached to a gun, technically classifies the weapon as a handgun.

A Florida vacation got off to an odd start for Judith Fleissig, 58, of Rochester, N.Y., when she and her daughter realized the car they'd rented had an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. More oddness followed: The gun was left there by the wife of Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill, police say.

Fleissig and her daughter rented the Nissan Rogue in South Florida on Jan. 4. Only hours earlier, it had been rented and returned by Lauren Tannehill, reports Florida's Sun-Sentinel, citing a Broward County sheriff's report.

The Miami Dolphins have told the newspaper that the couple views the incident as a personal matter.

The AR-15 is often called the civilian version of the military M-16, as NPR's Ailsa Chang reported in a profile on the weapon last June.

""This is certainly the kind of item you don't want to forget anywhere, but forgetting isn't a crime,"" Broward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Keyla Concepcion tells The Miami Herald.

And unlike a GPS, the rifle is not on the list of equipment options for vehicles rented from E-Z Rent-A-Car, where Fleissig picked up the car at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport complex.

The Sun-Sentinel says Fleissig and her daughter, who was also in town to interview for a job, had been driving the Rogue around with a powerful gun onboard for a couple of days before they realized there was a bag in the SUV's rear compartment.

Fleissig tells the newspaper they intended to contact the owner themselves when they opened the bag, which she says had no ID tag.

Her daughter opened the bag and said, "" 'Oh my God, it's a gun,' "" Fleissig says. ""I said, 'I think I'm going to throw up.' ""

""We got out of the car; we were kind of freaked out. I didn't want to touch it. I took a picture, zipped it back up and went to the police station. They came out and took it. ""[I thought] 'this vacation is getting better and better.' ""

The rental company told the pair to give the gun, valued at an estimated $2,000, to police. The company also says it cleans cars between rentals as a matter of routine.

It seems that the Tannehills only used the Rogue for a couple of hours before deciding to return it for a different vehicle.

The Sun-Sentinel reports:

""The gun is legally owned by Ryan Tannehill, and the couple immediately called the rental car company to report a missing item and was given 'the run around,' but the couple didn't specify what was lost in the bag, a source said.""

It's not yet clear whether the Tannehills have claimed the gun from the police. As The Sun-Sentinel reports, Lauren Tannehil's Twitter feed includes photos of the couple firing rifles — though seemingly not an AR-15 — at a shooting range."

The shooting in San Bernardino has focused attention on a ""loophole"" gun manufacturers use to get around weapons bans. It's the target of some lawmakers, but AR-15 owners say the gun is misunderstood.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Assault-style rifles including the AR-15 are under scrutiny again after recent mass shootings. They were used by the gunman in Newtown, Conn., and more recently Roseburg, Ore., and San Bernardino. AR-15s, in particular, are often called America's gun. They're some of the most popular rifles in the country, especially when it comes to sports shooting. NPR's Kirk Siegler has been talking with AR-15 enthusiasts and filed this report.

KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: The A-R in the AR-15 actually stands for Armalite, not assault rifle, as it's sometimes mistaken for. Armalite was one of the first companies to develop AR-15s in the late 1950s. And pretty much ever since, sales have been robust, especially in states like Florida that place few restrictions on them.

AARON GANN: Very common, very easy to use, you know. It's good for new shooters. It's very safe. It's easy to make safe for storage.

SIEGLER: Aaron Gann (ph) lives near Tampa, where he's a nursing student. He's been shooting for sport and hunting since he was a kid growing up in Texas.

GANN: I shoot this weapon a lot just for target. I enjoy shooting for target, then also nostalgia from being in the military.

SIEGLER: Gann was deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq in the Army. He is a gun enthusiast, make no mistake. And like a lot of self-described Second Amendment advocates, he thinks there's a lot of misperception around rifles such as the AR-15.

GANN: Unfortunately, the media likes to try to make it as some kind of high-power assault rifle. But actually the bullet that it uses is mainly used for what they call varmint hunting, like groundhog and coyote. It's not super powerful. You can go to any range, and it's safe to use.

SIEGLER: And Gann bristles when right after mass shootings like Newtown or San Bernardino, there's this rush of criticism around AR-15s. In San Bernardino, he says, no one was there to stop the shooters, so it wouldn't have mattered even if they had just had handguns.

Now, California is one of six states that, for the most part, bans all assault-style weapons including AR-15s. So how was it that the guns used in San Bernardino were purchased legally at a gun store nearby?

ARI FREILICH: Unfortunately, gun manufacturers have attempted to infiltrate California's market, despite the clear spirit and intent of California's voters, by introducing California-compliant assault weapons is what they're called.

SIEGLER: Ari Freilich is a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. He says some gun manufacturers have gotten around California's 1989 assault weapons ban with what he calls the bullet button loophole.

Basically, California compliant means you can't just use your finger to detach and reload a magazine. You need a separate tool to push a separate button. This creates a lag time to reload. But Freilich and other gun control advocates want California lawmakers to close this loophole when they reconvene next year.

FREILICH: They are military-style weapons for a reason. They are designed for and intended to allow the shooter to kill as many human beings as possible in as short as time as possible.

SIEGLER: Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a similar effort two years ago, even as other so-called blue states like Connecticut and Maryland had moved to ban the AR-15s after the Newtown massacre. The gun debate is so complex and cuts across party lines in red or blue states. Just take Mike Freeland (ph). He lives in Tulsa. He owns several AR-15 and loves building them.

MIKE FREELAND: For a good part of the country, it's - shooting is just part of the culture.

SIEGLER: Freeland says he doesn't identify politically with what he calls the stereotypical gun owner. He leans left, but he also doesn't think banning AR-15s or other guns is the way to go.

FREELAND: Yeah, I think the AR-15, for incidents like we hear way too often - I think it's just the availability of it.

SIEGLER: He wants to see tighter restrictions on buying guns in first place. He talked to people on both sides of this debate, and if nothing else, it seems like there's this general agreement on one thing. There's a huge appetite for a broader conversation on gun violence that cuts past the rhetoric. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Los Angeles.

""With recent events and political environment, these weapons will be harder to get a hold of."" ""This is what your AR-15 dreams it could be when it grows up."" ""I can meet ... near the FL Mall in Orlando or any other time."" ""Cash is king.""

These classified advertisements for semi-automatic weapons were listed this week on Armslist, a website where anyone can advertise a firearm they'd like to sell, and anyone can contact a seller with an offer to buy. The site is legal. But there's no way to know whether buyers and sellers who meet through Armslist are following federal, state or local background check rules.

We wanted to see how many semi-automatic firearms — defined here as handguns and rifles able to rapidly fire a large number of bullets, one shot per trigger pull, without having to reload — can be currently found on Armslist, and how quickly new listings appear. This provides a window into the difficulty of regulating access to a type of weapon frequently used in mass shootings.

Omar Mateen, the Orlando mass shooter, used semi-automatic weapons. So did the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, the San Bernardino killers, and at least 70 percent of shooters listed in a database of all mass shootings in America since 1982 compiled by Mother Jones.

Our data analysis shows that semiautomatic weapons comprised at least 1 in 4 firearms listed on Armslist in the days following the Orlando shootings.

Those shooters acquired their firearms in a variety of ways, and there's no evidence that any of them used Armslist. But this site, and others like it, are coming under increased scrutiny by law enforcement, gun control advocates, and researchers as debate over access to these kinds of weapons heats up.

In October, New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs subpoenaed Armslist for transaction and advertising records. ""Through this investigation into Armslist, DCA is stepping up and doing its part to keep our city safer for every New Yorker — civilians and officers alike,"" NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time.

We analyzed data on all firearms currently advertised at Armslist, and found that in the four days following the mass shooting in Orlando — from Sunday, June 12, through Wednesday, June 15 — 15,500 unique new listings for all types of firearms were posted to the site; 3,625 — or about 1 in 4 — were listed as semi-automatic weapons by the seller; more than 2,000 firearms were not categorized by weapon type.

This chart shows how many of these listings were posted, by state:

Armslist, often described as ""the Craigslist for guns,"" doesn't vet sales arranged through its website, and its existence is legal. Its terms of use say users have to follow all laws, federal or otherwise, and that it's ""the sole responsibility of the buyer and seller to conduct safe and legal transactions.""

We tried to reach Armslist for response to this story but did not hear back.

There's no federal law requiring a private gun owner to run a background check before selling someone a gun. At least 18 states (and the District of Columbia) have their own laws for private firearms sales, and some require background checks in some cases. So do some cities. But — and more on this in a bit — there's evidence that not all private buyers and sellers follow the rules. Illegal sales happen, and currently, there's no way to stop them.

Armslist isn't the only site of its kind, though it is considered to be the biggest and most popular. All ads are listed in the U.S. But there's no way of knowing exactly how many sales are arranged through sites like Armslist each year. ""We aren't able to track those,"" says Corey Ray, a spokesman at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Gun sales are tracked through applications for background checks, but since private sellers don't have to run background checks, they can't be counted that way. Under federal law, private sellers can't sell to someone they know — or someone whom they suspect — wouldn't pass a background check, but they don't have to verify it either way. And unlike federally licensed dealers, like gun shops, they don't have to keep sales records or ask to see permits, either.

In October, Harvard researchers surveyed 2,000 gun owners and found that roughly 40 percent got their most recent gun without submitting to a background check. That finding lines up with an earlier survey from 1994.

Our Armslist analysis showed that, on average, about 3,800 new ads were posted on the site each day since the mass shooting in Orlando. On average, 900 of those each day were advertised as semi-automatics. It should be noted that gun sales tend to rise immediately after mass shootings, so this may be higher than usual. But a 2013 New York Times analysis of three months of listings estimated that 20,000 new ads were posted on the site each week.

Gun shops and other vendors ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms — meaning they have to run background checks — can also advertise through Armslist. But in our analysis, 75 percent of all sellers were listed as ""private.""

It should be noted that one investigation into Armslist found that nearly 30 percent of its private gun ads were listed by ""high-volume"" sellers, i.e. people who seemed to be ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms but operating without a license.

So, who buys firearms at sites like Armslist? It's impossible to know for sure, since Armslist doesn't require users to create an account through the site or divulge any personal information to post ads, browse listings, and contact other users. In our analysis, 2,634 listings — 17 percent — were created by users who haven't registered on the site (though registered users don't have to divulge personal information, either).

There are lots of reasons someone might look for a gun through Armslist: to save money, to hunt for hard-to-find models, to buy directly from the current owner. These sites can also appeal to people who might have a hard time legally acquiring a weapon at a gun store, or even through online gun retailers like Grab a Gun or auction sites like GunBroker — all required to run background checks.

On its website, Grab a Gun details the six-step process all buyers have to go through to buy a gun there.

Grab a Gun/Screen shot by NPR

But using Armslist, sellers and buyers don't have to go through this process. As Alex Yablon at the investigative gun news site The Trace, which aims to reduce gun violence, puts it, ""If you think of online gun stores as being like Amazon and online gun auctions as like eBay, then sales arranged online but conducted in person are like Craigslist. And like transactions arranged on Craigslist, they are essentially beyond regulation.""

Of course, most people using Armslist and other sites like it are there to purchase guns legally, and intend to use their guns legally and responsibly. Some of the semi-automatic weapons currently listed on Armslist wouldn't be very useful in combat or an assault situation, and are valued mostly by collectors and hobbyists.

Our examination of Armslist listings found a number of sellers who say they will only complete the sale at an ""FFL"" — a federally licensed dealer, usually a gun shop, where the buyer's background check can be run on the spot.

Law Breaking Down Gun Terminology Amid New Debate Over Gun Control Breaking Down Gun Terminology Amid New Debate Over Gun Control Listen · 3:21 3:21

""Will only meet at local FFL to complete transfer. No hand to hand transactions will be done,"" writes one seller advertising a .223/5.56 caliber Colt AR-15. Some sellers refuse to ship items, while others stipulate they'll only ship to licensed dealers. Others say they will need to see the buyer's permit to purchase or carry before making a sale.

But other listings are far more relaxed — or more desperate.

""I will travel very far to met [sic]. Asking $275 or OBO. Really looking to selling [sic] considering any serious offer,"" reads one current listing for a semi-automatic rifle.

""Forsale [sic] ar-15 300 blackout in good condition need to get rid of it to pay bill 750 obo,"" reads another.

A 2013 investigation by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that 3 percent of prospective buyers on Armslist had a criminal record that could have disqualified them from buying a gun.

That year, the New York Times traced one ""handgun wanted"" listing on the site back to a prospective buyer with ""a pair of felony convictions for burglary and another for motor vehicle theft, as well as a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction — all of which bar him from having guns."" This January, The Guardian found Armslist users willing to sell without a background check.

In its Terms of Use, Armslist states that buyers and sellers are responsible for ensuring that all transactions facilitated through the site are legal. It also lists the main phone number and website for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, for those who need to brush up on the rules. But during a 2011 NYPD undercover operation of Armslist and similar sites, in which investigators pretended to be buyers who stated they couldn't pass a background check, 62 percent of sellers they contacted said they were willing to sell them a gun anyway.

A handful of sales have ended in death. As Stephanie Mencimer at Mother Jonesreported in 2013, an NYPD investigation found that guns used in four murders, and one suicide, could be traced back to Armslist transactions.

And in 2012, a Wisconsin man named Radcliffe Haughton bought a pistol in a McDonald's parking lot from a seller he had met on Armslist. He had posted a ""gun wanted"" listing on Armslist three days after his wife acquired a restraining order against him for domestic violence — making it illegal for him to purchase a gun. He wrote:

""Looking to buy ASAP. Prefer full size, any caliber. Email ASAP. I constantly check my emails. Hoping it has a high mag capacity with the handgun, ammo, accessories. I am a serious buyer. Email me ASAP. Have cash now and looking to buy now. I am mobile.""

The next day, Haughton murdered his wife and two of her co-workers before killing himself.

In January, President Obama announced a new executive action on guns, saying he wants to close a ""loophole"" that makes it easy to buy guns online without a background check. But this plan would not affect private sellers at sites like Armslist. It calls for stronger enforcement of existing laws requiring anyone ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms to run background checks. But for an ordinary person looking to quickly trade a gun for cash, nothing would change under this plan.

Armslist released a statement following Obama's announcement, saying, ""Many, if not most, private sellers want to do background checks. Oftentimes, the reason they do not is because under the current system, their only recourse is to physically go to a licensed dealer and pay the dealer a fee to do the check. This is costly and burdensome."" The statement recommended making it possible for individuals to run background checks themselves, saying that ""would be a force multiplier and have a meaningful impact in reducing crime."" (ATF spokesman Corey Ray said that proposal brings up a number of security and privacy issues.)

Much has been made of the fact that Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, who purchased both of the weapons he used in his deadly rampage legally, was twice investigated by the FBI for suspected terrorist ties and statements, but didn't end up on the terrorist watchlist. Even if he had, Mateen could still have legally purchased his guns; terrorism suspects aren't prohibited from owning firearms. Now, some typically on opposite sides of the gun control debate are pushing to change that.

But even if Mateen were on the watchlist, and even if known terrorists were barred from purchasing weapons from licensed dealers, unregulated private sales — made easier through online marketplaces like Armslist — still could have enabled him to buy his weapons.

The Bushmaster semi-automatic assault rifle used in Friday's attack on an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., is a style of weapon used often in mass shootings. Melissa Block speaks with Malcolm Brady, retired assistant director of what was then known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, about the style of weapon and why it's so often linked to these tragedies.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

That weapon that David just mentioned, the AR-15, was not only used in last Friday's school shooting. It was also used this month by a gunman who killed shoppers at a mall in Oregon. And it was used back in July in the attack on a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The semiautomatic AR-15 is essentially a civilian version of the military's M-16. And it is, according to the NRA, the country's best-selling firearm.

To better understand its appeal to gun owners, we turn to Malcolm Brady. He's a retired assistant director with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. And he used to carry an AR-15 in the military.

MALCOLM BRADY: It probably is the best-selling weapon and it's probably because it's a very well-made weapon. They can fashion that weapon to pretty much be whatever you want it. You know, it can come in different colors. It can come with different magazines. It can come with different stocks. And it carries a very popular round that's easy to buy and it's not that expensive. The weapon has a, shall we say, a Rambo effect, just cool to carry.

BLOCK: You said not that expensive, what would the price range be?

BRADY: You can get a real knocked down model for probably for around 500. I mean, that is really a scaled-back model. Anything with good sights and good target pooling and magazines and stocks, it's going to run near a thousand dollars or more.

BLOCK: I have to ask you, Mr. Brady, you're talking about the coolness of a weapon that was just used to mow down 20 children.

BRADY: When I say cool, it's cool because a lot of dedicated people that are entitled to carry that weapon, and carried it in the military, would like to shoot it. They see it from the aspect of reliving their days in the military. That's when I say cool.

BLOCK: Do you think, Mr. Brady, that a shooting like we've seen will tarnish the reputation of this weapon, will make gun owners less likely to want to buy it?

BRADY: I think you'll see a very large increase in the people that want to buy it.

BLOCK: Really?

BRADY: And it may be for protection. It may be for the coolness. And it may be for the fact that people will be in fear that the weapon will be put back on a banned level, and they want to obtain it before it is banned again. But I think you will see the popularity of it and the purchase of them increase drastically, in between now and the holidays, near Christmas.

BLOCK: But let me go back to this notion that in the aftermath of this horrific shooting, where we have seen the faces of these children who were killed by this weapon, how can you say that that will actually increase sales?

BRADY: Because the people that will be buying them are buying them in the premise that: I can prevent that same thing happening at my house or my business or my location. Well, you know, I don't necessarily agree with it, but that's the perspective. And that's why I say you'll see an increase in the sale of these type weapons between now and the holidays.

BLOCK: In terms of the lethality of the AR-15, Mr. Brady, would this weapon be considered any more deadly, say, than the handguns that the shooter in Newtown was carrying, the Glock and the Sig Sauer?

BRADY: At the range that he shot this weapon and the amount, as I understand it, the amount of rounds that he used on each individual child, it would have made no difference if it were the Glock or the Sig Sauer.

BLOCK: I wonder, Mr. Brady, if this shooting at the school in Connecticut has made you rethink anything about this weapon; that you said as you yourself carried this in the military.

BRADY: Personally, I don't own one. I don't intend to ever own one. If I were a target shooter, maybe. But with all weapons - and I do have my own - I keep them under lock and key, as I did growing up. And I've taught safety to my children, which is paramount. And even to this day, if my son and I are looking at weapons, the first thing he does, and the first thing I do if it's put into my hand, is check it for safety factors. It's just hard to say, you know, if it will change or not. Myself, I would never own one of them. But I can understand why people would.

BLOCK: Malcolm Brady is a retired assistant director with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Mr. Brady, thank you.

BRADY: Thank you very much. Have a good day.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Ben Dickmann Courtesy of Ben Dickmann

Ben Dickmann has been hunting since he was a child. The 40-year-old Florida man enjoyed going out on the gun range to practice firing at targets and was the proud owner of an AR-57, a semi-automatic rifle.

But, after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student using a semi-automatic rifle, Dickmann, who lives just over 30 minutes away in Fort Lauderdale, did something unexpected.

Dickmann turned in his AR-57 to the sheriff's office and asked them to destroy it. He posted about it on Facebook, and that post has now gone viral. It's been shared more than 100,000 times.

Dickmann spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about his love of the firearm and why he decided to give it up.

Interview Highlights

On the decision to turn in his AR-57

It's come after a lot of soul searching. Everybody always says - you know, it's the big argument right now - everybody's offering thoughts and prayers but nothing else. And I thought, well, this is something I can do that I think is right. And it's something I can do that might spark a change. You know, my whole goal was maybe to inspire one friend on my Facebook page to do the same thing. And maybe that friend would inspire one other person. And who knows? I totally didn't expect for this to go the way it did and as fast as it did.

On the issue of obtaining a concealed carry/weapon permit

The concealed weapons permit program here in the state of Florida, as far as I'm concerned, is a joke. Literally, it's three hours of PowerPoint, and then you go down to the range with a very, very low caliber handgun, and you have to put five out of 10 rounds on a paper plate at 5 feet. Probably half the class that I had are people that had never touched a gun before in their life.

On the challenge to give up his AR-57

After Las Vegas, I had thought long and hard about it, and thought, well, you know, it's not hurting anything sitting in my gun safe here. But it wasn't really until this last tragedy at Stoneman Douglas where it really hit home with us - and me.

Actually, one of my friends on Facebook rather sarcastically said, well, if you really feel this way, why don't you go turn in your gun at Broward Sheriff's Office? I'll even drive you. And that's what spurred me to think. Even though he was being extremely sarcastic about it because he's a very staunch conservative, gun rights activist person, it kind of spurred me to say, you know what? Yeah, I'll do that.

On what he plans to do next

For me, to be honest, I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, and nothing that I had this grand master plan going into this for. So I'm happy that this sparked a debate and hopefully causes some action. I hope somebody - be it the students, be it the next generation - picks up the torch and does something.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images

Wal-Mart, thought to be the largest seller of firearms in the U.S., will stop selling military-style modern sporting rifles, such as the the AR-15, this fall.

Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said the decision to phase out the controversial semi-automatics was based in business, not politics, citing declining demand.

""If you have a product customers aren't buying, you phase it out,"" he said, according to Bloomberg.

He added that Wal-Mart shoppers ""were buying shotguns and rifles, and so we are increasing assortment in that.""

Lundberg tells NPR the move is happening now because of the change in seasons:

""As our Sporting Goods departments are resetting this week from Summer to Fall, the MSRs are being taking out of the assortment and replaced with new rifles and shotguns.""

The soon-to-be phased out AR-15 was used in several high-profile shootings over the past few years, including the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook school in Newton, Conn., and the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo. Gun control advocates support bans on these types of weapons and welcome Wal-Mart's decision to remove them from the shelves.

Spokeswoman Lori Haas from the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, based in Washington, D.C., praised Wal-Mart's decision.

""I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great signal that things are changing and that we have responsible citizens reacting to the gun violence in our country,"" Haas told NPR.

But while Haas embraced Wal-Mart's move, she questioned its claim that demand had indeed dropped. Wal-Mart does not disclose gun-sales figures.

""It would be lovely if there had been a decrease in demand,"" Haas said, adding, ""I would be very interested to learn of the gun manufacturer's sales.""

According to a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, Amy Hunter, the AR-15 is highly popular in the U.S.

""The AR-15 is America's most popular general use rifle,"" Hunter told NPR.

In Hunter's emailed statement, the NRA called Wal-Mart's recent move disappointing.

""While we're disappointed in Wal-Mart's decision, we appreciate the firearms retailers who continue to carry these firearms and enable law-abiding citizens to purchase the firearm of their choice.""

In 2006, Wal-Mart also cut back on gun sales, removing firearms from about a third of its stores, again chalking the decision up to ""diminished customer relevancy."" But then in 2011, it reintroduced guns to more stores around the country.

According to CNN Money, a Wal-Mart spokesman said at the time that the retail giant ""realized there is broader appeal for guns in some areas because of sporting needs.""

Wal-Mart will be selling the discontinued rifles at steeply discounted rates as it phases them out."

A North Carolina man pleaded guilty Friday to charges from an armed encounter within a Washington, D.C., pizzeria that was the focus of pernicious and baseless Internet rumors.

On Dec. 4, 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch entered the Comet Ping Pong restaurant and fired an AR-15 rifle into a door. The 28-year-old man told police that he had driven from his home in Salisbury, N.C., to ""self-investigate"" the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory that the restaurant was the site of a child sex-abuse ring involving powerful Democrats such as Hillary Clinton.

Welch was charged with illegally transporting firearms over state lines and assault with a dangerous weapon. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said in a statement that Welch will may receive far less time — likely a range of 18 to 24 months for the federal firearms charge and 18 to 60 months for the District of Columbia assault charge.

The statement goes on to read:

""According to the government's evidence, on Sunday, December 4, 2016,Welch transported three loaded firearms, together with ammunition, from North Carolina to Washington, D.C. The firearms included a 9mm AR-15 assault rifle loaded with approximately 29 rounds of ammunition, a fully-loaded, six-shot, .38-caliber revolver, and a loaded shotgun with additional shotgun shells. He drove directly to the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Connecticut Avenue in Northwest Washington. ... ""Upon arriving at the restaurant, Welch parked his car and armed himself. At about 3 p.m., he marched inside the restaurant, which was occupied by employees and customers, including children. He was carrying the AR-15 assault rifle and the revolver. He was carrying the AR-15 openly, with one hand on the pistol grip, and the other hand on the hand guard around the barrel, such that anyone with an unobstructed view could see the gun.""

Welch surrendered to law enforcement following the incident, but his armed entrance shocked the pizzeria's staff and management, already beleaguered by the fake news story.

Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis talked with NPR about the Internet rumors about a week before the incident:

""Well, it started when I was receiving many direct messages on Instagram and comments on my Instagram page. And I realized that something had come up. It turned out that there was a worldwide conspiracy theory ... based inside of Reddit and was being sent out through YouTube and Facebook and other places and that's sort of an insanely complicated, made-up, fictional lie-based story. This was a coordinated political attack. ... ""They would go into our social media accounts and they would take photographs that were on my Instagram of my friends' children or of my associates' children and post them around thousands and thousands of fake news sites and on Reddit and on YouTube and use these images of happily playing, innocent children as proof of some kind of human trafficking scheme led by the Clintons.""

Welch, who has been in custody since his arrest, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 22."

(This story last update at 4:00 p.m. ET)

Investigators in Santa Monica, Calif., were trying to piece together a motive in a shooting rampage in which four people were killed before police fatally shot the gunman.

The assailant, dressed in black and carrying a semi-automatic rifle, first shot and killed two men – believed to be his father and brother – at a home about a mile from Santa Monica College. Authorities were soon called to the burning home, but it wasn't immediately clear if the fire was arson.

Police say next the armed assailant carjacked a woman and ordered her to drive to the Santa Monica campus, where he shot at a bus, injuring three women. Authorities say their injuries were minor.

As he approached campus, the gunman fired on two people in an SUV. The vehicle crashed into a wall, killing the driver and seriously injuring the passenger, who doctors said was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, according to The Associated Press.

The gunman then exchanged fire with police before fatally shooting a woman outside the library.

Trena Johnson, a longtime administrative assistant working in the dean's office was quoted by the AP as saying she witnessed the library shooting. Looking out the window around noon on Friday, she described seeing a man with a ""very large gun.""

""We saw a woman get shot in the head,"" she said. ""I haven't been able to stop shaking.""

Police then exchanged gunfire with the suspect in the school's library, killing him.

Authorities say the gunman was carrying a canvas bag that included a rifle, a handgun and magazines of ammunition. A small cache of ammunition was also found at the house.

NPR's Sam Sanders reports that authorities have not identified the victims or the gunman, who they said was a white male in his 20s or 30s carrying an assault-style weapon.

Update at 4:00 p.m. ET. SUV Passenger's Prognosis 'Grim'; Suspect Had Attended College



Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said the condition of the passenger in the red Ford Explorer is ""grave"" and that her prognosis is ""grim.""

Seabrooks, speaking at a Saturday news conference, said the suspect had been enrolled at Santa Monica College as recently as 2010.

She said his identity could not be released until next of kin were notified — they ""may be out of the country,"" she said.

Seabrooks said police ""had contact"" with the suspect in 2006 but that he was a juvenile at the time, so she could not reveal details. She later said that Saturday would have been the suspect's 24th birthday.

The police chief says the gunman, who was armed with a .223 caliber semi-automatic ""similar to an AR-15."" tried to kill several people hiding in a safe room in the library and that it was ""remarkable"" that they were unhurt. She said the gunman was also wearing a ""load-bearing vest"" that was designed to take bullet-proof panels, but there were none in it.

She said the bag that he was carrying contained various clips and ammunition and that had he not been stopped, he could have fired some 1,300 rounds.

Update at 2:45 p.m. ET. Why The College?

The Los Angeles Times says police are trying to determine why the gunman wanted to go to the Santa Monica College campus.

The newspaper says the woman who was carjacked by the unidentified man, Laura Sisk, 41, said he specifically asked to be taken to the college.

""You're going to drive me to Santa Monica College and let me out,"" Sisk told the Times in an interview.

She said the man was dressed in black body armor and carried an AR-15 assault rifle.

Officials have been careful, however, not to characterize the rampage as a ""school shooting"" and to stress that while two people were killed on campus, the incident started elsewhere.

Update at 11:50 a.m. ET. Victim Identified

The driver of the vehicle who was killed has been identified as Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, according to police investigator, Joyce Kato.

Franco drove a red Ford Explorer that the gunman sprayed with bullets, killing him and wounding his passenger."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of TrackingPoint Courtesy of TrackingPoint

A new rifle goes on sale on Wednesday, and it's not like any other. It uses lasers and computers to make shooters very accurate. A startup gun company in Texas developed the rifle, which is so effective that some in the shooting community say it should not be sold to the public.

It's called the TrackingPoint rifle. On a firing range just outside Austin in the city of Liberty Hill, a novice shooter holds one and takes aim at a target 500 yards away. Normally it takes years of practice to hit something at that distance. But this shooter nails it on the first try.

The rifle's scope features a sophisticated color graphics display. The shooter locks a laser on the target by pushing a small button by the trigger. It's like a video game. But here's where it's different: You pull the trigger but the gun decides when to shoot. It fires only when the weapon has been pointed in exactly the right place, taking into account dozens of variables, including wind, shake and distance to the target.

The rifle has a built-in laser range finder, a ballistics computer and a Wi-Fi transmitter to stream live video and audio to a nearby iPad. Every shot is recorded so it can be replayed, or posted to YouTube or Facebook.

""Think of it like a smart rifle. You have a smart car; you got a smartphone; well, now we have a smart rifle,"" says company President Jason Schauble. He says the TrackingPoint system was built for hunters and target shooters, especially a younger generation that embraces social media.

""They like to post videos; they like to be in constant communication with groups or networks,"" Schauble says. ""This kind of technology, in addition to making shooting more fun for them, also allows shooting to be something that they can share with others.""

A team of 70 people spent three years creating the technology. Schauble says there's nothing else like it, even in the military. For civilians, TrackingPoint sells its high-end, long-range guns directly. With price tags of up to $22,000, they're not cheap.

One hunter who doesn't want one is Chris Wilbratte. He says the TrackingPoint system undermines what he calls hunting's ""fair chase.""

""It's the traditional shooting fish in a barrel or the sitting duck. I mean, there's no skill in it, right? It's just you point, you let the weapon system do its thing and you pull the trigger and now you've killed a deer. There's no skill,"" Wilbratte says.

This new rifle is being released as the gun control debate continues to simmer in Washington.

Chris Frandsen, a West Point graduate who fought in Vietnam, doesn't believe the TrackingPoint technology should be allowed in the civilian world. The gun makes it too easy for a criminal or a terrorist to shoot people from a distance without being detected, he says.

""Where we have mental health issues, where we have children that are disassociated from society early on, when we have terrorists who have political cards to play, we have to restrict weapons that make them more efficient in terrorizing the population,"" Frandsen says.

Schauble says because the company sells directly — instead of going through gun dealers — it knows who its customers are and will vet them. And he says there's a key feature that prevents anyone other than the registered owner from utilizing the gun's capabilities.

""It has a password protection on the scope. When a user stores it, he can password protect the scope that takes the advanced functionality out. So the gun will still operate as a firearm itself, but you cannot do the tag/track/exact, the long range, the technology-driven precision-guided firearm piece without entering that pass code,"" he says.

Schauble says demand has been ""overwhelming."" TrackingPoint now has a waiting list. Others are interested, too: Rifle maker Remington Arms wants to use the technology in rifles it wants to sell for around $5,000."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Claudiad/Getty Images/Vetta Claudiad/Getty Images/Vetta

Maybe money does grow on trees after all.

Households in several African countries grow more trees than scientists previously realized. And those trees may account for an average 17 percent of a farm's income, according to a study funded by the World Bank's Program on Forests and published online in January in Forest Policy and Economics.

""Trees play a really important role in farmers' lives,"" says lead author Daniel Miller of the University of Illinois. The impact of farmed trees has received relatively little attention because previous studies have focused either on trees in forests or other types of crops on farms.

Before beginning their project, Miller's team had to answer a basic question: What counts as a tree? The group decided to include ""any woody perennial with a trunk or elongated stem that supports branches and leaves."" This definition included fruit trees, trees grown for timber and shrubby cash crops like coffee and tea.

Next the scientists analyzed five African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda — all of which had interview data from national surveys on farmland use and household income. The surveys asked households to report all crops grown for economic reasons as well as the amount of money derived from each crop. The team then calculated the annual income (including non-agricultural sources like other wages and rental income) reported by each household, and the share that trees contributed.

Miller says he was surprised by how many households planted trees for economic purposes: Overall, 30 percent of landholder respondents said they grew trees on their land for agricultural reasons — like selling timber or fruit. ""This is actually an underestimate,"" says Miller, ""because these surveys were designed for agricultural purposes and didn't explicitly ask about all trees. The tree that the interviewee is sitting under to answer questions might not be taken into account.""

The trees in the survey supplied more than shade. Farm trees accounted for almost as large a share of annual income for farmers as forest trees do for people living near forests: 17 percent compared to 20 percent.

Because trees take time to grow, some farmers may be disinclined to invest in them, Miller says. But trees also have benefits. Many varieties are drought-resistant. Plus, they mitigate climate change by consuming carbon dioxide.

Trees were not equally popular across all countries. In Tanzania, 55 percent of farmers grew trees while only 16 percent did so in Nigeria. What's more, households led by women were less likely to grow trees than male-led households. This difference, Miller says, may underscore the importance of property law. Women, he conjectures, may worry about losing their land to men before their seedlings grow up to bear fruit.

But women particularly stand to benefit from trees grown for timber, because they often have to travel long distances to fetch firewood from forests, according to Alice Macharia, director for African programs at the Jane Goodall Institute, a community-based conservation nonprofit. The institute runs programs in Uganda and Tanzania to educate communities about the perks of cultivating trees and provides farmers with popular seedling varieties.

Macharia, who was not part of the study, says she was glad to see work highlighting the benefits of trees to farmers. Next, she said she would like to see research comparing the ability of different tree species to survive harsh conditions.

Miller's team also wants to understand more about how trees make money for their growers. Do they help people out of poverty? Or protect households from sliding into poverty during tough times? They hope to answer these questions in future research.

""What is the role of trees?"" asks Miller. ""We don't have good answers to that question. Stay tuned."""

NPR's Scott Simon talks with Georgetown University Asia expert Victor Cha about the global repercussions of the deadly nerve gas attack on Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea's dictator.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

A backchannel meeting between the United States and North Korea scheduled for March in New York City has been canceled after the U.S. withdrew the visa for North Korea's envoy. This follows the assassination of the half-brother of North Korea's leader, apparently by a lethal nerve gas. We are joined now by Victor Cha of Georgetown University.

Thanks very much for being with us.

VICTOR CHA: It's my pleasure.

SIMON: According to The Wall Street Journal, you were supposed to be part of those talks. Can you confirm that?

CHA: Well, there were supposed to be what are called track II talks that were going to take place sometime next month. But those are not going to happen now, I think, largely because of this - the finding that it was this VX nerve agent that was used in this assassination.

SIMON: VX, that's a chemical banned in most countries but in - not in North Korea. So presumably, this can be traced to North Korea.

CHA: Yes. North Korea's one of just a handful of countries that has not signed onto the CWC, the Chemical Weapons Convention. And they have a large stockpile of VX and other chemical weapons that they have as a part of their military hardware.

SIMON: So you can confirm for us, Professor Cha, that there were supposed to be talks between the Trump administration and North Korea. You were going to be in them. But there won't be talks now.

CHA: Well, I wouldn't say they were talks between the North Koreans and the Trump administration...

SIMON: The United States of America.

CHA: Right. Track II is largely academics and experts on the U.S. side, some former U.S. government officials from different administrations. On the North Korean side, reportedly, the head of their delegation would have been a foreign ministry official who is dual-hatted as a think tank person. So that person would have been coming, presumably, in a track - what we call 1.5 capacity.

SIMON: Yeah. Professor, what's there to talk about if North Korea wants nuclear weapons and the U.S. and much of the world don't want them to?

CHA: It's a really good question. I think the - part of the idea is to be able, at least try to get back to some sort of dialogue. We're in a cycle now of North Korean missile tests, this assassination attempt. And on the side of the rest of the world we're in a cycle of sanctioning and U.S.-ROK, U.S.-South Korean military exercises coming up next month. So when all those things are happening, I think most people want at least some sort of dialogue channel open. Otherwise things could escalate pretty quickly. And I think that's mainly the purpose of trying to keep a dialogue channel open.

SIMON: Yeah. But is there anything the world realistically can offer North Korea if they are really intent on getting nuclear weapons and chemical weapons?

CHA: Yeah. You know, it's a great question. I think that the core of the problem is that they say that they pursue these weapons out of insecurity. So the logical thing is can the world provide them some sort of security? And in past agreements that I have participated in, we provided them security guarantees and offered to negotiate a peace treaty with them. The problem is I think the security - insecurity that they feel is generated by the regime itself. You know, these sorts of totalitarian regimes never feel secure. And that's the core problem.

SIMON: Because there's mass starvation. There's mass poverty. There's mass oppression.

CHA: Right. And that they - all those things, and that they don't rule by the consent of the legitimacy of the people. And that's the basic problem.

SIMON: Yeah. China has a role in this?

CHA: Yes. China is both part of the solution, in terms of putting more pressure on North Korea, but they're also part of the problem because they still consider North Korea to be an ally. And they don't want to put so much pressure on the regime that they risk collapsing it. About 85 percent of North Korea's external trade is with China. So if they feel like they put too much pressure on, they could completely destabilize the regime. And that worries them because they don't want a collapsing Korean Peninsula on their border.

SIMON: Victor Cha is director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. Thanks so much for being back with us, professor.

CHA: Sure, it's my pleasure.

Malaysian authorities say initial autopsy results show a chemical weapon — VX nerve agent — was used in the fatal poisoning of Kim Jong Nam, older half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.

VX is an odorless substance that can exist as liquid or gas. It can kill within minutes if it's passed through the skin. It is 10 times more toxic than sarin and classified as a weapon of mass destruction.

Early last week, while Kim Jong Nam was traveling through the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, two women approached him, touched his face and held a cloth over it. He was able to walk to a help desk, which took him to an airport nurse area, but soon fell severely ill and died before making it to the hospital.

The women who approached him were caught on airport security cameras and captured within days of the attack. They are from Southeast Asian countries and are now in custody. But police believe the plot involved far more people than the two women. Authorities are seeking at least seven North Koreans, including a diplomat, in connection with the crime.

That VX nerve agent is responsible for Kim's death strengthens the claims made by South Korea that the North Korean regime ordered the hit. VX is man-made and not that difficult to produce, according to chemical weapons experts. But it tends to be used by state actors. For example, Saddam Hussein is believed to have used VX nerve agent on Kurdish citizens of Iraq in the 1980s.

South Korea last week blamed North Korea for the killing and called the rather public assassination a terrorist act. North Korean officials in Malaysia, meanwhile, were rejecting the autopsy's results before it was even concluded. And to add to all this drama, someone this week apparently tried to break into the morgue where Kim's body is being held. That incident is under investigation.

The body believed to be that of Kim Jong Nam has yet to be identified by next of kin, so Malaysia is refusing to release the remains. Malaysian authorities have asked the North Koreans to provide a DNA sample from a Kim family member. But North Korea is not cooperating.

The Malaysian police inspector general has been talking with the press this week, but not answering many questions, saying instead that a lot of answers reporters are seeking are ""subjects of the investigation."" Later he said that the investigation could last years.

npr32,npr,[],,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125184572,"World's Hottest Pepper: The Perfect Weapon?

The Indian military has announced plans to use the world's hottest pepper — otherwise known as the ghost chili — in a new series of smoke grenades used to combat terrorists. NPR's Melissa Block speaks to Joey Prado, owner of Chunky's Burgers in San Antonio, who has been using the pepper in his recipes and says it would make a perfect weapon.

MELISSA BLOCK, host:

The bhut jolokia, otherwise known as the ghost chili, is so powerful, so spicy that the Indian army wants to use it to fight terrorists. They're working on a stun grenade harnessing the power of the chili, which has been deemed the hottest pepper in the world at more than one million Scoville heat units. By comparison, a jalapeno might have a Scoville rating of 5,000.

Well, it turns out the ghost chili has been deployed for the last year and a half, not in a grenade but on a burger, at Chunky's Burgers in San Antonio, Texas, where Joey Prado is the owner.

Mr. JOEY PRADO (Owner, Chunky's Burger): It was a curiosity thing. You know, we get people in here, being in south Texas, people like spicy. So I thought, let's see how spicy we can get it. I'd heard of this pepper and finally found it, somebody who could bring it in out of New York, actually. And we tried it here. I said, well, let's try it on a burger, see how hot we can make it and see what people could tolerate. They find out pretty quick, the first bite into it.

BLOCK: I guess the ghost chili makes a jalapeno seem like vanilla ice cream or something.

Mr. PRADO: It's like an olive compared to the ghost chili.

(Soundbite of laughter)

BLOCK: An olive?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah. Literally, it's about 100 times hotter than a jalapeno. So, yeah, jalapenos are just literally like olives compared to it. I eat them all day long.

BLOCK: Is this kind of a bragging rights thing, do you think, for people who come in? They want to put themselves up to the test, see if they can handle the ghost chili?

Mr. PRADO: That's exactly what it is. I guess being here in south Texas, it's a machismo thing. You know, they want to see they think they can handle hot, and if this is the hottest pepper, they want to do it. They want to try to do it, anyway. I would say maybe one out of every 30, 40 people can actually eat that burger because it's just crazy hot.

BLOCK: What do they look like when they're eating it, tears streaming down their face?

Mr. PRADO: Oh, yeah. The tears coming down, the nose is running, the lips are bright red from being on fire. They're just constantly - they're having trouble keeping it down because they just want to spit it out, it's just so hot. It looks like, you know, their puppy died or something because they're just crying, and nose running, and it's crazy.

BLOCK: Well, what about for the poor folks who are having to work with this pepper in the kitchen?

Mr. PRADO: In the kitchen, yeah, they got to be very careful because if they keep it on the grill too long when they saut� them, it can clear the restaurant out. I mean, it's like tear gas. You start coughing, your throat itches, your nose starts to run. It's a dangerous pepper.

BLOCK: Well, I guess that's why the Indian army would want to use it as a weapon, right?

Mr. PRADO: I can easily see that because, yeah, it's just crazy. I mean, if they can weaponize it, it's going to be fairly easy for them because I think we have a weapon here in the kitchen every time the guys forget to take them off the grill.

BLOCK: Do you get complaints from your neighbors?

Mr. PRADO: You can actually smell it outside. Here, I've been outside, and I know when they're making the burger. You can feel it in your throat. It just tickles, and you just start coughing nonstop, and of course, everybody clears out the restaurant. So I know for a fact that they're making a couple of burgers back there.

BLOCK: Are the cooks wearing special gloves when they're handling these chilis?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah, they wear latex gloves because if they get it on their hands, even if you wash it, it'll transfer, you know. The next thing you know, their arms will swell up, and even if you wash it, it's still on there. You've got be very careful with this pepper.

BLOCK: Do you have some kind of warning on your menu?

Mr. PRADO: Actually, if they come in and order the burger, they have to sign a waiver.

BLOCK: Really?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah, they have to be over 18, can't be pregnant, have no medical conditions that may be affected by it because it'll raise your blood pressure. You'll start to sweat. And we have people say their hands start to tingle, their ears start to burn. It's crazy hot. If they don't sign the waiver, we won't make them the burger.

BLOCK: Proceed at your own risk.

Mr. PRADO: Pretty much. I think we've had EMS out here a couple times, actually.

BLOCK: Really?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah, believe it or not. People have tried it, and they come in with their buddies, so they try to force it down. It's hot, but they're going to do it.

BLOCK: Well, Joey Prado, thanks for talking to us about it.

Mr. PRADO: Not a problem, Melissa. You can come in any time.

BLOCK: Joey Prado is the owner of Chunky's Burgers in San Antonio, Texas, where you can try a burger with the scorching hot ghost chili, if you dare.

A new study released Monday from the International Institute for Strategic Studies says North Korea's recent success with intercontinental ballistic missiles was facilitated by black market purchases of Ukrainian rocket engines. NPR's Robert Siegel speaks with the study's author, Michael Elleman.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

North Korea's threat against Guam underscores this disconcerting fact - the North Koreans have made dramatic improvements in developing nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Researcher Michael Elleman says they could not have done that alone. In a study for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Elleman says that help may have come from a factory in Ukraine. And, Mr. Elleman, thanks for joining us today.

MICHAEL ELLEMAN: Thanks for having me.

SIEGEL: You write that North Korea has acquired a high-performance liquid propellant engine from a foreign source. First, how do we know that the North Koreans couldn't have engineered an engine like that on their own?

ELLEMAN: Well, we haven't seen them develop and use any kind of engine that was based on their technology development. We haven't seen even small engines. The engine that powers these particular missiles is quite powerful. It's large. It's sophisticated. So to me, it stretches credulity to think that they suddenly were able to develop this on their own.

SIEGEL: How much do you actually know about these particular engines?

ELLEMAN: Well, we're able from the videos to understand approximately what the total amount of power released by the engine is. We know how long it operates for, and from that we can back out the amount of fuel consumed. And with that and some of the visual characteristics of the engine, we're able to determine that it comes from the - what they call the RD-250 family of engines that were developed in the former Soviet Union.

SIEGEL: When you say we know it was - it came from Ukraine or was made in Ukraine, how do you know that?

ELLEMAN: Well, I don't know that it came from Ukraine. In my writing, I think I was very specific in saying that the most likely source would be Ukraine. We've seen the modifications that were incorporated into the engine that the North Koreans are using. I have two independent sources that have said they've seen that engine in Ukraine. It doesn't mean that it came from Ukraine, but it strongly implies that.

But I want to make one point very clear. I don't think the Ukrainian government was involved in this at all. I don't even know that executives from the Yuzhnoye plant would have been involved. This, to me, sounds like criminal gangs were able to access something and export it from either Ukraine or Russia.

SIEGEL: Last month, the factory Yuzhmash said it had not, does not and will not participate in the transfer of potentially dangerous technologies outside Ukraine. You say it could have been a criminal gang. In a way, that seems almost scarier than the notion that a government might have supplied the Koreans with this technology, the idea that it's on the loose and being sold on the black market.

ELLEMAN: Well, again, you know, because there are so many sites where a large number of engines might have been stored or kept, not all of them would be protected to the extent that we would like to see. And the Yuzhmash - Yuzhnoye facilities are not too far away from the area where Russian separatists in Ukraine and the Ukrainian armed forces are actually fighting, so undoubtedly there would be a number of criminal elements.

And we know from the past in the 1990s that a number of Russian missile technology left Russia and ended up in North Korea. And we know that there were North Korean agents seeking missile technology from Yuzhnoye in 2012 because they were arrested by the Ukrainian government.

SIEGEL: Just curious - if, in fact, these engines were transported from somewhere in Ukraine near Russia to North Korea, how would they get - how would you do that? Would you send them by truck? Would you fly them somewhere? How would they move?

ELLEMAN: You could move them in any one of those methods. So the actual engine could fit into a - you know, like a wooden crate 1 meter by 1 meter by 2 meters. So you could pack them into, you know, a large aircraft. You could put them in the back of trucks. You could put them on trains. So, you know, the possibilities are almost endless. For me, the big question going forward is how many of these engines were actually transferred? And I just don't have any information to suggest that it's a small number or a large number.

SIEGEL: Michael Elleman is a senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Thanks for talking with us today.

ELLEMAN: Thanks for having me.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Greater Manchester Police/AP Greater Manchester Police/AP

In the days before the Manchester Arena attack, Salman Abedi, the man police have identified as the bomber, ""made most of the purchases of the core components"" of the weapon himself and was largely alone as he moved about the city, British police say.

""Many of his movements and actions have been carried out alone during the four days from him landing in the country and committing this awful attack,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit said, referring to Adebi's recent return from a trip to Libya.

""With specialist support, we have also had a good understanding of the likely component parts of the bomb and where these came from,"" Jackson said.

When the bomb detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on May 22, it killed at least 22 people and wounded dozens.

Police are still trying to find the distinctive blue suitcase Abedi was seen carrying as he moved around Manchester's city center and other areas ahead of the attack. The suitcase is ""a different item"" than what was used to carry out the bombing, Jackson said — but he added that people should be cautious and contact police if they can help track it down.

""We are especially keen to find out why he kept going back to the Wilmslow Road area, and we need to find the blue suitcase which he used during these trips,"" Jackson said.

Officials have not ruled out Abedi's acting as part of a wider network — a crucial question that arose last week because of the sophisticated and effective nature of the attack and the timing of his visit to Libya.

Last week, a high-ranking Western government official told NPR, ""Our assessment is he did not have the skills to build such a bomb, and the conclusion is there is a bomb-maker out there.""

Manchester police have made at least 16 arrests in connection to the attack and were still holding 11 men in custody, according to the department's latest updates.

As we have reported, Abedi's father and brother were also detained in Libya last week. Another brother was arrested in England.

The latest police findings are the results of painstaking work, Jackson said, with more than 1,000 officers working on the case and helping to track Abedi's movements through security camera footage, his phone calls and his interactions with people.

Calling the scale of the investigation ""enormous,"" Jackson said there are more than 7,000 entries listed on the counterterrorism unit's lines of inquiry. Investigators are talking to hundreds of witnesses and looking at ""almost 300 pieces of digital equipment, including phones,"" he said.

""There has been huge progress made over the week, and the speed of the inquiry remains the same,"" Jackson said."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Handout/South Korean Defense Ministry Handout/South Korean Defense Ministry

President Trump's unorthodox approach to foreign policy is causing rising anxiety among lawmakers and experts who worry about his singular authority to launch nuclear weapons.

While the first use of nuclear weapons is generally prohibited under international law, the speed of executing a strike means it would be difficult to stop the president if he decided to launch a unilateral attack, says Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer and co-founder of Global Zero, a group that advocates eliminating nuclear weapons.

""The president has absolute authority, unilateral power to order the use of nuclear weapons,"" he tells Here & Now's Robin Young. ""The legal question falls by the wayside if the president has carte blanche authority to order the use of nuclear weapons and all the means at his disposal to ensure that his decision is quickly implemented.""

Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said that he would challenge an order from Trump if it were illegal.

""I provide advice to the president,"" Hyten said. ""He'll tell me what to do, and if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm gonna say, 'Mr. President, that's illegal.' Guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works.""

But the president's sole launch authority has ignited a debate about whether there should be more checks and balances on the president's actions. As tensions between the U.S. and North Korea escalate, a group of senators raised concerns about Trump's temperament to handle this responsibility at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week.

""We are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests,"" said Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy.

Blair says that in order to launch a weapons strike, the president must alert his military aide who holds a suitcase, the so-called nuclear football, which contains attack options. Once the president orders the strike using a special code, the Pentagon immediately transmits the order to launch weapons.

Strategic Command also receives the order, but Blair explains, ""If they felt that it was a really bad call or illegal, and they wanted to try to override it, they could try to transmit a termination order, but it would be too late.""

Blair also says the legality of using nuclear weapons is unclear, which means the decision really is up to the president.

""The first use of nuclear weapons is almost invariably going to be illegal because they're not necessary and because they will cause collateral damage against civilian populations and in other ways violate the law of war,"" Blair says. ""But that's not really the way that it's viewed from the inside.""

In a 1996 advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice concluded that the threat or use of nuclear weapons generally violates international law governing armed conflict and humanitarian law, declaring that ""states must never make civilians the object of attack.""

But according to the Arms Control Association, a legal gap allows for the possible lawful use of such weapons.

The court stated in its opinion ""that it cannot reach a definitive conclusion as to the legality or illegality of the use of nuclear weapons by a State in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which its very survival would be at stake.""

Though only Congress has the power to declare war, retired Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler, former commander of Strategic Command, testified last week that ""only the president of the United States can order the employment of U.S. nuclear weapons."" Massachusetts Republican Sen. Ed Markey has proposed legislation that would require congressional approval for any first use of nuclear weapons.

When pressed further by senators, Kehler said he didn't know what would happen if Trump ignored the military's order to stand down on a nuclear strike deemed illegal. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed this would amount to a constitutional crisis.

Blair agrees there are not enough people in the chain of command to slow down the authorization process.

The nuclear codes are ""the length of a tweet,"" he says. ""It would take them one or two minutes to format and transmit that directly down the chain of command to the executing commanders of the underground launch centers, the submarines and the bombers."""

Look at this map, and notice that deep, deep in the Republican South, there's a thin blue band stretching from the Carolinas through Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. These are the counties that went for Obama in the last election. A blue crescent in a sea of red.

Enlarge this image Matt Stiles/NPR Matt Stiles/NPR

These same counties went mostly blue in 2004 and 2000. Why? Well, the best answer, says marine biologist Craig McClain, may be an old one, going back before the Civil War, before 1776, before Columbus, back more than 100 million years to the days when the Deep South was under water. Those counties, as he writes here, went for Obama because trillions and trillions and trillions of teeny sun-loving creatures died there. He's talking about plankton. That's why the Republicans can't carry those counties. Blame plankton.

[Don't leave. I know some of you bounced here because my headline was political, and the word ""plankton"" will send you scuttling back to HuffPo, Politico and Drudge, where politics is plankton-free. But before you go, check out this next map.]

It's an image of North America as it looked during the Cretaceous era, 129 million to 65 million years ago. As you can see, much of the continent was still covered by water. The Deep South had a shoreline that curled through the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, and there, in the shallow waters just offshore, were immense populations of floating, single-celled creatures who drifted about, trapped sunshine, captured carbon, then died and sank to the sea bottom. Those creatures became long stretches of nutritious chalk. (I love chalk.)

When sea levels dropped and North America took on its modern shape, those ancient beaches — so alkaline, porous and rich with organic material — became a ""black belt"" of rich soil, running right through the South. You can see the Cretaceous beaches in this map, colored green. McClain got these maps from geologist Steve Dutch's website, at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay.

And because this stretch was so rich and fertile, when cotton farmers moved here in the 19th century, this stretch produced the most cotton per acre. Harvests of 4,000-plus bales were common here. Notice that the most productive plantations mirror the ancient coastline.

Then came slavery.

McClain, quoting from Booker T. Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery, points out: ""The part of the country possessing this thick, dark and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers."" After the Civil War, a lot of former slaves stayed on this land, and while many migrated North, their families are still there.

In this 2000 census, you can see that the counties with the biggest populations of African-Americans still trace that Cretaceous shoreline.

This, says marine biologist McClain, explains that odd stretch of Obama blue; it's African-Americans sitting on old soil from ancient organisms that turned sunshine into fertilizer. So plankton remain a force in Southern elections — though not always, not continuously. After the Civil War, when the South voted solidly Democratic and Jim Crow laws ruled, many blacks couldn't vote, so the pattern disappears. Voting rights laws hadn't been passed during the Goldwater-Johnson election of 1964, so in this map, the African-American difference is invisible.

But some African-Americans were still there. So was the soil (though it's not as rich as it once was), and so were the rocks that geologist Steve Dutch ""found immediately familiar"" because they mapped those ancient shores. All of which is to say, when you cover politics, sometimes, without realizing it, you are also telling rock tales. Geology, every so often, peeks through.

Geologist Steve Dutch's detailed maps, and careful analysis, come from a study he did of the Bush-Gore election in 2000. He called it ""Geology and Election 2000."" You can find that here. ""Dr. M"" (that's Craig McClain's Nom de Blog at ""Deep Sea News"") wrote his geology analysis here."

The civil war in Syria has left millions of people dependent on food aid. But delivering that aid to rebel-held areas is an enormous challenge. And food aid is being used as a weapon to control the population in both government and rebel territory.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

The civil war in Syria has left four million people dependent on food aid. That's what Muhannad Hadi, the World Food Program's emergency coordinator for Syria, told us on the program last week, and he expects that number to grow to seven million by the end of this year.

The ongoing conflict between the government of Bashar al-Assad and anti-government fighters means residents constantly move in search of security and basic necessities. And many groups, including radical Islamists, are winning over those communities by providing food.

NPR's Deborah Amos has covered the Syrian civil war since it began, and joins me in the studio. And Deb, it's great when your travels bring you home for a bit and we can see you. Thanks for coming in.

DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: It's very nice to be in the studio.

GREENE: Give me a sense of how desperate Syrians are for food right now?

AMOS: No one is starving. It would be wrong to think that. But there are shortages. There are many Syrians who are now so poor that their staple diet is bread, which is why people would risk their lives to stand in a bread line, because they can't afford anything else. And in places that are controlled by the rebels, it is very, very difficult for international aid agencies - almost impossible in some areas - to get food aid to those places, and these are the places where people are most in need.

GREENE: Why isn't it getting to them?

AMOS: The food aid goes through the United Nations, that has many offices inside Damascus, the capital of Syria. And that aid goes through the government. They have not wanted that food aid to go to contested areas, rebel-held areas, and the international system doesn't really promote something called cross-border aid.

GREENE: Cross-border aid. Make sure we understand what that is, here.

AMOS: So what happens is if the UN wants to deliver aid to a rebel-held area, it has to get government permission. That has happened rarely. There were two cases earlier this year where aid was moved from Latakia on the coast, driven all the way up to the Turkish border on the Syrian side, and it was delivered to refugee camps that were in sight of Turkey. So logistically, it would've been easier, cheaper, safer, to bring those trucks from Turkey into Syria.

GREENE: Just drive a truck across the border.

AMOS: Just drive a truck. But it...

GREENE: But it can't happen.

AMOS: ...instead it can't happen. No government really wants to break that system.

GREENE: They have their own conflicts, countries like Turkey, and they don't want the UN coming in into their borders and deciding who's going to get food.

AMOS: And not asking them.

GREENE: Well, the people who are in rebel-controlled areas, who is getting food to them?

AMOS: Well, the rebels have taken it upon themselves in places that they control to be the humanitarian aid organizations, along with Syrian civilians who have set up shop. But I can tell you that the most radical Islamist guerilla rebel groups have begun a hearts and minds campaign. They are fighting for an Islamist state in Syria. They're very open about that.

GREENE: Mm-hmm.

AMOS: And how to convince people to come with them is to be the deliverer of aid.

GREENE: And is that enough, in some cases, to turn people?

AMOS: In the beginning it was, because these groups were less likely to loot, less likely to steal, more likely to give bread fairly. In the last few months, there have been some additions that you also have to swallow with your bread, and that is Sharia law, and people are rebelling. So food isn't enough to turn a population pro-al-Qaida in Syria, because the package is much bigger.

GREENE: What are governments like the United States and others doing about this?

AMOS: The United States, USAID, is actually running a covert, cross-border aid operation. It is rather large on the Turkish border, smaller on the Jordanian border. And they have partners, some rather large international aid agencies that take their names off the trucks. There are no American flags on any of this aid, and it goes in every day across the Turkish border, and they have Syrian partners who distribute that aid in the north.

There are times when Islamist groups take credit for that bread that comes, because the Americans don't want to brand it. There is a bit of an argument in Congress, in the White House, about: Should we be branding this aid? But the concerns, of course, with everybody who is looking at this as a humanitarian disaster, is any way you that can get flour into Syria stops one Syrian from crossing the border and becoming a refugee.

GREENE: Deb, it's great to see you. Thanks for coming in.

AMOS: Thank you.

GREENE: That's NPR's Deb Amos.

Three years ago, the Islamic State overran large swaths of Iraq and Syria, and soon declared a caliphate that straddled the border between the two countries. Today, the group's physical caliphate is declining — and the group is preparing its base of fighters for a future under siege.

One of the ways it is doing that is through its musical propaganda.

In the most austere interpretations of Islam, musical instruments are prohibited. But the a cappella hymn nasheed, in Arabic, is permissible. The Islamic State has used nasheeds to spread its message since its founding, disseminating battle hymns online through its own media unit and other affiliated propaganda outlets.

Most ISIS nasheeds are in Arabic, but the language of delivery can be as diverse as the foreign fighters who have joined its ranks.

The Islamic State's latest nasheed, released earlier this month, is titled ""Dawlati Baqia"" or ""My State Is Remaining."" Like other nasheeds circulated by ISIS, it sounds like it was professionally recorded and has an Auto Tune quality to it.

The song begins:

My state is remaining, firing at the enemy.

Its soldiers shout that it is remaining.

Its path will not be eliminated; its light seeks to expand.

Like other ISIS nasheeds, this one was disseminated across the Web, on encrypted messaging applications and likely on the group's radio station — still broadcasting in areas under its control. The verses are a defiant reply to those who believe ISIS' battlefield setbacks signal the group's demise.

Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi , a research fellow at the Middle East Forum, has been tracking the Islamic State's full range of propaganda, including its music, since the group emerged. He says the nasheeds reflect the group's evolution from a battlefield force implementing its rule over an expanding territory and population to an embattled base now under intense pressure.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mohamed El-Shahed /AFP/Getty Images Mohamed El-Shahed /AFP/Getty Images

The past few months have been a struggle for the group. The physical caliphate, which at its height drew adherents from as far afield as Europe and Chechnya, is dwindling. In Iraq, U.S.-backed Iraqi troops are closing in on the last ISIS-held enclave of Mosul, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced his caliphate three years before. And in Syria, ISIS is facing separate offensives from U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab tribal forces as well as from Syrian pro-government forces, backed by Russia and Iran.

""My State Is Remaining"" warns that the fight isn't over, though:

The Muslim nation has been awoken from its slumber.

Oh people of error! The state is remaining — not vanishing,

Anchored like the mountains, anchored, anchored.



The ""people of error"" may refer to Islamic State's battlefield enemies, including the U.S.-led coalition — or even those trapped under ISIS control, seeking to flee.

Between 2013 and 2015, Tamimi says, ""You see [in the songs] the rise of the Islamic State, implementation of Islamic law and how it creates its realm of justice. But now what you see is the nasheeds are responding to the current situation faced by the Islamic State, which is the setbacks — territorial setbacks, potential loss of Raqqa and almost loss of Mosul.""

In response to its losses of territory and people, ISIS released a nasheed in May titled ""Heed the Call,"" referring to the call to jihad. The lyrics exhort the fighters ""in the era of epic battles and conflict"" to hold their ground in the face of death. ""Where are the real men?"" the song asks. ""Where are the lions of the struggle?""

""The idea behind this messaging is two things,"" Tamimi says. ""One is [a message that] we'll still remain, and the second one, encouraging people to keep up the fight.""

Two years ago, when ISIS was still expanding geographically and attracting recruits to its nascent caliphate, the group was producing threatening battle hymns. They often served as the background music for its terrifying and bloody propaganda videos.

The nasheed ""Soon, Soon"" can be heard in the background of one of the most horrific ISIS execution videos — in which a captured Royal Jordanian air force pilot, Moath al-Kasasbeh, appears to be burned alive in a cage. ""You'll see the battle come to your very home,"" the lyrics go. ""To destroy you, my sword has been sharpened.""

The nasheed was released within a day of the pilot's death, an emblem of the unapologetic brutality and defiance of ISIS at the height of its power.

But the murder did not stop the anti-ISIS coalition's bombing campaign. And in the years since, the physical caliphate has largely crumbled.

Tamimi says that as ISIS has lost territory and men, its nasheed production and variety also fell off. Foreign-language nasheeds — in Turkish or Uighur, for example — that were once churned out for ISIS' global following are becoming scarcer. Even the Arabic nasheeds directed at its base appear less and less often.

Tamimi says at first he thought perhaps the singers had been killed in airstrikes. But then ISIS released ""Heed the Call"" and ""My State Remains"" in May and June.

Despite the mournful tone of ""My State Remains,"" the latest nasheed, the lyrics reveal a group keenly aware — and even proud — of the terror and upheaval it has unleashed, and the many lives it has destroyed. ""Our state has made the tears of our enemies flow,"" the song says. ""We have killed them by the thousands and led them to their deaths."""

Updated at 11 p.m. ET

Two students were hospitalized with gunshot wounds in Los Angeles after what police describe as an accidental shooting Thursday morning at Salvador Castro Middle School. A 12-year-old girl has been arrested.

Late Thursday, The Associated Press reported:

""[Police] spokesman Josh Rubenstein says the 12-year-old girl arrested in Thursday's shooting was being booked on a charge of negligent discharge of a firearm on school grounds. ""Twelve-year-old Jordan Valenzuela, a classmate, tells The Associated Press that he talked to her just after the shooting. ""He says she was sobbing and kept repeating, 'I didn't mean it.' He says she told him that the gun was in her backpack and that it accidentally went off when she dropped the bag.""

Both students who were shot are 15 years old — a boy who is in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head and a girl who was shot in the wrist and is in fair condition. Erik Scott of the Los Angeles Fire Department said three other people, ranging in age from 11 to 30, ""suffered abrasions"" during the attack.

The 15-year-old boy is expected to fully recover. Trauma surgeon Aaron Strumwasser said the victim was lucky the bullet that struck him in the temple did not cause life-threatening damage. ""I think he will do fine,"" said Strumwasser at the LA County-USC Medical Center, as quoted by the Los Angeles Times.

""As a parent, this is everyone's worst-case nightmare — a worst-case scenario and a nightmare for all of us,"" Robert Arcos, commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's Operations-Central Bureau, told reporters Thursday.

He said at the time it was too early know how the girl obtained the weapon.

As AP explains, district policy dictates that ""students at middle and high schools in Los Angeles are subject to daily random searches for weapons using metal-detector wands, but officials have not said whether any such screenings occurred at the school Thursday.""

The Los Angeles Times notes Castro Middle School sits just across the street from Belmont High School, in a building that ""used to be part of Belmont High when the high school had a higher enrollment.""

""I'm just scared for all the kids,"" Gloria Echeverria, mother of a 13-year-old student, told the AP while standing outside the police tape ringing the campus. ""School is supposed to be a safe place for them, and apparently it's not.""

Updated at 9:30 p.m. ET Saturday

Police in Kissimmee, Fla., just south of Orlando, reported late Friday that two officers there had been shot.

Officer Matthew Baxter, a three-year veteran of the department, was killed, and Sgt. Sam Howard was in ""grave critical condition,"" Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell told reporters early Saturday.

Later Saturday, Howard died of his injuries, the police department said in a statement on posted to Facebook.

Baxter was married to another officer and had three children. Howard is also married and a father.

Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs had earlier written on Twitter that both had been killed, calling the shooting a ""[h]eartbreaking loss of two of Kissimmee's finest officers.""

President Trump sent his condolences to the officers on Twitter.

Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said Saturday that 45-year-old Everett Miller was arrested several hours after the shootings, charged with first-degree murder for killing Baxter. Authorities didn't say if Miller is facing charges for Howard's death.

According to the police chief, Miller was a Marine veteran recently committed involuntarily for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, and had threatened law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.

""This is a tough time for each one of us,"" he told reporters early Saturday. O'Dell said the department hasn't ""experienced this in over 25 years.""

""At this point, I'd ask you to please keep the men and women of the Kissimmee Police Department, the families of the fallen officers, the law enforcement personnel in the central Florida area in your thoughts and prayers,"" he added.

The officers were shot in an area with ""some drug activity,"" he said.

""There are no county or jurisdiction lines when it comes to our Law Enforcement Brotherhood,"" Osceola County Commissioner Fred Hawkins Jr. wrote in response to the shootings.

Later in the same night, two other officers were shot in a separate incident about 165 miles north, in Jacksonville, Fla.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office wrote that one of the officers was in critical condition and one was in stable condition in local hospitals.

Mike Bruno, the director the office's Department of Patrol and Enforcement, told reporters that four or five officers responded to an ""attempted suicide call"" at a home around 11 p.m. They thought it was an active shooter situation after hearing gunshots from inside.

A suspect ""began shooting through the door at the officers,"" using a ""high-powered rifle,"" then went outside and exchanged gunfire with the officers, Bruno said.

The suspect was shot by police and died at a hospital.

In a third separate incident, in southwestern Pennsylvania, two Pennsylvania state troopers were shot in Fairchance on Friday. The suspect in that incident was also killed.

Federal health officials are urging all Americans to get their flu shots as soon as possible, and are especially concerned that too few elderly people are getting vaccinated.

""Flu is serious. Flu is unpredictable,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters during a joint briefing Thursday with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. ""Flu often does not get enough respect.""

While the influenza virus causes relatively mild illness in most people, the disease can lead to tens of thousands of deaths during severe flu seasons, Frieden noted. About 100 children die each year from the flu.

The CDC and other infectious disease specialists are concerned by a recent drop in seasonal flu vaccination. About 45 percent of the U.S. population got vaccinated against the virus last year, which was down 1.5 percentage points from the previous year.

The largest decrease was among people ages 50 and older. There was a 3.4 percentage-point drop among people ages 50 to 64, and a 3.3 percentage-point drop among those ages 65 and older. The elderly are among those most vulnerable to life-threatening complications of the flu.

As many as 168 million doses of flu vaccine should be available this year, and more than 93 million have already been distributed, according to the CDC.

""There's plenty for everybody,"" Frieden said.

Although some questions have been raised about whether getting the flu vaccine too soon may diminish its effectiveness, federal officials recommended against anyone waiting. Similarly, some research recently questioned whether protection from the vaccine may wane more quickly among people who get vaccinated every year. But the CDC and other infectious disease specialists still advocate annual vaccination.

The nasal spray vaccine, which many parents have preferred for their children, is not being recommended this year because recent research has questioned its effectiveness. Researchers are still trying to confirm if and why the nasal version might be less effective than the shot.

But two new flu vaccines are available this year. One protects against four strains of flu instead of just three. The other contains a substance known as an ""adjuvant,"" which boosts the vaccine's effectiveness.

Health officials recommend that most people simply get whichever version of flu shot is most readily available to them rather than wait for a specific version."

A Navy SEAL testified Wednesday in Fort Bragg, N.C., that he was shot and badly injured during a heavy firefight while searching for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl after Bergdahl walked off his combat outpost in Afghanistan.

The military judge, Army Col. Jeffery Nance, is allowing the testimony of three service members whose injuries are considered a direct result of the searches for Bergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban and held for five years. He has pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.

The Navy SEAL, Senior Chief Petty Officer James Hatch, was forced to retire from the military after nearly 26 years of service because of the injuries sustained while searching for Bergdahl. He testified that he underwent 18 operations in the years that followed.

On Wednesday, he walked to the witness stand with a heavy limp, accompanied by a black service dog.

Hatch said that before Bergdahl went missing, the unit's mission was capturing and killing high-value targets. Members of the unit got word that they were going to focus on rescuing Bergdahl.

""Someone is going to get killed or hurt trying to get this kid,"" Hatch recalled saying.

Nine days after Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance, Hatch led a team with two helicopters on a mission into Afghanistan's Paktika province. He said the team was taking heavy fire even before they landed.

As they began advancing to the position where they believed Bergdahl was held, he said, a trained dog with them lunged after three figures, who turned out to be children.

Shortly afterward, the dog was shot in the head and killed, he said. Hatch spoke in formal, controlled language, with his voice only wavering when he spoke about the dog.

Hatch was then shot in his right leg, just above the knee. He described screaming in pain and worrying that he was endangering fellow troops. ""I really thought I was going to die,"" he said. The Navy SEAL was then airlifted out.

""Everyone on that mission was aware [Bergdahl] walked off,"" Hatch said. When asked why they went after him, Hatch responded: ""Because he's an American.""

Another witness, Capt. John Billings, was Bergdahl's platoon leader and described the searches immediately after Bergdahl went missing.

""The next 10 days were just kind of a blur,"" he said. ""Everybody in Afghanistan was looking for Bergdahl.""

On Monday, the military judge probed whether recent comments by President Trump could challenge the fairness of the legal proceedings. As we reported:

""Under the military justice system, it's unlawful for commanders to influence legal cases, or even give the appearance of influence. That principle covers the president as commander-in-chief. ""Bergdahl, who spent five years in Taliban captivity, was a frequent target for Trump when he was a candidate. Trump suggested in 2015 that Bergdahl 'should be shot,' as NPR's Rebecca Hersher reported. ""In previous filings, lawyers for Bergdahl cited at least 45 instances where candidate Trump called their client a traitor.""

On Monday, Trump said: ""I can't comment on Bowe Bergdahl. ... But I think people have heard my comments in the past.""

Nance said at the beginning of Wednesday's hearing that he hasn't decided whether these comments constitute undue influence and would rule at a later point. The defense wants a motion to dismiss the whole case. The judge's decision on this could factor into Bergdahl's sentence.

Nance has broad discretion in determining that sentence — he could sentence Bergdahl to life in prison or he could let him walk out of court a free man, saying in a sense that the five years he spent in Taliban captivity is punishment enough."

Some might chalk it up to bad luck; others, to karma.

Robert Meilhammer, 51, of Crapo, Md., was struck in the head Thursday by a dead Canada goose that plunged from the sky after a fellow waterfowl hunter fired a blind shot on a flock overhead. Meilhammer was in the midst of a hunting party with three friends in Easton, Md.

The goose fell about 90 feet, knocking the hunter out instantly and causing head and facial injuries. When Meilhammer came to, he was coherent but ""hazy,"" according to the Maryland Natural Resources Police.

Natural Resources police officers and EMS responders transported Meilhammer via ambulance to the Easton Airport, where he was airlifted to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore.

Talbot County EMS responders called his head injury ""severe."" The dead bird also knocked out two of Meilhammer's teeth.

Thousands of Canada geese in the United States migrate south each year, filling the sky with long, V-formations. Adult Canada geese weigh about 12 to 14 pounds, and can have a wing span reaching nearly 6 feet. The ""honkers,"" as the bird are called for their noisy calls, are found in every contiguous U.S. state.

Meilhammer is in stable condition."

Kuki Gallmann, a conservationist best known for her book I Dreamed of Africa, was ambushed and shot while she drove across her conservancy in Kenya Sunday morning.

Gallmann, 73, was shot in the stomach and ""severely injured"" while surveying her property with rangers of the Kenya Wildlife Service, according to her brother-in-law Nigel Adams and a press release from a farmers' association of which she's a member.

She was flown to a hospital in Nairobi for treatment, and was still conscious and speaking after the attack, according to The New York Times.

Her conservancy, the Laikipia Nature Conservancy, has been the center of a bloody battle for weeks, as a large-scale drought has pushed cattle-herders to extreme measures to try and find grazing land.

NPR's Eyder Peralta spoke on All Things Considered earlier this month about the issue, after the owner of another ranch was shot and killed.

""You have nomadic herders who are moving into private wildlife conservancies with thousands of heads of cattle,"" Peralta said. ""And in response, the Kenyan government launched a military-style operation to push the herders out. But what we've seen is an escalation of violence. Police have killed lots of cows. And the herders have responded by burning tourist lodges on the properties.""

In fact, Gallmann was said to be surveying arson damage inflicted on her property, when she was attacked.

Members of the Pokot and Samburu tribes have long grazed on conservancy land in Kenya, but over the past few years things have changed. Herders have brought more and more cows, killed other wildlife, and begun to vandalize property. Gallmann's daughter, Sveva Gallmann, told NPR last month that the escalation concerned her.

""That's not just grass,"" she said. ""That is heavily politicized violence. And that is what's much more worrying about this situation.""

She added that she doesn't think the herders even own many of the cows.

""There's a lot of, actually, politicians, people within the police, people within the administration storing their wealth in cattle and laundering ill-gotten money through cattle,"" she said.

Government officials deny those claims.

Kenya has a national election coming up in August, and local land owners also blame politicians for inciting herders to push their cattle onto privately-owned land as a way of boosting their popularity, reports the United Kingdom's The Telegraph.

In an interview with NPR Sunday, Martin Evans, the chair of the Laikipia Farmers' Association, agreed that the battle between the herders and the Kenya Defense forces is politically motivated.

""It started a year ago,"" Evans said. ""At the time it started, there was plenty of rain, it was nothing to do with lack of grass at that time so yes, I think it's definitely being pushed by politicians.""

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's office issued a statement warning politicians in the area not to inflame the situation with ""reckless rhetoric.""

""Politicians encouraging invasions of privately-owned property or attacks on individuals can expect strong deterrent action in terms of the law,"" Kenyatta's spokesman, Manoah Esipisu, said.

In the last month, the violence seemed to be escalating on the Gallmann ranch. Herders burned down a famous resort on her property, and she exchanged text messages last week with The New York Times that showed her concern.

""Pokot militia openly carrying firearms,"" Gallmann wrote on April 15. ""Not just herders. Group of armed men without livestock. 13 firearm spotted.""

Gallmann was born in Italy, and published her memoir I Dreamed of Africa in 1991. It was turned into a movie starring Kim Basinger in 2000.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Aja C. Holmes planned to go to work last week, but her flu symptoms — a cough, fever and severe body aches that worsened overnight — had other ideas.

""It felt like somebody took a bat and beat my body up and down,"" said Holmes, 39, who works as a residential life director at California State University, Sacramento. ""I couldn't get out of bed.""

The nation is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad flu season.

Flu is widespread in 46 states, including California, according to the latest reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Nationally, as of mid-December, at least 106 people had died from the infectious disease, according to the CDC. At least 27 Californians younger than 65 had died as of Friday, seven of them during the week before Christmas, according to the California Department of Public Health. And states across the country are reporting higher-than-average flu-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits.

In California, the flu struck surprisingly early and hard this season. The state's higher temperatures typically mean people are not as confined to the indoors, leading to a later flu season compared with other regions. Health experts aren't sure why this season is different.

""We're seeing the worst of it right now,"" said Dr. Randy Bergen, a pediatrician who is leading Kaiser Permanente-Northern California's anti-flu effort. ""We're really in historic territory, and I just don't know when it's going to stop."" (Kaiser Health News, which produces California Healthline, is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.)

Here is what you should know about this flu season:

1. It's shaping up to be one of the worst in recent years

The H3N2 influenza A subtype that appears to be most prevalent this year is particularly nasty, with more severe symptoms including fever and body aches. Australia, which U.S. public health officials follow closely in their flu forecasting in part because its winter is our summer, reported a record-high number of confirmed flu cases in 2017. Another influenza B virus subtype also is circulating ""and that's no fun, either,"" Bergen said.

Flu season in the U.S. typically starts in October and ends in May, peaking from December to February.

2. This season's flu vaccine is likely to be less effective than in previous years

U.S. flu experts say they won't fully know how effective this season's vaccine is until the end of the season. But Australia's experience suggests effectiveness was only about 10 percent. In the U.S., it is 40 percent to 60 percent effective in an average season. Vaccines are less protective if strains are different from what was predicted and if unexpected mutations occur.

3. You should get the flu shot anyway

Even if it is not a good match to the virus now circulating, the vaccine helps to ease the severity and duration of symptoms if you come down with the flu. Young children are considered among the most vulnerable to complications from the disease, and a shot can significantly reduce a child's chances of dying. High-dose vaccines are recommended for elderly people, who also are exceptionally vulnerable to illness, hospitalization and death related to the flu, according to the CDC.

""Some protection is better than no protection,"" Bergen said, ""but it's certainly disappointing to have a vaccine that's just not as effective as we'd like it to be.

Shots may still be available from your doctor or local health clinic, as well as at some chain drugstores. Check the Vaccine Finder website for a location near you.

4. Basic precautions may spare you and your family from days in bed

As much as possible, avoid people who are sick. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes.

Masks aren't particularly effective in keeping you from catching the flu, although they may help keep sick people who wear them from spreading their germs further.

If you are sick, cover your cough and stay home from work if you can, Bergen said. Remaining hydrated, eating nutritious foods and exercising can also help strengthen your immune system.

Because elderly people are so vulnerable to the flu, some nursing homes and assisted living facilities may limit visitors and resident activities, depending on the level of illness.

5. Don't mistake flu symptoms for those of a common cold

The hallmarks of flu are fever and body aches that accompany cough and congestion, Bergen said.

If you feel as if you're having trouble breathing or if your fever can't be controlled with medication like Tylenol, check with your doctor. It's even more important for patients to see a doctor if they have a chronic medical condition like diabetes or heart disease or if they are young or elderly.

Kaiser Permanente doctors now are being advised to prescribe antiviral drugs like Tamiflu — given as a pill or, for kids, an oral suspension — even without a lab test for influenza, Bergen said. According to a report in The Los Angeles Times, however, Tamiflu supplies are running low.

And Bergen cautioned that these medications are only partly effective, reducing the time of illness by just a day or two.

The pitches from pharmacy chains started in August: Come in and get your flu shot.

Convenience is touted. So are incentives. CVS offers a 20 percent-off shopping pass for everyone who gets a shot, while Walgreens donates toward international vaccination efforts.

The start of flu season is still weeks, if not months, away. Yet marketing of the vaccine has become an almost year-round effort that starts when the shots become available in August and is hyped as long as the supply lasts — often into April or May.

Not that long ago, most flu-shot campaigns started as the leaves began to turn in October. But two things have stretched the flu-shot season: the decade-long increase in the number of drugstores that have a retail medical clinic inside, and state laws that allow pharmacists to give vaccinations.

Drugstores have figured out how ""to deliver medical services in an on-demand way,"" says Tom Charland, founder and CEO of Merchant Medicine, which tracks the walk-in clinic industry. The approach appeals to customers, particularly millennials, and turns out to be good business.

""It's a way to get people into the store to buy other things,"" Charland says.

But some doctors warn that the marketing may be overtaking medical wisdom, since it's unclear how long the immunity imparted by the vaccine lasts, particularly in older people.

Federal health officials say it's better to get the shot whenever you can. An early flu shot is better than no flu shot at all. But the science is mixed when it comes to how long you'll get optimal protection from a flu shot promoted and given during the waning days of summer; the typical flu season peaks in midwinter or beyond. Immunologists and public health officials are divided on how patients should respond to such offers.

""If you're over 65, don't get the flu vaccine in September. Or August. It's a marketing scheme,"" says Laura Haynes, an immunologist at the University of Connecticut Center on Aging.

A combination of factors makes it more difficult for the immune systems of people older than 65 to respond to the vaccination, she says, and the protective effect may also wear off faster than it does in young people.

So, when is the best time to vaccinate?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises physicians that it's safe to make flu shots available to all age groups whenever the vaccine becomes available, each year. While ""delaying vaccination might permit greater immunity later in the season,"" the CDC notes, citing evidence from a 2013 study, that ""deferral could result in missed opportunities to vaccinate.""

How long will the immunity last?

""The data are very mixed,"" says Dr. John J. Treanor, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Rochester medical school. Some studies suggest vaccines lose some protectiveness during the course of a single flu season. Flu activity generally starts in the fall, but peaks in January or February and can run into the spring.

""So some might worry that if [they] got vaccinated very early and flu didn't show up until very late, it might not work as well,"" he says. But other studies show ""you still have protection from the shot you got last year,"" Treanor adds, ""if it's a year when the strains didn't change.""

In any given flu season, the effectiveness of immunization varies, partly dependent on how well the vaccine matches the strain of flu virus that's predominant that year. In the overall population, the CDC says studies show a vaccine can reduce the risk of flu by about 50 to 60 percent when the vaccine is well-matched.

It's especially important to vaccinate children, to help keep parents and grandparents healthy, as well as the kids themselves, doctors say. While most people who get the flu recover, it is a serious disease responsible for many deaths each year, particularly among older adults and young children.

The intensity of illness provoked by each influenza strain can vary, too; U.S. deaths associated with the flu have ranged from about 3,300 a year to 49,000 in the past 31 seasons.

To develop vaccines, manufacturers and scientists study what's circulating in the Southern Hemisphere during its winter flu season — June, July and August. Then, based on that evidence, they forecast what flu strains might be circulating in the U.S. the following November, December and January, and incorporate that information into flu vaccines that are generally ready by late July.

For the upcoming season, the vaccines will include three or four strains — including two influenza A strains, an H1N1 and an H3N2, as well as one or two B strains, according to the CDC. The federal health officials recommend that everyone older than 6 months gets vaccinated, unless they have a health condition that would prevent it.

The vaccines can't give a person the flu because the virus is killed before it's used in the shot. This year, the nasal vaccine — a squirt of liquid that includes a live attenuated virus — is not recommended for use, as studies showed it was not effective during several of the past flu seasons.

So, talk to your doctor, and weigh your options for the timing of that flu shot. ""The ideal time is between Halloween and Thanksgiving,"" says Haynes, who specializes in the immunity of older people. ""If you can't wait, and the only chance is to get it in September, then go ahead and get it. It's best to get it early rather than not at all.""

Altered consciousness, dreamy detachment and a healthy streak of escapism have long been hallmarks of psychedelic music. TOY is well aware of this — but at the same time, the British band is savvy enough to know just how far a pop song can be pushed, pulled and stretched. On the group's first two albums, 2012's TOY and 2013's Join The Dots, infectious indie rock bleeds into trippy studio effects, hypnotic rhythms and otherworldy textural manipulation. Much of the credit goes to frontman Tom Dougall, whose spun-sugar voice and dynamic songwriting ties together the outfit's ambitious, wide-angle soundscapes.

After a three-year break from studio albums, TOY is releasing its third full-length, Clear Shot, and it's even further proof of just how vivid and inviting psychedelia can be in the 21st century. Dougall — along with guitarist Dominic O'Dair, keyboardist-guitarist Max Oscarnold, bassist Maxim Barron and drummer Charlie Salvidge — infuses songs like ""Another Dimension"" and ""Clouds That Cover The Sun"" with the wide-eyed enchantment of a kids' magic show. ""Time runs free / Stretches and it squeezes / Everything and anyone it sees,"" Dougall coos at the start of ""Another Dimension,"" marveling at the elasticity of space-time before the song erupts into a serotonin-triggering chorus. Despite its title, ""Clouds That Cover The Sun"" is just as euphoric, even as its melancholy undertow pulses along at the speed of Oscarnold's gently burbling keys.

For all its billowy, pillowy bliss, Clear Shot can also get intense. ""Spirits Don't Lie"" is more of a droning meditation than a gleeful traipse, with Salvidge's nervy percussion feeling like a palpitating heartbeat. Still, for each of the album's pockets of shadow, there are a dozen bursts of sun. There's a buoyant skip in ""We Will Disperse"" that's reminiscent of The Flaming Lips' bubblegum grandeur, while ""I'm Still Believing"" slinks along with a silky flourish. ""So simple, so fine / She perfectly read my mind,"" speak-sings Dougall, too caught up in butterflies to worry about being melodic.

Snatches of everyone from Can to Stereolab to MGMT can be heard in Clear Shot's chugging-yet-supple anthems to ecstasy. ""Dream Orchestrator"" is the catchiest of the lot; propelled by a throbbing beat and effervescent synths, it's by far the danciest track on the album, not to mention the most forward-gazing. The chorus alone could be bottled and sold as an antidepressant, fueled as it is by easygoing hooks, squalls of breathless noise and upward-spiraling rapture. Rather than relying too heavily on the work of psychedelia's past masters, Dougall and crew have put a futuristic spin on hallucinatory pop — that is, if the future were something to be viewed with romance and wonder instead of today's all-too-pervasive doom."

Not only can the NRA marshal its grassroots to boost its preferred candidate, but it holds in reserve the power to fund and support primary challengers. That threat became real for an eight-term incumbent Democratic lawmaker from Oklahoma who voted for the assault weapons ban in 1994.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

There was a time when the National Rifle Association was known mostly for promoting gun safety and personal ownership of firearms. These days, the NRA is better known as an uncompromising political force. It defends its interpretation of the Second Amendment and works to defeat politicians it sees as enemies. Now, this transition has happened over several decades. NPR's Don Gonyea looks at one early and telling race that signaled the change.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Congressman Mike Synar was just 28 years old when he went to Washington, a Democrat from Muskogee. Yes, Oklahoma still sent Democrats to Congress back then. In those early years, Synar counted the NRA among his supporters.

NATHAN GERTH: What we're looking at here in terms of the letter...

GONYEA: That's Nathan Gerth of the University of Oklahoma reading a letter from 1980 found among boxes and boxes of documents from Synar's career.

GERTH: The National Rifle Association's Political Victory Fund is pleased to announce its endorsement of Congressman Mike Synar for the re-election from Oklahoma's 2nd District.

GONYEA: But the honeymoon did not last. After the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981 and several mass shootings, Synar supported stricter gun laws. Here he is on the House floor in 1993.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MIKE SYNAR: The Brady Bill, my colleagues, was introduced in 1987. Six long murderous years have passed. One hundred thousand of our best and brightest citizens have been killed by handguns since it was first introduced.

GONYEA: He would also co-sponsor the ban on assault weapons. The NRA responded by pouring cash and energy into defeating him. They backed Democrats to oppose him in primaries. In '92, Synar's opponent used that support, including full-page ads funded by the NRA, to force a runoff in the primary. At the University of Oklahoma, Nathan Gerth points to the headlines on one of those now-yellowing newspaper ads.

GERTH: You see point blank that the NRA Political Victory Fund is making some bold statements about Synar. Right up front, it's saying he's not only anti-hunter, anti-gun, but he's anti-Oklahoman.

GONYEA: Synar survived that runoff, but in '94 - another Democratic challenger. Synar would defend himself in ads like this one, again, from the University of Oklahoma archive.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: He's not afraid to make powerful enemies if it means standing up for the people of Oklahoma - Mike Synar for Congress.

GONYEA: Painted as too liberal, Synar lost the primary to a retired school principal named Virgil Cooper who would himself go on to lose in November. The NRA did back then something it has since perfected. It got its voters out in large numbers, making guns a hot-button issue. Gene Wallace worked for Mike Synar in those years. He says they didn't fully appreciate that Synar's votes on gun control would hurt him.

GENE WALLACE: We did dismiss it because it wasn't a part of the public square debate. There wasn't anybody calling our office. There wasn't anybody coming to our office and saying, hey, we're fearful that someone is going to take our guns.

GONYEA: The NRA declined a request for comment. There is tragic end to Mike Synar's story. Less than a year after his defeat, he was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1996. He was 45 years old. President Bill Clinton spoke at the memorial service.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BILL CLINTON: And if I hadn't been elected president, he never would have had to vote on that assault weapons ban.

GONYEA: Clinton added...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: He always had that wonderful saying, you know, that if you don't want to fight fires, don't be a fireman. If you don't want to cast votes, don't be a congressman.

GONYEA: That audio from the William J. Clinton Presidential Library. In the decades since, the NRA has escalated its political activity. It wins by painting its opponents as out of touch with the values of their district. In 1994, Congressman Mike Synar was among the first to learn that. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

Biathlon links two things that don't often go together, at least in the United States: cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. It's the only Winter Olympic sport in which the U.S. has never medaled.

The sport ""combines the power and aggression of cross-country skiing with the precision and calm of marksmanship,"" the Olympics website says, adding that biathlon ""has its roots in survival skills practised in the snow-covered forests of Scandinavia, where people hunted on skis with rifles slung over their shoulders.""

Its practitioners must power across the course, heaving themselves up and down inclines — then stop, calm their breathing, and fire rifles at a target 50 meters (164 feet) away.

For biathletes, the fact that their sport involves firearms isn't always comfortable. And following last week's school shooting in Parkland, Fla., some members of the U.S. team are adding their voices to the rising chorus calling for stricter gun control.

On Tuesday night, after he finished competing, American biathlete Lowell Bailey spoke out about the gun he uses to compete — and the type of gun that was used to kill 17 people in Parkland.

""We're a sport that uses a .22-caliber rifle,"" Bailey said, according to Yahoo Sports. ""A .22-caliber rifle that shoots a single round is a much different thing than an AR-15. In my opinion, there's just no reason for assault rifles to be in the hands of ordinary citizens.""

The Florida shooter used a semi-automatic rifle similar to an AR-15.

""I support an assault weapons ban,"" Bailey said, according to The Washington Post. ""I really do. Our country needs to wake up. Our country needs to change. There's just no excuse. I compete against all of these other World Cup nations — Germany, Norway. How good are they on the range? They're great at rifle marksmanship. Do you know how strict their gun control laws are? It's a travesty America hasn't changed and continues to go down this path. It just makes me want to cry.""

His teammate Susan Dunklee has previously described the tension between needing to use a gun for biathlon and hating gun violence.

""Watching the news after the Las Vegas shooting, I just had this disgust about anything gun-related,"" Dunklee told NPR's Melissa Block. ""It really took away the joy that I enjoy doing my sport, just thinking about that and the whole gun culture. Most of the time, I kind of forget that my sport is a gun sport. It's just biathlon: To me it's something totally different.""

""I look at what's happening with all these mass shootings and it's so sad, and it's not OK,"" she added. ""It almost makes me want to just put the rifle down and never touch it again. Sometimes.""

The biathletes experience for themselves how gun control laws vary from country to country. In Pyeongchang, for example, their rifles are stored in lockers. The athletes must check them out each time they practice.

""They're under lock and key,"" Dunklee told Yahoo Sports. ""We each have our own key. We ski around with them, then we bring them right back. Very controlled. Russia does that too.""

""It would be like if you're a runner and someone locked up your running shoes,"" teammate Joanne Firesteel Reid told Yahoo.

Biathletes from other countries are similarly skeptical of the permissiveness of America's gun laws.

""In Norway, it's really strict to buy weapons,"" Norway's Tiril Eckhoff told USA Today. ""I think that's the main thing in America. Everyone can buy a gun, and that's totally wrong, I think.""

U.S. biathlete Tim Burke said that he was devastated when he read what had happened in Parkland. ""What happened back home really put things in perspective,"" he told USA Today. ""I'm an avid hunter. But if locking up all of my sport rifles and hunting rifles meant saving one life, I would do it."""
npr53,npr,['Kayla Williams'],,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15285761,"Queen for a Year

... A woman at war: you're automatically a desirable commodity, and a scarce one at that. We call it ""Queen for a Year."" Even the unattractive girls start to act stuck-up. It's impossible not to notice.

""Queen for a Year."" You won't find the phrase in the dictionary or any compilation of military terms. But say it among soldiers, and they'll know immediately what you mean. That's what we've called American women at war since nurses traveled to Vietnam in the sixties.

There's also this ""deployment scale"" for hotness. Let me explain. On a scale of ten, say she's a five. You know — average looks, maybe a little mousy, nothing special. But okay. Not a girl who gets second glances in civilian life. But in the Army, while we're deployed? Easily an eight. One hot babe. On average every girl probably gets three extra points on a ten-point scale. Useful.

After you're in-country for a few months, all the girls begin to look good — or at least better. It changes — how should I say this? — the dynamics of being deployed.

You could get things easier, and you could get out of things easier. For a girl there were lots of little things you could do to make your load while deployed a whole lot lighter. You could use your femaleness to great advantage. You could do less work, get more assistance, and receive more special favors. Getting supplies? Working on the trucks? It could be a cinch — if you wanted it to be. It didn't take much. A little went a long way. Some of us worked it to the bone. Who says the life of the Army girl has to be cruel? Lots of girls succumbed to temptation. The younger girls were the most susceptible. Many thrived and fed on the male attention they were getting for the first time in their lives.

I did my personal best to resist. So did my friends and the girls I respected. (That's why I respected them.) But many girls became full-fledged Queens for a Year. We saw it. And the guys talked.

The guys loved to talk. It didn't even especially matter what girls did or did not do. By the time it circled back to us (and in Iraq, everything that went around came around extra-fast), it might as well have been true.

""I watched her doing PT today. She was doing dips. She wants it!""

""I saw her in line for chow — she was wearing a tight brown T-shirt. She's looking for some action!""

Creepy.

And the locals? Even worse than Joes. At least some American guys have learned some subtlety about staring at our t***. They'd look out of the corner of their eyes. Or when we were looking away. Either Iraqi guys didn't care or didn't have the practice.

They just blatantly and openly stared at our t***. All the time.

Apparently Iraqis asked our guys if we were prostitutes.

Employed by the U.S. military to service the troops in the same way the Russian army managed sex for its soldiers in Kosovo. I didn't want anyone to think we were the U.S. equivalent of that! None of this means that life in the Army while deployed to a combat zone has to be celibate. ""What goes TDY stays TDY."" It's a longstanding military tradition. License to do as we please while on ""temporary duty"" — that is, while away from our permanent post. And it stays TDY when we return home.

Sex is not specifically prohibited for deployed soldiers. It's just implied that it is not allowed. Yet the PX in Iraq sells condoms.

The general attitude is: ""Don't get caught."" The one rule is: ""Be discreet."" Probably most of the single girls do it. Most of the single guys, too, if they ever get the chance. It becomes a simple matter of supply and demand.

And even though it's not okay, it's true — if a girl was indiscreet, if she got caught, or people knew, everyone lost respect for her. Like she was some slut. It was different, of course, for the guys. Somehow everyone got it that getting laid was okay for the guys.

So get real. The Army is not a monastery. More like a fraternity.

Or a massive frat party. With weapons. With girls there for the taking — at least some of the time.

The guys are there for the taking too. And we took. I took.

But mostly I chose to be a bitch. I was nowhere as young as most of the other girls over there. Nowhere as innocent — at all.

I'd hung around guys almost all my life; my punk rock scene in high school was overwhelmingly male. I'd dealt with sex from a young age. I'd been married.

In Iraq I felt I could deal with being Queen for a Year. But it still got to me. It still got me angry. Sometimes. I remember walking through the chow hall (once it was built) at the airfield was like running a gauntlet of eyes. Guys stared and stared and stared. Sometimes it felt like I was some f****** zoo animal. Guys hitting on us or saying inappropriate things — just constant.

Then sometimes I got in the mood. I'd enter the chow hall with a swing to my step. Check me out. Look. Don't touch. So occasionally it went to my head.

The girls joked, too. Some guys we met in Iraq were no prime specimens themselves. Funny nose, bad posture, bad teeth, whatever.

But they also looked better. Always. So it worked both ways.

Location, location, location. It played with all our minds.

It was like a separate bloodless war within the larger deadly one.

Family members of some of the victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., have filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and seller of the rifle used by the gunman to kill 26 people.

The lawsuit filed on behalf of 10 victims claims that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle never should have been sold to the public because it is a military weapon. Nine of the families suing lost members in the shooting. Natalie Hammond, another plaintiff, was a teacher at the school who survived the rampage.

The Associated Press reports:

""In addition to Bushmaster, the families have named Camfour, a firearm distributor, and Riverview Gun Sales, the store where the Bushmaster rifle was purchased in 2010. Messages seeking comment from the defendants were not immediately returned. ""The 40-page complaint was filed in superior court in Bridgeport.""

It was two years ago yesterday that 20-year-old Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and opened fire, fatally shooting 20 children — some as young as 5 years old — and six adults.

President Trump speaks to the National Rifle Association, the gun rights group that strongly backed him in the 2016 campaign. NPR takes a look at what is on his agenda when it comes to gun rights.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

The nation's powerful gun lobby spent a lot of money in last year's presidential race. And today the winner of that race showed up to thank them for their effort.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The eight - year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.

(APPLAUSE)

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

That's President Trump delivering the keynote speech at the National Rifle Association's annual convention in Atlanta today. In a few moments, we'll hear how gun control advocates are focusing their strategy in the Trump era.

SHAPIRO: First, with a friendly president and a Republican controlled-Congress, the NRA is ready to go on offense. NPR's Scott Horsley takes a look.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Donald Trump is the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to attend an NRA convention. He told the gathering in Atlanta, he's well aware the NRA worked long and hard to put him in the White House.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.

HORSLEY: The NRA did come through for Trump, spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising in last year's election at a time when many conservative groups were sitting out the presidential race.

Sheila Krumholz directs the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign money. She says the NRA and its affiliates were among the top 10 spenders in last year's race.

SHEILA KRUMHOLZ: They're a powerhouse. The NRA has long been one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington. They have money and members, and they use both to great effect.

HORSLEY: The NRA seemed less concerned about electing Trump last year than defeating Hillary Clinton. Krumholz says the group spent more than $10 million on pro-Trump TV ads. But it spent almost twice that much on commercials targeting Clinton like this one, which shows a woman reaching for a handgun when an intruder breaks into her house.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: She'll call 911. Average response time - 11 minutes. Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.

HORSLEY: These ads ran heavily in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina. Trump won all three. And at today's convention, Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre of the NRA was ready to celebrate.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WAYNE LAPIERRE: Our victory in that fight has made possible the fights we continue to face, and face them we will.

HORSLEY: In Washington at least, the NRA no longer has to worry about fending off gun safety proposals like expanded background checks or limits on magazine sizes. Instead, it can push its own affirmative agenda. And topping that list is national reciprocity for concealed carry permits. LaPierre notes the NRA has been pushing for concealed carry for 20 years.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: The NRA is the reason today that 15 million Americans legally carry a firearm for personal protection.

HORSLEY: If the group's successful in winning national reciprocity, anyone with a permit to carry a concealed weapon in one state would be allowed to do so in all 50 states, essentially overriding the rules in states with stricter concealed carry laws. Trump has backed the idea. Though, he didn't discuss it in his speech today.

Instead, the president made an appeal to hunters and fishermen, noting his interior secretary has reversed a last-minute Obama rule restricting lead shot and fishing sinkers. Over the last two decades, though, personal protection has eclipsed hunting as the leading rationale for gun ownership. And the NRA has shifted its focus, too. LaPierre today sounded a populist, nationalist tone very much in keeping with Trump's own campaign rhetoric.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: It's up to us to speak up against the three most dangerous voices in America - academic elites, political elites and media elites. These are America's greatest domestic threats.

HORSLEY: The NRA leader is putting gun rights dead center in the culture wars. And there's nothing concealed about the political weapons he's carrying. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House.

Not all gun-rights advocates support the NRA's opposition to gun control. NPR's Scott Simon speaks to Mike Weisser, a semi-automatic rifle owner and seller, who wants much stricter controls.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Mike Weisser knows about guns. He spent half of his life in the gun business - selling guns, importing them, writing about them, teaching people how to use guns. He owns six semi-automatic rifles, and he likes to shoot them. But he wants to see the weapons heavily regulated. Mike Weisser joins us now from the studios of New England Public Radio in Springfield, Mass. Thanks so much for being with us.

MIKE WEISSER: My pleasure. Thank you for having me on.

SIMON: What do you own those six semi-automatics?

WEISSER: I like guns. So I don't really make a distinction between one gun or another. If I like it and I want to shoot it, I own it. I also own I don't know how many handguns. I don't know how many shotguns. It's a lot.

SIMON: And you're a collector?

WEISSER: No. No, I'm simply a gun nut. We're people who are hobbyists with guns the way other people are hobbyists with ham radios. I mean, if you go to a weekend model train show, same kind of people.

SIMON: Well, but you - I mean, as I don't have to tell you, I'm sure, guns are lethal in a way model trains or stamps aren't.

WEISSER: That's right. And that's one of the reasons why I've always felt very uncomfortable with the argument of not regulating them Because, you know, we have a long history of regulating all kinds of dangerous products. You know, regulation does not mean you can't get your hands on it.

SIMON: What kind of regulations would you like to see for semi-automatics?

WEISSER: What I would like to see is that there'd be a measurement of how lethal a particular weapon is. And the more lethal it is, the more it has to be regulated in a sense of what the buyer has to do to buy one and what the buyer has to do to show that he or she knows how to use it properly and what the buyer has to do to show that he or she is keeping their hands on the gun.

Because if we don't have a really good system - and it's not hard to do it - to keep track of guns in people's houses so that this theft rate starts to drop, we can talk all we want about law-abiding citizens, you know, and doing background checks, but if you've got a couple hundred thousand guns going out into the population that are there to be used as crime guns, then you're going to have an awful lot of gun violence.

SIMON: I'm told you're a lifelong - lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.

WEISSER: I'm a life member, correct. I've been a member of the NRA since I was 11 years old in 1965.

SIMON: Why are you still a member of the NRA?

WEISSER: Because when I joined the NRA, the NRA focused on the two things that I think guns should be used for by people who aren't in the military. And that's sports shooting and hunting. They still do that, although that's become really not their major focus. They also are the premier training organization. And I'm a certified NRA trainer. So, you know, I don't want to be on the outside just kind of yelling at them. Frankly, if they would get off this kick of the armed citizen and using guns for protection against crime, they wouldn't hear any noise from me. I just don't happen to like the position they've been taking over the last several decades to promote the sale of guns.

SIMON: And how (laughter) - how congenial do you find your viewpoint among gun owners? I know you hear from a lot of people.

WEISSER: Well, you know, I'm - it's not a congenial viewpoint. It's not something that most of the gun owners feel comfortable with. You know, I didn't start coming out publicly on these positions because I wanted to win any popularity contests. I thought it had to be said.

SIMON: Mike Weisser, who writes about guns for the Huffington Post - thanks very much for being with us.

WEISSER: My pleasure. Thank you very much for having me on.

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Sommers II/Reuters John Sommers II/Reuters

Editor's note, June 16: An earlier version of this story said Omar Mateen carried an AR-15, based on comments from Orlando Police Chief John Mina, who said Sunday that the gun was an ""AR-15-assault-type rifle."" Law enforcement officials subsequently told NPR that the gun was a Sig Sauer MCX, a rifle similar to an AR-15 but also different in fundamental ways. This story reflects the change.

When Omar Mateen embarked on his deadly rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday, he carried an assault-type rifle called a Sig Sauer MCX, law enforcement sources tell NPR.

The MCX is described by its manufacturer as ""the ultimate modern hunting rifle"" that is ""engineered from the ground up to be short, light and silenced.""

It is similar in appearance and lethality to the AR-15, the name given to a very popular family of rifles made and sold by nearly two dozen companies. Law enforcement sources call the MCX an ""AR-15 equivalent made by a different manufacturer.""

AR-15's were used in some of the most infamous mass murders in recent history, including the 2012 shootings of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

They were also used in the killings that same year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and last year's ISIS-inspired shootings at a government office building in San Bernardino, Calif.

After Sunday's massacre in Orlando, the New York Daily News dubbed the AR-15 ""the mass murderer's best friend.""

The AR-15 is popular with gun owners, in part because it's lightweight and easy to handle. Its long barrel generally makes it shoot more accurately, especially at great distances, and it tends to come with a high-capacity magazine.

""They've really caught on, just because of their military styling and because of their ease of use and customization. They're very highly customizable. You can put on your own component parts to it, take things out and easily put new things in. So some people have likened it to the iPhone of guns,"" says Adam Winkler, professor of constitutional law at UCLA and the author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in an interview with NPR.

Despite its similarities, the MCX is also fundamentally different from an AR-15.

Its internal operating system — its method of propelling bullets from its chamber and cycling to the next round — works differently, and several gun experts contacted by NPR say they do not consider it to be part of the large family of AR-15 rifles.

""With an innovative short-stroke gas piston operating system, users can change barrels, calibers, stocks and handguards in the field,"" according to a company brochure.

Weapons such as these — often referred to as assault-type rifles — were prohibited by Congress in 1994, but the ban expired a decade later, and since then their popularity has only grown, says Winkler.

Mateen bought the MCX legally, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He also carried a 9 mm pistol.

""He is not a prohibited person, so he can legally walk into a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms. He did so. And he did so within the last week or so,"" ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Trevor Velinor said Sunday."

Updated at 6:35 p.m. ET Saturday

As a groundswell grows against the National Rifle Association in the aftermath of last week's school massacre in Parkland, Fla., several businesses say they are ending their partnerships with the gun advocacy group.

The brands — ranging from insurance companies to airlines to rental car agencies — announced their decisions on social media, many apparently in direct response to tweets demanding change under the trending hashtag #boycottNRA.

Activists are seeking to name and shame business affiliates of the group.

On its website the NRA says, ""It pays to be a member! Get back hundreds of dollars more than you pay in dues"" and offers ""benefits"" running the gamut from home and auto insurance to prescription drug discounts to the ""Official Wine Club of the NRA.""

By Saturday, Delta and United Airlines both joined a growing list of companies distancing themselves from the NRA. Both said they would no longer offer discounts to members.

First National Bank of Omaha got the ball rolling on Thursday when it announced via tweet that it ""will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card."" It was responding to a tweet saying ""Please END your relationship with the @NRA. #NRABloodOnYourHands."" The bank said ""customer feedback"" spurred it to review its relationship.

A day later, Symantec, the cybersecurity company, said it had halted its NRA discount program.

About an hour after that, insurance company MetLife followed suit, tweeting, ""We value all our customers but have decided to end our discount program with the NRA.""

Then rental car companies hopped on board. Enterprise Holdings, which owns and operates car rental agencies Alamo, Enterprise and National, announced via tweets Friday from each brand's account that by March 26, it would sever its NRA member discount program.

Hertz's move came later in the day.

And the list went on.

On Tuesday, ThinkProgress, a project of the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund, published a list of some two dozen ""corporate partners"" that offer incentives to NRA members. ThinkProgess says it asked all of the corporations ""whether they plan to continue their relationships with the gun lobby. A growing number of those companies have ended their relationship with the NRA since this list was initially published.""

By their count, more than a dozen have already ended their relationships.

Company spokespeople reached by NPR would not elaborate on the announcements.

In a statement released Saturday, the NRA said the companies were punishing NRA members, ""in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice. In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve.""

The statement went on, ""Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.""

Many social media users have maintained their support for the group, which says it has 5 million members. Some said they would boycott the companies severing ties with the NRA.

The Huffington Post reports that several companies are continuing to stick by the NRA.

But it is not a novelty for companies to distance themselves from the group after mass shootings.

ThinkProgress reports Wyndham Worldwide stopped offering NRA discounts after a pressure campaign in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012.

But the parent company of major hotel brands including Travelodge, Howard Johnson, Ramada and Days Inn emphasized the distance by tweeting Friday that it ""is no longer affiliated with the NRA.""

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre addressed the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday and spoke of ""the breakneck speed for gun control laws,"" following the Florida shooting. ""As usual, the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,"" he said.

Meanwhile, some teachers in Florida were unsettled to learn earlier this week that the retirement funds to which they've been contributing invest in the gun company that produced the weapon used in the Parkland attack. Bloomberg News reports the Florida Retirement System Pension Plan held more than 41,000 shares in American Outdoor Brands Corp. (formerly Smith & Wesson), maker of the AR-15 rifle used by the shooter.

The president of the Florida teachers union has called for the fund to divest itself of shares. But The Washington Post reports that a spokesman with the state pension fund said that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

Student survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that left 17 of their classmates and educators dead are also using their platform to increase pressure on the NRA.

On Wednesday, at a CNN town hall, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio broke with an NRA stance when he announced he would support raising the age from 18 to 21 for ""buying a rifle."" He was responding to a question from student survivor Cameron Kasky. However, during the same exchange, Rubio refused to say he would renounce NRA donations. (Rubio has earned the NRA's highest rating, A+.)

Demonstrations by Stoneman Douglas survivors have mobilized students across the country, who have been protesting, staging school walkouts and calling on legislators to act.

""March for Our Lives,"" a national rally, is planned in Washington, D.C., on March 24."

After last month's mass shooting a Florida high school, students around the nation have staged walk-outs, rallies and other demonstrations to advocate for stricter gun measures. In response, some school administrators have threatened to suspend students who protest, and are being criticized for cracking down too hard. At the same time, many colleges are sending the opposite message, encouraging and congratulating students' activism.

In Boston, New Mission High School junior Ariyana Jones says many students at her school have been scared off from participating.

""Teachers will tell you straight up if you walk out, you will get written up and suspended,"" she says. ""They are trying to intimidate us, and I feel like it's working because they don't want to get that on their record or get in trouble.""

Needville, Texas Superintendent Curtis Rhodes, was more explicit, posting a warning on Facebook forbidding demonstrations during school hours, and threatening 3-day suspensions for anyone taking part. ""Life is all about choices, and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,"" he wrote. ""We will discipline no matter it if is one, fifty or five hundred students involved... and parent notes will not alleviate the discipline.""

The post has since been taken down, and the school declined comment, but the warning got students worried — and got lawyers involved.

""Really what that is, is retaliation for a student expressing their first amendment rights,"" says Texas ACLU Staff Attorney Kali Cohen. She says the hard line approach is not only unconstitutional, but also flies in the face of public schools' mission, as affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, to prepare young people to be engaged citizens.

And colleges couldn't agree more. Scores of colleges have posted and tweeted to reassure students that if they get suspended for taking part in a peaceful protest, it will not diminish their chances of getting accepted. As MIT put it, students do not have to ""choose between speaking out and getting in.""

Brandeis echoed the sentiment, tweeting ""#Brandeis supports students' right to stand up for their beliefs."" The tweet not only assured students their admission would not be jeopardized if they were disciplined for peaceful protest, but the tweet went further to urge them to go for it, saying ""Speak up, speak out.""

Brandeis says such activism, not only won't hurt students' chances of getting accepted, but may actually help.

""Having the bravery to stand up, to organize people, that takes a lot of courage and that is certainly something that I think would be applauded here,"" said Brandeis University Dean of Admissions Jennifer Walker. ""From a Brandeis perspective, I think speaking up and speaking out is a good fit for our campus culture.""

Students like Michael Martinez, a junior at Weston High School in Massachusetts, are taking comfort in the overwhelming support from colleges. Having personally lost a close relative and a family friend to gun violence, he's volunteering to help coordinate students across Massachusetts to join the National Walk-Out planned for March 14. ""We want this to be more than just a march,"" Martinez says. He's organizing an afternoon of lobbying at the State House, to follow the walk out.

""This is an opportunity for students to really, really get involved in a way that I don't think a lot of students have ever been before,"" he says. ""Young people to practice civic responsibility, service, community leadership and advocacy. I mean, it's a real life lesson, and a lot more valuable than anything a student would be learning in a classroom that day.""

Student organizer Vikiana Petit-Homme, a junior at Boston Latin Academy, agrees.

""Schools should be encouraging youth to speak,"" she says. ""They are there to prepare kids for the future, and [that means] learning to make sure we're heard. They should not be silencing us.""

The outcry from students and parents and the response from colleges seems to have prompted some high schools to soften their stance.

In Virginia, the Prince William County schools sent out a letter last month warning students that those who disrupt classes or leave school without permission will face disciplinary action. But after a bit of a uproar, officials sent a second letter the next day saying they had ""clearly sent the wrong message"" and promising to ""allow for some flexibility.""

But neither can it just be anarchy, says Associate Superintendent Phil Kavits; Schools have to balance students' rights with student safety.

""There have been examples in the past where people have had walk outs and decided to march down busy streets,"" Kavits says. ""And when they do that, we've lost the ability to keep them safe.""

Just this week, some 700 middle school students staged a walk out, after informing school officials that it was coming, and getting their blessing.

In Boston, high school students gathered to plan their March 14 walk out were waiting to hear how friendly their administrators would be to the idea, when School Superintendent Tommy Chang popped in unexpectedly, and pleasantly surprised them. He praised their work, and assured them they will not be disciplined for it.

It was welcome news to students like Petit-Homme. But she's quick to add, no official policy would have stopped her anyway.

""At this point, we've seen the adults are not doing what they're supposed to be doing, which is to keep us safe,"" she says. ""So we're done with going to them and asking for permission. At this point we're just going to do what we have to.""

Yes, Petit-Homme says, protests will be peaceful, but she says students cannot promise that they'll never disrupt the school day.

""The whole point is to be disruptive, to make sure we catch your attention. It's to make sure that you are hearing us. So causing a disruption is exactly what we're going for.""

There's no guarantee if, or when, it may result in real change. But it will almost certainly make for a college application essay the admissions committee will love."

After the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas last year, lawmakers discussed imposing restrictions on ""bump stocks."" The Las Vegas shooter used that type of gun modification, which makes a semiautomatic weapon fire like an automatic weapon, and killed 58 people.

After a gunman killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November, lawmakers discussed how they could improve the background check system.

No new laws came of those discussions.

Now, after a gunman killed 17 people at a Florida high school, President Trump has given some indication of what he thinks could stop further shootings.

""We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health,"" he said in a statement.

Whether that will inspire legislation remains to be seen. Mass shootings often inspire gun-control legislation — legislation that, in recent years, more often than not has languished.

While the president and members of Congress consider how to respond to the Florida shooting, the tool below allows you to see how your state's representatives and senators have voted on major gun legislation over the past two-and-a-half decades.

Because some bills aim to loosen gun restrictions (such as the February 2017 bill to ease restrictions on mentally ill people's ability to get firearms) and some bills aim to tighten them (Dianne Feinstein's 2016 amendment to stop people on the terrorist watch list from getting guns), we have color-coded people's votes in terms of whether they — broadly speaking — voted to increase or decrease gun restrictions.

Votes below include senators' votes from when they were in the House, if they ever served there.

Note: Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby was a Democrat until 1994, when he changed parties.

And here's a brief description of each bill represented above:

Brady Bill (1993, House and Senate): Enacted into law. Refers to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Passed in 1993, the Brady bill established five-day waiting periods and required background checks for gun purchases.

Assault Weapons Ban (1994, House and Senate): Enacted into law, expired in 2004. This law banned people from making, selling or owning certain types of semiautomatic weapons.

Closing Gun Show Loophole (1999, House and Senate): Did not become law. This refers to separate measures in each chamber that would have (broadly speaking) required people purchasing guns at gun shows to undergo a background check and a three-day waiting period.

Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (2005, House and Senate): Enacted into law. This measure protects firearm manufacturers from being sued for crimes committed with the firearms they manufactured.

Concealed Carry Reciprocity (2011 and 2017, House; 2013, Senate): Did not become law. These bills would have allowed a person with a concealed-carry permit in one state to legally carry a concealed firearm in other states.

Manchin-Toomey Bill (2015, Senate): Did not become law. This bill would have required background checks for the purchase of guns at gun shows and online.

Murphy Amendment (2016, Senate): Did not become law. This measure would have expanded background checks to cover guns sold online and at gun shows.

Feinstein Amendment (2016, Senate): Did not become law. This measure would have barred people on terrorist watch lists from buying firearms.

Mental Health (2017, House and Senate): Enacted into law. This bill undid an Obama-era regulation that added some people with mental illnesses to the FBI's background check database.

Part of the reason some gun laws fail, as stated before, is that gun control votes tend to fall so sharply along party lines. But the data show that Democrats, who favor gun control more than Republicans, tend to be more likely than Republicans to break ranks.

Of the bills we analyzed, here is how House votes broke down within the two parties:

Loading...

On the Senate side, the split is more straight along party lines, but there are a few exceptions — for example, with the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

Loading...

We broke out the people who broke with their party most often on the bills we studied here. On the Senate side, North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp has voted against stricter gun control (or for looser gun control) on every major gun control bill we studied since she took office in 2013. In the chart below, a white X denotes votes where a member of Congress voted differently from most of their fellow party members.

And on the House side, Georgia Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop has voted against his party on five gun control bills.

Again, though, there are more gun control bills than represented here. The point isn't to capture every gun bill vote ever, but to allow people to see how the people who represent them have voted on some key pieces of legislation.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Lawmakers in Washington and Tallahassee have discussed a lot of ideas to reduce school shootings, but on the hardest questions — like what to do about guns — there is just no clear consensus.

There are few signs of clarity from President Trump, who has taken a leading role in the debate without providing strong direction to solve the problem.

Trump started out voicing support for several options that crossed party lines. But lately the bipartisan message has gotten muddled. For one thing, Trump has been spending more time with the National Rifle Association, and it's beginning to show.

No consensus

Some Republican lawmakers want to raise the age limit to buy a long gun to 21 from 18; others, like the NRA, do not.

Trump voiced support for this proposal last week but didn't mention it at last week's Conservative Political Action Conference, where the NRA had a big presence, nor did Trump talk about it at a White House meeting with governors on Monday, after he had lunch with NRA leaders over the weekend.

Background checks have broader support. On Meet the Press on Sunday, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who has sponsored a bill to vastly expand background checks, said it may be up to Trump whether this happens or not.

""The president's expression of support for strengthening our background check system is very constructive. The president can play a huge and, in fact, probably decisive role in this,"" Toomey said.

But even though Trump says he wants ""comprehensive"" background checks, he has only supported a House bill that would tweak the current background check system. It would not make it universal nor close the gun show loophole, as would the bill that Toomey sponsored with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. in the months after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

The House bill, which is backed by the NRA, also includes a provision to loosen existing gun restrictions. It would allow people with permits to carry concealed weapons in their states to carry anywhere in the country — even in states that don't offer conceal-carry privileges. That provision is opposed by Democrats in the Senate.

The president also says he wants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to ban bump stocks, a gun accessory that allows a semi-automatic weapon to fire like an automatic weapon. But the ATF says that it doesn't have the power to ban bump stocks and that a ban would have to be legislated by Congress.

The NRA says it does not support banning bump stocks, despite coming out for more regulation of them after the massacre on the Las Vegas Strip last year.

Democrats and some Republicans are willing to reinstate the ban on some styles of assault weapons, but others including Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Trump and the NRA are not.

This suggests the debate may follow the same path we've seen after other mass shootings — a spike in support for gun control in the polls, no action by Congress, then fading interest as the moment passes.

Trump's familiar pattern

The main thing the president talks about now is ""hardening"" schools and arming some teachers. Those ideas represent the essence of the NRA approach to preventing school shootings — an echo of NRA executive Wayne LaPierre's CPAC speech — but they lack broader support.

The idea of arming teachers hasn't gone through any kind of policy process at the White House. There are numerous questions about how it would work and whether the federal government could have any role in this, since K-12 education is the responsibility of the states.

A White House spokesman admitted last week that there is no plan to turn Trump's idea of arming some teachers into legislation — in other words, the president was just musing about it.

Look back over the past several months of the immigration debate when Trump started by claiming he was searching for consensus, then retreated to a hard-right, maximalist position.

With immigration, the president first said that he would sign whatever Congress sent him and that he would ""take the heat"" if lawmakers compromised. Then, when faced with a bipartisan deal that would have given him full funding for his border wall and a path to citizenship for the people in the U.S. illegally who were brought here as children, he rejected it and insisted on a proposal that would drastically reduce legal immigration instead.

In the gun debate, he has managed to dominate the media narrative — one of the ways Trump measures success — with his proposal to arm some teachers. It's a proposal that has few supporters outside the president's hard-core base — just like the proposal to limit legal immigration.

At the White House meeting with governors, Trump didn't mention the idea of raising the age limit to purchase assault rifles to 21 — a proposal he had seemed to embrace earlier. That left the White House facing questions about whether the NRA twisted his arm when he had that luncheon with the organization's leaders.

""The president's still supportive of the concept,"" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. But the administration is holding out for the details.

The president revealed the NRA lunch to reassure people once again that he can handle the gun lobby.

""I will tell you, they are doing what they think is right. But sometimes, we're going to have to be very tough, and we're going to have to fight them,"" Trump said.

Tipping point for the NRA?

If a Republican president stood up to the NRA and changed the dynamic on gun control, it would be a tipping point in American politics. However, tipping points are most clearly seen in the rearview mirror.

Lots of observers have suggested that this time is different. And it does feel different because of all those young, articulate, social media-savvy students.

They became activists and household names overnight.

But the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting has also been considered a tipping point because of the horror of first-graders being massacred — and nothing happened.

Still, the decision by a growing number of businesses to sever ties with the NRA shows that many companies now feel doing business with the gun lobby is bad for their bottom line.

Whether it's bad or good for Trump and Republicans won't be known until November."

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

In the Florida House, Jared Moskowitz has been one of the more outspoken voices in this debate. He's a Democrat who represents the Parkland area. And when we spoke with him almost two weeks ago, he was frustrated with Washington but optimistic that Florida could come through.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

JARED MOSKOWITZ: Washington is broken. Nothing's going to happen in Washington. But Tallahassee has three weeks. We have three weeks. We have a unique opportunity.

CHANG: Now, with just one week left in their legislative session, some of that optimism is gone.

MOSKOWITZ: The bill is still moving along. But this obviously is not where I thought the process was going to go. The bill does keep guns out of the hands of people like Nikolas Cruz, but now it also potentially could do other things that really were never part of this conversation. And so we have a bill in which the two sides have come together. We are talking. We are compromising. And sometimes when you do compromise, that means both sides have to get something.

CHANG: And both sides have to give something up.

MOSKOWITZ: And both sides have to give something up. I, obviously, am against arming teachers. I was against it from day one. I filed the amendment to take it out in committee. I filed the amendment on the floor to take it out of the House bill on the floor. But at the same time, in the bill is monumental gun control for the state of Florida, which we've not been able to do in 20 years and may not get another crack at it again for a long period of time.

CHANG: What would you be willing to give up in order to get a gun control legislation package passed?

MOSKOWITZ: I am willing to give up certain things to get the marshal program, which is the optional program to arm teachers out of the bill. And I am working on that. You know, what specific I'm willing to give up - I'm not willing to tell the other side exactly what I'm willing to give up yet because we're still having negotiations. And they might listen to NPR. You know, we'll continue to have that dialogue, continue to have that conversations. We got a week left to get this done. A week is an eternity when it comes to negotiating a bill.

CHANG: Are there any lines in the sand that you would draw? Is there anything the other side wants that you absolutely will not consider?

MOSKOWITZ: I mean, the answer to that is of course, which is that this can't just turn into a bill that doesn't answer the ultimate question. Would this have prevented another Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting? Would this bill keep guns out of the hands of people like Nikolas Cruz? So if they want to start getting rid of things like, well, you can be under 21 and still buy guns or you're not going to have a waiting period - if they start getting rid of stuff like that, then at the end of the day, then we have to kill the bill.

CHANG: Is there any middle ground that you could stomach with this proposal to possibly arm teachers or other staff at schools?

MOSKOWITZ: Well, listen, it gives me indigestion. I mean, I'm already stomaching the optional program. I mean, I can tell you if they wanted to mandate the program, that's a complete deal breaker I think. We - then this bill would die under its own weight. It's objectional (ph) to me because I'm trying to take guns off the streets. I'm trying to get guns out of the hands of people like Nikolas Cruz. I'm not trying to put more guns in places. And so we've got to be very careful as we move forward on what we can get accomplished here and then give these kids - give these kids a win that they can take to D.C. so they can accomplish what they've been working so hard on since this tragedy happened at Douglas.

CHANG: There are so many conflicting forces going on here. You've had a lot of people traveling to the Capitol to put pressure on you guys, on the lawmakers. You have the NRA and their supporters. You have the survivors of the Parkland shooting. What do you think? Which side seems to have more influence over your colleagues right now?

MOSKOWITZ: Well, that's tough to say. It's obviously based on where they're from and their district. I mean, I would tell you that, you know, Democrats are hearing from parents that want gun control. We're also hearing from teachers that don't want this program, this Marshal program, even though it's optional. I think Republicans are hearing from the NRA big time. The NRA is sending out emails saying we need to find people to primary these Republican-elected officials. The NRA is saying we're going to spend more money in Florida in races than we've ever spent before. So the NRA is in full force. You may not see it if you're in a Democratic district, but if you're in a hardcore Republican district, they're getting hammered. And they're also hearing from teachers that don't like the optional marshal program.

So everyone right now is hearing from their constituents, hearing from their activists, hearing from their neighbors. We cannot leave here without a bill. That's just got to be the ultimate, ultimate answer of whether or not we succeeded or failed these kids. This bill is already not what they want. They want different stuff. But the idea that we did nothing and we failed them - that's got to be totally unacceptable.

CHANG: Jared Moskowitz is a Democrat and represents the Parkland area in the Florida House of Representatives. Thank you very much.

MOSKOWITZ: Thank you.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wallheiser/AP Mark Wallheiser/AP

House and Senate Republican lawmakers in Florida unveiled a package of sweeping gun control proposals on Monday, which they hope to pass before a legislative recess in two weeks.

The measures are aimed at making schools safer for children but present a challenge to the National Rifle Association's grip on the state's Republican leaders, including the self-professed gun-toting governor, who presented his own plan Friday.

If passed, it will be the first time in more than a decade that lawmakers advance any legislation opposed by the NRA, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

The bills under consideration by the Senate Rules Committee address several concerns raised by gun-control advocates who have been pressuring politicians to enact more protective measures in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Many advocates attended Monday's hearing wearing orange T-shirts with the slogan Gun Reform Now.

The GOP plan bears several similarities to the one proposed Gov. Rick Scott; both would raise the legal purchasing age of firearms to 21 from 18, implement a ban on bump stocks, increase school safety protocols and give police and courts more authority to take guns out of the hands of anyone deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.

Where they diverge, is in the debate over arming qualified school teachers. Like President Trump, Republican lawmakers argue student safety would be bolstered if teachers with concealed-carry permits and at least 132 hours of weapons training could carry guns on campus. Under the changes they would be acting under auspices of local law enforcement.

House Speaker Richard Corcoran is a gun-rights activist and helped craft the plan. NPR's Greg Allen reported the Republican called it the most far-reaching proposal of any of the 50 states.

Student victims, Democratic leaders and Scott oppose the strategy, which is being called a ""marshal plan.""

In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Scott said he opposes the idea of giving teachers guns. ""I want our teachers to teach. And I want our law enforcement officers to be able to protect the students,"" Scott said on the show. ""I want each group to focus on what they're good at.""

But, the Herald-Tribune reported, the governor would ""authorize sheriff's offices to train school personnel to help protect students, if sought by local school boards.""

The state GOP also goes a step further in seeking to impose a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases.

One provision not included in the bills lawmakers are considering is a primary concern for student activists from Douglas High School: a ban on high-powered semiautomatic rifles, including the AR-15 which was used by the gunman to kill 17 students and employees. The Tampa Bay Times reported Democrats, who are largely outnumbered, are seeking to add an amendment to one of the bills that would make buying an AR-15 illegal.

Other security measures backed by leaders from both parties include additional funding to ""harden schools"" with metal detectors, bulletproof glass, steel doors and upgraded locks. And Greg reports, there is bipartisan support for expanding mental health services in schools.

The House Rules Committee will take up a similar package on Tuesday."

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks to Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman, who chairs the Florida Supreme Court Task Force on Mental Health, about gun violence and mental health. Leifman offers a look at what role courts can play in preventing something that hasn't happened yet.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Lawmakers are trying to figure out if there is a way to prevent the next mass shooting, and part of that challenge lies with the mental health system. Yesterday we spoke to psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl from Vanderbilt.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

JONATHAN METZL: Psychiatric diagnosis is itself not a predictive science. In other words, there's nothing in psychiatric diagnosis that's going to tell you how somebody is going to act in one week or one year. And in that sense, putting psychiatrists in the position of having to predict something in the future is really at odds with their expertise.

CHANG: We wanted to look at the legal side of the prevention puzzle. If a judge commits someone to a mental hospital, their name can be added to a list that would show up on a background check for buying a new gun. The law varies from state to state, but Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman says in his state of Florida, the bar is very high.

STEVE LEIFMAN: What we're looking at in order to meet the criteria for actual involuntary commitment is they have to be imminently dangerous to self for others, meaning that they have to basically have a gun to their head or someone else's head. And anything short of that, they don't generally meet that criteria anyway.

CHANG: I asked Judge Leifman how he makes these assessments about someone's mental state even though he's not a clinician.

LEIFMAN: You know, the reality is most judges, particularly on the criminal bench, see more people in a week with serious mental illnesses than a psychiatrist may see in a month. I mean, that's - the bigger story here is that we have this horrific, fragmented, under-resourced mental health system that does not provide the resources that people need for recovery.

And so the default system for people with serious mental illnesses is a criminal system, even more than this probate system, that looks at people that have gone to a hospital, that are deemed dangerous to self for others. Or they're self-neglecting so bad that they're putting their own life at risk.

CHANG: When you're deciding whether they meet that criteria, as you say, are you thinking to yourself at some point that you could be taking away someone's Second Amendment rights, so you have to be very careful? Does that weigh on you as you're trying to make your assessment?

LEIFMAN: Honestly I think the primary concern of the court is not necessarily at the moment thinking about what their Second Amendment right is. And it's not that we're diminishing that. But the immediate concern is that they may be in a state where they could kill themselves or they could kill somebody else. And so it's less about, at that moment, what their Second Amendment right is and more about making sure that they are safe and secure and that the public is safe and secure.

CHANG: As we heard, the psychiatrist we spoke to was pretty adamant that there is no crystal ball out there for knowing when someone is going to be dangerous. And yet both psychiatrists and judges are put in the position of trying to anticipate violence. How do you feel about being put in that position?

LEIFMAN: It's difficult. The doctor is absolutely correct. There are no screening tools out there that can predict dangerousness. We have very good screening tools that can predict future criminality, and we use those in our criminal system with our mental health program here. But there is no crystal ball. And so...

CHANG: Does that make you uncomfortable, that you are put in the position to make hard judgment calls but there is no crystal ball?

LEIFMAN: I don't think judges feel uncomfortable. I mean, we make difficult decisions every day. And what you do is you just rely on the evidence that's in front of you, and you apply it to the law. I think where judges might get in trouble is if they start trying to guess what may happen. And so as long as you stay focused on what the evidence is and what the law requires, you're usually in a pretty good position.

CHANG: Yesterday at the White House, President Trump said it should be simpler to take guns away from people who pose a threat. Let me play some of the tape for you.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man's case that just took place in Florida. He had a lot of firearms. They saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So you could do exactly what you're saying but take the guns first; go through due process second.

CHANG: Take the guns first; go through due process second. As a judge, what do you think about that?

LEIFMAN: Well, I don't think any judge likes to hear putting due process in the backseat. Due process is required in any situation. Now, there are some states that have these red-flag types law...

CHANG: Yeah.

LEIFMAN: ...That actually allow you to go to court first similarly to what we do for injunctions on domestic violence. The judge signs the order very quick as long as there is some evidence that the person meets whatever the criteria is under the law, and then law enforcement should then be able to take the weapon. But I think you're going to probably run in some - to some constitutional issues if you just start seizing property from people without some kind of due process.

CHANG: When we think about legislative options to limit rights such as the Second Amendment, can you tell us a little bit about what we should be weighing?

LEIFMAN: You know, there are limits on most, if not all constitutional protection. The First Amendment, which comes before the Second Amendment, also has limitations. You cannot go into a movie theater and yell fire. Even though that's free speech, it clearly could cause a danger to public safety. So there are limits to all fundamental rights. They can't be abused. And so I think people can be foolish sometimes when they say they are absolute rights because they just aren't. You have to always be able to weigh these against the public safety.

Look; we don't allow convicted felons to own firearms. We don't allow people that have been convicted of domestic violence to own firearms. And so I don't think anyone that may be exhibiting at a particular moment a very serious situation should probably be able to hold onto their firearm. That doesn't mean that there shouldn't be some kind of due process to make sure that happens, but I do think a lot of what we do is balancing rights against protecting the public.

CHANG: What more authority would you want as a judge that you don't have right now to try to play a greater role in preventing mass shootings or gun violence?

LEIFMAN: So in Florida, we do not have the authority to take guns away from people that may have been found dangerous to self or others. We only have authority to put them on a list to stop the purchase of the firearm. But if they already own a gun, there's nothing we can do, which makes no sense at all.

And I think that it's hard for us to just think that if we point fingers at people with mental illnesses, we're going to fix this horrible problem of, you know, gun violence at schools or mass shootings. It's bigger than that. And people with mental illnesses are only a small part of the problem. And so it's about fixing the broader issues.

And I think one of the laws that the legislatures are contemplating around the country is not just removing firearms for people that may have a mental illness. But if someone is acting dangerous period, the police would have the authority to remove the firearm at that point. Just to single just people with mental illnesses out is not going to fix the problem.

CHANG: Judge Steve Leifman chairs the Florida Supreme Court Task Force on Mental Health. Thank you very much.

LEIFMAN: Thank you.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Colin Hackley/Reuters Colin Hackley/Reuters

Florida's Republican governor is calling for a range of measures that aim to prevent shootings like the one that occurred last week in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and staff were killed.

In a news conference Friday in Tallahassee, Rick Scott said he wants new laws and programs that fall into three categories: gun laws, school safety and mental health.

PBS NewsHour YouTube

He did not ask for any specific weapons to be banned and more than once mentioned that he is a member of the National Rifle Association.

""I know there are some who are advocating a mass takeaway of Second Amendment rights for all Americans,"" Scott said. ""That is not the answer. Keeping guns away from dangerous people and people with mental issues is what we need to do.""

Here's what he called for in Florida:

People under 21 will be banned from buying or possessing firearms, with some exceptions for military and law enforcement.

A ban on the sale or purchase of bump stocks.

$450 million for a safe schools initiative, which will put a law enforcement officer in every public school — at least one officer for each 1,000 students. He does not believe arming teachers is a solution.

Money from this program will also be used to fund ""school-hardening"" measures such as metal detectors, bulletproof glass, steel doors and upgraded locks.

President Trump has left his Republican allies confused about his intentions on guns, concerned about his moves on trade and curious about the state of his White House staff.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Here are just two data points from a chaotic week. On Wednesday, President Trump held a televised meeting with lawmakers. He appeared to endorse gun legislation, including measures opposed by the NRA. He accused fellow Republicans of being afraid of the NRA. Well, then yesterday, Chris Cox, the top NRA lobbyist, dropped by the Oval Office. Cox came out saying that the president does not support gun control. And the president wrote on Twitter he had a, quote, ""good, great meeting with the NRA."" NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here to help us figure this out. Hey, Tam.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey.

GREENE: So do we know after these last few days where the president stands on gun control?

KEITH: Not exactly. So Chris Cox, the NRA lobbyist, came out of that meeting and, as you say, he tweeted that the president and vice president support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control. Now...

GREENE: Seemed in very good spirits compared to what we thought the NRA was feeling just a day before.

KEITH: Well, that's because they had just talked to the president in the Oval Office late at night and apparently had a good meeting. And, you know, this follows, earlier in the week, President Trump had this televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers where he seemed to side with Democrats on all kinds of things, including - and he went farther than Democrats on this - the idea that you would take the guns first and go through due process second. He endorsed all sorts of legislation. Well, now today, Sarah Sanders, his spokesperson, who, we should say, doesn't always exactly represent the president's views - but she was on ""Fox & Friends"" and was asked, OK, what does the president support now?

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX & FRIENDS"")

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Look, the president's already expressed support for Senator Cornyn's legislation. He's also supported the Stop Gun Violence Act. Those are two pieces of legislation in their current form that the president supports. The Toomey bill he has not fully gotten on board with. They're still kind of working out some of the final pieces of that legislation. Until it gets into its final stage, we're not going to weigh in. But we're continuing to closely watch that.

GREENE: OK. So she's throwing out the names of a lot of bills there, Tam, but safe to say that she's talking about some of the things that the president had originally said he would support that the NRA is against.

KEITH: Yeah. So the first bill she talked about is a narrow change that would basically make it so that more information gets into the background check system. That has been even supported by the NRA. The Toomey bill that she's referring to is a more comprehensive background checks bill that, at that meeting on Wednesday, President Trump had said, hey, this should be the base bill. Add all kinds of other stuff into it and let's do something comprehensive. Now, the White House is saying, well, we don't really know if the president's going to support that bill or not.

GREENE: All right. I want to play you a little tape here and then ask you something. This is Republican Senator John Thune describing that televised meeting with the president where the president seemed to be siding with Democrats the other day.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN THUNE: You guys saw - you saw it, right? It was - it was wild.

GREENE: I mean, he seems kind of perplexed. Is what Sarah Sanders said this morning going to help out Republicans as they look at this issue and try to figure out where the president is guiding them?

KEITH: Not necessarily. There's just not that much clarity. When things change from day to day and hour to hour, members of Congress aren't going to stick their necks out on an issue that isn't really, you know, on the Republican side, their issue. And already Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate has said that they aren't even going to vote next week on gun legislation as they had thought they might. They're moving on to a banking bill.

GREENE: And all of this comes, of course, in a week where there was a big personnel move at the White House - the resignation of Hope Hicks, the president's very close aide, maybe the most loyal person outside his family. She's leaving the White House. What does this say about the state of things on the Trump team and the president's inner circle?

KEITH: The president's inner circle has fewer and fewer true loyalists in it, and it seems like the president may not be listening to some of those people who are left. The move that he made this week, yesterday, on trade, sort of surprising everyone, making an announcement - he's wanted to do that for a long time. A lot of people have been telling him not to do it. And now, it seems like he's just doing what he wants to do.

GREENE: Including these tariffs that you mentioned on steel imports. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Tam, thanks. We appreciate it.

KEITH: You're welcome.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images

Congress is under intense pressure to pass legislation to curb gun violence, but lawmakers are deeply split over how far to go in limiting access to guns.

Lawmakers from both parties say they want to take action to prevent another deadly attack like the Feb. 14 shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people. Disagreements over gun control measures go beyond a clear partisan split between Democrats and Republicans, leaving even the most popular bipartisan proposal stalled in Congress.

Senate leaders had hoped to fast-track a bill to improve the national background check system and send it to the House for quick consideration. But conservative Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, placed a hold on the bill, preventing speedy passage. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Tuesday that he does not plan to take up any gun measures until the Senate acts first.

""We're waiting to see what the Senate can do,"" Ryan said at a weekly press conference. ""We'll find out what the Senate can do, and we'll address that then.""

Ryan said he is deeply disturbed by the shooting and he wants Congress to delve into failures in the existing law enforcement and background check systems that happened in the lead-up to the Florida shooting.

Many Republicans oppose any limits on gun rights for most people. Ryan said the House is focused instead on preventing criminals and people with a history of mental illness from accessing deadly firearms.

""We do know that there are gaps in the background system that need to be plugged,"" Ryan said. ""We shouldn't be banning guns for law-abiding citizens, we should be focusing on making sure that citizens who shouldn't have guns in the first place don't get them.""

The Senate bill would address some of those concerns with narrow changes to how local, state and federal law enforcement agencies share information. It would make it easier for the FBI and local police to update the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Conservatives like Lee say that the Senate bill doesn't address the core problem with the background check system and that they worry it would deny gun owners their right to due process. Lee and Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and John Kennedy, R-La., sent a letter to Senate leaders opposing that bill, saying they worry it ""might lead to an increase in the likelihood of abuse and administrative error.""

The Senate bill has also drawn criticism from some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who say the bill doesn't go far enough. Schumer is calling on Congress to pass new, broader background checks.

""Not just a little something here, a little something there,"" Schumer said Tuesday in a speech on the Senate floor. ""But comprehensive background checks are supported overwhelmingly by the American people.""

Schumer is also co-sponsor of the narrower Senate bill, which was written in part by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.

Cornyn has complained that the infighting over the narrow bill could be standing in the way of the best opportunity Congress has to pass a gun bill this week.

""This is our chance to show the nation that we refuse to accept shootings at schools and churches as the new normal,"" Cornyn said Tuesday. ""If our attitude is 'I want everything on my list or nothing,' we're going to end up with nothing."""

Rachel Martin talks to Charles Cooke, National Review Online editor, about how the Florida shooting may have started a change of heart on gun policy in the White House, that sentiment isn't universal.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And this week, President Trump pressed lawmakers to come up with a unified plan on gun policy that he can support.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to pursue commonsense measures that protect the rights of law-abiding Americans while keeping guns - and we have to keep the guns out of the hands of those that pose the threat.

GREENE: But it is not entirely clear what measures the president really supports. An NRA lobbyist met Trump yesterday and said that the president does not support gun control. Charles Cooke is editor of National Review Online. And while Cooke supports some regulations, he told Rachel Martin that the recent school shooting has not shaken his belief in gun rights.

CHARLES COOKE: We need to give law enforcement, as long as there is a due process component - a strong due process component - more leeway in removing guns from people who have shown themselves to be violent or have made threats. But in terms of sweeping gun control, I haven't changed my view. And the reason for that is not that I don't care about what happened, or that I don't think it was a disaster for those involved, or that I wasn't personally affected - I have children myself - but because I just strongly disagree that that is - that gun control is the way you will stop this.

RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: President Trump met with Democrats and Republicans from both House and Senate. And in that discussion about what to do about gun violence in the country, the president, a Republican, actually suggested that an assault weapons ban could be a good idea.

COOKE: Well, I think the president is entirely incoherent. He's also somebody who does not have particularly strong views in favor of guns. I understand that he has been defended by the NRA, both on his policy positions and also, oddly enough, just in general. But if you go back to Donald Trump 20 years ago, you will find somebody who was in favor of an assault weapons ban and waiting period and so forth. So we're dealing with an anomaly within the system.

I do think it is much more useful politically to look at the underlying political reality here. And that means looking at what Republicans think of this issue. And, you know, as much as Donald Trump flails around, I don't think that's going to change.

MARTIN: There have been other Republicans who have at least softened their language when thinking about an assault weapons ban. I interviewed a top Republican donor recently who said that he was going to stop supporting candidates who didn't fully embrace an assault weapons ban. Why do you argue that that's a bad idea?

COOKE: Well, I think it's a red herring. I don't think it will do anything. I mean, there are already 10 million AR-15s in the country. It's peculiar to me that we focus in on this weapon. It doesn't have a more lethal capacity than a handgun, especially in a close-range situation.

MARTIN: Do you support raising the age limit for someone to buy an assault-style weapon from 18 to 21, as the president has suggested and which is getting traction among Republicans right now?

COOKE: I don't know. I'm not quite sure whether we have thought this through. At what point do we think somebody is capable of exercising their own judgment? And I feel as if what's happened here is that we looked at the age of this guy in Florida - he was 19 - and we said, well, we would like to stop that post hoc. And so why don't we change the age at which he would have been able to buy a rifle?

The fact that this guy was on the radar and there weren't any tools with which the local sheriff's office could stop him is a big problem. And that proposal, which has been picked up by Marco Rubio, among others, strikes me as the most fruitful one.

MARTIN: So this is the idea of expanding these so-called red flag laws that because so many people had warned about Nikolas Cruz's behavior, there were red flags, right? And a handful of states in this country have already passed these laws that say, listen, someone like Nikolas Cruz, a parent, a teacher, someone in his life, if they had alerted a judge, and a judge had made a decision that this young man should not have weapons, they could have removed those guns from him. Would you advocate a more expansive set of those laws across the country?

COOKE: Yes, absolutely, providing, of course, that there is sufficient due process. But I think, in this case, there would have been more than enough evidence. I mean, the big fear that gun owners have is that the system will be abused. So, for example, you know, I'm a semi-public figure. So someone will call the FBI and say, you know, Charles Cooke is crazy. He made this joke on Twitter, and he's probably going to shoot up a school.

But the point is that if that happened, a judge or a police officer would come and see me, and they would ask my wife and my employer and my friends and others whether I was a threat. And they would, of course, say no. But with Nikolas Cruz, they would have said yes.

MARTIN: You just explained a scenario in which you have faith in American institutions to some degree, and we are living in a moment where a lot of people don't. And, quite frankly, the NRA has spun up that fear, that paranoia that you will not get due process, that this will be left up to some subjective liberal judge who wants to strip you of your Second Amendment rights.

COOKE: Well, I think there are two reasons for that, and I think they're both fair. One is that often, when these laws are implemented, they are implemented by left-leaning politicians. The second thing here - and, again, I think Democrats have themselves to blame for this - is that you have seen over the last two years an almost endless push to restrict Second Amendment rights and strip them, in many cases, from people who the government has put on secret lists. Which is so flagrantly unconstitutional and is obviously going to inspire a lack of trust.

But again, that bill, when it was introduced, was defeated. Hopefully, it will be defeated again. And just because, you know, that bad idea has been put to the - doesn't mean that this can't be done correctly. I'd also just say, I do have a lot of faith in American institutions. Yes, maybe I have the optimist eye as an immigrant, but I think that our institutions are holding up pretty well.

MARTIN: What do you make of this moment writ large when you think about the gun debate in America and how it has been intractable for so many generations now? Do you think this is a moment where something might change if you agree that something should change?

COOKE: Well, as I say, I hope that the Cornyn-Murphy bill passes, which would fix the background check system. And I hope that we have some sort of gun violence restraining order bill. So I do hope something changes. I still think the gun debate is intractable, both because there are so many guns in circulation that it seems to me that we are always going to be tinkering around the edges and also because this issue has, over the years, largely been won by conservatives. And so to dismantle the victories that they have won would take such a long time, that even if you could somehow do it, I'm not convinced there would be a great change.

MARTIN: Charles, thanks so much for your time.

COOKE: Thank you for having me.

GREENE: Rachel was talking there to Charles Cooke. He is the editor of National Review Online.

The House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines – a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas.

On a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle.

In the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him.

However, as The New York Times reports: ""... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.""

The bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures.

Connecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty — who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting – said the bill would undermine states' rights, ""hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,"" according to The Associated Press.

The NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a ""watershed"" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure ""all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.""

In the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats."

A <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/why-own-a-gun-protection-is-now-top-reason/"" target=""_blank"">new national survey</a> shows that protection is the top reason gun owners say they have firearms. In an earlier survey, hunting was their main reason. Melissa Block talks with Michael Dimock of the Pew Research Center about this and other results of the new gun survey.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

A new national survey on gun ownership indicates that 37 percent of U.S. households have guns. The Pew Research Center looked further into who owns guns and why. They surveyed about 1,500 Americans last month and Michael Dimock, the Pew Center's director, joins me to talk about what they found. Michael, welcome back.

MICHAEL DIMOCK: Hi.

BLOCK: Let's look at that 37 percent number first. These are people who report having a gun in their household, a gun either owned by them or by someone else.

DIMOCK: That's right. That's right. About 24 percent of Americans say they themselves own a gun. Another 13 percent live in a household where somebody else owns a gun.

BLOCK: This is a tricky number to get a handle on, right? How reliable do you think those numbers are? Because there are conflicting data on this.

DIMOCK: It is a surprising difficult question to get a good read on. You'd think it would be very concrete but it's not. And you have very different findings from different polls. The General Social Survey has probably one of the most reliable long-term trends on this and they've shown a decline in gun ownership rates, both personal and at the household level, over the past 40 years.

But the Gallup organization has also asked this question for 40 years and they've seen no decline in the rate of gun ownership and they get different proportions saying they have guns in their home. I think some of the complication is, some people may or may not be aware of guns, not just they don't know that it's there at all, but they may have forgotten about it. Some people have inherited a gun from their father. It's an old hunting rifle. It's out in the barn. I think there are different ways people know about guns or think about guns that make it an actually more difficult thing to measure than you'd think. But I think it's safe to say that most Americans today don't have a gun in their home.

BLOCK: I wonder if there would people who might not want to tell people they have a gun in the home, might be reluctant to divulge that information.

DIMOCK: I think it's a possibility. I mean, there are stereotypes associated with gun ownership and there's also a privacy issue. There may be some people who don't want to talk about it.

BLOCK: Or if you have any concerns that your guns might be confiscated, maybe that would be one question you wouldn't want to answer.

DIMOCK: That's true.

BLOCK: Well, of the gun owners whom you surveyed, who are they? What did you learn about them? What are the demographics?

DIMOCK: Well, the demographics are about what you'd expect. There's an enormous gender gap in gun ownership. Men are far more likely to own guns than women. That means that among gun owners, about 74 percent of gun owners are men and only 26 percent of gun owners are women. There's also an enormous divide along racial and ethnic lines.

Whites are far more likely to own a gun than minority groups are. And you also see a big age disparity. Younger folks are less likely to own guns than older Americans. And regional differences; South and Midwest, a little more likely to own guns than in the Northeast, but more so along an urban/rural dimension, much more prevalent in rural areas.

BLOCK: You asked people what the main reason is that the own a gun and you saw a pretty big shift on that, an interesting shift.

DIMOCK: Yes, yes. About 15 years ago, most people who own a gun told us that the main reason they had it was for hunting. Well, it was about half, 49 percent said hunting was the main reason they had a gun. Twenty-six percent said it was for protection. Those numbers have basically flipped around today. We have about half, 48 percent of gun owners, saying that protection now is the main reason that they have their gun and hunting has declined as a focus.

Other data suggests that just fewer Americans hunt these days.

BLOCK: You also asked women gun owners their thoughts on having guns and what did they tell you?

DIMOCK: Right. Well, again, women are far less likely to own guns, but if they do, they overwhelmingly cite protection as the main reason they have it. Again, I think that may reflect that women are less likely to be hunters as much as that they're more likely to be concerned about safety.

BLOCK: And they say 80 percent of them said having a gun makes them feel safer.

DIMOCK: Right. And we find that to be a very, very broad attitude, not only among gun owners, but even among people who live in a household where somebody else owns a gun, that people tend to feel that the gun makes them safer. They feel safer by having it in the household.

By contrast, people without a gun in the household, most of them say they'd be uncomfortable having a gun and the main reason they give is that they're worried about the safety of having a gun in the household. So the division in perspectives on how guns relate to our safety is really, really stark.

BLOCK: Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center, thanks very much.

DIMOCK: Thank you.

The U.S. Supreme Court delivered a major victory to gun control advocates on Monday. The 5-4 ruling allows strict enforcement of the federal ban on gun ""straw purchases,"" or one person buying a gun for another.

The federal law on background checks requires federally licensed gun dealers to verify the identity of buyers and submit their names to a federal database to weed out felons, those with a history of mental illness and others barred from gun ownership.

Significantly, the federal form and identification procedure make clear that only the actual buyers are eligible to make the purchase. It features in boldface these words: ""Warning: you are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm to you.""

In this case, Bruce Abramski Jr. offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun in Virginia for his uncle in Pennsylvania because Abramski thought he could get a law enforcement discount on the gun. Abramski had previously been a policeman but had been fired from the Roanoke, Va., police department for alleged theft.

At the gun dealership, Abramski filled out the federal forms, stating that he was the actual buyer of the gun. He even signed a separate form certifying his understanding that giving a false answer to that question is itself a federal crime.

After he was cleared by the federal database, Abramski gave the gun to his uncle, deposited the uncle's $400 check, and gave him a receipt.

Police later found the receipt after searching Abramski's home in connection with another crime. He was sentenced to five years of probation for lying on the federal form by representing himself as the actual buyer.

He appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that his answer on the form was ""not material to the lawfulness of the sale"" because his uncle could have bought the gun legally on his own.

On Monday the high court rejected that argument by a 5-to-4 vote. Writing for the majority, Justice Elena Kagan said that Abramski's reading would completely gut the twin purposes of the law — to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have them, and to assist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious crimes.

Kagan noted that according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, nearly half of its gun trafficking investigations involve straw purchasers. In the first six months of the 2014 fiscal year, there were 42 prosecutions in which the straw purchase violation was the lead charge, and many others in which it was a charge secondary to another crime, according to the Syracuse University Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Kagan said that were Abramski's view of the law to prevail, it would ""render the required records close to useless"" for aiding law enforcement. ""Putting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a gun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper trail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw,"" she said.

Writing for the four dissenters, Justice Antonin Scalia accused the court majority of making it ""a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner."" Joining his dissent were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

Particularly interesting in Monday's ruling was the vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who in 2008 sided with the court's conservatives in declaring for the first time that individuals have a constitutional right to gun ownership. That decision, written by Scalia, also had language pointedly allowing gun regulations — language that many experts believe was added at Kennedy's insistence.

Monday found Kennedy lining up instead against court conservatives to support the ban on straw purchases.

Many experts, like UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, were somewhat startled by the closeness of the vote. ""It surprised me that there were four justices who would go so far as to say federal law does not outlaw straw purchasing,"" said Winkler. ""That was a pretty significant step toward gutting one of the few viable and effective gun control laws we currently have on the books.""

Reaction from various interest groups was pretty predictable, though the closeness of the vote seemed unexpected.

""The government's out of control, and all three branches are united against the people and the Constitution,"" said Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.

In contrast, Jon Lowy, legal director of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, was relieved. ""The gun lobby was seeking to blast a gaping hole in our federal straw purchase law,"" he said. ""Fortunately, the court rejected that."""

Opponents of expanding background checks for gun sales often raise the fear that it would allow the government to create a national gun registry — a database of gun transactions. In fact, federal law already bans the creation of such a registry. And the reality of how gun sales records are accessed turns out to be surprisingly low-tech.

The trace begins after police seize a gun at a crime scene and then reach out to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives National Tracing Center in Martinsburg, W.Va. — the one place in the country that can investigate where the gun came from.

Here, in a warren of cubicles, ATF contractors are busy on the phones pursuing trace after trace. On a recent visit, they had 700 calls to make. Last year, ATF processed more than 344,000 crime gun trace requests.

Many people assume that ATF has a massive database of gun owners at its fingertips and can instantly access that information. The reality is very different. It involves lots of phone calls — and often, manual labor.

Here's how it works:

Local law enforcement sends ATF the particulars on the gun they've seized: the manufacturer, model, caliber, serial number. ATF then starts running that information back through the distribution chain, contacting the gun manufacturer — say, Glock or Smith & Wesson — and the manufacturer checks its records and identifies the wholesaler it sold the firearm to.

Then, ATF contacts the wholesaler and goes down the record chain until it finds the retail gun dealer. It's that dealer who should be able to say who bought that firearm.

It's up to the federally licensed gun dealer to keep the record of each gun purchase. It's a three-page form called a 4473 that the buyer and dealer have to fill out before a sale.

Scott Hester leads an ATF team that handles urgent gun traces for things like gun trafficking, homicide and violent crime.

""I take it personally that these traces come across my desk, and I'm doing what I can to help solve a crime,"" Hester says.

His cubicle is lined with newspaper headlines about the cases he's proudly handled.

""The very high-profile traces like Gabby Giffords, I worked on that case,"" he says. ""I worked on a case where four officers ... were having coffee [one morning] and they got killed. Newtown, we got called in on that one.""

If they're lucky, the trace can be completed really fast.

""It does not happen very often. But imagine the delight on the cop's face when we can put that gun in that bad guy's hand in 15 minutes,"" Hester says. ""It makes them very happy.""

Hester calls that ""winning the trace lottery.""

About 70 percent of the time, ATF says it can successfully trace a gun back to a buyer. Of course, for local law enforcement, that doesn't necessarily solve things.

That gun could have traded hands many more times after the original sale. It could have been transferred in private sales or maybe stolen. And for ATF, there's a whole other level of complication.

For about a third of the traces, it turns out the gun dealer, the wholesaler or manufacturer has gone out of business.

By law, when they close up shop, they have to ship all their gun purchase documents here to the ATF tracing center in West Virginia.

On a recent visit, the center received a dozen boxes of records from an Alabama gun dealer who's gone out of business. But these gun sale records can come in by the truckload — as many as 3,000 boxes at a time, hundreds of millions of pages in all. Those pages are stored in stacked cartons that line the walls and reach the ceiling. Boxes are everywhere. All of these cartons hold records of gun sales from businesses that have folded.

""On any given day, we will have to hand-search these records,"" says ATF Special Agent Charles Houser, who runs the National Tracing Center.

That's right, hand-search.

That means that if it's a gun maker or seller who's gone out of business, the workers here have to painstakingly leaf through these documents one page at a time looking for a match to the gun they're trying to trace.

""The idea that we have a computer database and you just type in a serial number and it pops out some purchaser's name is a myth,"" Houser says.

The idea that we have a computer database and you just type in a serial number and it pops out some purchaser's name is a myth.

They don't have that searchable, central database because the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby have successfully blocked that through Congress. They argue that a database of gun transactions would be a dangerous step toward a national gun registry.

So tracers comb through page after page of records as they stand amid boxes stacked head-high. ATF gets more than 1 million of these out-of-business records every month. And when they open those boxes of paperwork, who knows what they might find.

Houser points to a table filled with battered, burned and waterlogged gun sale records.

""These look like the Dead Sea Scrolls to me,"" he says. ""These are Hurricane Katrina records we kept. Businesses went underwater, and they went out of business. But they still shipped their records here, and we dried these out in the parking lot.""

And occasionally a gun dealer might deliver a not-so-subtle message with the ledgers — the acquisition and disposition books — he sends in.

""So those not so friendly with the government have maintained their A & D books on paper towel or toilet paper,"" Houser says. And it turns out, that's fine with him. ""As long as you get the records, I'm OK.""

ATF used to put these documents on microfilm. Now, the agency scans them.

""We have to have seven scanners running 16 hours a day or we fall behind,"" Houser says. But even once the pages are scanned, Houser points out, they're still not searchable. They're just making a digital image.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Cliff Owen/AP

""The only difference between the digital images and searching the boxes is that now somebody can sit at a TV screen, and they will flip through page by page. It's not searchable by anybody's name,"" he says.

With so much paperwork flooding in — there's a backlog — about 3,000 boxes right now are waiting to be scanned.

""When we pass 10,000 boxes here, GSA [the General Services Administration], who owns the building, warned us that the floor will collapse,"" Houser says. ""So what we've had to do is rent shipping containers, and then we put those out in the parking lot, and we have to send people out into the shipping containers to search boxes.""

Houser figures that 90 percent of the time, ATF can complete an urgent trace within 24 hours. For a routine trace, it might take a week.

Houser admits that this whole process looks pretty ugly, but he maintains that it is effective.

On the day of NPR's visit, the National Tracing Center completed 1,500 gun traces — with another 5,000 cases still in process."

When Jared Loughner walked into the Tucson gun store where authorities allege he put down his money for a Glock 19 in November, the store owner sent a request to run Loughner's name through the FBI's database of criminals, fugitives, illegal immigrants and mentally ill to see if Loughner was among them.

Loughner had had several run-ins with police for possessing drugs and had been told to leave his community college for erratic behavior. But the arrests never became convictions, and his behavior was never evaluated by state mental health professionals. So like 10 million others across the U.S. last year, Loughner passed and got his gun.

Despite the outcome, it's not people like Jared Loughner — people who may have questionable but not criminal backgrounds — that have gun control advocates worried. It's the database itself, which is only as good as the records that states put into it.

Several studies and experts say those records are often incomplete or missing.

""The [background check system] is gigantically better than nothing, and it is helping to keep people who are not supposed to have guns from getting guns,"" said Matt Bennett, spokesman of the nonprofit group Third Way, formerly known as Americans for Gun Safety. ""But it has very significant holes that are problematic.""

'That's Not Very Reliable'

The database is a 13-year-old system called NICS — the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It pulls records from not only state and local police, but also dozens of other agencies, including the U.S. Park Police, campus police and the U.S. Border Patrol. Except for a few additional restrictions in some states, as long as you're 21 and not in it, you can buy a handgun. If you're 18, you can buy a long gun.

But according to the FBI and a 2005 study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a significant problem is the number of states that are slow or fail entirely to update the final outcome of court cases. For example, the database may include the arrest record of someone charged with murder, but it may not know whether that person was convicted if the state court did not provide that information.

""If there's an open warrant for someone's arrest, the database is usually correct,"" said Robert McCrie, professor of security management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""Where it is not correct is in the disposition of cases — if the charges are later dismissed or the case is continued. That's not very reliable, and that's a problem.""

""Many counties and states don't see it as their duty to put substantial information into the system,"" McCrie said.

Digging Through Records — With A Time Limit

McCrie and other experts say that leaves it up to database researchers to figure out what happened. In some states, researchers have to track the information down at the specific courthouse where the trial occurred, calling a busy clerk's office to ask someone to manually pull the file. Some records are in storage in warehouses or basements.

And according to the law, the researcher has only three days to do it. If the FBI cannot determine whether someone is permitted to buy a gun in three days, in most states the dealer is allowed to proceed with the sale. It's called a ""default proceed.""

In 2005, the latest figures available, the Justice Department determined that more than 3,000 people walked out of a gun store with a firearm that they should not have been able to buy, because records later revealed they were felons or otherwise prohibited from owning a gun.

At that point, it's up to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearm and Explosives to get the gun back.

""Imagine you're law enforcement and you're sent to retrieve the firearm from the felon who bought it or the domestic violence offender,"" said Becca Knox, director of research for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""Not exactly the situation we want to put our law enforcement officers in.""

Some of the biggest challenges for the database, experts say, are domestic violence and drug cases, which often have inconclusive ends. Defendants are sometimes given a year or two to attend treatment, complete community service or enter therapy before a court decides whether a conviction will stand. An arrest is not enough to prohibit someone from buying a gun.

According to the Justice Department, some states are still entering those records manually. In states where records are fully automated, a clerk in a courtroom can punch the information into the database. Other states pass a handwritten piece of paper from one office to the next before it gets entered — a delay that can be costly for victims of domestic violence who have requested immediate restraining orders.

""You can see there's uneven performance,"" Knox said. ""The database is an incredible step forward, but we still have to figure out where the administrative and financial roadblocks are.""

In 2009, the FBI ran 10.8 million background checks on potential gun buyers. About 150,000 people were rejected. Most had felony or domestic violence convictions, or a restraining order, on their records. Less than 2 percent were rejected because of a mental illness."

President Obama announced executive actions Tuesday, intended to curtail gun violence. But if history is any guide, the president's effort may have the unintended effect of boosting gun sales — 2015 was a banner year.

""After San Bernardino, our business went up probably 50 percent,"" John Lamplugh, who has run gun shows in Maryland and Pennsylvania for more than three decades, said, referring to the recent shooting in California. ""It's either two things: They're scared and need to protect [themselves]. Or they're afraid that [the government is] going to take it from them. There's the two things that drive our business.""

According to the Congressional Research Service, there are roughly twice as many guns per capita in the United States as there were in 1968: more than 300 million guns in all.

Gun sales have increased in recent years. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. gun-makers produced nearly 11 million guns in 2013, the year after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre. That's twice as many as they made in 2010.

""There's a gun for every man, woman, and child, more or less,"" says Deborah Azrael of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.

But that doesn't mean every man, woman and child has a gun. The number of armed households has actually declined to about 1 in 3. So an ever larger number of guns is concentrated in a shrinking number of homes:

One of Obama's executive actions would try to expand background checks and improve background check processing. According to the FBI, 23 million background checks were performed in 2015, nearly three times the 8.5 million performed in 2000.

Researchers say a decline in hunting is partly responsible for the shrinking number of households with a gun. Gun ownership rates remain higher in rural areas. And there is considerable variation from state to state. Fewer than 6 percent of households in Delaware and Rhode Island have guns, compared with more than 50 percent in Arkansas, West Virginia and Wyoming."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

Since 1993, the United States has seen a drop in the rate of homicides and other violence involving guns, according to two new studies released Tuesday. Using government data, analysts saw a steep drop for violence in the 1990s, they saw more modest drops in crime rates since 2000.

""Firearm-related homicides dropped from 18,253 homicides in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011,"" according to a report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, ""and nonfatal firearm crimes dropped from 1.5 million victimizations in 1993 to 467,300 in 2011.

There were seven gun homicides per 100,000 people in 1993, the Pew Research Center study says, which dropped to 3.6 gun deaths in 2010. The study relied in part on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate was 49 percent lower in 2010, and there were fewer deaths, even though the nation's population grew,"" according to the Pew study. ""The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults, robberies and sex crimes—was 75 percent lower in 2011 than in 1993.""

All of that is good news — but many Americans don't seem to be aware of it. In a survey, the Pew Research Center found that only 12 percent of Americans believe the gun crime rate is lower today than it was in 1993; 56 percent believe it's higher.

In an effort to explain that finding, the Pew researchers noted that while mass shootings are rare, they capture public interest and are often viewed as touchstone events that help define the year in which the crimes occur. As examples, they cite three shootings in the past two years, in Tucson, Ariz.; Aurora, Colo.; and in Newtown, Conn.

The U.S. gun crime rate peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Pew study says, ending years of growth in gun violence that began in the 1960s. But the rate of suicides committed using a firearm hasn't fallen as fast, they add, noting that 6 out of every 10 gun deaths in America stems from suicide.

""Looking at the larger topic of firearm deaths, there were 31,672 deaths from guns in the U.S. in 2010,"" according to the Pew Center study. ""Most (19,392) were suicides; the gun suicide rate has been higher than the gun homicide rate since at least 1981, and the gap is wider than it was in 1981.""

The study also analyzed the people who've lost their lives to gun violence.

In 2010, 84 percent of those killed were male; 69 percent were between the ages of 18 and 40. And 55 percent of gun homicides that year were black, the researchers found — far higher than their share of the population (13 percent).

The study also notes that while the number of gun homicides has dropped, the number of guns in America hasn't.

Noting that it isn't clear how many Americans have guns in their households, the Pew researchers found that the ""2009 per capita rate of one person per gun in the U.S. had roughly doubled since 1968.""

The federal report included data about where criminals had acquired their weapons.

""In 2004 (the most recent year of data available), among state prison inmates who possessed a gun at the time of the offense, fewer than two percent bought their firearm at a flea market or gun show,"" according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. ""About 10 percent of state prison inmates said they purchased it from a retail store or pawnshop, 37 percent obtained it from family or friends, and another 40 percent obtained it from an illegal source."""

In the wake of the horrific shooting in Las Vegas this week, the White House faced questions about whether President Trump would support stricter gun legislation.

Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn't give a definite response to these questions, but her statement showed a White House hesitant to create new regulations.

""I think one of the things we don't want to do is try to create laws that won't stop these types of things from happening,"" Sanders said Monday. ""I think if you look to Chicago where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn't helped there.""

Pointing to Chicago to suggest that gun laws don't work is not a new talking point — Trump claimed Chicago had ""the toughest gun laws in the United States"" in a 2016 presidential debate; his fellow Republican candidate Chris Christie likewise pointed to Chicago as a place with high crime despite tight gun laws.

And the rhetoric goes beyond politicians. The right-wing site Breitbart has on many occasions posted articles with headlines containing the phrase ""gun-controlled Chicago.""

This can sound like a potent talking point — it is a huge city with a notorious crime problem, which Trump already used regularly to talk about creating law and order. It also packs the added rhetorical punch of being closely linked to President Obama, whose actions Trump has worked hard to undo.

But while gun violence in Chicago is high, the rest of this common talking point doesn't really hold water.

High crime and tough gun laws

It's also true that there were more than 4,000 shooting victims in Chicago in 2016. It's also true that Chicago has suffered a massive amount of gun crime recently. In 2016, homicides in Chicago sharply rose, mostly as a result of gun homicides, as the University of Chicago crime lab found in a January report.

Gun homicides in the city rose by 61 percent between 2015 and 2016. That helped make the gun homicide rate in Chicago particularly huge compared to other similar cities. The rate was 25.1 per 100,000 residents in 2016, compared to 14.7 in Philadelphia and just 2.3 in New York.

It also had a relatively high number of guns recovered — 243 per 100,000 residents. That's roughly on par with Philadelphia and much higher than Los Angeles or New York.

But it's not true that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the country, as other fact checkers have also repeatedly found.

It is true that Illinois has tougher gun laws than many other states. The state is one of seven that requires licenses or permits to buy any firearm, and it's one of five that requires waiting periods for buying any firearm. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks gun laws nationwide, has given the state a B+ for its gun laws.

Chicago itself has some tough laws — there is an assault-weapons ban in Cook County, for example. But it's not true that Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country. At one point, it did have much tougher laws — it had banned handguns in the city limits, but a 2008 Supreme Court ruling declared that ban unconstitutional, and a 2010 ruling reaffirmed that. The city also had had a gun registry program since 1968, but ended it in 2013 when the state passed a law allowing the concealed carry of weapons.

""We generally think of California as having the strongest gun laws in the country,"" said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The whole state's laws are pretty strong.""

The center has given California an A rating and ranks it No. 1 in terms of the tightness of its gun laws. California bans the open carry of guns and requires background checks on private firearm sales, among other things.

""Some cities go even beyond that,"" Shearer added. ""San Francisco has a safe storage law, requiring that guns kept in the home are kept locked.""

That's a regulation that Chicago, for example, does not have.

Quibbling over exactly what part of the U.S. is No. 1 in terms of gun-law strictness, however, isn't the most compelling part of Sanders' statement. She also said that having gun regulations ""certainly hasn't helped"" in Chicago.

That's a much more controversial claim — and it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

State lines don't stop guns

It's important to remember here that Chicago is very close to two states that have relatively weak gun laws: Wisconsin and Indiana. So while it's easy to pick on Chicago (or any other high-crime city) for its ugly statistics, says one expert, taking bordering states into account weakens this gun-advocacy talking point.

""It's not a scientific study. It's an anecdote,"" said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University. ""They might have pointed to Washington, D.C., back in the days when D.C. banned handguns and yet had high gun-violence rates. Those bans are only at best partially effective, because the borders are permeable.""

D.C. borders Virginia, which does not have strong gun laws. (It gets a D from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.)

Neither Wisconsin nor Indiana requires licenses or permits to purchase a gun, for example, nor do they require waiting periods. While Illinois has that B+ rating from the law center, Wisconsin has a C- and Indiana a D-.

And there's good evidence that being next-door to those states keeps Chicago criminals well-supplied with guns. A 2015 study of guns in Chicago, co-authored by Cook, found that more than 60 percent of new guns used in Chicago gang-related crimes and 31.6 percent used in non-gang-related crimes between 2009 and 2013 were bought in other states. Indiana was a particularly heavy supplier, providing nearly one-third of the gang guns and nearly one-fifth of the non-gang guns.

Other evidence corroborates this — a 2014 Chicago Police Department report found that Indiana accounted for 19 percent of all guns recovered by the department between 2009 and 2013.

New firearms trace data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released last week likewise shows that Illinois as a whole faces a massive influx of guns. Of around 8,700 firearms recovered in Illinois and for which the bureau found a source state, more than half came from out of state — 1,366, nearly 16 percent, came from Indiana alone.

By comparison, 82 percent of guns recovered in Indiana and traced were from within Indiana, suggesting that criminals in that state don't have to cross state lines, like those in Illinois, to get their weapons.

All of this might suggest that criminals will just go to whatever lengths necessary get their hands on guns, regardless of whatever laws are in place.

But that's the wrong way to think about it, Cook said.

""No one's in a position to say that Chicago's various special regulations and Illinois's regulations are doing no good,"" he said, ""because we don't know what the homicide rate would be in the absence of those.

1791: The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is ratified. The amendment reads: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""

1871: The National Rifle Association was formed by Union Army veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate.

1934: The National Firearms Act passes in response to gangster culture during Prohibition. The law implements a tax on the making and transfer of automatic-fire guns, shotguns and rifles.

1939: Supreme Court upholds a federal ban on sawed-off shotguns, implying that the Founding Fathers adopted the amendment to ensure the then-new federal government could not disarm state militias.

1968: Congress passes the Gun Control Act. The law calls for better control of interstate traffic of firearms. Lee Harvey Oswald used a mail-order gun to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.

1976 D.C. City Council bars residents from owning handguns.

1986: The Firearm Owner's Protection Act is approved by Congress. The law prohibits felons from owning or possessing guns or ammunition. The Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act is also passed. It prohibits the manufacturing, importing and selling of ammunition that can penetrate a bulletproof vest.

Each year more than 32,000 people die in the United States as a result of suicides, homicides and accidents with firearms.

For years doctors have tried to reduce the toll by addressing gun injuries and deaths as a public health issue; there's ample evidence that ease of access to is linked to the number of suicides and homicides. But those efforts haven't gained much traction.

On Monday, six medical organizations including the American College of Physicians and professional societies for surgeons, family doctors, obstetricians and gynecologists, pediatricians and emergency physicians joined with the American Public Health Association and the American Bar Association in a ""call to action"" aimed at reducing the health consequences of firearms. Shots talked with Dr. Steven Weinberger, executive vice president and CEO of the American College of Physicians and leader of the effort, on what the doctors hope to change. This is an edited version of the conversation.

Your top priority is expanding criminal background checks to cover all firearm purchases. Why is that so important?

Right now there are loopholes in the background checks and there are certainly quite a few people who end up purchasing firearms through those loopholes, whether through private sales from an individual or gun show sales. All of a sudden the background checks are no longer effective. We feel that should be a universal requirement.

But you're also worried about laws that require doctors to report people who have mental health or substance abuse problems; some states bar them from buying or owning firearms. Why is that?

This is the tricky one. There needs to be better access to mental health care in the United States, I think there's no question about that. People who get adequate treatment are less likely to commit acts of violence. But if reporting of all people with mental health and substance abuse disorders is made a requirement, then people have a disincentive to seek care. We feel this has to be done on a case-by-case basis, not merely based on the presence of a mental or substance abuse disorder, but whether that person is at risk of doing harm to himself or herself or to others.

The paper says that private ownership of assault weapons represents a ""grave danger to the public"" and you want tighter restrictions on their use. How did you decide on that?

The tricky thing was how to define these particular types of firearms. We chose ""military"" type. We know gun manufacturers have done all sorts of things to get around those requirements in the past. It's relatively easy for the general public to say this is a military-style assault weapon in terms of the appearance and the magazine capacity. We really don't see any need for civilian use for those types of weapons or ammunition. And they have been of major import in mass shootings. So we feel it's critical to eliminate private use of those.

Obviously the gun lobby has been against anything at all that has any sort of restrictions on firearms or the type of person who can use firearms. Our hope is that there may be some ability to move this forward since we have the American Bar Association on this with us. We can speak to the medical and public health issues on this, but we are not constitutional law scholars. They have confirmed that these recommendations are constitutionally sound.

Some states have attempted ""gag laws"" that bar doctors from talking with patients or parents about gun safety or asking them if they have firearms in the house. As doctors you think this is a very bad idea. Why?

This is something that unfortunately comes up all the time. The idea that a pediatrician can't be speaking with a patient about the issue of firearm safety and whether there's a firearm in the home is really problematic. It does violate First Amendment rights, but beyond that it interferes with the physician-patient relationship in a really inappropriate way. With the things we've seen with a child going into a mother's pocketbook and pulling out a gun and shooting someone, it's tragic and it's unconscionable.

Doctors have been fighting this battle for years and not making much progress, frankly. It's got to be frustrating.

It is frustrating. One of the other authors on the report said that the number of people who are killed with firearms is the equivalent of a 747 going down with all its passengers once a week throughout the year. If we saw that would there be public uproar.

And these are preventable deaths. Homicides and suicides are things we can control. Obviously we recognize that this is an uphill battle. But it's such an important public health issue, we can't give up on it."

Facebook and a top Republican Senator have responded to allegations from the tech website Gizmodo that Facebook is suppressing ideologically conservative news or stories from conservative organizations from its ""trending topics"" column.

According to an article Gizmodo published on Monday, Facebook wasn't just relying on algorithms to determine which stories made it onto the list of developing news on the right-hand side of its homepage. The article alleged that contracted employees called ""human curators"" helped decide what stories appeared, and that it ""often depended on the taste of individual supervisors — some of whom were said to favor liberal causes such as Black Lives Matter,"" reports NPR's David Folkenflik for All Things Considered.

The article, citing several unnamed former curators, said some stories in which conservatives may have more interest were passed over.

It said that some of the topics that the curators suppressed included ""former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately scrutinizing conservative groups; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report; Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was murdered in 2013; and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder.""

The Gizmodo report adds that some former curators said they were ""instructed to artificially 'inject' selected stories into the trending news module, even if they weren't popular enough to warrant inclusion — or in some cases weren't trending at all.""

Some of these topics included the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, the article said, also citing Black Lives Matter and the conflict in Syria as other subjects that former curators said were ""injected"" into the module.

In a rebuttal Monday night, Facebook's Tom Stocky, who is in charge of the trending topics section, denied the report's allegations and said the company has ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true.""

""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers,"" he wrote, adding that the company ""does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin."" He added:

""There have been other anonymous allegations — for instance that we artificially forced ‪#‎BlackLivesMatter‬ to trend. We looked into that charge and found that it is untrue. We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so.""

With more than one billion users a day, Facebook has become indispensable to many news organizations, David reports. He says, for example, that nearly 5 million people have ""liked"" NPR's Facebook page, and are therefore directed to NPR content. He also adds that Facebook has recently started paying NPR and other news organizations to produce live video streams for the tech giant's new foray into live video, which the company calls Facebook Live. Facebook has no say over the content of NPR's live videos. (For more information on the arrangement, read this post from NPR's ombudsman Elizabeth Jensen.)

For Facebook detractors, Facebook's bid to expand the social media platform's influence using video makes the allegations regarding the company's methods for sorting trending topics even more problematic.

""With 167 million US Facebook users reading stories highlighted in the trending section, Facebook has the power to greatly influence the presidential election,"" the Republican Party said in a statement Monday. ""It is beyond disturbing to learn that this power is being used to silence view points and stories that don't fit someone else's agenda.""

On Tuesday, Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee John Thune of South Dakota also weighed in.

""Facebook must answer these serious allegations and hold those responsible to account if there has been political bias in the dissemination of trending news,"" Thune said in a statement, according to The Hill. ""Any attempt by a neutral and inclusive social media platform to censor or manipulate political discussion is an abuse of trust and inconsistent with the values of an open Internet.""

David reports that on Tuesday afternoon, Facebook told NPR that it will review its practices more deeply and address the Senator's questions."

A North Carolina man who fired an AR-15 rifle inside a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., last year as he was ""investigating"" a baseless conspiracy theory has been sentenced to four years in prison.

Edgar Maddison Welch pleaded guilty in March to federal charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and transporting a firearm over state lines. The case is seen as a clear example of the potential real-world consequences of fake news stories.

During the sentencing hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson stressed that Welch's actions ""literally left psychological wreckage,"" The Associated Press reported.

The unfounded ""Pizzagate"" Internet rumor at the center of this case accused the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria of being the home of a Satanic child sex abuse ring involving top Democrats such as Hillary Clinton. ""Speculation and fabrications tied to the bizarre conspiracy theory have been relentlessly circulated by politically motivated fringe sites,"" as The Two-Way has reported.

Welch heard about the conspiracy theory last December and spent three days reading about it and watching videos, according to a statement that was part of his plea agreement. He then decided to go investigate the matter himself.

""The defendant then took it upon himself to act in what he believed would be a violent confrontation at the restaurant,"" the statement reads. Welch unsuccessfully attempted to try to persuade friends to join him. He said he believed it would involve ""sacraficing [sic] the lives of a few for the lives of many,"" according to court documents.

Welch then drove to Washington and entered Comet Ping Pong, where numerous children were present. He was brandishing the 3-foot-long rifle and had a loaded revolver in a holster on his hip. Employees and clients fled the pizzeria while Welch looked around the restaurant and moved furniture.

He terrified an employee who inadvertently returned to the restaurant during his ""investigation,"" briefly pointing a gun at him before the employee ran for his life. Welch also shot through the lock of a closet, damaging a computer. Nobody was injured, and he ultimately surrendered to the police.

In court documents, prosecutors said they were seeking a sentence of four and a half years, while Welch's defense had requested a sentence of one and a half years.

In a letter to the court, Welch stated that he was ""truly sorry for endangering the safety of any and all bystanders who were present that day."" He claimed that he ""came to D.C. with the intent of helping people.""

Comet Ping Pong advertises itself as a ""hipster-heavy pizza parlor"" that features ""table tennis galore."" Its owner, James Alefantis, told NPR in December that the conspiracy theory has been difficult for the restaurant, calling it ""an insanely complicated, made-up, fictional lie-based story"" and a ""coordinated political attack."""

The Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident who exchanged gunfire with the suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at a church insists he is not a hero, saying that he was ""scared to death"" during the encounter.

""I think my God, my Lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done,"" Stephen Willeford, a former National Rifle Association instructor, tells KHBS/KHOG television in Arkansas.

Willeford says his daughter alerted him to what sounded like shots being fired at the nearby First Baptist Church. That is when, he said, he got his rifle out of his safe.

""I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots — just 'pop pop pop pop' and I knew every one of those shots represented someone, that it was aimed at someone, that they weren't just random shots,"" Willeford said.

""I was scared to death, I was,"" a visibly shaken Willeford told the television station. ""I was scared for me. I was scared for every one of them and I was scared for my own family that lived less than a block away.""

Willeford said he loaded a magazine in his rifle and ran across the street without even taking the time to put on his shoes.

When he saw the suspect, identified by police as Devin Patrick Kelley, the two exchanged gunfire.

""He saw me and I saw him,"" Willeford said. ""I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover.""

""I know I hit him,"" Willeford said. ""He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again.""

Kelley was reportedly wearing tactical gear and wielding a variant of the AR-15 rifle.

When the gunman sped away, Willeford saw a pickup truck and quickly explained the situation to the driver, later identified as Johnnie Langendorff, and the two set off on a high-speed chase to run down the attacker.

Langendorff told KSAT that Willeford ""came to my vehicle in distress with his weapon"" and said "" 'we need to pursue him. He just shot up the church.' ""

Langendorff said he and the other man pursued the shooter at high speed before Kelley appeared to lose control and go off the road. ""The other gentleman jumped out and had his rifle on him and he didn't move after that,"" Langendorff told the TV station.

Kelley's vehicle, a truck, hit a road sign and flipped before landing in a ditch, KHBS/KHOG says. Willeford says he put his rifle on the top of the truck and yelled to the suspect: ""Get out of the truck, get out of the truck"" but never saw any movement until law enforcement arrived a few minutes later.

Freeman Martin, regional director of the state's Department of Public Safety, said the cause of Kelley's death had not been determined. ""However, investigators found evidence at the scene that indicates the subject may have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound."""

Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the debate over gun control has been reignited. Many have said that if there is going to be any action on gun control, law-abiding, responsible gun owners will need to be a part of the conversation. Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep talks to Steven Rinella, a writer and avid hunter, about how he views the current debate.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

The events in Newtown have put gun violence high on the minds of many Americans. Last week, President Obama called for new gun control measures, and he said he hopes gun owners support him.

A Pew Research Center poll taken after the Newtown shootings shows that 65 percent of gun owners still believe it's more important to protect gun rights than to control gun ownership.

Steve Rinella, an author and lifelong hunter, has been watching closely as this debate has been reignited. He spoke with our colleague Steve Inskeep.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

If we talked about the time before the Newtown, Connecticut shooting, where did you stand before that shooting on gun control?

STEVE RINELLA: Before the shooting, I stood on gun control where I've stood on gun control for my whole life. And my understanding of gun ownership was formed as a very young child. I grew up in a home with guns. I was taught to use them at a young age.

INSKEEP: Mm-hmm.

RINELLA: My father was very strict about handling them, what were appropriate uses for guns. I own guns now. I know how to use them. I was brought up knowing that I could use them to feed myself, and I do that now. I could use them to defend myself. And it was never something to be ashamed of. It was a responsibility to be proud of.

INSKEEP: What weapons do you own?

RINELLA: I own a lot of hunting weapons now. I use bolt-action rifles...

INSKEEP: Mm-hmm.

RINELLA: ...and I use pump-action shotguns.

INSKEEP: OK.

RINELLA: But I don't own a lot of the types of weapons that are being discussed right now.

INSKEEP: You don't own an AR-15, for example.

RINELLA: No, I don't. I've never been interested in them. But at the same time, I'm a member of the National Rifle Association, because I do have concerns that I want to safeguard. I have family in Montana and Alaska. I travel to those places to hunt.

Now, if someone were to come forth and say, you know, we've decided that it's a bad idea that American citizens can move from state to state with firearms, I know that the NRA would notify me of that risk, and they would defend my rights in that sense. So when I joined the NRA, it's not that I'm necessarily joining the NRA to help safeguard a particular high-capacity weapon that I own. It's I trust them to generally ensure and look out for my Second Amendment rights.

INSKEEP: Let me just ask you, as a hunter who has spent time with a lot of other hunters: When the subject does narrow down to assault weapons, as happened in the '90s and as seems to be happening again, and we do have some kind of definition of an assault weapon as a weapon where you can quickly fire a lot of shots.

RINELLA: Yeah.

INSKEEP: What kind of conversations do hunters have about those? Do people say, man, I use that? Do people say, I don't use that, but I want anybody else to be able to use that? What do they say?

RINELLA: Well, let me say this: I hunt year-round. I don't hunt - personally, I don't hunt with one guy who hunts with an AR-type rifle.

INSKEEP: All right.

RINELLA: I know guys that do. I don't have any desire to do it, because for me, like, culturally, like, my definition of a hunting rifle is fixed on a specific image. And I would say the guys that I hunt with feel the same way. But, again, we know that there are vulnerabilities that we have, you know, that we have the ability to drive around to our hunting locations with firearms, to fly in airplanes with firearms. So we have a sympathy or empathy for other gun owners who are feeling the same way. But, with all that said, I'll tell you, I just got a text message the other day from my brother who basically announced to me that he just made a radical departure from his own viewpoint and is rethinking this whole issue in light of the recent shooting. So I can't speak to how many hunters are feeling that way.

INSKEEP: You know, I want to ask another question, because Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association held a press conference on Friday in which he proposed that there ought to be armed guards, armed police officers in every school in America. And that hits an interesting philosophical divide. There's the old saying that an armed society is a polite society, that if there are more guns around, it can actually be more peaceful. The flip side of that is the idea that the more guns are around, the more likely it is that someone is eventually going to fire a gun. I wonder what your instinct is there.

RINELLA: Well, what he said, I expect what came out of the NRA press conference to be, like, widely lampooned in the media. But I'll tell you this: I have two young children, OK. I have a two-and-a-half-year-old son. I have a week-old daughter. They're not in school yet. When I imagine forward to when they do begin school and I think about their safety, would I feel better about their safety knowing that there was an assault weapon ban possibly in the future? Or would I feel better about or more secure in their safety knowing that they were going to go to a school that had a similar type of armed guard presence that you'd find at a sporting event, that you'd find in a bank? I would feel better about them going to school where they were protected by armed guards.

That, to me, seems concrete and tangible, and it addresses whatever persons that might want to attack children, whatever their motivations are, whatever their capabilities are, however they decide to go about doing it, it would present a level of safety - if I was selecting a school for my kids.

INSKEEP: Is it fair to say that the Newtown, Connecticut shooting, as awful as it was, has not really changed your thinking about guns and gun control, or at least has not yet changed your thinking?

RINELLA: Steve, I'll tell you honestly - and this is a bold statement, because, like I said earlier, we have a new daughter in our home - I've thought about these issues every hour of every day since that happened, all right. I don't know where I'm going to come down in the end. I've thought about them every day, and it's weighing on my mind heavily. In a year, if we talk, I might tell you where I landed, but right now, my mind is a whirlwind.

Audie Cornish talks to Shawn Harris of Conflict Arms Research about how the Islamic State militants acquire weapons. Harris embedded with Kurdish troops in order to trace weapons from the battlefield.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

One concern critics of the plan to support moderate rebels have raised in the past - whether weapons meant to fight ISIS could in up in the hands of ISIS. A group called Conflict Armament Research traces weapons in warzones and is studying arms used by ISIS. An investigator with the group, Shawn Harris, recently embedded with Kurdish troops fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. He says they've already come across some U.S.-made weapons on the battlefield.

SHAWN HARRIS: Yeah, we encountered a number of M-16A4s and an AR-15, which is actually a civilian rifle, but we did come across American-made weaponry.

CORNISH: So help us understand how you work exactly. Is it you're traveling with these local troops as they fight ISIS and then you pick stuff up or - how do you trace it?

HARRIS: With the Kurdish troops, what we do is we'll usually be based in the larger city that's safe, and there's not a lot of ISIS movement. And then the troops will notify us when they have captured something and will go in and document the weapons afterwards in a safe and secure location.

CORNISH: Walk us through the process of tracing the weapon. When you pick up an individual weapon, what are you looking for?

HARRIS: First we're looking for individual, unique markings and serial numbers, and so what we'll do is we'll take pictures of the entire weapon. Also there's little stamps, sometimes little symbols and whatnot, that'll tell you certain customs markings, or it'll tell you which component was made in which factory.

CORNISH: And we should mention there were several countries - right? - that you were able to trace weapons back to.

HARRIS: In terms of manufacturing, yes. However the tracing process goes much further than just getting the serial number and say, OK, well, it was made in China. That's all fine and good, but who did they sell it to, and then who did they sell it to? And then at what point did that weapon become an illicit weapon or basically fall off a truck or, you know, loose a receipt?

CORNISH: I think the question most people will have listening to this is, how do we know how ISIS got a hold of these weapons, especially in the case of U.S. weapons? Is there any way for you to determine that?

HARRIS: In terms of the U.S.-made weapons, the best guess we have right now is that they acquired it when they routed the Iraqi security forces back in June. There's no way to verify that. We know that the weapons have property of U.S. government stamped on them, but we can't really speak to the countries that are the intermediaries at this point. That's going to be in a few months or six months when we're able to actually track down the paperwork which actually takes longer than finding the weapon itself.

CORNISH: Now, besides military assault rifles that you might expect to find in a conflict zone, you found some more exotic weaponry, like anti-tank rockets. What have you been able to learn about those?

HARRIS: Again out best guess before the tracing requests come in is that the M79 rockets that we found were transferred from Saudi Arabia to the Free Syrian Army. There was a previous report about a large shipment of M79s to the Free Syrian Army to fight Assad in 2013, and so they matched the profile.

CORNISH: Based on what you've seen, is there any way to understand the scale of weaponry that ISIS has access to or the amount that it's captured that can be sourced back to the U.S.? I mean is there any way to know kind of what is out there in the battlefield?

HARRIS: It's a very good question, and it's very difficult to be able to tell because these captures that we do are the weapons that were left behind a lot of times. Sometimes they were forced to leave it because they had to move quickly, you know. A lot of the times, they're able to pick up the best stuff and take it with them. The variety of different calibers tells us that they have a pretty wide range of weaponry, and so it's not simply just a bunch of rebels with AK-47s. They have what could be called professional armies - set of ammunitions.

CORNISH: In the end, based on what you've seen, how confident could the U.S. be that any weapons that come into the region - no matter who they're intended for, won't end up in the hands of ISIS?

HARRIS: Well, every conflict has the element of arms changing hands. You know, when one group will win a battle with another group, they will take their food, they will take their trucks and their weapons. There's always that risk, you know, in terms of strategic policy. That's something that we don't want to comment on because that's not our area of expertise. But there are - we can say that there are American-made weapons in the hands of ISIS and that has given them an advantage.

CORNISH: That's Shawn Harris; he's a field investigator with Conflict Armament Research. He's investigating the weapons used in Syria and Iraq by ISIS. Thank you so much for coming to speak with us.

HARRIS: Thank you so much.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images

A Connecticut judge has ruled that a lawsuit against the manufacturer and seller of the weapon used in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 can proceed.

The gun companies had sought to dismiss the lawsuit filed by nine victims' families and a survivor, which names Remington Arms, maker of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle, model XM15-E2S; as well as the distributor and seller.

Gunman Adam Lanza used the firearm to kill 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Conn.

Katie Toth of NPR member station WSHU reports that Thursday's ruling ""is a victory for the survivors and families of shooting victims who filed the lawsuit.""

She says lawyers for the gun companies had pointed ""to a federal law that prevents certain lawsuits against gun makers when those guns are used in a crime."" But Toth notes, ""The companies could still try to get the lawsuit thrown out based on the merits of the case.""

Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis ruled that the law ""does not prevent lawyers for the families of Sandy Hook victims from arguing that the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle is a military weapon and should not have been sold to civilians,"" The Associated Press reports.

As the Two-Way reported in February:

""The lawsuit was initially filed in state court in Connecticut in December of 2014, two years after 20 children and six adults were gunned down at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn. It then went to a federal court before being shifted back to a state court last fall, in what's seen as a possible advantage for the plaintiffs, who are acting on behalf of 10 victims.""

The lawsuit, we reported, ""seeks damages and an injunction against selling the AR-15 rifle.""

Now that the case has been cleared to move forward, both sides are due back in court on Tuesday."

Updated at 10:50 p.m. ET on Friday

In the shooting Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, 17 people were killed. Three were on the staff as coaches or teachers; 14 were students. On Thursday afternoon, the Broward Sheriff's Office identified them.

Here are their names.

Alyssa Alhadeff

Alyssa was 14. In a Facebook post, her mother said Alyssa was a talented soccer player and creative writer and had an amazing personality, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

She was remembered at a funeral service and burial this morning in North Lauderdale, Fla. Some 400 people gathered for the service, spilling out onto the sidewalk, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

""I wish I could have taken those bullets for you, Alyssa,"" her mother Lori Alhadeff said at the funeral, according to the Miami Herald. ""I would have protected you.""

""This has changed our entire community forever,"" said Rabbi Goodnick at the beginning of the service, the Herald reported. ""It's not just a loss to our community. It's a loss to humanity as a whole. Parents aren't supposed to send their child to school, like so many of you did today, thinking that they may never come home.""

At a vigil on Thursday night, teammate Madison Ciccone said that Alyssa had started the season on the J.V. soccer team, but by the end had been called up to varsity.

""She was ecstatic [when she was called up],"" Ciccone told the Sun-Sentinel. ""It's an amazing feeling being a freshman on varsity.""

The summer camp she attended in northern Georgia also shared the news of her death. ""May Alyssa's memory forever be for a blessing,"" Camp Coleman posted.

Yesterday, Lori Alhadeff issued an emotional challenge to President Trump.

""I just spent the last two hours putting the funeral arrangements for my daughter's funeral, who's 14,"" Lori Alhadeff said in an interview on CNN. ""President Trump, please do something. Do something! Action! We need it now! These kids need safety now!""

Scott Beigel

Beigel, 35, was a geography teacher and the school's cross-country coach.

He was killed after he unlocked a door to allow students in to hide from the shooter, according to the Sun-Sentinel:

""Stoneman Douglas student Kelsey Friend said in an interview with ABC's Good Morning America that Beigel saved her life. "" 'He unlocked the door and let us in,' Friend said. 'I had thought he was behind me, but he wasn't. When he opened the door, he had to re-lock it so we could stay safe, but he didn't get the chance to.' "" 'He was in the doorway and the door was still open and the shooter probably didn't know we were in there because he was lying on the floor. If the shooter had come in the room, I probably wouldn't be [alive].' ""

""Mr. Beigel was my hero, and he still forever will be my hero,"" Friend told CNN. ""I will never forget the actions that he took for me and for fellow students in the classroom.

""If his family is watching this,"" she said through tears, ""please know that your son or your brother was an amazing person and I'm alive today because of him. Thank you for bringing and having this amazing person in life, and giving him the power to be stronger than I could have ever been. ... I will not let this shooting go down as another one.""

Martin Duque Anguiano

Martin, 14, was a freshman at the school, according to the Miami Herald.

""Words can not describe my pain,"" his brother Miguel wrote on Instragram. ""I love brother Martin you'll be missed buddy. I know you're in a better place. Duques forever man I love you junior!!! R.I.P Martin Duque!""

In a GoFundMe solicitation to raise funds for his brother's funeral, Miguel wrote, ""He was a very funny kid, outgoing and sometimes really quiet. He was sweet and caring and loved by all his family. Most of all he was my baby brother. My family and I have no words to describe the event that has happened on this date, all my prayers to the lost ones. My family and I will appreciate anything that we can get helped with. R.I.P Martin Duque.""

Nicholas Dworet

Nicholas, 17, was a senior at the school with Olympic ambitions.

Andre Bailey, head coach at Dworet's swim club, told The Indianapolis Star that the swimmer made huge strides in his life in the last 18 months: working hard at school and in the pool.

Nicholas had just earned an academic scholarship to the University of Indianapolis and had committed to its swim team in the fall.

""I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, he just took his life in his hands and he chiseled and molded his life,"" Bailey told the Star:

"" 'This is a kid who went from middle of the pack last year to being just lights out,' Bailey said. 'He helped put our program on the map.' ""Nicholas was a team captain known as the 'swim daddy' for the way he helped teammates train and practice. "" 'Everybody loved him,' Bailey said.""

The Miami Herald reports that Nicholas was just making a name for himself as a state-ranked swimmer.

Dworet was one of the top short-distance high school swimmers in Broward County over the past two years and had success at the state level as well. He finished fifth in November at the Class 4A state swimming and diving championships in the 100-yard freestyle in a personal-best time of 46.53 seconds, according to his College Swimming profile. The Miami Herald named him as a third-team All-County swimmer this season. ""'He dreamed of making the Olympic swim team and going to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo,"" the Dworet family wrote in a statement posted to father Mitchell Dworet's Facebook page Friday morning. ""He believed he could accomplish anything as long as he tried his best.'""

Aaron Feis

Feis, 37, graduated from Douglas High School in 1999 and had been an assistant football coach at the school since 2002, the ­Sun-Sentinel reported. He had worked as a security guard at the school for at least eight years.

Now he's being heralded as a hero.

He reportedly died from wounds he sustained while shielding students from bullets.

""He was a great guy,"" sophomore Douglas lineman Gage Gaynor told the Sun-Sentinel. ""Everyone loved him. Shame he had to go like this. Always gave his all to making us better. Definitely learned a lot from him.""

When he heard the gunshots, Feis — along with Chris Hixon — raced to the scene in a golfcart. He told football coach Willis May, ""That was no firecracker.""

Broward Sheriff Scott Israel told the Miami Herald that the stories about Feis' response fit his character.

""'I don't know about the incident yet or what actually his performance was, but I know Aaron personally. I coached with him. My two boys played for him,'"" Israel said. ""'I don't know when Aaron's funeral is, I don't know how many adults are going to go, but you'll get 2,000 kids there. The kids in this community loved him. They adored him. He was a phenomenal man.'""

Feis is survived by his wife, Melissa, and a young daughter.

Jamie Guttenberg

Jamie was 14.

""My heart is broken,"" her father, Fred Guttenberg, wrote on Facebook, according to the Miami Herald. ""Yesterday, Jennifer Bloom Guttenberg and I lost our baby girl to a violent shooting at her school. We lost our daughter and my son Jesse Guttenberg lost his sister. I am broken as I write this trying to figure out how my family get's through this. ... Hugs to all and hold your children tight.""

Speaking at a candlelight vigil held Thursday night, Fred Guttenberg spoke of Jamie in a moving tribute: ""I sent her to school yesterday, and she was supposed to be safe,"" he said choking back tears. ""My job is to protect my children, and I sent my kid to school.""

Chris Hixon

Hixon, 49, was fatally injured after he raced to the scene of the shooting to try to help students, the school's head football coach told NPR.

Hixon was the wrestling coach, along with his role as athletic director. ""It's hard to be AD and a coach but he did it because he just loved it so much,"" says Willis May Jr. Hixon loved being with the students — ""he'd get out there and wrestle with them."" May described Hixon as a ""great man"" with a ""great sense of humor"" who loved his family. He added that Hixon was very proud of his military background.

Last year, Hixon was named Broward County Athletic Association's athletic director of the year, the newspaper reports.

Jason Stein, athletic director at neighboring Taravella High School, told the Sun-Sentinal that Hixon was survived by his wife and a son with special needs.

""It is devastating,"" Stein told the newspaper. ""His son was with him everywhere. Chris epitomized what an athletic director was all about.""

Luke Hoyer

Luke, 15, was a freshman who played basketball and was an NBA fan — and he was quiet but happy, his cousin Grant Cox told The New York Times.

""I know Luke loved his family,"" Cox said. ""He had a huge heart.""

Luke's aunt, Joan Cox said her nephew was a loving, sweet person who ""smiled all the time, according to the Miami Herald. She also said that Luke's parents, Gena and Thomas Hoyer searched local hospitals for their son before going to the law enforcement command center where they were informed he had died. He was the youngest of three children.

Luke's funeral is scheduled for Feb. 19 at Church of the Glades in Coral Springs.

Cara Loughran

Cara was 14 and loved the beach, according to the Times.

""We are absolutely gutted,"" her aunt, Lindsay Fontana, wrote in a Facebook post seen by the newspaper. ""While your thoughts are appreciated, I beg you to DO SOMETHING. This should not have happened to our niece Cara and it cannot happen to other people's families.""

Gina Montalto

Gina was 14 and a member of the school marching band's winter guard, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

Joaquin Oliver

Joaquin was 17. He moved with his family to the U.S. from Venezuela when he was 3, the Herald reports.

Friends told the Times that he played basketball in a city rec league and loved to write poetry.

Alaina Petty

Alaina was 14, according to a Facebook post by her church in Coral Springs. It said that another member of the church had been shot twice but was expected to recover.

""It is impossible to sum up all that Alaina was, and meant, to her family & friends,"" the family wrote in a statement to the Herald. ""Alaina was a vibrant and determined young woman, loved by all who knew her.""

She was in the JROTC and helped with a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints cleanup of the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma, the statement said.

Meadow Pollack

Meadow, 18, was a senior who planned to attend Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., in the fall, The Herald reports.

""Everyone should know how great she was,"" her cousin Jake Maisner told the Sun-Sentinel. ""She was a beautiful girl, inside and out.""

More than 1,000 people attended her funeral including Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Reps. Ted Deutch and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and County Commissioner Michael Udine.

Meadow's father yelled in anger at the accused killer at the funeral service held at the Temple K'ol Tikva in Parkland, the Associated Press reports.

""You killed my kid,"" he told the congregation at the funeral. ""'My kid is dead' goes through my head all day and all night. I keep hearing it over and over.""

""This is just unimaginable to think I will never see my princess again,"" her father added. ""This piece of s—- killed my kid, and I wasn't able to do anything about it,"" as quoted by the Sun-Sentinel.

Pollack was the youngest child in her immediate family and of 10 grandchildren, family members told the Sun-Sentinel.

Helena Ramsay

Helena was 17 and headed for college next year, according to her family.

""My family lost an absolutely beautiful member today, due to a senseless school shooting,"" her relative Curtis Page said in a Facebook post.

""Helena was a smart, kind hearted, and thoughtful person. She was deeply loved and loved others even more so. Though she was somewhat reserved, she had a relentless motivation towards her academic studies, and her soft warm demeanor brought the best out in all who knew her,"" he added.

Alex Schachter

Alex, 14, played trombone in the marching band, the Times reports.

His father told the Times that he was ""a sweetheart of a kid"" who ""just wanted to do well and make his parents happy.""

His older brother, also a student at Douglas, survived the shooting.

Carmen Schentrup

Carmen, 16, was a standout student. In September she was named a National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.

Peter Wang

Peter, 15, was in the [J]ROTC program, according to the Herald. His cousin told the newspaper that Peter was in study hall when the shooting began and that he had been holding a door so others could escape.

His family reportedly owned a Chinese restaurant and was preparing to celebrate Chinese New Year on Thursday."

Around the U.S., a worsening heroin epidemic has more and more cities turning to the anti-overdose drug naloxone to reduce deaths from abuse. Also known as Narcan, the medication blocks the effects of opioids and reverses the respiratory depression that occurs during an overdose.

Baltimore recently stepped up its naloxone training, focusing on drug users, and their families and friends. So far this year, city health workers have taught nearly 4,400 people how to use naloxone. That's more than quadruple the number trained in 2014.

A big concern for Baltimore and other cities is the price of naloxone, which has risen dramatically as demand has gone up. In February, the Baltimore City Health Department was paying about $20 a dose. By July, the price had climbed to nearly $40 a dose.

Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, places the blame squarely on the manufacturers and, in particular, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, the company that makes the naloxone most widely used by health departments and police.

""When drug companies increase their prices and charge exorbitant rates, they decrease the access to the drug,"" Cummings said this summer. ""There's something awfully wrong with that picture.""

Amphastar says it raised prices because of increased manufacturing costs, including a rise in the prices of raw materials, energy and labor.

Naloxone isn't a new drug. It was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1971 as an injectable medication, used primarily in hospital settings.

Today, Baltimore and other cities are choosing intranasal naloxone for community use — naloxone that can be sprayed into the nostril and doesn't require needles. The intranasal delivery method isn't explicitly approved by the FDA. Amphastar is currently the only company that makes naloxone in a dosage that can be administered that way.

Daniel Raymond is policy director for the Harm Reduction Coalition, which advocates for broader access to naloxone. He discussed naloxone pricing over the years, the changing market for the drug and what it means for prices and competition. Here are highlights, edited for length and clarity, from a conversation with All Things Considered's Audie Cornish.

On the price of naloxone a decade ago

When we started following this issue, it was over 10 years ago, and for the injectable naloxone it was about a dollar a shot. Each vial was dirt cheap. So it's been a really dramatic increase over a fairly short period of time.

On how the market for naloxone has changed

Emergency rooms have traditionally been the main purchasers of naloxone. It's also used by anesthesiologists, and it's been used on some ambulances. So it was typically a hospital market. The hospital would buy in bulk, and there wasn't a whole lot of prescribing going on.

Now we've got over 40 states that have passed laws facilitating access to naloxone, and have first responders carrying it and community distribution. That's the majority of the country that's moving in this direction of making naloxone more accessible.

On intranasal naloxone and potential new competitors

Amphastar is currently the only manufacturer in the U.S. who makes the dosage of naloxone used for intranasal administration. They have no competition. They can set whatever price they want, and almost a year ago, they decided to almost double that price. It's hitting programs and health departments and first responders across the country really hard.

There are a couple companies that saw the need for an FDA-approved intranasal naloxone device. They've designed new devices that they've submitted to FDA for approval. So, I'm hoping by the end of the year, we'll have one or two other intranasal naloxone devices available. The challenge will be whether these companies decide they want to compete on price, or they just want to take a share of the market.

On Evzio – the naloxone auto-injector

What the makers of Evzio — a company called kaleo — thought about was: Can we make something that your grandmother could use? So they designed this cartridge that's an auto-injector. It actually talks you through the process of reversing an overdose. Now, they needed to do the research to show they had the right dose, to show that people could actually follow the instructions and use it without any training at all. And they needed to do all the manufacturing and assembling. So those R&D costs start to add up. The costs of the production line start to add up. Their gamble was, if they could take the complexity of educating somebody out of the picture, then they could drive more doctors to prescribe this.

On pharmaceutical companies' pricing strategies

I think their choice in front of them is that they can have a narrow market at higher prices, or a much broader market at lower prices. Either way, they're going to making money. The latter way, they're saving more lives.

NPR and All Things Considered will continue reporting from Baltimore in the coming months, checking in with Baltimore Health Commissioner Leana Wen and her team periodically. Stay tuned for future stories."

NPR's Art Silverman reads a lot of crime thrillers. In the last year, he's noticed ""The Internet of Things"" seems to being playing a big role as the weapon of choice.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

For writers of crime fiction, those vulnerabilities in the Internet of things present an opportunity. NPR's Art Silverman realized that when he picked up some of the new books coming into our office.

ART SILVERMAN, BYLINE: Each week, I produce this All Tech Considered segment. It's a lot of work to keep up with the tech world, so when the day's over, I look for an escape. I grab a good book, even a bad book. As long as it's a crime fiction, I'm happy.

But lately, I can't escape. That's because writers are putting technology into their plots. Why should murderers use a gun when they can tamper with a toaster, fiddle with a freezer or pose a threat to a thermometer?

JEFFERY DEAVER: My job really is to scare the socks off my readers.

SILVERMAN: That's Jeffery Deaver. His detective story ""The Steel Kiss"" came out this year. In it, his villain, a man named Vernon Griffith, runs around New York City doing dirty digital deeds like hacking into the controls of an escalator.

Unlike pulling a trigger, which most of us understand, hacking home appliances is a bit complicated, so Deaver occasionally has to stop mid-story to explain to readers what's up. He does that in the voice of the nerd helping the detectives.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEAVER: (Reading) OK, you want to know about the Internet of things. OK, smart products from household lights all the way up to the dangerous ones our boy is using are embedded with wireless connectivity circuits.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SILVERMAN: Despite all these modern-day complications, Deaver says he's still abiding by a rule he set for himself 40 books ago - frighten readers by using the things they deal with every day.

DEAVER: The high-tech elements of the book are really no different from traditional police work, a car chase scene. It simply is another tool of storytelling for me.

SILVERMAN: And those tools do the job. I got chills when the bad guy spooks a young couple by hacking into their baby monitor in ""The Steel Kiss.""

DEAVER: They hear a voice and saying, hi, Honey, how are you doing? Do you want to come live with somebody else? And of course this is on the baby monitor. And the woman drops her phone, races to the door. And it turns out the villain had hacked in as an act of revenge to make the parents feel uncomfortable.

SILVERMAN: That scene really hit home. I've listened through a baby monitor to my grandchild sleeping. All this hacking of the Internet of things in these novels is not over yet. Folks at a website called crimefictionlover.com told me that next summer, be ready for ""Flashmob"" by Christopher Farnsworth and ""The Dark Net"" by Benjamin Percy.

Most crime writers are new to technology, so they have to research everything carefully. But some come from the tech world. Author William Hertling worked for 20 years as a software engineer and was a big reader.

WILLIAM HERTLING: I always loved reading spy thrillers. And of course the spy thrillers of the '80s had a particular set of technology that they worked with. And today, though - right? - what we have to do with computers is completely different. It's a whole other type of game, but it's the same kind of cat-and-mouse game.

SILVERMAN: He says that old spy game was played with miniature cameras and microphones. It's just the tools that have changed. His latest book is ""Kill Process."" A tech expert named Angie uses her skills to exploit smart home devices. She wants to kill men she thinks are abusing their spouses. Here Hertling reads a typical scene.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

HERTLING: (Reading) I go after the furnace, a smart device like every appliance built in last five years. The furnace doesn't possess any protection at all besides the original factory password shared on countless...

SILVERMAN: Hertling takes us step by step as Angie penetrates the system. No need for breaking and entering - just jump over digital hurdles, and Angie is all set to kill.

HERTLING: (Reading) And now the furnace generates copious quantities of carbon monoxide as it also runs the ventilation fans backwards with the cleaning duct open. These three things should never ever happen at the same time, but they are now.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SILVERMAN: A furnace as a weapon - I had to ask William Hertling how much he thought any of this stuff was even possible.

HERTLING: I kind of call it science fiction because I think of myself as a science fiction author. And it wasn't till I finished the book and I thought, well, can I even call this science fiction?

SILVERMAN: Well, that's a great thing. Now I have absolutely nowhere to go to escape from technology, not even in crime fiction.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SHAPIRO: NPR's Art Silverman - he produces All Tech Considered. The authors he spoke with are William Hertling of ""Kill Process"" and Jeffery Deaver of ""The Steel Kiss.""

Donald Trump seems to be running his presidential campaign lately with an old playground adage in mind:

I am rubber. You are glue. Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.

At least, that seemed to be the case at a campaign rally Friday night in Pensacola, Florida. During his speech, several of the more inflammatory attacks lobbed at his opponent appeared to be direct projections of criticisms once aimed at himself.

At the rally, Trump said that the only thing Clinton has done well is keeping herself out of trouble. He was specifically referencing the Department of Justice investigation of Clinton's private email server.

In response to ""lock her up"" chants from the crowd, Trump seemed to veer off his prepared speech.

""Because she is being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart,"" Trump said, ""and she wouldn't be prosecuted.""

That assertion mirrors something the GOP nominee said about himself — one that many people found shocking at the time.

""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters."" Trump said at a campaign event in Sioux Center, Iowa, nearly nine months ago.

Later in Friday's speech, Trump echoed another talking point from the campaign trail. This time, he bent a criticism that's been aimed at him back onto her.

""She's trigger happy,"" Trump said of Clinton. ""Personally I think she's an unstable person.""

Clinton has made the same argument repeatedly about Trump, saying that he is ""temperamentally unfit"" to be president and that his ideas are ""dangerously incoherent.""

""This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes — because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin,"" she said during a June speech on national security.

Trump's projection of criticism of himself onto others has developed into a pattern recently.

This is that Trump projection thing again. https://t.co/1eu9L2cFcd — Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) September 7, 2016

Last week, the GOP candidate criticized Clinton for not providing specific policy details, even though she had released a 288 page book detailing her proposed policies that same day, according to NPR's Tamara Keith. Not providing concrete policy plans is a criticism Clinton often brings up about her opponent.

Late last month, Trump tweeted that Clinton was ""pandering to the worst instincts in our society."" The tweet was in response to a speech Clinton gave that day in which she made a similar criticism about him, saying he ""built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia"" and ""is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.""

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016

For the rest of Friday night in Florida, Trump mostly stayed on his standard messages, both those in line with traditional conservative values and his own lines: he'll build the wall (Mexico will pay) and it wouldn't be so bad to be friendly with Russia.

But he did veer off course one other time, suggesting that he would shoot Iranians circling U.S. destroyers:

""With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,"" Trump told the crowd.

Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs tweeted that this remark, along with the earlier comment that Clinton could shoot someone and not be prosecuted, were both instances when Trump went off teleprompter."

A ticking time bomb. That's what some health officials say the Zika virus is in Southeast Asia.

In the past two weeks, an outbreak in Singapore has climbed from a few dozen cases to nearly 300. ""They're starting to have a situation in Singapore, which is really quite worrying,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said at a recent meeting on Zika at Georgetown University Law Center.

And it's true. Southeast Asia has all the right ingredients for a massive Zika outbreak.

It's home to more than 600 million people. Many are packed into densely populated cities, which often lack mosquito control. And just like Latin America, Southeast Asia has the perfect climate for the mosquitoes that transmit Zika — hot and moist.

""When you go outside in Malaysia, you get bitten everywhere. It's not like in the U.S. Mosquitoes are everywhere!"" says Jamal Sam, a virologist at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.

But there's something hiding in Southeast Asia that may protect the continent's people from Zika. It's in their backyards, their flower pots and birdbaths. And this secret weapon is the exact opposite of what you might expect.

""There's lots of evidence that Zika is already present in Southeast Asia,"" Sam says.

That's right: Zika could protect Asia from Zika.

Scientists first detected the virus in the region in the 1960s. Over the next 50 years, multiple studies found sporadic cases across a massive swath of land — in Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Those studies suggest Zika has been lurking in Asian mosquitoes and possibly infecting people silently, for decades — maybe longer. And that means people in the region may already be immune to Zika.

It's almost like the people are vaccinated, Sam says. ""Because once you get Zika, you probably can't get it again, probably. We don't know for sure, but that's probably true.""

That natural immunity could stop — or temper — potential outbreaks, Sam says.

""It's possible,"" Sam says. ""But it depends on how much immunity we have [in the population]. And those studies haven't really been done.""

Decades ago, a few studies suggested up to 30 percent of Malaysians may have immunity to Zika. But, Sam says, no one really knows about other parts of Southeast Asia. And even that Malaysian percentage is a bit dubious.

""Those studies are old,"" he says. And the tests used back then — and even now — aren't good at differentiating Zika antibodies from those of similar viruses, such as dengue. ""So you get a lot of false positives,"" Sam says.

Of course, Southeast Asia has changed over the past decade in ways that could make Zika outbreaks worse. Many countries have gone through massive development, with cities growing both up and out. Mosquitoes that carry Zika thrive in urban environments.

And the Zika virus itself has also changed over time. Viruses with RNA genes, such as Zika, are known to mutate quickly. Some scientists have worried that Zika has turned into a more dangerous form that causes birth defects

But recent studies suggest that doesn't seem to be the case, says Jasper Chan, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

""We think the Zika virus hasn't mutated that much over the years,"" Chan says. ""We don't see very significant changes, at least, not in the key genes.""

So, he says, the version of Zika in Asia will probably act similarly in people as the one in Latin America. ""Microcephaly, Guillan-Barre and all the other concerns about Zika are still a threat to people in this region"" — unless those people have already been infected with Zika.

So in the end, it's really a mystery about how much of a problem Zika will be in Southeast Asia. ""The virus could spread explosively or not,"" Chan says. ""We'll have to wait and see how the story unfolds."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption General Photographic Agency/Getty Images General Photographic Agency/Getty Images

President Obama has said that the use of chemical weapons could change the U.S. response to the Syrian civil war. But why this focus on chemical weapons when conventional weapons have killed tens of thousands in Syria?

The answer can be traced back to the early uses of poison gas nearly a century ago.

In World War I, trench warfare led to stalemates — and to new weapons meant to break through the lines.

Poisoned gas was described as ""the most feared, the most obscene weapon of all.""

Paul Baumer, the protagonist of Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, recalls some of the horrors associated with gas in World War I: ""We remember the awful sights in the hospital, the gas patients who, suffocating, cough up their burnt lungs in clots. Better to take your chances in the open rather than stay in the hollows and low places where the vapors settle.""

Ban Followed WWI

Despite the horrific injuries, gas caused only a small percentage of the war deaths. But as Greg Thielmann of the Arms Control Association notes, it left a frightening legacy in the form of a million survivors.

""[That] meant painful lung diseases, a lot of people blind for the rest of their lives,"" he says. ""That meant, for example, in America, there were tens of thousands of people who were scarred by exposure to mustard agent in World War I.""

Reaction to those deaths and injuries was swift. By 1925, the League of Nations had approved the Geneva Protocol, which banned the use of chemical weapons.

In World War II, their use was extremely limited. Adolf Hitler, himself a victim of gas in World War I, never used his stockpiles on the battlefield.

But during the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union produced massive quantities of chemical and biological weapons. The end of the Soviet Union paved the way for a historic step: the 1993 treaty that banned the production, stockpiling and use of these weapons.

""We have now verified the destruction of about 80 percent of all the chemical weapons stockpiles that have been declared to us,"" says Michael Luhan, spokesman for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which oversees enforcement of the treaty.

Possible War Crime

But that success has not removed chemical weapons from the list of global threats. A century after their first use, these weapons still have the power to terrify, in part because civilian populations are so vulnerable.

Thielmann, who worked in the State Department for decades, points out that militaries have learned how to shield their troops with protective gear.

""And what that meant is that the main victims of chemical weapons in modern war are those who were not so equipped, which means mostly civilians,"" he says.

Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association says the use of chemical weapons in Syria could constitute a war crime — especially if used deliberately against civilians. He says Syrian commanders on the ground should take note.

""Those that do not cooperate in any orders to use these weapons, they will be treated much more leniently, and their actions will be taken into account in the postwar situation,"" he says.

Yet Kimball concedes that international prosecution of such a crime would be difficult."

South Africa was filled with drama in 1993. Violence raged as the white president, F.W. de Klerk, negotiated with black leader Nelson Mandela to end apartheid.

Amid this uncertainty, de Klerk appeared on TV one night and made a startling announcement: South Africa secretly built six nuclear weapons, but had dismantled them and shut down the program, he said.

""Let us convince the world we are not playing games, that we have broken those bombs down, that we can account for every milli-milli-milligram of material in it — and that is exactly what we did,"" de Klerk said at a 2012 event in Washington, recalling his decision two decades earlier.

To this day, South Africa is the only country that's built its own nuclear weapons and then relinquished them. Three former Soviet republics — Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan — inherited nukes when the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991, and then gave them up.

President Trump is now calling for North Korea to relinquish its nuclear arsenal, a step it says it will never take. History shows that countries are unlikely to give up their weapons unless there's a dramatic change in circumstances, as was the case in South Africa.

Visiting a nuclear plant



A week after de Klerk's 1993 announcement, his government invited a few reporters, including me, to a nuclear research center where the bombs were built in Pelindaba, outside the capital, Pretoria.

We put on protective clothing from head to toe and received a guided tour of the mostly deserted plant, though it still had sealed drums of waste along the walls. One worker said he and his colleagues constantly speculated on the nature of their work, but were never told the details.

De Klerk said the weapons were a deterrent never intended for actual use. The white rulers feared the Soviet Union was plotting with local black and communist groups to gain control of South Africa, with an eye on the country's vast gold and mineral wealth.

But when the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, the Cold War was over and the Soviet threat was gone. The following year, de Klerk released Mandela from prison and opened negotiations with his African National Congress. At around the same time, de Klerk decided to scrap the nuclear weapons program. South Africa signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1991, but did not announce the dismantling of its weapons until two years later.

The nuclear weapons became ""a millstone around the neck,"" he said.

South Africa's case was unique. With North Korea, neither threats nor diplomacy has worked. But does the South African example hold any lessons?

""Absolutely. No country has been compelled to give up its nuclear weapons. But countries have been convinced to do so. South Africa is the classic example,"" said Joe Cirincione, the head of the Ploughshares Fund, which works to eliminate nuclear weapons. The group has provided financial support to NPR in the past.

Few choices

There are no great options when it comes to North Korea, but Cirincione says the U.S. should push for negotiations.



""Coercion has failed. Everything we've tried, sanctions, military threats, etc., has only increased North Korea's desire to get the bomb,"" said Cirincione.

South Africa gave up its weapons when the threat went away. Dealing with such fears is sure to be part of the equation no matter how the U.S. addresses North Korea.

Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, said North Korea fears a U.S. attack that would topple its ruler, Kim Jong Un, and that's what's driving its push for a long-range missile that could threaten the United States.



""I think the first order of business for the Trump administration is to find a way to halt further long-range ballistic missile testing and nuclear testing,"" Kimball said.

Many demands

In any talks, the North would make many demands that could include an end to U.S.-South Korean military exercises, the withdrawal of nearly 30,000 U.S. troops in the South and a formal peace treaty between the two Koreas.

(The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, so the two sides have technically remained at war all this time.)

But even those deals might not be enough for North Korea to give up its nukes, which it sees as an invaluable deterrent in the face of its larger and more powerful rivals. And South Africa may never be the nuclear example that resonates with North Korea, Kimball said.

Ukraine relinquished its arsenal for a promise of security that didn't hold up. Russia seized and annexed Crimea in 2014 and has supported Ukrainian separatists in the eastern part of the country, near the border with Russia.



""Ukraine has not felt as though that bargain has been respected by Russia,"" Kimball said.



There's also the cautionary tale of a pair of dictators — Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi — who gave up their nuclear programs before acquiring a bomb. As Cirincione notes, that didn't save them.

""This is exactly, unfortunately, the lesson that Kim Jong Un has learned — that if you give up your weapons, America will kill you,"" Cirincione said.

Saddam was executed by Iraq after the U.S. invaded in 2003, toppling his regime and seizing him. Gadhafi was killed by rebels in 2011, after U.S. air strikes helped the opposition forces oust him. Observers say North Korea's Kim wants a nuclear arsenal so badly because he believes it'll protect him from suffering the same fate.

Glock The Rise of America's Gun by Paul Barrett Paperback, 300 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Today the Glock pistol has become the gun of choice for both criminals and law enforcement in the United States.

In his book Glock: The Rise of America's Gun, Paul Barrett traces how the sleek, high-capacity Austrian weapon found its way into Hollywood films and rap lyrics, not to mention two-thirds of all U.S. police departments.

The Glock was created in 1982 by curtain-rod manufacturer Gaston Glock. Glock didn't like the handguns available on the market and decided to manufacture a new gun from scratch. Before starting, he asked gun experts in his native Austria what could be done to improve a handgun for the modern era.

""They said, 'A gun with much larger ammunition capacity, a gun that is much more durable and reliable ... [and] the gun should be easy to fire [and] easy to learn how to use,'"" Barrett tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. ""He integrated all of those elements into the Glock, and that's how he won his original contract with the Austrian army.""

The original Glock 17, the model adopted by the Austrian army, contained only 36 parts and could hold 17 bullets in its magazine. It didn't have an external safety like other semiautomatic handguns. It also didn't have a decocking mechanism. The result? A lightweight, interchangeable model that could be dropped, submerged and subjected to temperature extremes — and still accurately fire.

Coming To America

In 1988, the Glock made its way to the United States. It was perfect timing, coinciding with the rise of the American drug trade, when many cops were feeling outmanned by gangs on the street. The Glock's large capacity and light body gave it advantages over other guns.

""Police departments were amazed when they took their officers out to the range and found out not only could they learn to use the Glock pretty quickly, but the Glock also made them more accurate as marksmen,"" he says. ""And that's in part because it has a very light, very steady trigger pull. ... Critics of the guns say the trigger pull is so light that it makes accidental discharges so likely. But the Glock always has had that dual nature to it — the advantages can be reframed as disadvantages.""

One early advantage for police departments, says Barrett, was that Glock gave them large discounts when purchasing the gun for their departments.

""This was smart, because the point was to get the police departments to adopt the gun, and that would give the gun credibility in the much larger, much more lucrative civilian market, where you can charge full price and get your full profit margin,"" says Barrett. ""So this was ... a very crafty strategy.""

Another strategy, says Barrett, was to get the Glock screen time in Hollywood. In 1990, the Glock began to appear in the hands of police officers in Law and Order and other police procedural shows. It was also used by Bruce Willis in the movie Die Hard 2. Willis' character gave a long soliloquy touting the advantages of using a Glock.

""[He] introduced the gun as a character to people who don't know anything about guns,"" says Barrett.

That publicity helped the Glock, as did its frequent mention in rap lyrics.

""The Glock was adopted early on by some of the biggest names — Tupac, Dr. Dre. As soon as it appeared here, they began to embrace it for its dark, futuristic side,"" he says. ""The fact that it looked tough, [had a] large magazine capacity, and, not incidentally, the fact that it rhymed so well with words you might want to use in rap lyrics. Within the space of a few years, you not only had the Glock showing up in lyrics — you had song titles with the name in it and people changing their stage names to incorporate Glock into them.""

Gun Control And Debate

In 1991, the first Glock shooting spree took place in Texas. Twenty people were killed. Hours after the shooting, members of Congress were debating whether guns like the Glock should be restricted.

""It took awhile, but by 1994, a bill was passed — this is what we remember as the Assault Weapons Bill — and was signed into law by President Clinton,"" says Barrett. ""It had a variety of restrictions. One of them was limiting the pistol magazine capacity to 10 rounds.""

Glock's executives would pop up on television and say, 'Who are you accusing of putting guns on the street? We've done business with the very business in the city that's suing us. It is their guns on the street.'

The legislation, which expired in 2004, was initially seen as a terrible blow to the Glock. But the company quickly found a way to use the ban on high-capacity magazines to their advantage, he says.

""Glock had seen this bill coming for years and had been running the factory nonstop — three shifts a day, seven days a week — building up the large-capacity firearms and the large-capacity magazines,"" he says. ""When the law was enacted, it allowed for a loophole that grandfathered in pre-existing equipment before the ban went into effect. [And] Glock had this huge stockpile of the very equipment that many gun owners wanted to get because it was banned — and the value of that equipment skyrocketed.""

Glock also encouraged police departments to trade in their old equipment for newer, higher-capacity weapons. The old equipment — which contained the higher-capacity magazines manufactured before the ban — was then sold on the used-gun market, and found its way to the streets.

""Police departments were implicated in the proliferation of handguns all across the country,"" Barrett says, a fact that came to haunt the municipalities that, a decade later, tried suing the gun industry for flooding the streets with guns.

""Glock's executives would pop up on television and say, 'Who are you accusing of putting guns on the street? We've done business with the very business in the city that's suing us. It is their guns on the street.' ""

Glock's statements helped undercut those lawsuits, says Barrett.

""This process of always finding the exceptions, finding ways around efforts to restrict the Glock became a trademark for the company,"" he says. ""Right from the start, it helped the company, and it continue[s] on through its entire history.""

Interview Highlights

On selling the Glock to U.S. law enforcement

""[Glock] was smart enough to hire a genius salesman. ... This man Karl Walter was really a guru in figuring out how to appeal to the police — whether that meant offering them extremely attractive financial terms or hosting police procurement officers at [a famous strip club] in Atlanta. This was a guy who could make a deal with anybody and figure out how to sell the Glock.""

On an article in Soldier of Fortune magazine touting the Glock's body, which was made out of plastic

""[The writer] said, 'I was skeptical, too. I went over to Austria. I tried this gun. People, you've got to try it, too.' This was a huge door-opener for Glock. The focus on plastic soon developed into a controversy that was also a selling point because the gun control advocates [said], 'Because the gun is plastic, it'll become a terrorist tool. You'll be able to sneak it into airports, past the metal detectors.' This created a genuine controversy. ... Suddenly people were talking about the Glock before there were even more than a handful of guns in this country. This kind of attention is priceless. ... And then it turned out that the allegations weren't true, that you could see a Glock on an airport X-ray machine because a big piece of industrial-shaped plastic shaped like a gun looks like a gun.""

On selling guns using beautiful women at trade shows

""It's extremely similar to the way cars are sold, by means of sex and models and lots of other products. In the same way you have models at trade shows of all sorts, you certainly have them at gun trade shows. The appeal is just as obvious as it might seem. Guns are to some people an expression of virility. ... A buxom, scantily clad woman appeals to some customers.""

On current efforts to strengthen gun control

""No new federal gun control legislation was passed in the wake of [Columbine and other school shootings], which is in some ways more remarkable that in the wake of Virginia Tech and in the wake of Tuscon, we have similarly seen no new efforts to restrict the legal sale or ownership of guns. In fact, it's quite to the contrary. Over that time, gun laws in the United States are getting looser, not tighter. It is easier to carry a gun in many states. It is easier to get gun permits. And we have now had a Democratic president for three years, and he's said barely a word about gun control one way or the other. I think it's very fair to say that the gun control debate has really been won for the moment by the NRA and by the industry that it cooperates with, and by those people who are in favor of widespread civilian ownership of guns.""

I think it's very fair to say that the gun control debate has really been won for the moment by the NRA and by the industry that it cooperates with, and by those people who are in favor of widespread civilian ownership of guns.

On taking shooting lessons

""People who don't own guns really need to think about this: It's just darn fun to fire a gun. It's interesting. It requires a lot of attention. It's competitive. And it's just as people say — it's a real feeling of power to handle a firearm. That appeal is, in my view, undeniable and part of the reason that guns symbolize individualism, self-sufficiency to such a large portion of the population. I felt it myself."""

What weapon did the gunman use in the recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida?

If you said the AR-15, you'd be wrong. And we'll explain in a moment.

For more than a half-century, the AR-15 has been popular among gun owners, widely available in gun stores and, for many years, even appeared in the Sears catalog.

Yet over the past decade, the AR-15 and its offshoots have been used in many of the country's worst mass shootings. This has reignited the debate about their widespread availability.

Dick's Sporting Goods announced Wednesday that it would no longer sell these assault-style weapons.

""I'm a gun owner myself,"" Ed Stack, the company's chief executive officer, told ABC's Good Morning America. But, he added, ""We've just decided that based on what's happened and with these guns, we don't want to be part of this story.""

Many versions

Here's a quick history lesson on why AR-15 has become the umbrella term for a range of semi-automatic rifles made by a host of gun makers.

""AR"" comes from the name of the gun's original manufacturer, ArmaLite, Inc. The letters stand for ArmaLite Rifle — and not for ""assault rifle"" or ""automatic rifle.""

ArmaLite first developed the AR-15 in the late 1950s as a military rifle, but had limited success in selling it. In 1959 the company sold the design to Colt.

In 1963, the U.S. military selected Colt to manufacture the automatic rifle that soon became standard issue for U.S. troops in the Vietnam War. It was known as the M-16.

Armed with that success, Colt ramped up production of a semiautomatic version of the M-16 that it sold to law enforcement and the public, marketed as the AR-15.

When Colt's patents for the AR-15 expired in the 1970s, other manufacturers began making similar models.

Those gun makers gave the weapons their own names, yet the popularity of the AR-15 turned it into a generic term for all types of AR-15-style rifles.

These weapons can go for less than $1,000, though they can be customized and cost in the thousands of dollars.

The National Rifle Association estimates there are some eight million AR-15s and its variations in circulation, and says they are so popular that the ""AR"" should stand for ""America's Rifle.""

The Florida shooting

Which brings us back to our original question about the weapon used in Florida, which is commonly described as an AR-15.

Police say the gunman actually used a Smith and Wesson M&P15, that manufacturer's version of the AR-15.

AR-15-style rifles were around for more than 40 years before one was used in a mass killing, at an apartment in Crandon, Wis., in 2007. The shooter killed six people and then took his own life.

However, gunmen (and at least one gunwoman) have used AR-15-style weapons in most all of the deadliest shootings in this decade.

A partial list includes:

- The Las Vegas slaughter of 58 people last October.

- The Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooting that claimed 26 lives in November.

- The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., that left 49 dead in 2016.

- The San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that killed 14 people in 2015.

- The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that took 27 lives in 2012.

Similar to military weapons

AR-15-style semiautomatic weapons are civilian versions of military weapons. So what's the difference?

Gun control advocates say the difference is minimal, arguing the AR-15, like its military version, is designed to kill people quickly and in large numbers - hence the term assault-style rifle. They say it has no valid recreational use, and civilians should not be allowed to own them.

The gun industry, gun owners and their supporters say AR-15s are used for hunting, target practice and shooting competitions and should remain legal.

Because AR-15-style weapons are semiautomatic, the shooter must pull the trigger to fire each shot from a magazine that often holds 30 rounds.

In contrast, a shooter with a fully automatic assault rifle can pull and hold the trigger and the weapon will keep firing until the ammunition supply is exhausted.

Fully automatic weapons have been tightly restricted in the U.S. since the 1934 National Firearms Act, which was directed against machine guns at the time.

However, a bump stock — a legal device in many places — can be added to a semiautomatic weapon to approximate an automatic rifle.

The Las Vegas shooter had a bump stock, which brought the device to national attention, and has led to calls to ban it in the current gun debate.

A temporary ban

In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an assault-weapons ban, which outlawed the AR-15 and other similar semiautomatic rifles.

Mass shootings were down in the decade that followed, compared to the decade before (1984-94) and the one after (2004-14), but they did not end entirely.

After the assault-weapons ban expired in 2004, gun makers quickly reintroduced them and sales were brisk.

""One of the things that we have seen in recent years after the assault weapons ban ended in 2004 was this really huge explosion of these boutique kind of rifle companies that are producing these very high-end rifles that are very customizable,"" said Alain Stephens, who's part of NPR's criminal justice team and a former member of the military.

On several occasions, AR-15 sales have spiked when there's renewed talk about banning them.

Laws vary by state, but in Florida, for example, anyone who is 18 or older with a clean record can purchase an AR-15-style rifle with no waiting period.

Republican lawmakers in the state have proposed several steps that include raising the age to 21 for the purchase of all guns, and imposing a three-day waiting period.

However, the Republicans who control the legislature are not calling for a ban on AR-15s or any other gun, and the steps fall far short of what gun-control advocates want to see."

She was the alpha female of a wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park, sought after for photographs because of her unusual white coat.

Hikers found her suffering from severe wounds last month. The animal was euthanized by park staff shortly after.

The park now says the recognizable wolf suffered a gunshot wound, based on preliminary results of a necropsy by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The animal likely was shot sometime between April 10 at 1 a.m. and April 11 at 2 p.m. on the north side of the park, near Gardiner, Mont.

""Due to the serious nature of this incident, a reward of up to $5,000.00 is offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual(s) responsible for this criminal act,"" Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said in a statement.

She was said to be one of only three known white wolves in the park and, at 12 years old, was about twice the age of the average wolf there. ""As the alpha female for over nine years with the same alpha male, she had at least 20 pups, 14 of which lived to be yearlings,"" the park said.

A local wolf advocacy group called Wolves of the Rockies subsequently doubled the reward, offering an additional $5,000 that later grew to $5,200 after additional donations. Marc Cooke, who leads the group, ""suspects opponents of wolves in Yellowstone were responsible,"" according to The Associated Press.

""Many hunting outfitters and ranchers have been unhappy about wolves since their reintroduction to the park more than 20 years ago,"" the wire service adds. ""The wolves prey on big-game animals and sometimes cattle.""

This isn't the first well-known Yellowstone wolf to die from a gunshot wound — the park's most popular wolf was shot dead in 2012, as NPR reported.

""People in this world today crave something real, and our society is lacking that, and they could come to Yellowstone and see real nature unfolding in front of their eyes with this very unique personality of a wolf, and they loved her,"" biologist Douglas Smith told NPR about that deceased wolf, known as 832F."

A former Russian parliamentarian named Denis Voronenkov, who fled Russia last October and has criticized President Vladimir Putin's government, was killed in Kiev on Thursday, in an apparent assassination that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is reportedly calling ""state terrorism.""

Voronenkov, 45, had just left the Premier Palace hotel when he was shot twice in the head on a sidewalk along a busy street in Ukraine's capital, according to the Kyiv Post. Citing police, the newspaper adds that both Voronenkov's bodyguard and the attacker were wounded and in the hospital.

The killing has the ""handwriting"" of the Russian special services, Poroshenko said in a statement Thursday. According to a translation by Reuters, he said Voronenkov's murder was ""an act of state terrorism on the part of Russia, which he was forced to leave for political reasons.""

Responding to those accusations, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""We believe that all speculations about a Russian connection are absurd,"" according to state-run Tass media. He also said Ukraine ""had proved unable to take care of Voronenkov's security,"" the outlet reports.

Poroshenko said Voronenkov was a key witness in Ukraine's inquiry into former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and Russian military involvement in the country.

When he fled Russia, Voronenkov did so along with his wife, Maria Maksakova, who is also a former lawmaker. She was seen at the site of her husband's killing today, being restrained by police and emergency workers.

Here's how Radio Free Europe recently described Voronenkov:

""A former Communist Party legislator elected in the 2011 Russian vote viewed by many as rigged, Voronenkov is perhaps best known for co-authoring the 2014 bill in the State Duma that banned the foreign ownership of Russian media, a move Bloomberg View columnist Leonid Bershidsky called 'perhaps the single worst thing that happened to press freedom as an institution in Putin's Russia.'"" ""Now, though, Voronenkov appears to have flipped, becoming a fiery critic of most everything he once supported in Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, to boot.""

In an interview last month, Voronenkov told RFE that Russia ""has gone crazy. People are behaving in a pseudo-patriotic frenzy.""

Describing the dynamic in Russia, he and Maksakova told the news outlet that lying had become commonplace, and ""the lack of professionalism has been replaced by loyalty to power."""

Seven people were shot and killed at a home in a Dallas suburb where they had reportedly gathered to watch a football game, authorities and neighbors say. A police officer who arrived on the scene exchanged gunfire with the suspected shooter, who was killed.

Two other people were wounded in the incident, police said. There was no immediate word on their conditions.

The shooting occurred around 8 p.m. local time Sunday in Plano, about 20 miles northeast of Dallas. The victims, who were all said to be adults, had held an afternoon barbecue ahead of the Dallas Cowboys-New York Giants game, according to neighbors.

A nearby officer heard gunfire and responded, The Dallas Morning News reports.

The officer ""made entry, and that's when he observed several victims inside and then engaged the suspect,"" police spokesman David Tilley was quoted as saying by the Morning News.

""We're looking into a motive,"" Tilley said, adding that the relationship between the victims and the shooter was unknown as yet. However, the newspaper writes that:

""A neighbor said a friend of one of the homeowners said the violence had been sparked by a domestic dispute. ... The couple identified in public records as the homeowners sought a divorce in July.""

The police spokesman said the shooting was unusual for Plano. He declined to say whether police had been called to the house in the past, according to The Associated Press.

One neighbor, Stacey Glover, told the Morning News that the party had started in the afternoon, with people laughing and grilling outside. The newspaper reports: ""She heard shots about 8 p.m., opened her door and smelled gunpowder. When police arrived, she heard them yelling, 'Hands up' before more shots rang out."""

The Indianapolis Star reports Allan was responding to a report of a flipped car around 3 p.m. Thursday when one of the vehicle's occupants opened fire, hitting Allan. Two other officers, one of whom was off-duty, were nearby and both returned fire, authorities said. One of the car's occupants was hit and both were taken to the same hospital as Allan.

Updated at 9:36 p.m. ET

A shooting Wednesday morning at a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., left the third-highest-ranking member of the House of Representatives lying at the edge of the outfield with a gun wound to his hip. The shooter has died, President Trump announced.

Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, headed into surgery at a hospital in Washington at 10 a.m., according to a statement from his office. He remained ""in critical condition"" as of 8:15 p.m., according to a statement from the hospital, following a surgery and multiple blood transfusions, with more operations to come. The bullet that struck his left hip traveled across his pelvis, ""fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding,"" the hospital said.

When the shooting started earlier that morning, he was playing second base, his normal position on the congressional baseball team.

""All of a sudden, we heard a loud, what sounded like a gunshot, very loud and very close,"" Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., told NPR's Morning Edition. ""[Scalise] went down and dragged himself off of the infield into the outfield about 10 or 15 yards and was laying motionless out there.""

Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a doctor, plays on the team and was among the first out to Scalise to apply pressure to the wound, according to CNN. Capitol Police were also on hand because Scalise was present, NPR's Scott Horsley reports, and exchanged gunfire with the suspect. Two officers were wounded, and lawmakers and the president said the outcome would have been worse if they were not there.

At a press conference Wednesday morning, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was ""visibly emotional,"" according to The Washington Post:

""Asked about Scalise, McCarthy started to well up. "" 'I've known Steve since Young Republicans. Long before we ever served in the House,' he said before walking away.""

Scalise is married and has two children. According to his office, he spoke to his wife by phone before going into surgery.

A highly popular politician in Louisiana, Scalise, 51, represents the state's 1st Congressional District. He was elected in 2008 in a special election to replace Bobby Jindal, who had just been elected governor.

Since then, Scalise has always gotten more than 65 percent of the vote in primaries, avoiding runoff elections, the New Orleans Times-Picayune has reported. In November, he garnered 75 percent of the votes in his district.

The former systems engineer got his start in politics at Louisiana State University, where he was twice elected speaker of LSU's Student Government Association. He served as a member of Louisiana's state Legislature for 12 years before being elected to the U.S. House.

The turning point in his career was a 2012 win that made him chairman of the influential Republican Study Group. He beat Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., who had been unanimously recommended by the group's founders prior to the election.

After his victory, Scalise told reporters that his goal would be to pull Republican leadership ""as far to the right"" as possible.

""There are going to be times when we disagree with our leadership, but ultimately, we've got to work hard to pull our leadership to the right,"" Scalise said, according to The Hill, ""and to move a conservative agenda forward and unite as conservatives if we're going to get things done.""

Two years later, he won the race for the House majority's third-highest position. Scalise ran for majority whip against Peter Roskam of Illinois and Marlin Stutzman of Indiana, after the former whip, McCarthy, was elected majority leader.

""Scalise was the more conservative voice many members have been clamoring for and he's from a red state,"" NPR's Ailsa Chang reported at the time.

Right around the same time, the congressman came under scrutiny when it was revealed he may have inadvertently spoken at an event organized by a white supremacist group when he was a state representative.

""I didn't know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group,"" he told the New Orleans Times-Picayune at the time. ""At the end of the day, you are judged by your character. And look, I'm proud of my record of working to help people throughout my years of public service.""

Louisiana has gone for the Republican presidential candidate every election since 2000. Even so, Scalise wasn't an early endorser of Trump last year. Once he committed, however, he stayed that way even as negative press rained down on Trump in the months leading up to the election."

Dr. Christopher Fisher was working at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center just off the Las Vegas strip on Sunday evening when the patients starting arriving.

""It did look a bit like a war zone, can't say that it didn't,"" he remembers. ""Frantic families, blood in the hallways.""

People came in so grievously injured and so many at a time that Fisher, who is the medical head of trauma services for the hospital, and his colleagues used markers, writing directly on patients, to do triage.

When someone arrived, an emergency room physician would mark their wounds. It was quick, simple and impersonal by necessity.

Fisher says in those first few hours, the patients were functionally anonymous to the surgeons trying to save their lives. ""There's no paper charts prepared for all those patients,"" says Fisher. ""No documentation, so literally they just write on the patient. Just write where the wounds are.""

Fisher did seven surgeries in about 12 hours.



""What stuck out to me was probably my first patient of the night,"" Fisher remembers. ""I literally didn't even meet the guy, see the guy's face. He was just on the operating table, ready to go when I walked in the room.""



The man had been shot in the abdomen. Fisher's job was to find all the damage the bullet, or bullets, had done. And a bullet does terrible things to a body. ""It tears the tissue, it rips the tissue, it bruises the tissue as it goes through,"" says Fisher.



That first patient made it through surgery. As Fisher worked, he saw people with wounds all over their bodies. ""Literally everywhere,"" he says. ""We had people shot in the head, shot in the spine, chest abdomen, extremities."" The gunman fired from above, and from a distance, into a crowd of about 20,000 people and ""a lot of the gunshot wounds went side to side, so you anticipate that people were either running away or ducking.""

This is where, in addition to the controlled chaos of triage and the sheer volume of patients, the counting of gunshot wound victims gets even more complicated. At other Las Vegas hospitals, such as St. Rose Dominican, people came in with scalp lacerations where bullets grazed their heads. Others came in with a range of injuries from shrapnel, from bullets striking objects near them. Those types of injuries may or may not have been labeled as gunshot wounds by emergency room staff.

And even counting the total number of people treated at any given facility is challenging. For example, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo revised the estimate for the total number of people injured, from about 520 down to about 500, saying some people had been counted twice initially. Meanwhile, some suburban hospitals in the St. Rose Dominican network said they were still receiving some patients who were seeking treatment for the first time after being injured in the shooting and initially going home, rather than checking into the hospital immediately.

For the major hospitals, it has taken days to do their own counting of patients and cataloging of injuries. A spokesperson for University Medical Center, the only Level 1 trauma center in the city, said Tuesday night that it was unclear how many patients the hospital had treated specifically for gunshot wounds.

On Wednesday, Sunrise Hospital revised the total number of patients it had treated down — from 214 to 200, of whom 16 died and 29 were still in critical condition. Of those, the hospital estimates about 120 had gunshot wounds, but did not release an exact figure."

Jordan Edwards, a high school freshman, was leaving a house party in a Dallas suburb late Saturday night with several friends when police officers arrived outside. The officers were investigating a complaint about noisy teenagers in the neighborhood, and they had heard gunshots in the area as they approached.

Within minutes, the black 15-year-old passenger had been killed — shot in the head by an officer through the front passenger window and pronounced dead at the hospital shortly afterward.

The next day, Balch Springs police Chief Jonathan Haber apologized to Edwards' family at a news conference, explaining the situation by saying the vehicle was backing toward officers ""in an aggressive manner.""

By Monday afternoon, however, Haber had retracted that account.

NPR's Wade Goodwyn explains the discrepancies as Haber laid them out:

""In fact, the car with five teenagers inside was moving forward, not backward, and away from the officers, not toward them. There was no altercation, known or otherwise. ""Nevertheless one of officers fired a rifle multiple times into the passenger window, killing young Jordan Edwards. None of the teens were carrying weapons, nor were they drunk. ""Chief Haber said his review of the officer's body camera video indicated the shooting may not meet his department's standards.""

The officer, who remains unnamed, has been placed on administrative leave. Both the Dallas County Sheriff's Department and the Dallas County district attorney's public integrity unit are investigating the shooting.

""We offer our sincere condolences to Jordan's family and will continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers as we move forward expeditiously, with a commitment to justice and transparency,"" District Attorney Faith Johnson's office said in a statement Monday.

The attorney for Edwards' family, Lee Merritt, said at a news conference Monday that the teen's parents will continue to push for the officer to be arrested and charged.

""We are declaring war on bad policing. This has happened far too often,"" Merritt said, while flanked by Edwards' family. ""America must find a way to police its citizens without killing them."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images

As health departments in Texas try to assist people with immediate medical needs following Hurricane Harvey, they're also looking to ensure that those affected can get the prescription drugs they need and stay as safe as possible.

""Our best advice is always to avoid floodwater as much as you can,"" says Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. ""Of course, people have had to be in the water — they haven't had a choice.""

The state has already begun filling requests for tetanus vaccinations and is sending supplies of the vaccine to the affected areas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults get a tetanus booster every 10 years; the bacteria can enter the body through breaks in the skin and can cause serious illness. The CDC also has specific recommendations for children on its website. People who are not up-to-date on their tetanus vaccination or do not know when they last had one should try to get one, health officials say.

Van Deusen says water contamination from household chemicals and possibly industrial chemicals could be a problem, although as of midday Monday, he had yet to hear of a major industrial facility being flooded.

Dr. Phil Huang, medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health in the state capital, urges people to clean wounds with soap and water. ""Certainly, there can be contamination with high levels of water — fecal contamination, things like that.""

He also warns that well water could be contaminated as a result of flooding. He says it's important that people boil water for at least a minute before using it, or get bottled water.

Huang says in the days ahead, safety concerns could include carbon monoxide poisoning in households using generators; the consumption of contaminated food stored without refrigeration; and injuries suffered when people try to get back to their homes. Longer term, he says, mold will be an issue.

Huang says one of Austin's community health centers has set up mobile clinics to help people in shelters there who need prescription drugs, either by filling existing prescriptions or writing new ones as necessary.

The state has also contracted with the grocery chain H-E-B to work with patients on filling prescriptions as long as there is some way to verify the prescription, Van Deusen says.

A total of 14 hospitals have been evacuated in the affected region since Friday, he says, noting that two emergency departments have since reopened.

On Monday morning, MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the country's top cancer hospitals, tweeted that it was closed for all patient appointments. Since Sunday, the hospital has been surrounded by water, and roads have been impassable. Staff continue to care for hospitalized patients.

""Our patients are safe,"" tweeted Dr. Karen Lu, chair of gynecologic oncology at MD Anderson, on Sunday.

Starting last week, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission has been contacting long-term care facilities in the state to ask about evacuation and shelter plans, according to commission spokeswoman Carrie Williams.

As of midafternoon Monday, 39 nursing facilities and 19 assisted living facilities housing more than 2,280 residents had been evacuated, according to Williams.

""[We] will continue to contact providers to assess unmet needs,"" she wrote in an email. ""If we spot an emergency situation, we refer that to the State Operations Center and/or law enforcement as warranted.""

On Sunday, a photo of elderly residents surrounded by high water inside their nursing home went viral on social media, generating huge concern and some outrage. Hours later, emergency personnel evacuated 15 senior citizens from the home, La Vita Bella in Dickinson, Texas, Dickinson's emergency management coordinator David Popoff told The Daily News."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Historical Archives Sarajevo/AP Historical Archives Sarajevo/AP

A hundred years ago Saturday, Gavrilo Princip shot the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. That event triggered World War I, charting the course for the 20th century. Today, the legacy of the Bosnian Serb nationalist remains the subject of intense debate — nowhere more than in Sarajevo itself.

In the one-room museum on the corner where the assassination took place, tour guide Mirsad Nazerovic points to a black-and-white photo of a pillar that used to stand outside this building. It was a monument with a very short life.

""Construction started in 1916. It was finished in 1917. And it was destroyed in 1918,"" says Nazerovic.

That was the first in a long string of short-lived memorials to the assassination.

""The question you're faced with is very stark,"" says historian James Lyon, an expert in Balkan history. ""Was Gavrilo Princip a terrorist, or was he a national hero? There have been tug-of-war interpretations, and they have changed over time.""

Lyon runs through about a half-dozen monuments that have been erected on this site, built up and torn down with each change in power.

There was a plaque in the 1930s that said Princip fired shots expressing the longing of people to be free. It was removed when the Germans arrived.

Then World War II ended, and a plaque went up noting that this was ""where Gavrilo Princip threw off the German occupiers,"" says Lyon, ""obviously with references to the recent war in mind.""

For a while, there were footprints in the sidewalk where tourists could stand in Princip's shoes. Those were torn out during the Balkan war in the 1990s.

Today, a resolutely apolitical plaque stands on the corner of where the assassination took place. It reads: ""From this place on 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia.""

And this isn't the only place where the battle over Princip's legacy is raging.

A visit to Princip's grave requires a taxi ride outside of the town center. The site doesn't look like a historic place of consequence. People sell used books outside the cemetery fence. There's a grungy cafe, and a highway overpass casts a shadow on the graves.

Inside, Princip and most of his co-conspirators are buried in a small chapel. He died in prison after being convicted of the assassination. Some of the others were executed.

Historian Edin Hajdarpasic of Loyola University says the inscription on the chapel refers to the assassins as heroes.

""And above it is a citation from the Montenegrin poet Njegos,"" says Hajdarpasic. ""And it reads: 'Blessed is he who lives forever. He had something to be born for.' ""

Not what one would think of as the grave of a villain. Instead, says Hajdarpasic, ""it has hero written all over it.""

In every era, people with power have tried to use this assassin as a symbol. The meaning of the symbol changes depending on who's talking.

Even Hollywood got in on the act. The real Princip was a scrawny, malnourished guy.

But in the 1975 movie The Day That Shook the World, he's a smoldering heartthrob who murmurs to a gorgeous woman, ""Try to understand. I must do it.""

To people with firsthand experience of the assassination, this all seems very odd. Haaris Pasovic is a theatrical director in Sarajevo. His grandfather was a teenager working in the family shop on June 28, 1914, and actually heard the gunshots that killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

""My grandfather mentioned that once to me in passing,"" says Pasovic. ""The Sarajevo assassination wasn't ever the big deal in Sarajevo.""

Not for locals, anyway. But politicians know a powerful tool when they see one. And for the past 100 years, Gavrilo Princip has been a more potent symbol in death than he ever was in his life."
npr107,npr,[],,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98578531,"Book Explores History Of The American Rifle

A new book traces American history — though the sight of a gun. Alexander Rose, author of American Rifle: A Biography, and host Andrea Seabrook visit a shooting range to tell the story.

ANDREA SEABROOK, host:

SEABROOK, host:

Ask writer Alexander Rose about the icons of U.S. culture, and he'll tell you there is one innovation that represents the ingenuity, the independence, the pioneering spirit of America - the rifle.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: Rose is the author of a new history called ""American Rifle."" He calls it a biography.

Mr. ALEXANDER ROSE (Author, ""American Rifle: A Biography): Well, I kind of treat the rifle almost as a human being. The American rifle is completely and inextricably intertwined with American culture, technology, business, war and society.

SEABROOK: Rose met me at the firing range of the National Rifle Association outside Washington D.C., to take a tour through two centuries of American history, and how it was shaped by the rifle. That history begins with the Red Coats. In the 18th century, British soldiers were mainly armed with muskets - loud, slow, clunky things that were horribly inaccurate. And the British style of fighting with these rifles?

Mr. ROSE: Essentially, line up all of your men in a very long line and tell them, and this is actually from an 18th century British drill book, that when you fire your gun, make sure to close your eyes because you don't want to actually aim because you just waste time like that. And so what they would do is they would send this proverbial hail of lead towards the enemy in the hopes that some of it would actually connect.

SEABROOK: But the American rebel had a new invention.

Mr. ROSE: The famous Kentucky rifle, or long rifle, which was created specifically in America for a specific purpose - frontier warfare and frontier living.

SEABROOK: It could shoot farther and more accurately. That led to a uniquely American style of warfare - taking aim and firing on specific targets. Rose argues that is what won the revolution. While the Red Coats fired their muskets indiscriminately, the rebels picked off British officers. You know the rest of the story. Back to the firing range, the NRA is letting us shoot a few of the guns we're talking about.

Mr. ROSE: OK, I want you to grab a seat and we'll get you set up.

SEABROOK: OK. The mid-1800s brought a new American original, the Winchester. Doug Wickland, a curator at the NRA's National Firearms Museum, gives me a tutorial. OK.

Mr. DOUG WICKLAND (Curator, National Firearms Museum): It's loaded with five cartridges. Now to work the action each time, you just work the lever like that.

SEABROOK: And that loads a new bullet?

Mr. WICKLAND: It loads it and cocks the hammer.

SEABROOK: So you just have to pull a trigger. OK. Now I feel like Annie Oakley.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: OK, so now I pull this back. Oh, and it pops out the cartridge.

Mr. WICKLAND: And you're ready to shooting again.

SEABROOK: And now it's cocked again. My God, that's easy. OK, I'm going to do it again.

The Winchester's big innovation? It's a repeater. With a quick pump of the lever, you're reloaded. This rifle is the co-star of a thousand movies.

(Soundbite of movie ""Winchester '73"")

Mr. JIMMY STEWART: (As Lin McAdam): Seems they knew all about your Springfield being single shot.

Unidentified man: You mean they had repeaters?

Mr. STEWART: (As Lin McAdam): Yep, only this time we just might outfox them.

Unidentified man: On account of we got two Winchesters.

SEABROOK: Jimmy Stewart leading a posse in the movie ""Winchester '73."" If the Kentucky rifle won the American Revolution, Alex Rose says the Winchester won the American West.

(Soundbite of gunshots and fighting)

SEABROOK: By the end of World War I, modern warfare demanded, as Alex Rose writes, a light, full-powered, rapid-fire rifle. Enter the M1 Garand.

Mr. ROSE: The Garand was a semi-automatic which really means that every time you pull the trigger a bullet is unleashed.

SEABROOK: You didn't have to mess with it. You didn't have to reload.

Mr. ROSE: It was very simple, you just pushed your magazine in. You fired, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Clip came out, filled it with a new one quite quickly - quite an advance over the older guns of the early 20th century and late 19th century.

SEABROOK: The German and Japanese armies were still using bolt-action rifles. They had to manually work the lever between each shot. The M1 gave the Americans an advantage, but the Garand changed U.S. culture in another important way. General Douglas MacArthur appealed to President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal sensibilities. MacArthur made the case that by spending lavishly on updating American forces with the latest technology, he would be creating thousands of new jobs and turning unskilled laborers into skilled gunsmiths. The military-industrial complex was born.

(Soundbite of shooting range)

Mr. WICKLAND: The safety for this gun is inside the trigger guard. It's a blade that you push forward to remove.

SEABROOK: Back on the range, Doug Wickland hands me an M1 Garand. OK. Now this thing is heavy. This is not for wimps.

Mr. WICKLAND: You want to hold this into your shoulder as well.

SEABROOK: Is this one going to kick me?

Mr. WICKLAND: Just a little bit, but you've got experience. Now you can have one.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: The Garand was the last of the old rifles, says Rose. It was used straight through World War II, Korea, and into the beginning of Vietnam. Then came the rifle that brings us right up to today, the M16.

Mr. ROSE: The M16 is the first gun of the space age. I mean, even looking at it with that characteristic carrying handle and the fiber glass stocks.

SEABROOK: It's a jet black scary looking thing. Again, Doug Wickland sets me up.

(Soundbite of shooting range)

Mr. WICKLAND: It latches into position. Now flip off the safety, and you're ready to shoot.

SEABROOK: OK.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: That is so easy to fire. That's all - the first thing that comes to mind is that it's easy to pull the trigger. It doesn't kickback on you. It's just - it's simple. Now of course, I didn't even come near. I didn't hit the target, but ...

(Soundbite of laughter)

Mr. ROSE: Well, this is how these modern guns go, they're not supposed to be as quite as accurate as the old-time guns. But it is interesting that the M16 is - that you're not supposed to fire more than a couple of rounds at a time. It was designed deliberately so you conserve your ammunition and you take your aim, which is a very American idea about fighting wars.

SEABROOK: Rose says it may look different, but the M16 is still a direct descendant of that first Kentucky rifle.

Mr. ROSE: In its civilian and military aspects, the American rifle to this day mirrors traditional American ideas about individualism and self-control and discipline under fire and, you know, being able to think for oneself. You know, rifles are, I mean, they are part of the American character. The Americans have a relationship to rifles that others countries simply do not have.

SEABROOK: Now, I have to say, there are going to be listeners who aren't going to like the idea of looking at American history through the evolution of rifles.

Mr. ROSE: I mean, I just talk about the technology of them and the ideas behind them and what they represent and exemplify, that's my job as an historian. I am not a polemicist one way or the other. The real point is it doesn't really matter whether you like guns or whether you don't like guns. The point is that much of what you see about you today was indirectly or directly created by the rifle.

SEABROOK: Alexander Rose, his new book is called ""American Rifle: A Biography.""

(Soundbite of movie ""A Christmas Story"")

Mr. PETER BILLINGSLEY: (As Ralphie Parker) There it is, the Holy Grail of Christmas gifts, the Red Ryder 200-shot range model air rifle.

SEABROOK: That was the gun Ralphie Parker absolutely pined for in the movie ""A Christmas Story."" In a few minutes, our film critic, Bob Mondello, shares some of his favorite holiday scenes with a dysfunctional family twist.

(Soundbite of movie ""A Christmas Story"")

Mr. JEFF GILLEN: (As Santa Claus) You'll shoot your eye out, kid. Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho!

Mr. BILLINGSLEY: (As Ralphie Parker) No!

Attention all deer! As hunting season approaches, please be aware that the guy who's about to shoot you may be invisible. Or so he thinks.

W.L Gore and Associates, (makers of Gore-Tex rain gear), working with the HyperStealth Corporation — I kid you not — have designed a line of hunting clothes they call ""Optifade."" These clothes, they say, ""fool the deer's vision system at its roots,"" meaning when a hunter slips into his cap, vest, pants and hood, you, poor deer, won't see him (or her) there.

Skeptical deer should check this demo. Here are 2 outdoor settings. Use the slider to switch from human vision to deer vision. When you're a deer, can you find the hunter?

The company's professional consultants, Jay Neitz, an animal-vision expert at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and Timothy O'Neill, who pioneered the United States Army's digital camouflage as a researcher at West Point, have carefully studied the limits of deer vision. Deer, they told the New York Times, have a slightly blurrier view of the world. They see in 20/40, rather than 20/20. They are also colorblind in the red/green spectrum. Humans have three color receptors; deer only two.

W.L.Gore says its camouflage design combines two strategies: a ""micropattern"" colored so the hunter fades into the forest background. Plus, they've added a ""macropattern"" for moments when the hunter moves — which hunters do from time to time. The macropattern breaks up the hunter's silhouette. So even though the deer knows something's moving, it doesn't know that the mover is a person. Deer can't tell what it is.

But Does It Work?

One could argue, of course, that hunters don't need Invisibility Cloaks when they've already got rifles, ammo, and scopes — but the more intriguing possibility is that these clothes may not give the hunter that much of an advantage.

Optifade hasn't been around that long. While I didn't find any bad reviews on-line (and the deer aren't talking, of course), there is reason to be skeptical. These camouflage techniques have a history. And that history is spotty.

A hundred years ago, around World War I, the French, British and American military experimented with camouflage techniques borrowed from nature.

Inspired by the work of artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, (can you find his ""Peacock in the Woods""? There is one in there...) artists-in-uniform used pattern, color and then added sharp angles to break the silouettes of boats, cannons - hoping to make them disappear.

By the end of the war, 3,000 soldier/artists were using paint to hide things from the Germans.

In Britain, they tried painting ships. An artist named Norman Wilkinson, dubbed this ""dazzle"" painting. Boats were given abstract, angular, black and white zigzag skins, so from a distance, they didn't look like boats, and if they did, it was very hard to figure out front from back or which way the thing was going.

The idea got so popular, by June 1918, 2,000 British ships were painted in the ""dazzle"" style.

By the end of the war 1,200 American ships got the same treatment, nicknamed, ""Jazz painting"" or ""razzle dazzle.""

So why don't we still paint our ships like this? Why are modern battleships so often grey? What happened?

According to David Rothenberg at the New Jersey Institute of Technology:

The British navy conducted a study and determined that dazzle painting was not particularly effective. Sixty percent of attacks on dazzled ships resulted in damage, compared to 68% of attacks on nondazzled ships. And 40 percent more dazzled ships were initially attacked than the nondazzled ones [though the numbers were small].

In other words, British commanders decided that plain old grey ships didn't get much safer when they got dazzled. The Germans could see them, at least some of the time. We know this from the torpedoes they fired at ships they supposedly wouldn't see.

iStockphoto.com

We don't get the same data from deer. They don't shoot back. They just leap and dash off. So we can't measure Optifade's performance as easily. But the dazzle design and the Optifade designs are similar enough in principle, that it just makes me wonder: Who are the real victims here? The deer being shot by invisible predators? Or the hunters who think they're invisible?

David Rothenberg considers the history of military camouflage (among many other things) in his new book, Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution (Bloomsbury Press, 2011)."

Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47 rifle who died last month at the age of 94, wrote a letter in 2012 to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church expressing ""spiritual pain"" over the deaths caused by the ubiquitous weapon.

More than 100 million AK-47 and variants have been sold worldwide since it was first produced in the Soviet Union in 1949. The Kalashnikov rifle quickly developed a reputation for being cheap to make, reliable and easy to use, making it the weapon of choice for many of the world's infantry soldiers, freedom fighters and terrorists.

As we reported in December, when Kalashnikov died, the inventor had hinted publicly at some remorse over the deaths that resulted from the weapon but never said so unequivocally.

However, the Russian Orthodox Church says that in a May 2012 letter addressed to Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov — who converted to the religion at the age of 91 — wrote:

""My spiritual pain is unbearable. ""I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths? ""The longer I live, the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression.""

The penitent letter, published in the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper and quoted above in English by the BBC, was typed on the inventor's personal stationery and signed ""a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.""

Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying that she believes a priest helped her father with the letter.

The BBC reports:

""The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. "" 'The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,' Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. "" 'He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.' ""

The report of Kalashnikov's letter of remorse comes on the same day RIA Novosti reports that the rifle's manufacturer plans ""to sell up to 200,000 hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns in the United States"" each year.

The shooting took place in Imatra, about a three hours drive east of Helsinki, Finland's capitol.

Police detained a 23-year-old man who did not resist arrest. According to The Guardian the man had a criminal record, though neither his name nor any details of his criminal history were provided.

The Guardian also named one of the victims as Tiina Wilen-Jappinen, the chairwoman of Imatra's council.

A gun store owner in Arizona says he is refusing to sell Mark Kelly a semi-automatic rifle.

Kelly, along with his wife Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head during a shooting rampage at an event with her constituents, have become advocates for stricter gun controls. Kelly posted on Facebook that he had bought an AR-15. He said he didn't have possession yet, but he was planning on turning it over to Tucson Police once he did.

""Scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet,"" Kelly wrote. ""We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole.""

On Monday, Douglas MacKinlay, the owner of Diamondback Police Supply Co. in Tucson, said he would give Kelly a full refund.

""While I support and respect Mark Kelly's 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use,"" MacKinlay said on Facebook.

NPR via YouTube

Once again, and sadly not for the last time, a mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 stunned the nation and shocked the rest of the civilized world, spurring a national debate about guns and gun laws.

And once again, and surely not for the last time, that debate features the pre-eminent organization of gun owners, the National Rifle Association, known as the NRA.

Founded in 1871, the group now has about 5 million members. More to the point, it is among the most feared and effective players in Washington and the 50 state capitals, where it lobbies, raises money and prepares field campaigns.

The power of the organization is legendary, especially the widely published report cards it issues giving A to F grades to lawmakers. The cards have been credited with the election (or blamed for the defeat) of many a candidate, including incumbents.

Even the nuances of the group's affection, an A+ over an A grade, for example, can make the difference for candidates, especially in Republican primaries.

That is why the NRA has anchored the opposition in every major gun-related debate since it altered its main aim from marksmanship to hard-edged political activism. That change came 40 years ago and was related to other shifts in political sentiment, including the departure of Southern rural conservatives from the Democratic Party. All these helped elect the first presidential candidate to ever be endorsed by the NRA, Ronald Reagan, in 1980.

So what exactly is this juggernaut of influence and how did it become the de facto arbiter of firearms laws in our society?

The group's website has this modest introduction:

""While widely recognized today as a major political force and as America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights, the NRA has, since its inception, been the premier firearms education organization in the world.""

Started by Union officers upset over Civil War recruits' poor shooting skills

That inception dates back almost to the Civil War and two former Union officers, who had despaired over their wartime recruits' poor shooting skills. (An official study estimated that Yankee troops fired 1,000 rounds for every bullet that actually struck a Confederate soldier.)

The idea was to educate a new generation of marksmen, whether for war or hunting or recreational target shooting.

New York helped the NRA buy its first shooting range

Well into the 20th century, the NRA was known primarily for promoting the safe and proper use of firearms, often in some form of cooperation with the government. The Army, at times, donated surplus equipment for training, and the state of New York helped the NRA buy its first shooting range.

Of course, the idea that people owned and used guns was a given in the early years of America. They were integral to frontier survival and rural life, and inherent in the wider American culture — a feature of legend and lore, a symbol of individuality and independence.

In time, however, controversy over guns arose.

Four presidents shot began a split of Americans on guns

After Abraham Lincoln, two other presidents were shot by assassins, and Theodore Roosevelt sustained and survived a short-range gunshot wound.

People began to talk about the availability of guns and the desirability of some restrictions.

And the NRA wanted to be in on that conversation.

The NRA wasn't always staunchly opposed to gun restrictions

Many are surprised to learn that the NRA of past generations worked with the federal government to limit the traffic in guns — for example, where ex-convicts or mental patients were involved.

When handguns became the focus, the NRA spawned a subgroup devoted to them and supported state-level permit requirements for concealed weapons.

In the Prohibition Era, the conversation changed again with the urban use of shotguns and the fully automatic Thompson gun.

These lurid hallmarks of bank robbers and warring gangsters became a target for lawmakers. In the legislating beehive of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1938 regulated such guns, banned some buyers and made gun dealers register with the government.

The NRA worked with Congress and the White House on those acts and supported their enforcement. The same was true when these restrictions were extended and tightened following the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and again by a 1968 gun bill responding to the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy.

But in the late 1960s, there was also widespread concern about rising crime rates and the deadly riots that flared in the nation's major cities. Citizens were concerned about their safety and turned to gun purchases for their personal protection. And many NRA members wanted their organization to get out in front of that.

The hard-liners took over the NRA after an NRA member was killed by federal agents.

In 1971, agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms killed an NRA member who was hiding a large number of illegal weapons. This, too, stirred a restive reaction within the NRA rank and file. To address it, the NRA's top managers created the group's first lobbying organ, the Institute for Legislative Action, in 1975.

The ILA was headed by a Texas lawyer named Harlon Carter, an immigration hawk who had headed of the Border Patrol in the 1950s.

""You don't stop crime by attacking guns,"" he said. ""You stop crime by stopping criminals.""

Hard-charging and uncompromising, Carter was soon at odds with the Old Guard of the parent NRA, who downsized his ILA staff. He fought back by organizing an uprising at the annual NRA convention in 1977 and forcing the power struggle to burst into the open.

In the end, Carter won, ascending to NRA's de facto leadership as its executive vice president. He installed another hard-liner, Neal Knox, to head the ILA. The new marching orders were to oppose all forms of gun control across the board and lobby aggressively for gun owners' rights in Congress and the legislatures.

Becoming a political force

This change in mission coincided with a new surge in political money. Decisions by the Federal Election Commission and the Supreme Court had opened the spillway on vast new reservoirs of cash.

Soon, the NRA became a formidable force in fundraising and campaign spending, making band breaking candidacies at the state and federal level.

This, in turn, gave the group the muscle to move pro-gun legislation as well as to stop efforts at gun control. Carter proclaimed his group would be ""so strong and so dedicated that no politician in America, mindful of his political career, would want to challenge our legitimate goals.""

YouTube

The NRA has followed the path blazed by Carter (who retired in 1985) and Knox.

The group has since had presidents whose personal views were less rigid. That included the one-time movie star Charlton Heston, who served from 1998 to 2003. But, ironically, Heston is arguably most famous in his role as NRA president for proclaiming: ""From my cold dead hands!"" at the 2000 NRA convention, as he hoisted a rifle above his head.

""So, as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away,"" Heston said, trying to rally the membership against Vice President and Democrat Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election. ""I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed, and especially for you, Mr. Gore: 'From my cold, dead hands!'""

The rallying cry is on NRA bumper stickers and symbolizes the modern-era NRA attitude when it comes to gun restrictions. And since Carter's hard line, picked up by the subsequent leaders of the organization, the NRA has also seen seen its membership and coffers swell. And when a mass-shooting happens or a Democratic president looks like he or she might win, gun stock prices soar.

A setback and backlash

That speech also took place after eight years of a Democratic presidency that saw an assault-rifle ban go into effect. Gore, of course, narrowly lost in 2000. Often when there's momentum in one direction, there is a backlash, and that happened that year.

The NRA experienced setbacks on gun restrictions in the 1990s, stemming from the 1981 attempted assassination of Reagan. It created a new groundswell for gun control and led — eventually — to the 1993 law known as the Brady Bill (for Reagan's press secretary Jim Brady, wounded in the attempt on the president's life).

The Brady Bill established a waiting period and other restrictions and had the support of NRA member Ronald Reagan. The following year, a Democratic Congress enacted a domestic ban on ""assault weapons,"" the combat style semiautomatics so common in war zones around the world.

But the NRA managed to insert a 10-year sunset on the law, and when it came due in 2004, the control of Congress had passed to the GOP, which allowed the law to expire.

Over the years, the NRA has also become involved in litigation, such as the lawsuit challenging the personal handgun ban in the District of Columbia. That case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law in the landmark Heller decision in 2008.

The decision enshrined the longstanding NRA tenet that the Second Amendment right to firearms was meant for a private individual as well as a ""well-regulated militia.""

The majority opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia, who had been appointed to the court by Reagan, the first president endorsed for the office by the NRA.

The modern-day NRA has a well-established response formula after mass shootings

This is the NRA we know today, the one to whom lawmakers and the media turn after a firearm massacre such as in Las Vegas.

When this happens, the NRA has a well-established protocol for its response.

First ... the organization remains silent for a period of days, offering only a message of sympathy for the victims and a request that the tragedy ""not be politicized.""

Then ... the organization begins to engage, usually through a few officers and spokespersons who have been through this multiple times, such as the chief lobbyist, Chris W. Cox, and its executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

LaPierre made the rounds of TV talk shows and cable channels this weekend, reciting a well-practiced catechism defending his faith in guns, their use in self-protection and the NRA view of the Constitution.

That is, as follows:

1. That the Second Amendment guarantees the right to ""keep and bear arms,"" and the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that this right applies to private individuals and not just to organized militias (as referenced in the Constitution), but also to private individual citizens.

2. The organization lays the blame for gun violence on criminals and the producers of Hollywood movies and video games and the failures of the mental health system.

3. It reminds that it is not possible to legislate away the evil in the world.

Finally, and repeatedly, the NRA repeats its mantra: ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.""

Or, as LaPierre put it Sunday, ""It comes down to ... if your glass breaks in the middle of the night, there is not a government authority on the planet that substitutes for your right to own a firearm.""

After Vegas, a shift? Maybe not so fast

In the case of the Las Vegas shooting that took 58 lives and wounded or injured hundreds more, the NRA has deviated only a degree from its pattern. In its original response, the NRA said it was willing to discuss the Las Vegas shooter's reliance on a weapon modification known as a ""bump stock.""

This enables someone holding a semiautomatic weapon to fire many rounds without squeezing the trigger for each. This does not modify the weapon to make it ""fully automatic,"" but it produces a similar effect.

On the same day the NRA released its statement, this past Thursday, a number of Republican legislators, including some from party leadership in the House and Senate, told reporters they could ""take a look at"" bump stocks.

Two days later, President Trump also said the administration would ""take a look at"" bump stocks.

Whether this was a coordinated strategy or not, it struck many as a mild concession on the part of the NRA, which usually opposes new limitations. Indeed, it was denounced as such by the Gun Owners of America, a smaller guns-rights group that is often critical of what it calls the NRA's willingness to compromise and ""sell out.""

But it soon became clear that the NRA was not in favor of addressing the bump stock through any actual change in the law. LaPierre and others said it was within the purview of the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms to regulate bump stocks now. They said repeatedly that ATF should simply ""do its job.""

ATF officials, however, directly contradicted that statement, pointing to the language of the relevant laws on the books. They said those laws needed to change for them to ban bump stocks.

While that ""he-said, she-said"" debate goes forward, LaPierre added Sunday that he did not see a need for any gun bill that ""would become a Christmas tree"" loaded with anti-gun measures. He specifically mentioned the suggestions by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Democrat with whom he has clashed since she pushed the assault-weapons ban in 1994. (LaPierre was first made executive vice president in 1991.)

LaPierre's view is already being echoed by many members of Congress. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was seriously wounded when a gunman opened fire in June on a congressional baseball team practice, on Sunday suggested there might be other legislation moving in his chamber that enhanced gun owner rights rather than limiting them in any way.

Scalise, it must be noted, just returned to Congress after months of rehabilitation from his injuries. Scalise, whose NRA report card grade is an A+, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the right to guns is, in essence, without limits.

""Our Founding Fathers believed strongly in gun rights for citizens,"" Scalise said. ""Don't try to put new laws in place that don't fix these problems. They only make it harder for law-abiding citizens to own a gun.""

Asked if he thought gun rights were ""unlimited,"" Scalise said: ""It is. It is."""

This political primary season has seen an unprecedented use of guns to get votes. Republican hopefuls across the country are appearing in political ads firing guns and holding political events around firearms.

Texas state Sen. Donna Campbell won the Republican nomination in her party. In one of her ads, she's seen firing a gun at a target as a narrator lauds her for reducing ""the time it takes to obtain a concealed carry license, so more law-abiding Texans could exercise their constitutional rights to defend themselves.""

In another, candidate Matt Rosendale shoots a rifle at an imaginary government drone — though it did not help him snatch the nomination for a Montana congressional seat.

And in a now-classic ad, Will Brooke, a candidate for Alabama's 6th Congressional District, sets up a 1-foot-thick copy of the Affordable Care Act for target practice. Then he starts blasting away.

YouTube

""We're down here to have a little fun today and talk about two serious subjects — the Second Amendment and see how much damage we can do to this copy of Obamacare,"" he says.

Though Brooke did considerable damage to a publication from the Government Printing Office, he lost the Republican primary.

Guns are powerful political symbols this year because the gun rights crowd is on high alert. After mass shootings in the past two years in Newtown, Conn., and Aurora, Colo., they believe the Obama administration wants to come for their guns. Conservative candidates have piled on.

In Texas, GOP Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst — who ran for renomination and lost — had a poster with the phrase ""Come and take it"" superimposed on a rifle.

Even Wendy Davis, the liberal Democrat running for governor of Texas, had to come out and say she's for open carry of handguns.

""Candidates respond to public opinion, and when that's one of the questions they get asked a lot — 'Where do you stand on the Second Amendment?' — then they're gonna tend to get the point that not only are guns not a liability, but they actually can be a plus,"" says Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.

Candidates have raffled off weapons as a campaign gimmick in local, state and national races.

And the shooting range is becoming the new country club for some Republicans. Former New Mexico Republican Party chairman Allen Weh is running for the U.S. Senate. His press secretary, Paige McKenzie, said they held a fundraiser at a shooting range in Albuquerque to stress the difference between Weh and the incumbent, Democratic Sen. Tom Udall, on gun rights.

""Since Allen is a retired Marine colonel, we thought that this would be a fun and unique event for supporters to come out and shoot with the colonel,"" McKenzie says.

So what's going on here?

""Firearms are a very convenient shorthand in the Republican Party,"" says Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York in Cortland and author of five books on guns and politics in America.

It's not that every candidate who brandishes a firearm will become a crusader for gun rights if elected, Spitzer says. It's symbolic language.

""Having a gun in an advertisement is a way to summarize your opposition to the Democrats, to Barack Obama, your suspicion of big government, your valuing of individualism, and it also expresses a kind of sense of power that is very appealing to base voters in the Republican Party,"" Spitzer says.

Now that the political primary season is mostly over, it remains to be seen whether candidates will use hi-caliber firepower in the general election, where mainstream voters may not be as impressed by belligerent imagery."

Donald Trump addressed the National Rifle Association convention Friday. His past positions on guns have been far more liberal than the NRA.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

As the de facto Republican nominee, Donald Trump is working to shore up support from the party's base. This afternoon, he sought to reassure a group that has consistently turned out for Republican candidates, members of the National Rifle Association. But, as NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, Trump's position on gun rights hasn't always been in line with the NRA.

SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Donald Trump took the stage in Louisville, Ky., moments after receiving the NRA's official endorsement. He wasted no time in going after his likely Democratic rival on gun rights.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Just remember that. We're not talking about changing it. She wants to abolish the Second Amendment. So we're not going to let that happen.

MCCAMMON: Clinton has never called for abolishing the Second Amendment. She wants stricter background checks and to give families of victims the right to sue gunmakers. Trump, though, called Clinton unqualified and predicted that the former secretary of state would appoint justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who would erode their gun rights.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: You know, they keep chipping away. They talk about the magazines. They talk about the bullets. We're going to take care of it.

MCCAMMON: Trump hasn't always opposed stricter weapons laws. In his 2000 book, ""The America We Deserve,"" Trump wrote, quote, ""the Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions."" Trump wrote that he'd support an assault weapons ban and longer waiting periods to buy guns. While running for president, Trump abandoned those positions and fully embraced the NRA.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: When you look at Paris, you know, the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris, nobody had guns but the bad guys.

MCCAMMON: After the Paris terrorist attacks in November, Trump argued on CNN that more guns in the hands of the right people might have reduced the number of casualties. He's made similar arguments about mass shootings last year in San Bernardino, Calif., and at a community college in Oregon. Here he is on NBC's ""Meet The Press.""

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""MEET THE PRESS"")

TRUMP: You can make the case that it would've been a lot better had people had guns because they had something to fire back.

MCCAMMON: Advocates for stricter gun laws argue that would only lead to more deaths. In a conference call hosted by the Democratic National Committee, family members of gun violence victims denounced Trump. Tom Mauser's son, Daniel, was killed in the Columbine High School shooting in 1999.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TOM MAUSER: It seems to me that the GOP has told Trump that this is one issue, this is one place, where he cannot stray, that he has to worship at the altar of the NRA on these issues.

MCCAMMON: Speaking to the NRA, Trump doubled down.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Gun-free zones. We're getting rid of gun-free zones, OK?

MCCAMMON: But guns won't be allowed at this summer's Republican National Convention. Except for law enforcement, they're also not permitted at the White House or on Capitol Hill. Looking ahead, Trump told the crowd the Second Amendment is on the November ballot.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named Donald Trump, OK? I will tell you. I will never let you down. I will protect our Second Amendment.

MCCAMMON: Support from the NRA could help Trump solidify the GOP's conservative base behind him, but this isn't a primary anymore. If he wants to win the presidency, he'll likely need to appeal to more moderate voters. Sarah McCammon, NPR News.

The Supreme Court has weighed in on relatively few gun-related cases. We look at why.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

After the deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., many Americans are calling for action on guns. But Congress says it won't take up gun legislation in the near future. Enter the Supreme Court. The court could, by default, be the answer to setting national parameters on complex issues like who gets access to guns and how. But the court hasn't addressed that many gun-related cases in recent years. So where does it stand on gun control? We brought in NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about that.

NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Nice to see you.

MONTAGNE: Nice to see you. Now let's start with, when was the last time the court issued a major ruling on guns?

TOTENBERG: Well, you know, it's kind of interesting. For most of American history, the legal consensus was that the right to bear arms was not an individual right but a right for the militia, those called up for military service. In fact, I remember Chief Justice Burger, who was a conservative chief justice, saying that the idea that there was an individual right was really ridiculous. But that changed with some scholarly work and pressure and cases brought by gun rights advocates. And in 2008, in the Heller decision, the court said that there is an individual constitutional right to have a handgun in one's home for self-protection. And two years later, in a second case, the court made clear that its decision applied to the states as well as the federal government.

MONTAGNE: With all the talk of guns lately, Nina, you do have one side calling for more restrictions. You have another taking a hard line. But what is the court saying? Is there an absolute right to bear arms in this country or not?

TOTENBERG: No, there isn't. The court is saying that there's an individual right to bear arms, made clear that there are limitations on that right, just as there are limitations on other constitutional rights. You have a First Amendment right to free speech, but you can't yell fire in a crowded theater. You can't even parade loudly through a residential area at 2 in the morning. Similarly here, the court said in 2008 that the right to bear arms does not mean that the government can't ban firearms for felons, for the mentally ill. It doesn't mean you can't ban guns in sensitive places, like schools and government buildings. And it doesn't mean that there can't be conditions and qualifications for the commercial sale of firearms. And in addition, the court also seemed to say that particularly dangerous and unusual weapons could be prohibited, like military assault-style weapons.

MONTAGNE: Well, you know, is there a view, then, of the Second Amendment that might make the court more prone to leave this particular issue up to the states?

TOTENBERG: Not really, necessarily. I think we have to assume one of two things from this continued refusal to act - that the court believes it laid down guidelines in 2008 in the Heller decision and would just as soon stay out of this. Or more likely that neither side, those justices who support strict gun regulation laws or those who oppose them - neither side is sure that they have the votes to prevail if the court were to take up those issues. After all, Heller was 5 to 4 with Justice Kennedy casting the deciding vote. And it's possible also that there are some justices, especially in light of current circumstances, who have evolving views on all of this.

MONTAGNE: We are coming up on the first anniversary of Neil Gorsuch's term on the court, President Trump's appointee. What might his presence on the court mean on this issue?

TOTENBERG: Well, I think we've seen a few hints that he is certainly one of the staunch advocates for gun rights. And where he would draw the line is not entirely clear, but he did dissent with Justice Thomas in at least one of these cases that the court declined to hear. It takes only four votes to grant a case. It doesn't take a majority of the court to hear a case. And there haven't been four votes to do that.

MONTAGNE: NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, nice to have you.

TOTENBERG: Nice to be here.

Since the mass killing at a Parkland, Fla., high school earlier this month, many teachers have called on their state pension funds to sell their stakes in gun-makers. Private investment firms including BlackRock and Blackstone are reviewing their firearms investments in response to clients' demands.

But even those sympathetic to their position say divesting from those companies doesn't lead to industry change.

Many state pension funds that invest on behalf of public employees and teachers own shares in firearms manufacturers passively — they own their stakes primarily because they are included in broad market index funds that pensions invest in.

""I'm currently urging my colleagues to divest in retail and wholesale suppliers of weapons that are banned for possession or sale in the state of California,"" says State Treasurer John Chiang, who sits on the boards of his state's two largest pension funds — CalPERS for public employees and CalSTRS for teachers.

He is urging pensions across the country to sell off their investments in gun-makers and gun retailers.

""We can make a clear and powerful signal that the inaction by Congress is heartless, it's intolerable, and there are people who want to make sure that kids aren't losing their lives,"" Chiang says.

CalSTRS — the California State teachers retirement fund — sold off its stake in publicly traded gun manufacturers, including Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands (formerly Smith & Wesson) in 2013, following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

""After the Sandy Hook disaster, our board took a look at particularly firearms, and decided there are certain companies that made firearms that were already illegal in the state of California, and felt that that regulation may expand and hurt those companies. And so we divested of them,"" says Christopher Ailman, CalSTRS's chief investment officer.

But that was a purely financial decision, he says, not a moral one.

As managers of people's money, Ailman says pensions are bound by fiduciary obligations — that is, the goal of a pension is to preserve and grow assets.

Over the decades, CalSTRS has divested from other industries — including tobacco and coal. Ailman says the fund decided to divest because it anticipated stricter regulation, which would hurt those companies' sales. And in each of those cases, he says the fund's sell-off had zero impact on the companies' products or strategy.

""We had to write them a letter and tell them we no longer own their stock and wouldn't in the future, and I can tell you, they don't care,"" Ailman says.

Despite its public popularity, divesting is not a proxy for policy change, he says.

""I care about many of these issues personally, very deeply, and want to bring about social change, and I just am frustrated that activists are wasting their time focusing in on this as a mechanism when it's not effective,"" he says.

When it comes to economic pressure, social advocates say it's much more important for consumers to target the company's bottom line than for investors to divest.

Over the past week, the #BoycottNRA campaign has gained steam, leading airlines, hotels, banks and insurance companies to sever their discount programs with members of the National Rifle Association.

Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says she wants to see the campaign expanded to include a broad consumer boycott of retailers that have lax policies on gun sales.

""If Big 5 or Camping World or Dick's Sporting Goods won't adopt sensible practices related to selling guns, then people shouldn't buy their soccer cleats and footballs and other equipment at those stores, either,"" she says.

Denying those companies business affects their profitability, which in turn may affect store policies, whereas investors who sell off their shares simply lose their rights as shareholders, Gardiner says.

""One of those rights is to get information about the company. Another is to attend an annual meeting, and vote for the directors,"" she says. ""Shareholders can introduce shareholder resolutions; they can inspect the books and records of companies — so those are rights that investors might forgo, if they decided to divest out of gun companies.""

So far, few pensions are doing so, says Alex Brown, research manager for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

""Markets today are global, and generally for every seller, there's a willing buyer,"" he says."

The RAND Corporation has published an unflattering report about U.S. gun policy. It identified only 62 studies testing the effectiveness of policies such as background checks and buying restrictions.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

As we continue the conversation about guns in this country, we thought it would be useful to look at what, if anything, the research shows over the last two years. The nonprofit RAND Corporation has analyzed thousands of studies to try to evaluate the results of specific gun policies - whether, for example, certain policies led to a decrease in homicide or suicide.

NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher has looked into this, and she is with us now. Rebecca, thanks for joining us.

REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Of course. Thanks so much.

MARTIN: So what specifically was RAND looking for? Were there specific outcomes they were testing for?

HERSHER: Yeah. They were looking for two kinds of outcomes. So one is safety-based. So do these policies actually lead to fewer homicides, suicides, things like accidental injuries or deaths? And the other type is rights. So these are things like, do policies lead to less hunting? Did they lead to less recreational gun use, less defensive gun use by civilians, for example?

MARTIN: So is there a big takeaway from all this research that RAND analyzed?

HERSHER: Yeah. So the big takeaway is there is not a lot of data. They looked at some very popular gun policies - so things like permitting laws that require people to take gun safety classes to own a gun, age restrictions, mental health restrictions, gun-free zones around schools and public buildings. And they found basically very little rigorous research about whether these policies do or don't work. So this is how the study leader, Andrew Morral, put it.

ANDREW MORRAL: Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on we didn't find any evidence on.

HERSHER: So that's evidence that policies did anything good or bad. It's not that these policies don't work. It's that science can't tell us much about whether they work.

MARTIN: Now, there's been a lack of federal funding for research on gun violence because of interest group lobbying, frankly. I mean, this is something that was brought to light again after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So even as RAND analyzes these studies that do exist, is it really presenting a full picture of anything?

HERSHER: You're right. And it tells us more about what we don't know than what we do know. I think one interesting thing that they found is - they did this big survey in addition to analyzing studies. They asked people who consider themselves experts from all across the political spectrum what they think about the goals of gun policies, what those are. And this is what Andrew Morral found.

MORRAL: I think people on either side of gun policy debates often suspect that the other side has misplaced values or that it's a values problem in any case and that they prioritize things that should be of secondary importance. And that's not what we find. We find that the two sides appear to prioritize the same things in the same order.

HERSHER: So for example, whether you work for a gun rights group or a gun control group, left or right of center politically, the vast majority of experts say their primary objective or the primary objective of gun policies in general should be reducing suicides and homicides. So protecting privacy, making sure people can use guns to hunt or for recreation, even preventing mass shootings - most people agree those are not primary priorities.

MARTIN: So they found that there was actually a broad agreement on the goals of gun policies. That's interesting.

HERSHER: Yeah, and very few facts to figure out how to proceed to achieve those goals.

MARTIN: That's NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher. Becky, thank you.

HERSHER: Thanks.

Guns And The Trump Slump Guns And The Trump Slump Listen · 7:25 7:25

Sales of firearms have soared in America over the past twenty years. But fewer people are purchasing.

Today America's guns are concentrated in the hands of a comparatively small number of enthusiasts.

Their love of add-ons and special features has been a boon to gun manufacturers. Their periodic fear of anti-gun regulation has made sales spike in the past. But relying on a concentrated market of mega-buyers can come at a cost.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

A group of teenagers who say they are desperate for some action on gun control staged a silent ""lie-in"" outside the White House Monday, in the wake of the deadly Florida school shooting last week.

The event was organized over Facebook by a group called Teens for Gun Reform, which listed their intentions in a post: ""By doing this, we will make a statement on the atrocities which have been committed due to the lack of gun control, and send a powerful message to our government that they must take action now.""

Dozens of students assuming the pose of corpses lay on the sidewalk in view of the White House, with their arms crossed over the chests.

The somber protests lasted only a few minutes ""in order to symbolize how quickly someone, such as the Parkland [Florida] shooter, is able to purchase a gun in America,"" organizers wrote, alluding to Nikolas Cruz, who, according to court documents, confessed to firing on unarmed students and teachers with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle.

The Valentine's Day rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 dead and 15 wounded.

""We must stand together in solidarity as the younger generations, and show our legislators that we demand reform in order to feel safer in our classrooms,"" the group declared on Facebook.

The D.C. area group is part of a groundswell of students across the country challenging politicians they argue have failed to make schools a safe haven from gun violence. They are organizing rallies and a national walkouts demanding stronger gun laws.

Students from the Florida high school are planning a massive rally against school and gun violence called ""March for Our Lives"" in Washington D.C. on March 24.

Smaller rallies and protests are being organized in cities around the U.S.

""We're going to have, in every major city, somewhere that people all across the country can go to,"" Brendan Duff, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School told NPR.

He said students ""want to feel engaged, and they want to work they're doing something to help. And this is it.""

The Women's March youth branch, EMPOWER, is also organizing a national school walk out on March 14, the one month anniversary of the Florida shooting. CNN says the rallies are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in every time zone and last for 17 minutes — one for each victim who lost their life in the massacre.

Meanwhile, the White House says President Trump will host a listening session with high school students and teachers on Wednesday and meet with state local security officials on Thursday."

Rachel Martin talks to South Miami Mayor Phil Stoddard who wants to pass gun control measures in his city following last week's mass shooting, but Florida law prohibits local firearm regulations.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

All this week, we've heard the voices of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School - survivors of the mass shooting there - calling for tighter gun control, like student Cameron Kasky.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

CAMERON KASKY: As much as we love thoughts and prayers, we don't need them from our lawmakers. We need action, and we demand it. And we're going to get it.

MARTIN: Yet across the state of Florida, local leaders hoping to pass new gun control measures have found that their hands are tied. Like many states, Florida prohibits cities and counties from imposing their own gun control rules. If elected officials implement new restrictions, they can be fined and removed from office by the governor. Earlier this week, I spoke to Philip Stoddard. He is a Democrat and the mayor of South Miami. And I started by asking him what gun control measures he would like to see implemented.

PHILIP STODDARD: Mayors across Florida are calling for four different sets of changes. One is to raise the minimum age of gun purchases and possession - and same for ammunition - to the age of 21. We would like to see red-flag laws to allow protection orders. We want to eliminate the loopholes and private transfer of weapons. And we want background checks for all sales and transfers of firearms. We'd like to place restrictions on the sale and transfer of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And, of course, we're not too happy about the state's punitive regulations of lawmakers such as myself at the local level.

MARTIN: What would happen if you, as the mayor of South Miami, just went for it, just made those changes to affect your constituents?

STODDARD: Well, in the past, the city commission passed an ordinance that required trigger locks. And the NRA sued. And the Third District Court of Appeal voided the city's regulation. If I were to do that today, I would face fines and possible removal by the governor.

MARTIN: So Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz actually sponsored this prohibition rule back in 2011. And he said at the time that if each municipality was allowed to develop its own gun regulations - that - and I'm quoting here - ""someone crossing county lines could become a criminal.""

STODDARD: Well, I mean, the difficulties of enforcement is entirely a different issue. I mean, really, the question is, should people be allowed to bring assault weapons into Miami-Dade County, where I live? And I'd say the answer is no.

MARTIN: Did South Miami have to roll back any regulations when the law was first passed?

STODDARD: We'd had the one regulation on trigger locks. And that had already been voided by the Third District Court of Appeals. I will, however, add that a city commissioner, Jay Beckman, had a shotgun that he'd gotten for self-defense. He had disassembled it. His son found the parts, reassembled them and shot Jay to death in the shower one morning. If Jay'd had a trigger lock on that gun, Jay would still be alive.

MARTIN: That's a horrific story. Is there a chance that you would flout the state law and pass some of these gun control measures despite the risk?

STODDARD: I don't see any point in doing that. I think the real point at this point is to change the state law.

MARTIN: Philip Stoddard is the mayor of South Miami. Thank you so much for making the time to talk with us.

STODDARD: Thanks for having me on.

This week marked the official deadline for more than 370,000 handgun owners in the state of New York to register those guns with state police. New York is trying to use that information to build a comprehensive record of gun owners — something only one other state has done. The database that California started in 2007 has gotten mixed reviews.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has said he wants to make sure that people who can't legally own guns – those with criminal convictions, serious mental health issues, or active restraining orders — aren't somehow falling through the cracks and holding onto their firearms.

Anyone who took out a handgun license in New York before 2013 — the year the state passed a landmark gun control law — had to contact state police by Jan. 31 or risk criminal charges. That's caused a real backlash, particularly among rural gun owners, who don't entirely trust their state's intentions.

A commonsense plan?

The Albany Gun Show is a winter fixture in upstate New York. On the show's opening day in mid-January, Tom King, president of the NRA-affiliated New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, posted up beyond all the folding tables stacked with rifles and holsters.

King said he spent hours and hours answering a question that seemed to be on everyone's mind. ""People are saying, 'Do I have to register or don't I have to register?' So yeah,"" King said. ""There is a lot of confusion.""

The confusion, he said, is about why the state of New York wants information for its new handgun database. It's actually been on the books since 2013.

In the months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, several states adopted tougher gun control measures. New York passed a law known as the SAFE Act, which banned most assault weapons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he wanted to go even further.

YouTube

""We'll have for the first time a statewide handgun database that will allow the state, allow local officials to check periodically,"" Cuomo said. The plan lawmakers approved calls for detailed information on hundreds of thousands of legally licensed handgun owners and their weapons – down to make, model and serial numbers. Some of that information was already available on gun permit applications filed at county clerk's offices across the state, but it was often outdated or incomplete.

State police will build a database they can check against criminal records, alerts filed by mental health professionals, and restraining orders. Only law enforcement can see the information, not the public.

Cuomo described it as a system based on commonsense. ""You don't want criminals and people who are mentally ill to have guns,"" he said. Once the law passed, state police began collecting information from every person who applied for a new handgun permit.

""You can't make them criminals.""

The SAFE Act has been popular in urban areas, according to polling data. But some rural gun owners have resisted from the beginning. As the first big handgun registration deadline approached this winter, for people who got their guns prior to 2013, the pushback grew more intense.

Talk radio host Bill Robinson has lashed out at the state on ""The Second Amendment Radio Show,"" which he hosts for a small station near Rochester. ""The government shouldn't have master lists of us gun owners and the specific guns we have,"" Robinson said on a recent episode. ""They don't need it!""

National Does Increased Gun Ownership Help Decrease Crime? Does Increased Gun Ownership Help Decrease Crime? Listen · 4:33 4:33

A lot of gun owners are angry. While they can agree that so-called ""bad guys"" shouldn't have access to weapons, some fear that New York is trying to turn them into those bad guys. It goes back to the penalties associated with this registration process. The SAFE Act says failure to register handguns is a felony offense — and gun permits are automatically revoked.

""You just can't do that to people that live in your state, that are lawful gun owners,"" Tom King said. ""You can't make them, overnight, criminals.""

King is most worried about those who had handguns before the 2013 law went into effect, but all handgun owners will have to check back in every five years.

No response from 81,000 gun owners

As of the deadline, more than 81,000 people – or 20 percent of affected handgun owners in New York – haven't responded to the state's request. But New York State Police spokesman Beau Duffy argues that concern about this gun database has been overblown. He said felony charges are off the table for now. ""We're not going to take criminal enforcement action, particularly with those people who were unaware of this re-certification process,"" Duffy said.

The next big question is how this registry is going to be used and who's going to follow up with gun owners. Laura Cutilletta, legal director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, believes it could be a game-changer for police.

""This kind of tool seems like something law enforcement would really welcome and would make a priority if they can,"" Cutilletta said. ""Because to know who is determined to be dangerous already and has a gun — I mean, what better information could you give law enforcement than something like that?""

But Cutilletta doesn't think these systems will start popping up nationwide. They're too expensive, she said. New York set aside $28 million for its database, and California tucked away $24 million.

Instead, Cutilletta said, she and other gun control advocates are pushing for new kinds of restraining orders – called ""extreme risk protection orders."" They allow families and police to take their concerns to court and request permission from a judge to take guns away from people who could potentially do harm.

California, Washington and Oregon have already passed legislation allowing these protection orders. New York's lawmakers are considering a similar bill this year."

Last week's shooting in Parkland, Fla., echoed in the state's Capitol on Wednesday, as student survivors lobbied their legislature to pass stricter gun laws. Gun policy had already become a central issue in Florida's current legislative session after the shooting. But the effects of the shooting are reaching beyond the state's borders into legislatures across the country.

There are thousands of gun-related bills in statehouses — some would expand access to guns by easing permit restrictions and others aim to take guns out of the hands of people with domestic violence convictions, mental health issues or others who pose a threat.

The recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 has pushed some statehouses and state candidates deeper into the gun debate. Some are moving to bury bills that were already in the works, while others are gaining traction on measures that previously languished.

Here's a look at some of what's happening in statehouses across the country.

California claimed a victory on Tuesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court punted on a Second Amendment case once again. It declined to hear a challenge to that state's 10-day waiting period to buy guns, reaffirming that states have wide authority to set their own gun laws.

Kentucky legislators say they won't consider gun control proposals, but a bill allowing teachers and staff to be armed has gained traction, as Louisville Public Radio's Ryland Barton reported. The bill would allow schools to tap teachers and staff as school marshals, as long as they have a conceal-carry permit.

In Iowa, the Senate advanced a bill one day after the Parkland shooting requiring school districts to create active shooter safety plans, Iowa Public Radio reports. A Senate committee was also considering a bill that would have removed the permit requirement to obtain and carry weapons. The chairperson now says it's a bad time for that legislation.

""It makes me sick what happened down in Florida, but with that said, I did have the votes to move this thing forward and decided after the communication from the governor ... to pull it off the agenda,"" said Brad Zaun, a Republican from Des Moines suburb Urbandale.

An Illinois lawmaker has drafted a proposal in response to Florida's shooting to ban so-called ""ghost guns,"" which are assembled by individuals outside a factory or store. Rep. Martin Moylan, a Democrat, says he also plans to file a measure that would ban AR-15s, a popular semi-automatic rifle. As NPR Illinois reports, Moylan says he does not believe this proposal would be an intrusion on Second Amendment rights. ""Just like prohibiting people to drive 100 miles per hour in a car, there has to be rules and control.""

Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich has softened his stance on gun control in recent months and this week called on President Trump to pass ""common-sense gun laws."" He recounted a conversation with a friend who owns guns on CNN. ""If all of a sudden you couldn't buy an AR-15, what would you lose? Would you feel your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn't buy a goddarn AR-15? These are things that have to be looked at and action has to happen,"" he said.

It's unclear what that action will look like in his own state, though. As WOSU reports, there are 22 pieces of legislation related to guns pending in the Ohio legislature, including bills to ban bump stocks and strengthen background checks.

Kucinich plans to lobby the state legislature and called for city councils to ban assault-style weapons with high-capacity magazines, WOSU reports. That will be a tough sell, though. Ohio passed a law in 2006, which was upheld by the state Supreme Court, prohibiting cities from passing restrictive gun laws like an assault weapons ban or handgun registration requirements.

Kansas' statehouse was considering a bill that would have instituted gun violence restraining orders like California and Washington. The legislators say now is not the right time to talk about guns.

And as KCUR's Jim McLean reports, a Kansas congressional candidate Tyler Tannahill drew criticism online after he decided to go through with a giveaway of an AR-15 rifle, similar to the one used in the Florida shooting. Tannahill also touted a training program for arming teachers.

Nearly 50 gun-related bills have been introduced in Michigan since January 2017, the Detroit Free Press reports. The majority of those would expand access to guns and have stalled in committees. But Republican Rep. Jim Runestad tells the paper that a two bills dealing with removing guns from people with mental health issues could get a second look from his committee. ""What are we going to do to make sure people who are severely unbalanced are not given access to weapons?"" Runestad said.

In Idaho, bills to ease gun permitting are moving forward without hesitation. These include allowing anyone 21 or older to carry concealed weapons and allowing any Idaho resident to carry concealed weapons.

Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters, KCUR's Jim McLean, Michigan Radio's Rick Pluta, WCPN's Nick Castele, KBSX's Jimmy Dawson and NPR Illinois' Brian Mackey of NPR's statehouse collaborative contributed to this report."

Editor's note: This story was originally published in October and has been republished with updates following the shooting Wednesday in Florida.

It was the deadliest school shooting since a gunman took 26 lives at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newton, Conn. On Wednesday, a shooter killed at least 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

The Florida shooting is the latest reminder of the persistent gun violence in the United States. Rates of gun deaths in the U.S. are far greater than in much of the rest of the world.

Take countries with the top indicators of socioeconomic success — income per person and average education level, for instance. The United States ranks ninth in the world among them, bested only by the likes of Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Iceland, Andorra, Canada and Finland.

Those countries all also enjoy low rates of gun violence, but the U.S. has the 31st highest rate in the world: 3.85 deaths due to gun violence per 100,000 people in 2016. That was eight times as high as the rate in Canada, which had 0.48 deaths per 100,000 people — and 27 times higher than the one in Denmark, which had 0.14 deaths per 100,000.

The numbers comes from a massive database maintained by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which tracks lives lost in every country, in every year, by every possible cause of death. The 2016 figures, released last fall, paint a fairly rosy picture for much of the world, with deaths due to gun violence rare even in many countries that are extremely poor — such as Bangladesh and Laos, which saw 0.16 deaths and 0.13 deaths respectively per 100,000 people.

Prosperous Asian countries such as Singapore and Japan boast the absolute lowest rates, though the United Kingdom and Germany are in almost as good shape.

""It is a little surprising that a country like ours should have this level of gun violence,"" says Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health and epidemiology at the IHME. ""If you compare us to other well-off countries, we really stand out.""

Loading...

To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States — particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. Mokdad says a major driver is the large presence of gangs and drug trafficking. ""The gangs and drug traffickers fight amongst themselves to get more territory, and they fight the police,"" says Mokdad. And citizens who are not involved are often caught in the crossfire.

Loading...

Mokdad said drug trafficking may also be a driving factor in two Asian countries that have unusually large rates of violent gun deaths for their region, the Philippines and Thailand.

Loading...

With the casualties due to armed conflicts factored out, even in conflict-ridden regions such as the Middle East, the U.S. rate is worse than in all but one country: Iraq.

Loading...

The U.S. gun violence death rate is also higher than that in nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including many that are among the world's poorest.

Loading...

One more way to consider these data: The IHME also estimates what it would expect a country's rate of gun violence deaths to be based solely on its socioeconomic status. By that measure, the U.S. should be seeing only 0.79 deaths per 100,000 people. Instead, its actual rate of 3.85 deaths per 100,000 is almost five times as high."

There is a pistol-packing revolution going on in America. Nearly 13 million Americans have permits to carry concealed handguns — triple the number just nine years ago — and that figure is low because not every state reports.

It's puzzling that so many Americans are choosing to arm themselves at a time when the FBI tells us violent crime and property crime have been falling dramatically for two decades.

In search of handgun permit holders, I drove out to the Texas Firearms Festival, an outdoor gun extravaganza held near Austin where firearms fanciers get to shoot everything they see.

I'm not saying that being armed is gonna save your life, but at least you have an effective tool to mount some kind of defense.

""If you're in Paris and you see people coming with AKs into your rock concert, that sucks. But it sucks worse if you're unarmed,"" says festival producer Robert Farago. ""I'm not saying that being armed is gonna save your life, but at least you have an effective tool to mount some kind of defense.""

High school counselor Janna Delany, who carries a Ruger LC9, is more concerned about crime than mass shootings.

""It's more just for me personally to give myself a little bit of peace of mind, somebody trying to carjack me or hold me up at a gas station or stopped at a red light or something,"" Delany says.

Retired Houston homicide detective Brian Foster has a booth at the festival where he sells ""politically incorrect"" books.

""Police cannot take care of citizens,"" he says. ""They react after the fact. I spent many years dealing with cadavers.""

How Does Carrying A Gun Change You?

One thing is certain: Carrying around a loaded weapon and being prepared at a moment's notice to use deadly force changes how people perceive their environment. Of the 20 handgun carriers I interviewed over several months, most of them say they're more aware of how people look and how they act.

""I pay attention to different people, weird people, maybe stereotype people,"" says Sam Blackburn, a diesel mechanic from Georgetown, Texas, who attended the firearms fest in an NRA cap. He carries a 9 mm Smith & Wesson.

What is he looking for, specifically?

""Gangbanger-looking guys, maybe guys that look like they're up to no good or somebody that may think they're a Muslim extremist or something like that,"" Blackburn says.

Carrying a 2-pound steel appliance around like a cellphone doesn't only change the way a person thinks, it changes the way they move.

""It's exciting. I won't lie to you. There's some visceral response that you get from carrying a firearm,"" says Doug Miller. He owns a small IT company in Austin and teaches Israeli self-defense classes on the side. ""But after about 30 seconds, it becomes, 'Is this gonna be comfortable when I sit down? It's digging into my hip because my car has upholstered seats. That's really not that comfortable.' ""

What Do Women Think About Guns?

A Girl & A Gun is a women's shooting league that started in Central Texas and has now gone national.

Executive Director Robyn Sandoval says carrying a handgun has become an extension of motherhood, a way to protect her children.

""Family situational awareness is a big deal,"" she says. ""When we go to a restaurant, my 9-year-old [is thinking] who looks suspicious? What are people doing? What's an anomaly. Let's point out people in their cars. We make a game of it, of who can find somebody in their car just sitting there.""

The gun girls talk about their firearms differently than men do. Guys speak of them as tools; these women talk about them like pets.

""We name our guns,"" Sandoval says, ""I have Francesca, Dolly, Gracie. And we talk about 'em like, 'I'm takin' Gracie to the mall with us.'

""My small one is my Baby,"" says schoolteacher Bettylane Chambliss. ""And my dad will say, 'Do you have your gun with you?' And I went, 'Oh, yeah, I got Baby with me. I'm fine.' ""

When Can You Pull The Trigger?

Despite the pet names, there's nothing casual about getting a license to carry a pistol.

A gun in the home? The owner may have it primarily for hunting or target-shooting. A concealed gun out in public? It goes with the explicit understanding that the owner may kill someone they feel threatened by.

Michael Cargill, a popular handgun instructor in Austin, had this to say: ""You pull that gun out, your life is gonna change."" He's right.

Of the millions of Americans who get a concealed handgun permit, only a tiny fraction ever use them. Pro-gun folks compare it to a fire extinguisher in the home — you have it just in case.

But what happens when someone actually fires their weapon in self-defense? I met three concealed handgun permit (CPL) holders in Detroit who pulled the trigger.

Standberry unholstered his Sig Sauer .45, reached through the passenger-side window, and fired one shot. He hit the carjacker in the torso. Gravely wounded, the carjacker drove away, crashed into a tree and died. Police found a pistol in his pocket.

""It changed a lot in my life,"" he says. ""Matter of fact, in my English class, I just did a report on it. I named it, 'The incident that changed my life forever.' ""

Standberry went to counseling. He became fearful of gas stations. And he carried the burden of killing a 19-year-old.

""You know why? Because my son was 19 at the same time. It really bothered me that I had to take a 19-year-old's life. His life was just beginning. But he was into the wrong things. To this day, I still ask God for forgiveness,"" he says.

Caught In A Gunfight: Alaina Gonville

Gonville is a mother of three, a big woman who works as a bouncer at a Detroit bar.

Gonville was coming home from work late at night. She'd stopped at a store for a bottle of papaya juice. A scrawny guy walked up, pulled out a pistol and demanded her money. His accomplices were watching from a car behind him. As it happened, Alaina was carrying her pistol openly on her hip.

""I'm assuming they saw my gun. That's when they opened fire from their vehicle. I heard the gunshots coming at me. That's when I pulled my gun and returned fire,"" she says.

She doesn't know if she hit them or not. The robber bolted. His henchmen sped out of the parking lot, spraying Gonville and her car with military-grade bullets.

""I got shot with an AK-47, and it basically blew my arm off. It was dangling. I carried it into the hospital. After four surgeries and a lot of prayer it's healed about 70 percent,"" she says.

Did she think that having a handgun that night saved her life or endangered her more?

""That's a good question. I replayed the situation in my head over and over. I can't say, but I'm glad I had it,"" she says.

In Trouble For Thwarting Shoplifters: Tatiana Rodriguez

Born in Colombia, Rodriguez owns a small tree-trimming business in a Detroit suburb. Last October, she was outside a Home Depot loading some materials into her truck.

""A lady comes screaming through the door for help, and somebody [was] running,"" she says.

A man was running into the parking lot pushing a shopping cart full of merchandise. Rodriguez used to work at Home Depot, and she knows the company policy: Don't pursue shoplifters. But she says she thought this was more serious because a lady was screaming.

She saw the shoplifters getting away in an SUV. She had her Heckler and Koch 9 mm.

""So I take my gun out and I point at the car when he was coming towards us. I jump to the side and decide to shoot out the tires to stop them,"" she says.

In Michigan, it's illegal for a citizen to use deadly force to stop a property crime. Rodriguez got 18 months of probation for reckless discharge of a weapon and had her gun license revoked. She thinks the punishment would have been harsher, but the cops caught the shoplifters after she shot out their tires.

Her story got lots of news coverage. It turned into a case study of when not to use your pistol.

""It was not my intention to do anything wrong. I was just trying to help somebody who really needed it. And it backfired on me. So what do you learn? It's like you have to think a lot before you help somebody,"" she says.

For this story, I contacted firearms instructors and lawyers who reached out to dozens of handgun carriers who had pulled the trigger in self-defense. To my surprise, very few wanted to talk.

Some had been arrested by the police or sued afterward, and had spent thousands of dollars on legal fees. They didn't want to be dragged into the media spotlight again. Others were just traumatized by the whole experience.

Gonville urges people to think long and hard before they carry a gun.

""A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it's cool to have a gun,"" she says. ""It's not just about being cool. It's real life. Life and death is serious. Getting shot is serious. Shooting somebody is serious.""

Is It Safer To Carry A Gun?

An eye-opening Gallup poll released late last year revealed that 56 percent of respondents said they'd feel safer if more Americans could get permits to carry concealed handguns. Jennifer Carlson, a sociologist at the University of Toronto, wrote a book about handgun carriers in Michigan called Citizen-Protectors.

A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it's cool to have a gun. It's not just about being cool. It's real life. Life and death is serious.

""This is what I think is really fascinating,"" she says. ""It's not just the idea of if I conceal carry then I'm safer. It's the idea that if I just imagine there's people out there who are conceal carrying then the world is safer.""

All the trigger pullers I talked to for this story said the range time required to get a handgun license is grossly inadequate in terms of being prepared to defend themselves from an active shooter. They believe they're alive today because they did extensive practice on their own.

Mark Cortis, a veteran firearms instructor in Detroit, urges all of his CPL students to get more training. But he says hardly any of them ever do.

Planet Money Gun Lovers And Critics Agree: They're Not Sold On Smart Guns Gun Lovers And Critics Agree: They're Not Sold On Smart Guns Listen · 3:38 3:38

""One of my concerns about the [Michigan] state requirements for getting a CPL is they don't really include the tactics and the strategy that one will need to win or prevail in an actual gun situation,"" Cortis says. ""A hostile attack by a violent criminal is a fight.""

Not only are most handgun carriers in America totally unprepared for a gunfight, but gun-control activists hasten to point out that more guns lead to more suicides and accidental shootings.

Three years ago, Detroit's new police chief, James Craig, made a startling public announcement. He encouraged law-abiding citizens to consider carrying concealed weapons as a deterrent to violent crime.

In an interview, I asked Chief Craig if he ever worries about the citizens that he has urged to arm themselves?

""What concerns me, more than anything else, is guns in the hands of criminals, guns in the hands of terror suspects. That's what keeps me up at night. Not armed citizens,"" Craig says.

Meanwhile, Cortis reports so many Detroiters are seeking concealed pistol permits, classes are booked for two months out."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Darren McCollester/Getty Images Darren McCollester/Getty Images

We want to cut through the spin with a new feature we're calling ""Break It Down.""

Break It Down is going to be a regular part of our campaign coverage. We're going to try some new things. It might read a little differently from time to time. But our goal is to zoom in on what the candidates are saying, and give you the factual breakdown you need to make a sound judgment.

Hillary Clinton seemed to be barely holding back tears at a town hall in New Hampshire on Monday. Speaking in the aftermath of another tragic mass shooting, this time at an Oregon community college, the Democratic presidential candidate pitched her gun control proposals.

In the middle of her remarks, she made a big claim: She said that gun-makers and sellers are ""the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior."" We decided to see what she was talking about — and whether she's right.

Let's Break It Down.

The Claim:

""So far as I know, the gun industry and gun sellers are the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior. Nobody else is given that immunity. And that just illustrates the extremism that has taken over this debate.""

The Big Question:

Is Clinton right that the gun industry enjoys legal protections that other industries don't?

The Long Answer:

Clinton is wrong that gun companies have zero liability for their goods, but they do have special legal protections against liability that very few other industries enjoy.

To see what she's getting at, you have to back up 10 years. Clinton is talking about a 2005 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA — a law she wants to repeal as part of her gun control proposals.

Lawmakers passed that law in response to a spate of lawsuits that cities filed against the gun industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Those lawsuits often claimed gun-makers or sellers were engaging in ""negligent marketing"" or creating a ""public nuisance.""

In 2000, for example, New York City joined 30 counties and cities in suing gun manufacturers, saying manufacturers should have been making their products safer and also better tracking where their products were sold. Manufacturers, one argument at the time went, should stop supplying stores that sell a lot of guns that end up being used in crimes.

In response to these lawsuits, the NRA pushed for the law, which passed in 2005 with support from both Republicans and Democrats. Then-Sen. Clinton voted against it; her current Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, voted for it.

The law, however, allows for specific cases in which dealers and manufacturers can be held responsible. So that makes Clinton's statement technically incorrect.

""[Clinton's statement] doesn't appear to be completely accurate,"" said Adam Winkler, professor of law at UCLA and author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in an email to NPR. ""The 2005 law does not prevent gun makers from being held liable for defects in their design. Like car makers, gun makers can be sued for selling a defective product. The problem is that gun violence victims often want to hold gun makers liable for the criminal misuse of a properly functioning product.""

In other words: If you aim and fire a gun at an attacker, it's doing what it was intended to do. If it explodes while you shoot and hurts you, though, then you can sue the manufacturer. Likewise, if you had told the gun-store owner you planned to commit a crime with that gun, your victim could potentially sue.

However, Clinton ""is not totally off base,"" said John Goldberg, a professor at Harvard Law School and specialist in tort law. He said Congress was particularly ""aggressive"" in granting the gun industry this legal shield.

""Congress has rarely acted to bar the adoption by courts of particular theories of liability against a particular class of potential defendants, especially when that form of liability has not yet been recognized by the courts,"" he said.

At the time that the law passed, the NRA argued that the industry needed the protection, because — unlike carmakers, for example — it did not have the ""deep pockets"" necessary to fight a slew of lawsuits, as the New York Times reported.

Gun-rights advocates have also argued that suing a gun company for crimes committed with its products is akin to suing a car company for drunken-driving fatalities.

But the issues at hand are more complex, say some legal scholars.

""It's more like — are you a bartender and do you keep on pouring drinks for someone?"" as Fordham University law professor Saul Cornell told NPR. That might be a better way to think about whether manufacturers shouldn't supply certain stores, he says.

For an example of how this plays out, look at Adames v. Beretta. In this case, a 13-year-old boy removed the clip from his father's Beretta handgun, believing that made the gun safe, and then accidentally shot his 13-year-old friend. The victim's family sued Beretta, saying the company could have made the pistol safer and provided more warnings, according to SCOTUSBlog. Citing the PLCAA, the Illinois Supreme Court dismissed Adames' claims, and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear the case.

Victims of gun crimes like the Adames family may or may not have good cases, but PLCAA opponents say plaintiffs should at least be heard in court.

The Broader Context:

Clinton wants to repeal PLCAA as part of her broader gun control agenda, which also includes proposals to close the ""gun-show loophole"" and prevent domestic abusers from obtaining guns.

The law is one of several recent NRA legislative victories that gun control advocates would like to roll back. Recent laws have also stopped Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research on firearms, and they've also stopped researchers from accessing gun trace information, as NPR's Carrie Johnson has reported. Gun-rights advocates say withholding that trace information is about maintaining gun owners' privacy.

At first glance, taking a stand one way or the other on gun control means alienating a big chunk of voters. Democrats have steadily, overwhelmingly, favored gun control over the years, while Republicans have grown increasingly in favor of gun rights in the past decade or so, according to the Pew Research Center.

But then again, getting specific on gun policy might be good for Clinton in two ways. One is that it could endear her to pro-gun-control Democrats (this is one of the few areas where she is to the left of Sanders, her closest Democratic competition), particularly as calls for tougher gun control have grown louder after a long string of mass shootings.

Two, research has also shown that while Americans tend to be in favor of ""gun rights"" broadly, they also tend to favor specific potential gun control regulations, like background checks or assault weapon bans.

The Short Answer:

Clinton is wrong that gun manufacturers have no liability for their products, but she's right that they have unique protections from lawsuits that most other businesses — and particularly consumer product-makers — do not.

North Dakota's Republican governor signed legislation Thursday night that allows people to carry concealed handguns without needing a permit.

This makes North Dakota the latest of about a dozen states to adopt what gun rights proponents often call ""constitutional carry,"" according to the National Rifle Association.

As Dave Thompson of Prairie Public Broadcasting reports, ""The measure allows people 18 and older to carry hidden firearms without having to undergo background checks or training — as long as they're law-abiding citizens."" Anyone who is eligible to possess a Class 2 firearm license and has had a valid driver's license or state ID card for at least a year may carry a concealed firearm.

In a statement, Gov. Doug Burgum said, ""Gun ownership is both a right and a responsibility, and that responsibility begins with individuals and families."" The statement also said the governor ""encouraged anyone considering carrying a concealed weapon to enroll in one of North Dakota's many certified gun safety courses.""

The number of concealed-carry permits in the state has more than doubled in the past five years, to 48,700, according to The Associated Press.

Critics of the legislation had argued that it was already easy to get a concealed-carry permit in North Dakota.

Democratic state Sen. Carolyn Nelson of Fargo said the measure was unnecessary. ""If you can read, you can pass the test,"" she was quoted as saying by the AP.

South Dakota's Republican governor, Dennis Daugaard, vetoed a similar measure in his state earlier this month. In an op-ed in the Rapid City Journal, Daugaard wrote that he could not support ""bad legislation which would lead to a whole host of unintended consequences. The laws we currently have in place are effective, appropriate and minimal.""

Idaho, Mississippi and West Virginia passed similar laws last year, and New Hampshire did so last month."

Mass shootings and police shootings have spurred calls for authorities to take action to reduce the violence. But policymakers may be stymied by the dearth of public health research into both gun violence and deaths that involve the police. One big obstacle: congressional restrictions on funding of such research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Right now, the CDC studies all kinds of violence. There's a program on child abuse and youth violence, and the public health agency collects data on suicides and sexual assaults.

But there are some glaring research gaps. The CDC doesn't systematically collect data on deaths at the hands of law enforcement, and there's actually a law that effectively stops it from doing research on gun violence.

The authorization doesn't explicitly forbid research; rather, it says that no funds may be used ""to advocate or promote gun control."" But scientists got the message that firearms-related research was politically fraught.

Some scientists are looking to change that. ""It's never a good idea to muzzle scientific investigations for political reasons,"" says Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Holt's a physicist who was also a Democratic member of Congress until earlier this year. AAAS last week called for an end to congressional restrictions on gun research at the CDC.

""All the debate for several decades now has been carried out on the basis of opinion and ideology and assertion and political stance, rather than the evidence,"" says Holt.

If the government could collect detailed data on gun violence, researchers might see patterns and come up with interventions that could reduce the number of deaths, researchers say.

Nancy Krieger, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wants to see the same type of data on deaths that involve law enforcement. ""We have an official mystery in the United States as to the number of people who are killed by the police,"" she says.

Police departments sometimes resist reporting the data to the Justice Department, so official information is spotty. ""Why are these only being treated as police data?"" Krieger asks. ""These are mortality records. We in public health count dead people. It's one of the things we do. And we count them in order to understand how to prevent preventable deaths.""

Krieger says that for now the best source of information on gun deaths is a website created by the British newspaper The Guardian. ""It's shocking that we in the U.S. have to turn to a U.K. newspaper's website to get timely reporting about who is being killed by the police. We have better a public health system than that.""

So in a paper published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine, Krieger and several colleagues call for the CDC to declare law-enforcement-related deaths a so-called notifiable condition. That means public health workers — not police — would be required to report such deaths to a state or local agency.

The current limit on CDC research into overall gun violence came about in 1997 after some agency officials suggested the goal was to reduce access to guns.

The National Rifle Association seized on the statements, lobbying Congress to cut funding.

NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide says the organization doesn't want the CDC to advocate for gun bans. ""The NRA is not and never has been opposed to research that promoted the safe and responsible use of firearms and [it works] to reduce gun-related deaths,"" he said.

Former Arkansas Rep. Jay Dickey, who sponsored the original bill restricting gun research, now says the restrictions have gone too far. He told NPR's Steve Inskeep in October:

""It wasn't necessary that all research stop. It just couldn't be the collection of data so that they can advocate gun control. That's all we were talking about. But for some reason, it just stopped altogether.""

Dickey now wants his former colleagues to repeal the limits on CDC research.

But that possibility looks remote. Earlier this year, an amendment to do just that was defeated in a House committee with almost no debate."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Humphrey/AP Mark Humphrey/AP

President Trump signed a measure into law Tuesday that rescinds an Obama-era rule aimed at blocking gun sales to certain mentally ill people.

The GOP-majority Senate passed the bill by a 57-43 margin earlier this month, following a House vote to overturn the rule.

The Obama administration policy ""would have required the Social Security Administration to report the records of some mentally ill beneficiaries to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System,"" as The Two-Way has reported. ""Those who have been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs — roughly 75,000 people — would have been affected by the rule.""

It was strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association, and as NPR's Jessica Taylor reported, ""Republicans argued it infringed upon Second Amendment rights by denying due process.""

As we have reported, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a leading supporter of the rule's repeal, has stated that ""if a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it.""

The rule was written in response to the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot dead 20 students and six teachers. As The Associated Press reported, it was ""crafted as part of Obama's efforts to strengthen the federal background check system"" in the wake of that tragedy.

""We know that people with serious mental illness in this country can go buy a very powerful weapon and do great damage with it,"" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, who represents Newtown, said in a speech to Senate Republicans earlier this month. He said of mentally ill people, ""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect you are going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm?"""

Enlarge this image Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images

By a 57-43 margin, the Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to repeal an Obama-era regulation designed to block certain mentally ill people from purchasing firearms. The vote, which approves a House resolution passed earlier this month, now sends the measure to the White House for President Trump's signature.

President Trump, who campaigned as a defender of gun rights and a friend of the National Rifle Association, is widely expected to sign the measure.

The rule on the verge of rollback would have required the Social Security Administration to report the records of some mentally ill beneficiaries to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Those who have been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs — roughly 75,000 people — would have been affected by the rule, according to NPR's Susan Davis.

It was implemented by former President Obama after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, which saw 20 students and six teachers killed at an elementary school by 20-year-old Adam Lanza. The Hill reports that the rule was set to take effect in December.

Yet GOP lawmakers have argued that the regulation was needlessly heavy-handed, painting people with mental illnesses with too broad a brush and infringing on their constitutional rights. The Associated Press reports that Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a leading Republican critic of the rule, said it is filled with ""vague characteristics that do not fit into the federal mentally defective standard"" prohibiting someone from buying or owning a gun.

""If a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it,"" Grassley said, according to the news service.

The NRA and the American Civil Liberties Union also opposed Obama's rule — the NRA for its restrictions on the Second Amendment, the ACLU for the possibility it would stereotype the mentally ill as violent.

So, seizing its long-awaited moment with a GOP president in the White House, Congress passed Wednesday's ""Resolution of Disapproval"" under the Congressional Review Act, a rarely used maneuver that gives lawmakers a means to overturn federal regulations put in place by the executive branch. The move allows the Senate to proceed with a simple majority, thus enabling GOP senators to avoid a filibuster by Democrats.

The House got that ball rolling two weeks ago; the Senate sent it the rest of the way to President Trump's desk.

Democrats, however, excoriated the legislation as irresponsible.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut where the Sandy Hook massacre occurred, delivered a fiery speech against the measure before Wednesday's vote, The Hill reports:

""The [Congressional Review Act] we have before us today will make it harder for the federal government to do what we have told them to do for decades, which is to put dangerous people and people who are seriously mentally ill on the list of people who are prohibited from buying a gun.""

The AP notes that Murphy added: ""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you're going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Brennan Linsley/AP Brennan Linsley/AP

Shoppers hunting for Black Friday deals seemed to include a record number of those in the market for firearms; the FBI says it fielded 203,086 background check requests for gun purchases on the day after Thanksgiving — the highest daily total ever, reports USA Today.

""Background checks are considered the best available proxy for gun purchases since overall sales numbers are not made public,"" reports NPR's Uri Berliner.

But the number of firearms actually sold on Friday was probably higher than 203,086 because a buyer would require just one check but could purchase multiple firearms in a single transaction.

It is a popular time of year to buy guns. The previous record of 185,713 background checks was set one year earlier on Black Friday.

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is designed to keep guns from falling ""into the wrong hands,"" according to the FBI, although the reality sometimes falls short of the goal.

Federal law bars convicted felons or anyone under a domestic violence protective order from owning a firearm, among other people. The FBI says out of the more than 230 million checks that have been conducted, more than a million denials have been issued. The agency also says the system ""ensures the timely transfer of firearms to eligible gun buyers.""

In the vast majority of cases, the background check takes just a couple of minutes, and if it comes out clean, the buyer walks away with the weapon, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing FBI data. But even if there is a holdup, the consumer may still be able to get the gun promptly. ""In about 8% of cases, the verdict is delayed, and the seller has to wait three days. If there is no verdict after three days, the sale can go through,"" reports the newspaper.

Another loophole: only federally-licensed firearm dealers require background checks. Consumers can get around the rule by making a legal purchase from unlicensed sellers.

Friday's surge in background check requests came two days after Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to do a comprehensive review of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

""The recent shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas revealed that relevant information may not be getting reported to the NICS – this is alarming and it is unacceptable,"" Sessions said in a statement.

The gunman who killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church earlier this month should never have been carrying a gun. He was legally barred from possessing a firearm after being convicted of assaulting his then-wife and baby stepson, while serving in the Air Force.

But the system apparently fell short of flagging him. Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told The Two-Way in an email, ""Initial information indicates that Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations.""

But the system has been struggling under the weight of an exponential increase in background checks in recent years. In 1998, NICS reported fewer than 1 million. By last year, it had conducted more than 27 million — a record.

USA Today reports:

""The mere record of arrest is not enough to prohibit a gun sale, so FBI analysts must race to fill such information gaps within the three-day time period allotted for each check. The search sometimes requires inquiries to police departments, courthouses and prisons across the country to match final dispositions to the incomplete records.""

Despite the rise in firearm sales in recent years, President Trump — who is backed by the National Rifle Association — seems to have actually been bad for gun business. Since his election, the number of background checks dipped down, following a surge in 2016 amid fears that a Hillary Clinton presidency might limit gun sales."

The U.S. and Russia have been taking lots of jabs at each other.

Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized President Obama's plan for a military strike in Syria, and the Russian leader then denounced American ""exceptionalism"" in a biting op-ed in The New York Times.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., fired back Thursday with his own op-ed in the Russian paper Pravda, entitled, ""Russia Deserves Better Than Putin.""

Even Monday's shooting at the Navy Yard in Washington, in which a gunmen killed 12 people, has become part of the feud.

Alexei Pushkov, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's parliament, used the shooting to mock the United States as it was happening.

""A new shootout at Navy headquarters in Washington — a lone gunman and seven corpses. Nobody's even surprised anymore. A clear confirmation of American exceptionalism,"" Puskoy tweeted.

But while Pushkov sneers at U.S. gun laws, how do the stats look in Russia?

According to Gunpolicy.org, Russians have far fewer guns than Americans — and far more homicides.

There are fewer than 13 million firearms in circulation in Russia, compared with an estimated 300 million in the United States. That works out to about 9 guns per 100 people in Russia and closed to 100 guns per 100 people in America.

The most recent homicide statistics for Russia show that there were 21,603 killings in 2009.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Karpov Sergei/ITAR-TASS /Landov Karpov Sergei/ITAR-TASS /Landov

According to the FBI, the United States had 13,636 homicides in 2009 with a population that is more than twice as large. More than 80 percent of those killings were gun-related.

It's difficult to make a direct comparison of gun homicides in the two countries because Russia doesn't break down its murder statistics.

Russian Gun Laws

Russia has tough gun laws on the books. It's illegal for Russian citizens to own automatic and semi-automatic guns. It's possible to apply for a handgun or shotgun license, though citizens are required to provide reasons such as hunting or target shooting.

Applicants face strict background checks, including criminal history, a full psychological evaluation and a medical exam. They must pass a test on firearm laws and safety.

Each weapon is then registered by the police during a home visit. Police take bullet patterns, test bullets and cartridges so bullets can be matched if the gun is used in a crime. A license lasts five years, after which applicants must go through the whole process again.

In spite of these laws, the country does have periodic mass shootings by people thought to be mentally ill.

Last November, after a five-day drinking binge, 30-year-old lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov posted a message online referring to humanity as ""compost.""

Shortly after, he walked into the Moscow pharmaceutical company where he worked and opened fire, killing six colleagues and critically injuring another. He was jailed for life last week.

Move To Ease Gun Laws

The Right to Bear Arms, a Moscow-based organization that has more than 5,000 members, is trying to make guns more easily available in Russia.

""Our citizens are deprived of normal tools of self-defense, and that plays an important role in public safety,"" Maria Butina, the group's 24-year-old founder, told The Moscow News.

But she has a long way to go in convincing the public. A poll by the Levada Center in 2011 showed that 80 percent of Russians are opposed to easing existing gun laws."

Leaders of the National Rifle Association plan to break their weeklong silence Friday and make their first public comments on the mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

They say they will be speaking for the NRA's 4 million members. But they will also be speaking for the gun industry, which has close financial ties to the association.

The NRA and the gun industry are reeling after last week's massacre. The primary weapon used — an AR-15-style rifle — is one of the most popular guns in America.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association of the firearms industry, says those who have AR-15s are among the most passionate gun owners.

Just recently, the foundation put out a video touting the AR-15 as ""probably one of the most customizable rifles there is today."" A gunsmith showed how to add a muzzle flash hider, various sights and other accessories — things the gun is designed to accept easily.

And that captures the strength — and possibly the weakness — of the industry and the NRA.

""What we're seeing is that the industry is trying to think of one new thing to sell to gun owners,"" says Josh Sugarmann, head of the Violence Policy Center, a group seeking tighter gun laws.

Studies show the American gun culture faces long-term problems: too many older white guys; dwindling land for hunting, as suburbs encroach; and kids who pick up video games rather than BB guns.

Sugarmann says industry leaders see the problem. ""They've recognized that the traditional market — traditional hunting rifles and shotguns — is saturated. So there's an ever-shrinking market that's buying more and more lethal weapons,"" he says.

Weapons like the AR-15 — a civilian version of the standard military rifle. The industry-preferred term is ""modern sporting rifle.""

A survey by the Shooting Sports Foundation found that nearly two-thirds of AR-15 owners own more than one.

The NRA and the foundation are trying to expand the market of gun enthusiasts — as with a foundation promo for a program called First Shots. ""If you've never fired a gun before, here's your chance. Your local shooting range wants to give you a shot,"" the promo says. ""You're invited to a free seminar developed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation.""

But those demographic woes are for the long term.

Nima Samadi, an industry analyst at IBISWorld, has a short-term picture. He says that compared with the military and law enforcement segments of the gun industry, ""the consumer segment has seen a pretty aggressive growth, particularly over the past five years.""

One reason: fear of crime. The crime rate has been steadily declining, but it still helps explain the strength in handgun sales.

The other reason — much more powerful — is the fear that if you don't buy that AR-15 now, the Obama administration won't let you buy it later.

""By far, that's the largest driver for the growth,"" Samadi says.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, appeared on Glenn Beck's TV station earlier this month, before Sandy Hook.

""I mean, the strongest defense of the Second Amendment is the marketplace,"" he said. ""And there's no clearer picture about how average American citizens feel about their Second Amendment rights than lines at gun stores all over the country right now because they fear the Obama administration's second term is coming after their freedom.""

All of this has the effect of bringing the quarter-billion-dollar-a-year NRA and the $12 billion-a-year gun industry closer together.

Sturm Ruger, known especially for its handguns, had a yearlong promotion in which it gave the NRA a dollar for each gun sold. The total exceeded $1.2 million.

Beretta USA gave $1 million to support Second Amendment lawsuits.

And the CEO of Cabela's, the big-box chain that sells sports and outdoors gear, gave the NRA $1 million cash. He was inducted into the association's Golden Ring of Freedom for top donors.

It's much too early to tell how the Connecticut massacre will affect things — either financially or legislatively. But right now, gun sales are spiking. Once again, it's the fear of new gun control laws that's moving weapons off the shelves."

There's a national debate going on about gun silencers. On one side is the gun industry and a manufacturer whose motto is guns don't have to be loud. They support a new bill to relax longstanding federal restrictions on silencers, which are also known as suppressors. On the other side are people who say guns should be noisy because it's important for public safety. NPR's Nathan Rott has the story. And just so you know, you will hear the sound of gunshots.

NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: There are about a million registered gun silencers owned by people in the U.S. right now. But unless you own one or know someone who does, Jason Schauble would argue that your perception of silencers is flawed.

JASON SCHAUBLE: Most people know what they see in movies, and they see, oh, it's always a spy.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""GOLDENEYE"")

SEAN BEAN: (As Alec Trevelyan) You're late, 007.

PIERCE BROSNAN: (As James Bond) After you, 006.

SCHAUBLE: You know, somebody who's involved in some sort of combat scenario and then also the sound that it makes.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

SCHAUBLE: It is very, very quiet compared to what really happens.

ROTT: Schauble is a former Marine and an executive at SilencerCo, a leading manufacturer of gun suppressors. And he believes that Hollywood representation of silencers is unfair. It's not about professional assassins using near-silent guns, he says, but the tens of millions of gun owners, recreational shooters and hunters in America who want less recoil or kick when they shoot and a little less ringing in their ears after.

SCHAUBLE: It's about, I don't have to wear hearing protection while I shoot; I don't have to damage my ears. So we think of it as a public health issue.

ROTT: Silencers are currently legal for private citizens to buy in 42 U.S. states, but they're as heavily regulated nationally as machine guns. That's because silencers are listed under something called the National Firearms Act, legislation that was passed by Congress in 1934 in response to mob violence and the rising criminal use of new or modified firearms like sawed-off shotguns. Under that law, someone looking to buy a silencer has to enter a federal registry, acquire special licensing and pay a $200 fee.

The process today takes about nine months on average. The legislation proposed by Republican lawmakers would make that process much shorter and waive the feet. The legislation is called the Hearing Protection Act.

DAVID CHIPMAN: That's offensive.

ROTT: David Chipman is with Americans for Responsible Solutions, and he's a retired 25-year veteran of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or the ATF. He thinks the legislation is not about protecting shooters' hearing as the name would imply but a gun industry looking for new profits. There are hundreds of millions of guns owned by people in the country and only about a million silencers currently owned. So with silencers going for anywhere from a few hundred dollars to well over a thousand, there is a lot of room to make money.

The bigger issue, though, Chipman says, is that he believes removing current restrictions on silencers would put the public and law enforcement at risk.

CHIPMAN: A good scenario to think about is when there was that ambush shooting of Dallas police officers.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Chaos erupting on the streets of Dallas at 9 p.m.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Somebody's really armed to the teeth.

ROTT: Five officers were killed by a gunman in the shooting during a peaceful protest last year. And Chipman says police were able to quickly find the shooter because they could tell where the shots were coming from.

CHIPMAN: If that person had been using a silencer, it would have been very difficult to locate that person's position.

ROTT: Not because it would have made the shots silent but because it would reduce the flash at the end of the muzzle and change the sound of a discharge. A suppressed gun sounds different, he says.

CHIPMAN: It doesn't sound like gunfire.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: Couldn't ask for a prettier day, man.

MATT PINNELL: Seriously.

ROTT: Matt Pinnell from SilencerCo let us test that at a shooting range near their headquarters in West Valley City, Utah.

PINNELL: We have our 9 millimeter.

ROTT: He brought a range of different guns to try - handguns, rifles, even a 12-gauge shotgun.

PINNELL: So that's our small arsenal we have today.

ROTT: And we're going to shoot all of them with a suppressor and without to hear the difference. Quick technical note - I'm going to record this about eight feet away from Pinnell with my microphone pointed away from the gun so it doesn't blow out the mike. That said, it also makes all of these shots sound a lot quieter than they actually are.

PINNELL: Ready?

ROTT: Yep, let's do it.

PINNELL: OK.

ROTT: First up - that 9 millimeter handgun, one of the most common guns on the market - no suppressor.

PINNELL: Firing.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

ROTT: Pinnell screws a silencer on the end and...

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

ROTT: Quite a bit quieter.

PINNELL: Yeah, it makes a difference for sure. I mean you don't get that crack. You don't that ringing in your ears after.

ROTT: The American Speech Language Hearing Association says that any noise over 140 decibels - think a jet engine - can cause immediate, permanent damage to a person's hearing. A 9 millimeter handgun shot like the first three we just heard without the suppressor, those were about 160 decibels. With the suppressor, Pinnell says, those last shots were about 125, which is somewhere between the average loudness of an ambulance siren and a jackhammer.

Next, let's hear a .308 bolt-action rifle, your standard hunting rifle, without a suppressor.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: And then with one...

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: For kicks, let's also go inside to an indoor shooting range to hear the difference enclosed. Here's an AR-15 or semiautomatic rifle, no silencer inside.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

ROTT: Much louder. And then with one...

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: The point Pinnell and SilencerCo want to get across is that the sound of a suppressed gunshot is still loud enough to hear, whether you're in a forest or a shopping mall. Point taken. But is that sound still recognizable enough to warn people of potential danger?

NPR reached out to a number of law enforcement groups and individuals to ask them, is there a danger in making suppressors easier to buy? The bigger associations said they wouldn't comment on pending legislation or that they were reviewing the matter. Steve Ijames, a retired Missouri police chief and a current SWAT trainer, had this to say.

STEVE IJAMES: I don't think there's any way to escape that reality that if any particular product that could be misused or abused is more readily available, it's just simply a increased statistical probability.

ROTT: But Ijames does not believe that there would be widespread abuse. He says there could be complications. Technology like ShotSpotter, which uses the sound of a gun to pinpoint the location of a shooter, that could be less effective. But personally he says, if he had a vote, he'd be in favor of easing restrictions. He sees the benefits of quieting guns for shooters. As for the Hearing Protection Act, silencer manufacturers said they don't expect it to be a high legislative priority in the immediate future. Further out, though, they are optimistic.

New York state has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. Compliance with those laws is another matter.

New York passed a broad package of gun regulations after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., despite the objections of hunters and gun rights advocates. Now it appears that many gun owners are refusing to comply with a key provision that requires the registration of so-called assault weapons.

""I think this law was so incredibly repressive that it drove people to the point now that they're basically saying we're not going to abide by any more laws,"" says Brian Olesen, the owner of American Trade and Goods and several other outdoor stores around Albany, N.Y., that stock a wide range of guns for hunting and self-defense. Olesen says his customers overwhelmingly oppose the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act — or SAFE Act, as the 2013 gun law is known.

[The SAFE Act] still may be law, but the people of New York state have repealed it on their own. They're just ignoring the law.

The law has some of the nation's toughest regulations on guns and ammunition, including a ban on the sale of so-called ""military style assault weapons,"" like the AR-15 style long rifle used in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It also requires New Yorkers to register the assault weapons they already own with police.

Critics of the law see registration as the first step toward confiscation. And some say they just won't do it.

""I just don't see there's any need to,"" says Joseph Fuller of Cohoes, N.Y. Fuller says he owns several guns, including at least one that he's required to register under the SAFE Act. But he hasn't.

""I don't pay attention, to be honest,"" says Fuller. ""I have friends out in the boondocks. They won't register their guns either. And they told me ... don't even bother. Don't worry about it.""

No one knows exactly how many so-called assault weapons there are in New York. But the number is likely far more than the 45,000 that have been registered so far. The New York State Police released that number recently, but only after being ordered to by a court.

""[The SAFE Act] still may be law, but the people of New York state have repealed it on their own,"" says Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association. ""They're just ignoring the law.""

Supporters of the SAFE Act disagree.

""I think 45,000 is a lot of assault weapons. I think it's evidence of how long overdue this law is,"" says Leah Barrett, executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. Barrett points out that multiple public opinion polls — including one commissioned by her group — show that 60 percent of New Yorkers support the SAFE Act.

""They support the background check requirement. They support the state's ban on military-style assault weapons. They even support the background checks on ammunition sales,"" says Barrett, ""because they know that these are entirely reasonable.""

Still, the law's opponents show no signs of backing down. They've been especially loud in upstate New York, where hunting is a big part of the culture. Among them are many elected county sheriffs.

""When I prioritize what I need to do as a sheriff, the SAFE Act comes in at the bottom of that list,"" says Christopher Moss, the sheriff in Chemung County, a rural area near the Pennsylvania border. ""I do look at it personally as an infringement on Second Amendment rights.""

That puts Moss and many other state sheriffs at odds with Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo touted the SAFE Act during his re-election campaign last year. His administration did not respond to requests for comment on the apparent lack of enforcement.

And this month, Cuomo agreed to postpone another controversial part of the law: a statewide database to track ammunition purchases.

""When the database is ready, it will be instituted,"" Cuomo told reporters this month. ""But if people are worried that we're gonna do that before it's ready, we're not gonna do that before it's ready.""

That did not appease upstate Republican lawmakers. Some are still trying to repeal the SAFE Act. And gun rights groups are challenging the law in court. A federal judge in Buffalo upheld most of the law in 2013. An appeals court is expected to rule on the case this year."

On a weekday morning in January, business is steady at Northwest Armory, a gun store on an Oregon state highway just south of Portland.

Customers lean over glass cases to look at handguns or run their fingers along the polished wood of hunting rifles that line the aisles, aimed at the ceiling. AR-15s hang on hooks and ammunition boxes are stacked up behind a sales clerk, who leans over to talk to an older couple.

Oregon has a lot of gun owners. There are hunters and target shooters, ranchers who carry guns to guard their livestock against predators, and collectors. And a lot of men and women in Oregon carry guns to protect themselves.

From time to time, they all find themselves in a place like the Northwest Armory. They might be more inclined to visit after announcements like President Obama's executive order earlier this week.

Are sales more brisk at Northwest Armory since Tuesday morning?

""Well, you got to remember, we had a snowstorm,"" Karl Durkheimer said with a laugh. He and his wife own the Northwest Armory.

Durkheimer says that December 2015 was one of his best months in 20 years — Christmas is a big gun-buying occasion across the country — and the trend is continuing in January, despite the unexpected snow and ice. Durkheimer says customers are reacting to recent terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris, as well as the Obama administration's approach to guns — and a general discomfort many have toward the president's politics.

""There's a segment of society — a vast segment of society — that looks at him and says 'if he says black, I'm going to say white, if he says up, I'm going to go down,' "" Durkheimer said, adding that while there's been a divide before, ""I believe it's worse than it's ever been.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption David Gilkey/NPR David Gilkey/NPR

The store owner didn't agree with the additional rules Obama announced this week. He said that background checks already keep guns away from convicted felons and some people suffering from mental illness, and that instead of tightening those rules, police should more aggressively enforce gun laws and regulations already in place.

Durkheimer said gang violence in cities like Chicago provides a good opportunity for that.

""If I was the governor of Illinois, I would declare a state of emergency. I would take the National Guard, or whatever it took, and you'd have them on every street corner where this violence is occurring, and then I would enforce existing laws so that there was a zero tolerance for this senseless violence,"" Durkheimer said.

He questioned whether Obama's executive order, and the timing of it, might be more about distracting the American public from other pressing problems, such as the emerging conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

It may be too soon to tell whether the executive order will have much effect on gun sales at shops like the Northwest Armory. Some customers have noticed that past gun control efforts have driven up prices and made some products harder to get, mostly because of increased customer demand.

Erin Stoffel stopped by the Northwest Armory to pick up a special-order purple handgun he ordered for his wife weeks ago. It still hadn't come in. Stoffel hadn't heard President Obama's announced executive order on guns, and had mixed feelings about what Obama proposed — and how he proposed it.

""I appreciate that a lot of people out there are concerned about violence and crime rates, and so I don't know that necessarily I begrudge, certainly, a president doing what he can to stall violence,"" Stoffel said. ""But as far as trying to circumvent Congress, that bothers me — that's concerning.""

Durkheimer and his customers generally were skeptical about the effect of the rules. Durkheimer sees additional regulations likely making it harder for law-abiding citizens to obtain guns, without doing much to crack down on criminal gun possession.

Durkheimer said that gun shop owners don't want to put guns in the wrong hands, and that he had turned away men who smelled of alcohol, and a tearful young woman who seemed to be having a breakdown. But he also recalled an elderly man having to wait months for a collectible — because a background check flagged a college prank from 60 years before.

Durkheimer hopes government leaders can find a ""middle path"" that helps gun sellers and law-abiding customers."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Allen G. Breed/AP Allen G. Breed/AP

The city of Columbia, S.C., has banned the use of bump stocks, the attachment that dramatically accelerates the rate-of-fire of semi-automatic rifles. Columbia is believed to be the first, or one of the first, U.S. cities to enact such a ban.

Bump stocks allow semi-automatic rifles to fire bullets nearly as rapidly as automatic weapons. The ban is meant to prevent the device's use, not its sale — a discrepancy that Columbia officials say is due to a state law that bars cities from regulating firearms or firearm components.

Bump stocks made headlines in October, when a man used weapons fitted with the attachment in an attack that killed 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. The weapons reportedly shot perhaps as fast as 90 shots in 10 seconds. After that massacre, Massachusetts enacted a ban on bump stocks.

Columbia's Mayor Steve Benjamin says his city acted out of both common sense and respect for the Second Amendment.

""We could not outright ban ownership of them outright"" Benjamin tells NPR's Rachel Martin on Morning Edition. ""We could prohibit their use in the city in their attachment to illegal firearm and that's what we did in this ordinance. It is now under state law. All we could do is issue a misdemeanor for someone who attaches one would be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine in 30 days in jail.""

Columbia's City Council approved the new ordinance Tuesday, banning both bump stocks and trigger cranks — small cranks that fit over the trigger and which can fire a weapon multiple times with one revolution.

The ban had its critics when it was introduced in early December — but this week, Benjamin says, ""The response has been overwhelmingly positive."" He cited emails from Republicans and Second Amendment advocates who said that despite their political beliefs, ""there's no reason that these things should be on our streets.""

Laying out the city council's logic, the mayor noted that after a heinous mass shooting, ""people always say that a good guy with a gun could have done something about this.""

""Well, the reality is that on our city council, there are whole lots of good guys who have guns,"" Benjamin said, ""and [we] just thought that other than the argument being so constantly polarized, that people who are strong supporters of the Second Amendment — but also strong supporters of downright good common sense — should step up and do something. And we thought Columbia, South Carolina, might be a great place to start."""

Saying that on this ""profoundly emotional day"" he hoped that his state would serve as an example to the rest of the nation, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy sat down Thursday at 12:20 p.m. ET to sign into law what's being described as the most sweeping gun control legislation in the nation since the Dec. 14 school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

Malloy praised lawmakers and those who helped craft the legislation for coming together ""as few places in our nation have demonstrated the ability to do.""

Before the governor put pen to paper, Deborah Davis of Hartford told those gathered that ""our children are crying out from the grave, telling us to stop this violence."" Her son Philip was shot to death in 2010.

Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was among the 20 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School last December, thanked the lawmakers. ""Our voices have been heard,"" she said. ""We want Newtown to be known, not for our tragedy, but for transformation.""

As we reported earlier, the legislation puts extensive restrictions on the sale of weapons, ammunition and ammunition magazines in the state.

Our original post, with much more about the new law, follows:

Legislators in Connecticut, where 20 children and six educators were killed four months ago in one of the worst mass shootings in the nation's history, approved legislation early Thursday that puts extensive restrictions on the sale of weapons, ammunition and ammunition magazines in the state.

Proponents, The Hartford Courant reports, call it the ""toughest-in-the-nation"" response to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

Ebong Udoma of NPR member station WSHU in Fairfield, Conn., tells our Newscast Desk that the bill ""includes an expansion of Connecticut's assault weapon ban, background checks for all gun and ammunition sales, a new registry of existing high capacity magazines and a ban on the sale of magazines holding more than 10 bullets, starting next year.""

The ""historic gun control"" bill, writes the New Haven Register, ""also addressed mental health reforms and money to make schools more secure.""

The state's Senate passed the legislation Wednesday afternoon by a vote of 26-10. The Courant says ""two of 22 Democrats and eight of 14 Republicans [were] opposed."" Then at 2:26 a.m. ET Thursday, the state's General Assembly gave the legislation its approval. The vote was 105 to 44. ""Of the 98 House Democrats present, 13 voted no; and 31 of the 51 Republicans in the hall voted no,"" the Courant says.

Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, is expected to sign the legislation into law around midday.

A copy of the bill is posted here.

The Courant notes that:

""The legislation would require universal background checks for purchasers of all firearms, and would immediately expand the state's existing ban on assault weapons. The list of banned weapons would include the Bushmaster AR-15 semiautomatic rifle used by [Newtown killer Adam] Lanza. ... ""In a compromise, owners of ... large-capacity magazines would not be required to turn them in, although their use would be restricted and they would have to be registered with the state by Jan. 1, 2014. Likewise, people who already own semiautomatic rifles defined as assault weapons could keep them if they submit to new registration procedures. ""Beginning Oct. 1, all purchases of ammunition and long guns would require an eligibility certificate. To obtain certification to buy ammunition, purchasers would have to pass a federal criminal background check.""

And according to the Register, the legislation includes:

""A dangerous weapons offender registry, training for school personnel to recognize mental health issues among children, threat assessment teams at colleges, new eligibility certificates to buy any rifle, shotgun or ammunition, stricter firearms storage rules and tougher penalties for weapons trafficking, among other things.""

The Register adds that passage of the bills:"

From 2009 to 2014, more than 73,000 guns that were seized in Mexico were traced to the U.S., according to a new update on the effort to fight weapons trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The figure, based on data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, represents about 70 percent of the 104,850 firearms seized by Mexican authorities that were also submitted to U.S. authorities for tracing.

The data was analyzed by the Government Accountability Office, which notes in its report that U.S. police agencies have acknowledged firearms smuggling is fueling violent crime in Mexico.

""Most of the firearms seized in Mexico that were traced and found to be of U.S. origin from 2009 to 2014 came from U.S. Southwest border states,"" the GAO report says. ""While guns seized in Mexico of U.S. origin were traced to all of the 50 states, most came from Texas, California, and Arizona.""

Many of those guns were bought legally in the U.S. and then smuggled over the border, according to the GAO.

""About half were long guns, such as the high-caliber AR-15, preferred by cartel gunmen,"" NPR's John Burnett reports for our Newscast unit. ""Mexican drug traffickers continue to rely on straw purchasers who legally buy the weapons in the U.S., then transfer them to criminal gangs.""

The GAO report paints a picture of the challenges officials face as they try to stop the flow of weapons from the U.S. into Mexico, where laws seek to strictly limit the availability of guns to the public.

The report identifies a new wrinkle in the illegal gun trade, citing officials on both sides of the border who say they're seeing instances of unfinished gun parts being transported into Mexico, where they're used to assemble finished weapons. None of those unfinished parts — barrels and receivers; pins and triggers; grips and stocks — are covered by the U.S. Gun Control Act; they're also not subject to rules that require serial numbers, the GAO says.

In another example, the report says the ATF has been able to trace the original purchasers of less than half of the 73,684 guns that were seized and submitted for tracing.

The GAO says the agency couldn't figure out who bought 53 percent of the guns at retail ""because of factors such as incomplete identifying data on trace request forms, altered serial numbers, no response from the federal firearm licensee to ATF's request for trace information, or incomplete or never received out-of-business licensee records.""

Citing data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the GAO says, ""the agency seized 5,951 firearms that were destined for Mexico in the last 6 years.""

The new GAO report is an update of a 2009 study in which it found that the ATF and ICE were duplicating efforts and running into jurisdictional problems as they tried to fight arms trafficking.

As it did in that report, the GAO also issued recommendations — including one that calls on Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to ensure there's a way to monitor and support their agencies' sharing of information. It also called on the Office of National Drug Control Policy to set up indicators to reflect progress made by the ATF and ICE."

But significant partisan divides remain — and perhaps relatedly, they exist alongside divides in knowledge about guns in America.

Eight-in-10 Americans told the pollsters they favor bans on assault weapons, high-capacity ammunition magazines and ""bump stocks,"" an accessory used by the Las Vegas shooter that allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire like an automatic weapon.

Eight-in-10 likewise said they favor a federal database to track all gun sales. On each of these questions, majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans all were in favor of the restrictions to some degree.

But the share who were in favor, as well as the intensity of their agreement, varied by party — sometimes widely. For example, 91 percent of Democrats, along with 76 percent of independents and 70 percent of Republicans, said they are for banning assault-style weapons.

However, 74 percent of Democrats ""strongly favor"" this kind of restriction, as opposed to ""somewhat favoring"" it, compared to only 48 percent of Republicans ""strongly"" in favor and 45 percent of independents who said so.

Similar divides existed on other restrictions — fully 88 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of Republicans, and 82 percent of independents favor banning bump stocks. But while three-quarters of Democrats ""strongly favor"" this kind of ban, only around half of Republicans and independents do.

This kind of discrepancy in intensity can be important to show the softness of support for a measure — and can be an indication of how the group less ""strongly"" in favor can be swayed as arguments become more hotly political on specific topics, like an assault-weapons or a high-capacity magazine ban.

This isn't the only indication post-Vegas that Americans have an appetite for more gun control. A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll likewise showed that a majority of Republicans, along with Democrats and independents, favoring several different types of gun-control laws, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as creating a national gun-sale database.

But the new interest may be short-lived, Ipsos Public Affairs President Cliff Young said.

""What we know actually is that gun violence like this typically has a short-term effect on public opinion where there's a crystallizing event"" that temporarily bumps support for gun control upward, he said. ""We expect there should be some sort of half-life to it.""

And importantly, while Republicans and Democrats alike support specific restrictions, the general idea of tighter gun control is much more firmly supported by Democrats than anyone else — 84 percent of Democrats said gun laws should be ""a lot"" or ""somewhat"" stricter than today, compared to 61 percent of independents and 55 percent of Republicans.

One-third of Republicans said gun laws right now are ""about right,"" compared to 23 percent of independents and just 9 percent of Democrats.

Partisan differences also showed up in exposure to guns — significantly more Republicans than Democrats have fired guns, own guns and have friends who own them, the survey shows.

And that dovetails with some particularly wide partisan gaps on attitudes toward guns. Two-thirds of Republicans agreed with the statement ""owning a gun would make me feel safer,"" compared to around just a third of Democrats.

Likewise, 72 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement, ""The benefits of gun ownership outweigh the risks."" Democrats were the near opposite of that, with 60 percent disagreeing.

Loading...

And those different attitudes play into partisan gaps in Americans' knowledge about gun facts, Young said. ""Democrats see the issue through the lens of the risks that gun ownership presents, and Republicans don't,"" he added.

Loading...

Young points to a true-false question in which 59 percent of Democrats responded correctly that it's true that households with guns are more likely to experience a fatality from crime, accident or suicide than households without them. By comparison, 37 percent of Republicans and 39 percent of independents also responded ""true.""

Republicans are more likely to own guns — and believe that the benefits of gun ownership outweigh the costs. The poll also showed that they tend to have more proximity to guns but less proximity to violence than Democrats. Altogether, that may contribute to Republicans perceiving guns as less harmful.

There was also a partisan gap in Americans' knowledge of what Congress did (or didn't do) after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, which left 20 children and seven adults dead.

Just 42 percent of Americans responded correctly to the statement, ""After the Sandy Hook massacre, Congress put tough new background check laws in place.""

That's false. There was an effort to pass stricter background checks, but it never passed.

More Democrats (52 percent) knew that than Republicans (36 percent).

The NPR/Ipsos poll was conducted online, surveying 1,006 adults from October 10-11. For the full sample, there is a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. For Democrats in the sample, it's 6.1 percentage points; for Republicans-only, it's 5.8 percentage points and for independents, it's 8.2 percentage points."

On a recent Sunday night, Liz Paul was tired. She'd worked in the morning, spent a full day with her family and she did not feel like going out for her daily jog.

""I tweeted out, 'Well, it's 9 p.m. on Sunday and I didn't work out,' "" she says, ""I really shouldn't go run in the dark should I?""

The response was immediate. The network of people Paul is relying on to help in her battle to lose weight chimed in with advice. Some tweeted back, ""Yes, get out and run."" Others offered alternatives like a video workout. But everyone said, ""Do something!""

Paul, who is 35 years old and lives in Eagan, Minn., got up and went for a three-mile run. ""I wouldn't have done something if it was just me,"" she says, ""I would have given up. I would have said 'Oh well, I'll do it tomorrow.' ""

Several studies, albeit small ones, show that social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can help bolster weight loss. Researchers in London recently analyzed 12 studies involving nearly 1,900 people in the U.S., Europe, East Asia and Australia. They found those who used social networking sites lost modest but significant amounts of weight.

It's the social push that helps make people accountable, says Christopher Wharton, assistant professor in the nutrition program at Arizona State University. And accountability can be a powerful motivation to stay on track with a weight-loss plan. In-person support groups definitely help, he says, but most only meet once a week, while social media is ubiquitous.

""Even though you are virtually dispersed,"" he says, ""you can sign on to those platforms multiple times a day and talk about your progress, your perceived failures, and immediately receive support from friends and other acquaintances who are connected to you.""

Wharton says people can also take advantage of some easily downloaded phone apps to help them keep track of what they eat. In a recent study, he found a smartphone app was the best way to tally up the day's calories, which is key to weight loss. ""That might have something to do with how easy it is to pull a phone out of your pocket or purse and type in information and then be done with it,"" he says, ""rather than carrying around paper and pencil and manually writing things down.""

Liz Paul, who has lost more than 100 pounds since giving birth to her second child last November, is taking her digital weight loss efforts one step further. She now blogs about her struggle with weight in the blog Prior Fat Girl.

One recent post helped her figure out why she felt like eating, ""everything in sight."" As she wrote she realized she was overly anxious and stressed. She started blogging about the behavior and ended up discovering what the root cause was. Once she understood that, she says, she was able to get back on track."

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks with data scientist Cathy O'Neil about her new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, which describes the dangers of relying on big data analytics to solve problems.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

We are in a time of big data. In recent years, NPR's done stories about how data analytics are being used to help political campaigns, rally supporters, compare the cost of similar surgeries in different cities, track public buses in real time and even maybe identify police officers at risk of committing misconduct. But the question is are we putting too much faith in big data? That's the question we're asking in this week's All Tech Considered.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: In her new book, mathematician Cathy O'Neil says we are in a techno utopia. And she does not mean that in a good way. Her book is called ""Weapons Of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality And Threatens Democracy."" And she is with us now. Welcome to the show.

CATHY O'NEIL: Honored to be here, Kelly.

MCEVERS: So tell us what you mean by techno utopia.

O'NEIL: Well, techno utopia is this idea that the machine-learning tools, the algorithms, the things that help Google, like, have cars that drive themselves, that these tools are somehow making things objective and fair when, in fact, we really have no idea what's happening to most algorithms under the hood.

MCEVERS: So it sounds like when you're saying, you know, we have these algorithms, but we don't know exactly what they are under the hood, there's this sense that they're inherently unbiased. But what you're saying is that there's all kinds of room for biases.

O'NEIL: Yeah, for example, like, if you imagine, you know, an engineering firm that decided to build a new hiring process for engineers and they say, OK, it's based on historical data that we have on what engineers we've hired in the past and how they've done and whether they've been successful, then you might imagine that the algorithm would exclude women, for example. And the algorithm might do the right thing by excluding women if it's only told just to do what we have done historically. The problem is that when people trust things blindly and when they just apply them blindly, they don't think about cause and effect.

They don't say, oh, I wonder why this algorithm is excluding women, which would go back to the question of, I wonder why women haven't been successful at our firm before? So in some sense, it's really not the algorithm's fault at all. It's, in a large way, the way we apply algorithms and the way we trust them that is the problem.

MCEVERS: Your book has a lot of examples where big data has not lived up to its promise. I was wondering if you could give one example where this happened and, in fact, actually made things even worse?

O'NEIL: Yeah, well, so everybody knows about the sort of decades-long attempt to improve public education in the United States. It goes by various names like No Child Left Behind, you know, Race to the Top. But at the end of the day, what they've decided to do in a large part is to sort of remove these terrible teachers that we keep hearing about. And the way they try to find these terrible teachers is through something called the growth model. And the growth model, mathematically speaking, is pretty weak and has had, like, lots of unintended consequences.

When I say weak, I interviewed a teacher from New York City public schools named Tim Clifford. He's been teaching for 20 years, multiple awards, he's written quite a few books. He got a 6 out of 100 one year and then a 96 out of 100 the next year. And he says his techniques didn't change. So it's very inconsistent. It's not clear what this number is actually scoring in terms of teachers and the teaching ability. I interviewed a woman named Sarah Wysocki in the D.C. area who actually got fired because of her low growth model score.

MCEVERS: There must be other examples, though, where people, you know, good teachers got good scores.

O'NEIL: Yeah, I mean, there certainly are, but I would say it's relatively close to a random number generator. So the fact that some good teachers got good scores doesn't say enough. I guess the point is that you might have some statistical information when you hear a score, but it's not accurate enough to actually decide on whether a given teacher, an individual teacher is doing a good job. But it's treated as such because people just trust numbers, they trust scores.

MCEVERS: When you think about the kinds of problems that people are trying to solve with big data going forward, what are some of the areas where you think, yeah, just don't use data to do that one? That one's too complicated.

O'NEIL: It's such a massive field, like, you absolutely need to perform triage. So I really - I very, very carefully defined the kinds of algorithms that I worry about. And they have three characteristics. The first is that they're high-impact, they affect a lot of people. It's widespread and it's an important decision that the scoring pertains to, so like a job or going to jail, something that's important to people. So it's high-impact. The second one is that the things that worry me the most are opaque. Either that means that the people who get the scores don't understand how they're computed or sometimes that means that they don't even know they're getting scored.

Like if you're online, you don't even know you're scored but you are. And the third characteristic of things that I care about, which I call weapons of math destruction, the third characteristic is that they are actually destructive, that they actually can really screw up somebody's life. And most of the time, these algorithms are created with, like, good intentions in mind. But this destructiveness is typically undermines that good intention and actually creates a destructive feedback loop.

MCEVERS: Flagging you as a potential criminal to police or flagging you as some sort of person in a potential hiring position.

O'NEIL: Exactly. If you just imagine, like, something that is pretty well-known is that credit scores are being used to deny people jobs. And that actually creates worse credit scores. You know, an individual who doesn't get a job because they have a bad credit score goes on to having even worse credit scores. States are trying to prevent that from happening on a state-by-state basis. But what we have now in the age of big data is something called electronic credit scores, E-scores, that a lot of people don't even know they're being made of them.

They're not illegal, they're not regulated. And they could lead to the same kind of drastic and pernicious feedback loops.

MCEVERS: You know, we've talked a lot about the problems and the dangers of big data - want to know some of the things that you think it could be used for in a good way, some of the kinds of problems it can tackle. I mean, this is a powerful thing. Are there smart ways we can use it?

O'NEIL: So in the book, I talk a lot about predictive policing and recidivism risk scoring, which is two different kinds of algorithms that are currently being used to decide who to target, what kind of neighborhoods to target by the police and then, like, whether criminal defendants are high-risk and whether they should go to jail for longer. What I don't see happening, which I wish were happening with respect to the justice system, is a kind of audit of the actual entire process overall. We know a lot about how when people are held in solitary confinement, it's probably not good for them.

So why don't we use data to improve the entire system, including, like, knowing those kinds of attributes? How much time did this person spend in solitary confinement? What were the actual conditions? Was the GED offered as a - you know, what kind of facilities did they have? You know, I'd like to see the Amazon Workflow big data audit system be applied to the justice system. I think a lot could be learned and a lot could be improved.

MCEVERS: That's Cathy O'Neil. She's the author of ""Weapons Of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality And Threatens Democracy."" Thank you so much.

O'NEIL: Thank you so much.

Paris' Orly airport has been evacuated after security forces shot and killed a man who seized the weapon of a soldier on guard.

All flights are being redirected from the airport, and reporter Jake Cigainero in Paris tells NPR's Newscast that police ""have completely evacuated the airport and suspended all traffic.""

No one else was injured, according to the French interior ministry.

The BBC's Hugh Scofield says the incident happened around 8:30 a.m. local time. He continues:

""The man grabbed a gun from a soldier on patrol in the south terminal at Orly. He ran into one of the airport shops, and was shot dead there by the security forces.""

Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux told reporters the man was known to French intelligence.

The minister also said the man was linked with a carjacking earlier that morning in a suburb north of Paris.

The Associated Press reports:

""In that incident, the Paris police office said, a man fired birdshot at officers who stopped him during a traffic stop, wounding one in the face. He then fled and stole a woman's car after threatening her with a weapon. That car was found near Orly.""

French authorities did not find any explosives on the man's body or elsewhere in the airport after ""bomb experts and police dogs made a thorough sweep,"" Cigainero reports.

French prosecutors said an anti-terrorism unit was taking over their investigation.

This is a developing story."

The National Nuclear Security Administration says the rate at which nuclear weapons materials degrade is slower than they once believed. That means the the nation's nuclear arsenal may not need updating as soon as was thought. But the debate in Congress about the long-term reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile continues.

JOHN YDSTIE, host:

This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm John Ydstie.

RENÈE MONTAGNE, host:

And I'm Renèe Montagne. Good morning.

A new study suggests that plutonium, the critical component of nuclear weapons, may have a surprisingly long shelf life. Some U.S. weapons are close to 30 years old and scientists have worried the plutonium inside them may be slowly deteriorating. The new findings released yesterday suggest that's not the case, that plutonium could survive a very long time.

NPR's David Kestenbaum reports.

DAVID KESTENBAUM: The problem with plutonium is it's only been around since World War II, so it's hard to say how it ages over the long haul. Plutonium is radioactive. And when the atoms decay, they send bits and pieces plowing through the rest of material, potentially causing damage. The official estimate had been that plutonium should hold up for at least 45 years. The new findings indicate the weapon pits should be okay for almost twice that - 85 years at least.

The Department of Energy is planning to build a new facility to remanufacture plutonium cores for bombs. Stephen Schwartz says the new findings mean there is no rush to do that. He edits the journal called “The Nonproliferation Review.”

Mr. STEPHEN SCHWARTZ (Editor, The Nonproliferation Review): Plutonium aging, other warhead reliability problems, they've all been touted as reasons why we have to go back and start remanufacturing weapons. And if we're going to do that, they'll say well, we've got to build an entirely new weapon's complex. I think this calls into question whether or not that's a wise and necessary course of action.

KESTENBAUM: The aging research was conducted by Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The Department of Energy says the new findings do not change its plans. The DOE wants to redesign the warheads in the current weapons and build replacements. That would require a new facility capable of making 125 plutonium pits a year.

Thomas D'Agostino is deputy administrator for Defense programs at the DOE.

Mr. THOMAS D'AGOSTINO (Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, Department of Energy): The nation has a choice. We either, one, continue to refurbish and maintain large quantities of our Cold War nuclear weapons, or we can shift to the future, which is have a much smaller nuclear weapons stockpile, much safer and more secure stockpile that actually takes in, what I would say, higher technology features.

KESTENBAUM: Some members of Congress may have questions about that plan. David Hobson is a Republican representative from Ohio and chairs the spending panel that oversees the nuclear weapons complex. He says DOE has played up the plutonium-aging problem for years, now he says it doesn't look like a pressing problem.

Representative DAVID HOBSON (Republican, Ohio): We don't need to charge off here and waste a lot of money. I think this gives us a chance to step back and take a breath and decide what's the right thing to do.

KESTENBAUM: The government is planning to pick a design for the new warheads in the coming weeks.

Why would the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency — the people who helped bring the world stealth fighters and GPS — fund research into man-made proteins that could make it easier for some Americans to eat pizza?

That's what we wondered when we read that the Pentagon's gee-whiz research arm provided support for work on a drug to treat celiac disease, a condition that interferes with the digestion of gluten in wheat and other foods.

So we asked.

Mildred Donlon, a DARPA program manager, told Shots the agency has no interest in developing a treatment for celiac disease.

But in a strange twist of scientific fate, student researchers tried to crack the celiac puzzle with tools developed with DARPA funding.

How did it happen? Between 2005 and 2009, DARPA invested in computerized methods to find medical defenses for chemical and biological warfare threats like Sarin nerve gas and anthrax.

Now deadly anthrax spores and gluten are certainly threats on a very different scale, but researchers believe they both could be vulnerable to carefully designed enzymes. DARPA funded computerized techniques to develop better enyzmes faster.

Designing proteins, including enzymes, is the raison d'etre of David Baker's biochemistry lab at the University of Washington in Seattle. The lab used some DARPA money to fund its work, including development of a program called FoldIt, which enlists researchers (and citizen scientists) to figure out which among many possible protein structures is the best one to solve certain biomedical problems.

According to researchers who published a paper last month in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, a group of undergraduates at UW used FoldIt to come up with an enzyme that could break down gluten in the stomach.

The idea is to develop an enzyme pill that would eliminate gluten before it triggers a damaging immune response in people with celiac disease and to help people with the condition absorb nutrients better.

Nearly 1 in 133 Americans suffers from celiac disease, according to the University of Maryland Center for Celiac Research in Baltimore. But currently the only treatment is a gluten-free diet, which can be difficult for many people to stick with.

So there's likely a market for a pill they could take with meals the way people with lactose intolerance can take the enzyme lactase before consuming dairy products.

""The idea is you would pop your pill and then drink your beer, eat your pizza and cookies, and be quite happy,"" says Justin Siegel, an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular medicine at the University of California, Davis and an author of the paper.

According to Ingrid Swanson Pultz, a microbiologist at University of Washington and another author of the paper, the students found an enzyme that could withstand stomach acids. They then tweaked it to go after gluten.

It worked so well in the test tube that Siegel and Pultz have founded a company, Proteus Biologics, to try and bring it to market.

Siegel says they'll need to show in a clinical test that the protein can degrade enough gluten fast enough in the complex environment of the gut to be useful to people with celiac disease. They'll also have to prove that it doesn't have any toxic effects when eaten.

But don't expect an anti-gluten drug on the market anytime soon – even if Siegel and the other researchers decide to market it as a supplement (like a lactase pill), which would require far fewer trials than a drug. It could still take years to prove it's safe."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mohamed Al-Bakour /AFP/Getty Images Mohamed Al-Bakour /AFP/Getty Images

In a suspected chemical weapon attack like the one in Syria on Tuesday, children are the most vulnerable targets. They are more likely than adults to die from chemical agents and to suffer injures. If they survive, they also suffer from the physical and mental trauma of the attack for far more years than adults simply because they have more years left to live.

The effects of chemical weapons are more devastating for kids for a number of reasons. ""Because kids are smaller, there's a higher impact on a smaller body,"" said Dr. Steven Hinrichs, director of the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. A smaller dose of a chemical agent can do more damage to their organs. If the agent is sarin gas, as groups like Doctors Without Borders are reporting, a victim's lungs and airways can fill up with fluid, causing suffocation. Children would die faster than adults because a child has smaller airways and a smaller chest.

""Children have fewer defenses,"" says Dr. Sandro Galea, an emergency physician and epidemiologist at Boston University who has studied mass trauma and conflict globally. They can't run away as quickly from the site of a chemical attack. And once the chemicals enter their system, their immune systems are less mature and not as good at fighting them off. ""It makes them more vulnerable, immunologically and physically,"" Galea said.

Twenty children were among the 72 civilian casualties from an air raid accompanied by the apparent chemical attack on the rebel-held city Khan Shaykhun in Idlib province in Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Moreover, if children survive a chemical attack, they will live with the long-term effects far longer than, say, a 50-year-old. Survivors often have lifelong problems with fine motor skills like writing or cutting paper accurately with a pair of scissors. They often have gross motor disability as well, such as problems with their walking gait — trouble balancing or coordinating the movement of walking — and with the hand-eye coordination necessary to play sports or do many kinds of physical paid work.

The impact of chemical attacks can be mental as well as physical, although it's difficult to tease out the effects of nerve damage from post-traumatic stress disorder since symptoms sometimes overlap. Researchers believe that chemical attacks, like other violent attacks, can lead to PTSD and severe depression for survivors of all ages.

It's also difficult to separate the impact of a single attack, chemical or conventional, from the larger trauma of living through a war.

""Toxic stress affects brain development, learning and the social emotional ability to regulate one's own behavior,"" said Lindsay Stark of Columbia University, who studies childhood trauma in refugee and conflict settings.

But children are also incredibly resilient, Stark said. Child soldiers in war-ravaged African countries didn't turn out to be a lost generation as mental health professionals feared, she said. Many learned to cope with their traumatic pasts and went on to have productive lives.

She cautions against pessimistic outlooks for Syria's children. ""We have to be careful in terms of how we talk about this generation,"" she said. ""All hope is not lost.""

But, she cautioned, the longer children remain in conflict settings, the more challenging it can be to counteract the trauma they live through. Parents need to be able to buffer children from the chronic stress of war by creating a sense of normalcy with routines like going to school every day.

""It's the best thing parents can do,"" Stark said. But in war-torn countries like Syria, she added, ""it may be just not possible.""

By refusing to hear an appeals, the Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court ruling that left in place assault weapons bans in New York and Connecticut.

The high court declined to hear an appeal of a case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

After the shootings at Sandy Hook, both New York and Connecticut passed legislation that prohibited the possession of some semiautomatic ""assault weapons"" and large-capacity magazines.

That legislation was challenged in court by advocacy groups, businesses, and individual gun owners, especially because in 2008, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. In that case, the Supreme Court decided that the Second Amendment includes an individual right to bear arms. The court ruled that this was not an unlimited right, but that Americans had the right to possess any firearm that was ""in common use"" by citizens ""for lawful purposes like self-defense.""

The question before the Second Circuit, then, was whether assault weapons are commonly owned and whether the weapons are ""dangerous and unusual"" in hands of law-abiding citizens.

The Second Circuit answered yes to the first question but found that empirical evidence to answer that second question was ""elusive."" The Court decided that owning weapons like the AR-15 is, indeed, protected by the Second Amendment.

But, the Court argued, government can sometimes have a legitimate interest in impinging upon a Constitutional right. In this case, the Court ruled, banning assault weapons can save lives.

""At least since the enactment of the federal assault‐weapons ban, semiautomatic assault weapons have been understood to pose unusual risks,"" the Court wrote. ""When used, these weapons tend to result in more numerous wounds, more serious wounds, and more victims. These weapons are disproportionately used in crime, and particularly in criminal mass shootings like the attack in Newtown. They are also disproportionately used to kill law enforcement officers: one study shows that between 1998 and 2001, assault weapons were used to gun down at least twenty percent of officers killed in the line of duty.""

Upholding most of the provisions in the assault weapons ban, the Court argued that the government has a legitimate interest in stopping that kind of violence.

After the Supreme Court declined to take on the appeals, the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, which challenged the law, said it would continue its fight.

The Second Circuit, they argued, used wrong test to reach a decision and the death of Justice Antonin Scalia — who authored the Heller decision — may have influenced the Supreme Court from taking up a challenge.

Autonomous weapons, capable of operating independent of human control, are being developed by several countries around the world. NPR's Kelly McEvers talks with Paul Scharre of the Center for a New American Security about this new military technology and the challenges of regulating it.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The United Nations recently held meetings in Geneva to debate an emerging and controversial technology - autonomous weapons. These are more than just drones. They're weapons that in theory could operate independently of human control. Opponents call them killer robots. Here to make sense of this new area of military technology is Paul Scharre of the Center for a New American Security. He helped create the U.S. military guidelines on these weapons when he worked at the Pentagon. Welcome.

PAUL SCHARRE: Thanks. Thanks for having me.

MCEVERS: OK, so who is building these weapons?

SCHARRE: Well, a number of countries around the world - China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and France - are all developing ever more sophisticated robotic weapons of a variety of fashions. Now, no one has come out and said clearly that they plan to cross the line to go to fully autonomous weapons, but the technology they're building is definitely going to come right up to that line. And none of these countries have also said that they wouldn't cross it either.

MCEVERS: I wonder if you could give us some examples of what kinds of autonomous weapons already exist. And then what are some things that are in development?

SCHARRE: Sure. There are a number of countries - at least 30 by our count - that actually have automated defensive systems that have a higher level of automation where a human turns them on. And then if there's an incoming threat, they can automatically fire to defend the ship or land base that they're defending.

MCEVERS: The Iron Dome, defense systems in South Korea - those are the few examples that come to mind of those kinds of things, yeah.

SCHARRE: That's right - systems like the U.S. Aegis Combat System, the U.S. Patriot.

MCEVERS: Those aren't fully autonomous, right? I mean, those would be semi-autonomous.

SCHARRE: Well, autonomous weapons that get authorized in supervised modes. So they're using very limited defensive settings. People are supervising their operation in real-time, and they can intervene to stop it. And they even have physical access, so if the machine started to simply go haywire, they could actually just physically unplug it.

MCEVERS: So give us an example of something that's, you know - could be developed in the future.

SCHARRE: So there are at least a half dozen countries building prototypes of combat drones that are designed to go into enemy territory. These would be things that would be stealth combat aircraft designed to penetrate into enemy territory where their communications might be jammed.

So that raises the question, well, what does it do when it's outside of human control? Is it allowed to strike pre-planned targets much like cruise missiles today? Or if it comes across a new target and a human hadn't programmed in guidance, does it strike it on its own according to some programming? And really, countries haven't made those decisions yet.

MCEVERS: As I said, the United Nations has been meeting about this. There's a group called The Future of Life Institute which opposes the development of these types of weapons. And they released a short video that was presented at one of these U.N. meetings. Let's just hear a quick clip of that.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Trained as a team, they can penetrate buildings, cars, trains, evade people, bullets - pretty much any countermeasure. They cannot be stopped.

(APPLAUSE)

MCEVERS: Sounds pretty scary what he's saying. Like, how far away are we from having what he is describing?

SCHARRE: So I think there's a couple different aspects of what he's describing that are really important to kind of separate out. A small drone that might be able to navigate up to a specific person, say, with facial recognition technology and then attack them - that technology all exist today. Now, cobbling that together with the autonomy to target people all on its own - no one's done that yet, but that exists.

Now, the next step, leaping to something that has no countermeasure that can't be stopped - that's science fiction. That just doesn't exist in the real world. All military technologies have some countermeasures. And defense analysts look at the balance between the offense and defense.

MCEVERS: There's a failsafe, yeah. We talked about these United Nations meetings. I mean, did the U.N. come to any meaningful decisions about regulating these things?

SCHARRE: No. They've been meeting for several years now, and they agreed to meet again. Diplomacy moves pretty slowly. And that is a real challenge on this topic, where the pace of technology is really outstripping the pace of diplomacy.

MCEVERS: Paul Scharre - his book ""Army Of None"" on autonomous weapons comes out this spring. Thank you very much.

SCHARRE: Thank you.

Updated at 4 a.m. ET Saturday

A government spokesman has increased the death toll from Thursday's bombing using the ""Mother of All Bombs"" in Afghanistan to 94, up from 36.

Ataullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province, said in a tweet Saturday that 94 ISIS members were killed in the attack on an ISIS underground complex, including four top commanders.

""Fortunately there is no report of civilians being killed in the attack,"" Khogyani told The Associated Press on Saturday.

On Friday, U.S. Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. called it ""the right weapon against the right target.""

It was the most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat.

The bomb was dropped in the Achin district of Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan. A video of the strike shows it hitting at the lower edge of a mountain, along a narrow valley, producing a huge shock wave and blast plume.

The nearly 22,000-pound bomb is believed to have destroyed ""large quantities"" of weapons when it struck a network of tunnels, bunkers and other fortifications used by the offshoot group ISIS-K (for Khorasan province), according to an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman.

The U.S. assessment is still in progress, a Pentagon official told NPR's Tom Bowman, adding that there's a chance the death toll might include results from two other smaller operations against ISIS-K that took place Thursday night.

Nicholson said the ""MOAB"" ordnance — for Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or less formally, the ""Mother of All Bombs"" — was ""designed to destroy caves and tunnels, which ISIS-K have been using, along with extensive belts of IEDs, to thicken their positions against our offensive.""

U.S. special forces and Afghan commandos are now inspecting the site, Nicholson said, adding, ""the weapon achieved its intended purpose.""

Nicholson, the commander of the NATO-led Resolute Support force, discussed the operation Friday in a news conference in Kabul.

When he was asked about the timing of the unprecedented strike, and whether it had been influenced by the White House, Nicholson said, ""In regard to timing, it's when we encountered this target on the battlefield.""

The general said that because the spring offensive against ISIS-K had been slowed by fighters using caves and tunnels, ""It was the right time to use it tactically, against the right target on the battlefield.""

Addressing the Afghan public, Nicholson said all precautions were taken to prevent civilian casualties.

""We had persistent surveillance over the area before, during and after the operation, and now we have Afghan and U.S. forces on the site, and see no evidence of civilian casualties,"" Nicholson said. ""Nor have there been any reports of civilian casualties.

After providing an update on the operation, Nicholson recounted a litany of offenses committed by ISIS-K, from beheadings and other public executions to suicide bombings.

The strike is part of a broader offensive, which Nicholson said is a sign of Afghanistan's commitment ""to defeat Daesh in Afghanistan this year.""

The official designation for the MOAB is the GBU-43/B; here's how NPR's Phil Ewing explains its origin:

""The GBU-43/B has been in the U.S. arsenal for more than 14 years, deployed to bases in the Middle East where it could be loaded aboard an American aircraft but never used until now. At more than 30 feet long, it's too big to fit inside the weapons bay of a standard Air Force bomber. Instead, troops load it into the cargo compartment of a specialized transport, the MC-130 Combat Talon, which releases it over the target by opening its ramp in the same way it might for paratroopers or air-dropped supplies. The bomb is guided by satellite to its target.

NPR's James Doubek contributed to this report."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images

No one in the history of the NBA has been a louder proponent of the underhanded free throw than Rick Barry. The unorthodox technique — sometimes known as the ""granny"" — earned the Hall of Famer the title of one of the best free throw shooters of all time.

Barry swears by its accuracy, but players hardly ever use it.

""I really truly can't comprehend the aversion people have to trying something that could be very effective for them,"" Rick says.

He holds a career free throw average of 90 percent.

Even within his own family, his wife — Lynn Barry, a former Assistant Executive Director of USA Women's Basketball — and his four sons prefer the overhead. His youngest son, Canyon, 23, is the only one to continue the tradition.

""Logically dictated, if you have one of the greatest free throw shooters of all time as your personal free throw coach, you should at least give it a try,"" Canyon says.

He just finished his fifth year with the University of Florida Gators. During his last two seasons, Canyon scored, on average, 86 percent of his free throw shots. To compare, the average in the NBA over the same period is 76 percent.

For the Barrys, performing the underhanded free throw requires gripping the sides of the ball, bending your knees and lifting both arms in simultaneous motion up to the release which then lands the ball over the rim.

The move is meant to be seamless and soft. The idea is that there are less moving parts involved like elbows and wrists to ruin the arc.

YouTube

The method has been honed and refined since Rick learned it from his father.

Rick took most of the wrist out of it and would go on to use the technique throughout his illustrious career in the NBA, ABA and NCAA — including leading the Golden State Warriors to the 1975 championship.

It's a large shadow that's followed Canyon throughout his own collegiate career.

Upon missing a free throw at one tournament, he recalls the audience slowly cheering, ""you're adopted"" from the sidelines. He took the jeers in stride.

Why no one uses it

For most players who've tried it, that ribbing is one reason they stopped. Basketball great Wilt Chamberlain is famously ranked as one of the worst free-throw shooters of all time. But when he briefly switched to the underhand during the 1961-1962 season, he made 61 percent of his free throws that season, the highest of his career.

But then he decided to stop, and his free-throw game never recovered. In his autobiography Chamberlain said using the ""granny"" shot made him ""look silly"" and ""like a sissy.""

The use of underhand is so rare that watching a player perform it almost guarantees weird looks and endless chatter.

The most recent case is Chinanu Onuaku of the Houston Rockets. A Reddit thread dedicated to Onuaku's underhand garnered comments, such as ""women will assume he lacks masculine rigor"" and ""The other players don't respect him now too.""

Rick had that initial reaction while in high school in the 1970s. He says his father, a semi-pro player and coach, kept bothering him about switching, saying it would make him better.

But Rick was self-conscious about the underhand shot because he says girls were known to shoot that way.

""So I said, 'I can't do that dad, everyone's going to make fun of me,' "" Rick says. ""I remember him saying, 'Son, they can't make fun of you if you're making them.' ""

A changing game

Canyon refined the technique for changing times. For example, he now holds the ball further away from his body.

""The ball would get caught on the inseam of the shorts,"" says Canyon about the longer, baggier basketball uniforms. His father prefers the short shorts of days past.

Besides the changing fashion, Rick says Canyon's generation also produced a new type of athlete.

""The players have gotten bigger and stronger, they look like Greek Gods — you know chiseled bodies,"" Rick says. ""Its just astonishing how they got themselves to be physically.""

For Canyon getting to that level means a strict regiment of two-ball drills, lifting weights and calibrating his nutrition.

These are all things Rick didn't have to worry about. This includes injuries on the court. Rick would even get his knee drained during games and keep playing.

Not so much for Canyon. An injury today can mean the end of a burgeoning career. His ultimate goal is to play in the NBA.

But if that doesn't work out, Canyon has a backup plan: finish his master's degree in nuclear engineering.

Either way, he's sticking with the underhand free throw."

A revised timeline of the Las Vegas shooting is raising questions about if and when the Mandalay Bay hotel alerted police that a security guard had been shot before the assailant opened fire on the concert crowd. A sheriff's department official said they are still studying the sequence of events, and offers other details of the investigation in interviews with NPR/KNPR.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Las Vegas police have revised their timeline of last week's mass shooting. Initially they had said that the gunman shot a security guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort after he had opened fire on concertgoers. Now they say that's wrong. They say the security guard was shot six minutes before the gunman started firing his guns out his hotel window.

NPR's Leila Fadel has been speaking with the Clark County Sheriff's Department and joins us now. And Leila, this sounds like a pretty significant revision. The security guard came under heavy gunfire, we're told - police say some 200 rounds before the mass shooting. Tell us more about this.

LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Well, here's what we know. Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos - he was responding to a door alarm on the 32nd floor. And it wasn't the shooter's door. He gets up there, and then he comes under fire. He takes gunfire to the leg and is wounded. Now initially, like you said, we were told this happened before the gunman opened fire, a barrage of gunfire outside the window of the Mandalay Bay onto the country music festival. Now we know the gunman was hurt well before - about six minutes before this all started. That wounded security guard notified security at the Mandalay Bay. But the big question is, when did the police find out about that initial shooting?

Now, yesterday at the press conference, I did ask the sheriff that question, and he said police found out about the guard when officers arrived in the hallway about 20 minutes later. And today I tried to clarify that with Undersheriff Kevin McMahill in an interview at KNPR in Las Vegas. I asked when law enforcement knew about the shooting of the security guard at the Mandalay Bay and if there was a major break in communication.

KEVIN MCMAHILL: When specifically did they know? That remains to be a very, very difficult thing for us to put forward, which is why the sheriff indicated that on Friday we'll provide that information to the public because everybody wants to know, including us, when did you know?

FADEL: Now, McMahill says they're going through monumental amounts of tape, from dispatch tape to security dispatch and maintenance tape from the hotel, police body camera video. And the timeline could even change again. Now, we looked at the police dispatch tape, and the first time an active shooter is mentioned is just after 10:06, which is just over a minute after the mass shooting has started into the crowd. And the first time the security guard is mentioned is about 19 minutes later. Now, McMahill really stressed they're not trying to hide anything. But as the investigation goes on, they're finding out new things.

SIEGEL: As I understand it, one thing they found out is that the gunman also targeted fuel tanks at the airport. Did McMahill give you any details about that? Was this part of a larger plan?

FADEL: Yes. McMahill said the gunman was purposely targeting jet fuel tanks from the adjoining room in that same suite. And he was apparently shooting from the two different rooms from different vantage points onto the crowd and the jet fuel tanks, which is why McMahill says that people might have thought there were two shooters. Now, here's McMahill again speaking about when the shots were fired on those tanks.

MCMAHILL: It could have been before. It could have been after. But we do know there are different calibers, different weapons that were used in each room. And certainly it could have been done ahead of time to create even more chaos, even more confusion.

SIEGEL: And as far as we know, law enforcement hasn't found any suicide note, no manifesto of any kind. They found a piece of paper in the shooter's hotel room, but that really doesn't give us any more clues about why he did this, does it?

FADEL: No. That wasn't a suicide note. It actually had numbers on it. And I asked McMahill what those numbers could have been.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MCMAHILL: Our speculation is that it was ranges to how far he was shooting towards the crowd, different parts of the crowd as well as the fuel tanks.

SIEGEL: Any word as to how he actually got all those weapons into the hotel room without being spotted?

FADEL: He carried them up in suitcases. This is a man that checked into the Mandalay Bay almost a week before the attack actually occurred on September 25. And that's another change in the timeline. Originally law enforcement believed he checked in on September 28, and actually, he didn't. He checked in days before. Now, McMahill says that he carried the bags up one or two at a time. They saw this on images that were captured, and they know this from the cameras. So it didn't really trigger suspicion that the shooter had 13 or 14 extremely heavy bags up in his room.

SIEGEL: That's NPR's Leila Fadel in Las Vegas. Thanks.

FADEL: Thank you.

The Olympic Athletes from Russia won 4-3 in a game against Germany where neither team had much to lose.

Germany had defeated hockey powerhouses Sweden and Canada in the semifinals, and the Olympic Athletes from Russia were highly stacked. Neither country had medaled in men's hockey since 2002, when Russia won bronze.

With 0.5 seconds remaining in the first period, Russian Vyacheslav Voynov scored the first point of the match after an ambitious shot that made it past German goaltender Danny aus den Birken.

Germany brought the score to a tie with 10 minutes left in the second period, after a shot by Felix Schütz bounced off of goalkeeper Vasily Koshechkin and deflected off the body of Russian defenseman Bogdan Kiselevich across the goal line.

A steady back and forth continued, until Russian Nikita Gusev scored a point with 6:39 left in the third period. But the Russians relaxed — and just 10 seconds later, German frontman Dominik Kahun tied the game right back up, the stakes just as high as before.

With three minutes left in the third period, Jonas Müller broke the tie 3-2 with the cleanest shot of the game after a winning a puck battle against the Russians. This lead didn't last for long; either: With less than 60 seconds to go, Gusev scored again, and the teams were back to a tie.

About 15 minutes into sudden-death overtime, Gusev scored yet another goal — and the Russians threw off their helmets in celebration of winning gold.

The match was guaranteed to be Germany's best showing in men's hockey no matter the outcome: The team had won bronze in 1932, and West Germany won bronze in 1976. Their silver medal is the strongest performance Germany has ever shown in men's hockey, while Russia won gold in 1992 as the Unified Team.

Canada walked away with the bronze medal by beating the Czech Republic 6-4 after being knocked out for silver and gold by Germany.

The Russian athletes competed in neutral Olympic gear rather than Russian colors. The International Olympic Committee suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in 2017, citing a widespread culture of doping in Russia and alleged state-sponsored system of cheating.

Russian athletes were allowed to compete in the 2018 Winter Games under a neutral Olympic flag and were required to pass rigorous doping tests. Going into Pyeongchang, the IOC said there was a chance Russia's athletes could march under their country's colors at the games' closing ceremony.

After two Russian athletes were disqualified over doping, the IOC voted to uphold the ban, meaning that athletes will once again leave their Russian colors at home in the closing ceremony."

When a woman drinks heavily during pregnancy, it can cause profound damage to her unborn child.

Nobody knows how much alcohol, if any, is safe, so the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise women to abstain from drinking throughout pregnancy to avoid physical and mental birth defects.

But here and elsewhere, even conscientious pregnant women have been known to have an occasional beer or glass of wine while carrying a child. How risky is that?

Research funded by the CDC and conducted in Denmark is shedding some light on the question, though there's no definitive answer just yet. Still, the results suggest that light drinking (one to four drinks a week) and even moderate imbibing (five to eight drinks) may be OK. Even occasional binge drinking (five or more drinks in a single session) didn't appear to be tied to developmental issues.

The researchers measured the IQs, attention spans and decision-making of more than 1,600 5-year-olds and compared them with the drinking habits of the moms in early pregnancy. The women were asked about their drinking and underwent a battery of psychological tests when their kids were 5, too.

In case you are wondering, women in Denmark didn't generally consider drinking a little during pregnancy to be a health concern at the time the data for the study were collected (2003 to 2008).

There was a wide range of drinking behavior, with a little less than half of women refraining from alcohol. The next biggest group had 1-4 drinks a week. About 175 women had 5 to 8 drinks a week. Only 20 of them drank 9 or more alcoholic beverages in a week.

So what's the bottom line? The researchers wrote:

""We found no significant association of low to moderate average weekly alcohol consumption, and any binge drinking, during early to mid pregnancy with the neurodevelopment of children at the age of 5 years.""

Now there are lots of caveats, as the researchers note in a collection of papers just published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology. It's possible, for instance, that the testing didn't detect subtle changes in the development of the kids. Or it might be that some alcohol-related changes might not become apparent until later in life.

While the findings are reassuring, they shouldn't be read as a free pass for drinking while pregnant. ""The danger of it is that people consider it definitive research and definitive reassurance that any alcohol use, including binge drinking, during pregnancy is innocuous,"" says Janet Williams, a pediatrician at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.

Alcohol, she tells Shots, is generally recognized as the No. 1 preventable cause of birth abnormalities, ranging from physical to cognitive problems. And these new papers prompt more questions than answers, she says. ""The safest conclusion is that no drinking causes no fetal alcohol effects,"" says Williams, the immediate past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on substance abuse.

The Danish researchers concur, writing that ""it remains the most conservative advice for women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy."" But, they also say, ""small quantities consumed occasionally in pregnancy do not appear to pose serious issues"" for the key areas of neurological development they investigated."

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said two police officers were shot and seriously wounded shortly after midnight outside the Ferguson, Mo., police department. The shooting occurred as a protest outside the police station had begun to wind down.

A St. Louis County police officer and an officer from nearby Webster Groves, Mo., were shot, according to Belmar. He did not identify them by name.

The Webster Groves officer was struck once in the face. He is 32 years old and a five-year veteran of the force, Belmar said. He said the St. Louis County officer is 41 years old and a 14-year veteran of the force. That officer was struck once in the shoulder.

We will be updating this story with the latest developments. For more coverage, please visit our friends at St. Louis Public Radio, who are live-blogging the events.

Update at 1:46 p.m. ET Officers Released From Hospital

Both officers have been released from hospital, reporter Tim Lloyd of St. Louis Public radio reports.

The family of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old black man shot dead in Ferguson by a white police officer last August, called the shooting ""senseless"" and said their ""thoughts and prayers remain with the officers injured during this morning's shooting and their families."" In a statement, they said:

""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot and will not be tolerated. ""We specifically denounce the actions of stand-alone agitators who unsuccessfully attempt to derail the otherwise peaceful and non-violent movement that has emerged throughout this nation to confront police brutality and to forward the cause of equality under the law for all.""

Attorney General Eric Holder called the shooting ""inexcusable and repugnant.""

Update at 10:10 a.m. ET: Injury Updates, And More Details

The two police officers who were shot had been standing in a line of more than a dozen officers, Belmar said at a news conference Thursday morning.

Belmar said the Webster Groves officer was shot just below his right eye, and that the bullet is now lodged in the back of his head. The St. Louis County officer was struck in the shoulder, and the bullet passed through and exited his back.

He said, based on the shell casings found on the scene, the weapon used is believed to be a handgun. The St. Louis County Police Department has posted evidence photographs on Facebook.

Despite the serious nature of the injuries, Belmar said, the officers aren't expected to have any ""remarkable long-term injuries."" He said he had spoken with both of the officers.

""I think it's a miracle that we haven't had any instances similar to this"" before now, Belmar said, noting other occurrences of gunfire at protests in Ferguson.

""When you look at the tenor of at least some of the people"" involved in protests, he said, it is difficult for officers to discern who might pose a threat.

The St. Louis County police chief added that when shots were fired last night, the officers saw muzzle flashes later estimated to be about 125 yards away. He said the officers drew their weapons but did not discharge them.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we were very close to what happened in New York,"" Belmar said, referring to the recent fatal shooting of two officers there.

""This is really an ambush, is what it is,"" he said later.

Belmar said he had been surprised by the amount of ""agitation"" at the protest.

At one point, he acknowledged that there was ""an unfortunate association"" between whoever fired the shots and the protesters who were there for what he called ""the right reasons.""

Belmar also said he hasn't confirmed reports that rocks or bottles had been thrown at the officers during Wednesday night's protest. He repeatedly said it is ""very difficult"" for officers to identify potential threats in such situations.

Our original post continues:

Belmar described both gunshot wounds as ""very serious injuries."" Their wounds are not believed to be life-threatening. Both officers are being treated in a local hospital and their families are with them, according to Belmar.

The protests followed the resignation of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson earlier Wednesday, a move that followed a scathing report of racial bias in the Ferguson police department by the U.S. Department of Justice. Many in the crowd were reportedly calling for the town's mayor to resign, as well.

""The shots came just after midnight as people were starting to leave,"" reports St. Louis Public Radio. ""Belmar said he believed the shooters were embedded in the group that remained, a point fiercely disputed by protesters on the scene.""

The member station notes that several protesters who witnessed the shooting say the shots had been fired from behind them."

Kimberly Richardson has never gotten a flu shot. Since she's healthy and considers the seasonal vaccines a ""best-guess concoction"" of the viruses expected to dominate, the northern California gym teacher and mother of two says she didn't want an ""injection of something that may or may not keep me healthy in the long run.""

She's not alone. In an analysis of 245,386 women who delivered babies at Utah and Idaho hospitals over nine flu seasons, 90 percent said they didn't get vaccinated for influenza while pregnant. Those who did reaped benefits — their babies were healthier. As a group, infants whose moms reported getting a flu shot during pregnancy had about one-third the risk of flulike illness during their first six months of life, compared to babies of unimmunized mothers.

Disease-fighting flu antibodies are a ""gift the mom gives her baby across the placenta,"" says Julie Shakib, a pediatrician at the University of Utah School of Medicine who led the study, published this week in the journal Pediatrics.

In 2006, researchers at Kaiser Permanente published a similar analysis of 41,129 babies born between 1995 and 2001. But that study found no correlation between rates of infant illness and flu vaccination in expectant mothers.

This new analysis included six times as many babies and eight times as many vaccinated moms, notes Eric France, a pediatrician and preventive medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente Colorado and leader of the 2006 study. ""This is the paper I wanted to write 10 years ago,"" he says. Larger studies tend to be more reliable because they're more statistically accurate.

Other prior studies have shown that babies do benefit from maternal immunization — including a 2008 trial in Bangladesh that randomized 340 pregnant women to receive a flu shot or a control vaccine. Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for clinical research. However, a study that assigns some participants a placebo flu vaccination would be considered unethical in the United States given the country's standard of care. Instead, most U.S. studies observe a particular group over time or survey a group retrospectively, as in the current study.

These analyses are challenging. First, it's hard to agree on what constitutes ""flu."" Do you count all babies that show up at the doctor's office with fever and cold symptoms? Do you restrict analysis to cases that were confirmed by lab testing or focus only on confirmed flu that required hospitalization? The new analysis looked at all three categories.

It also takes a long time to get enough cases for statistically sound results. In the new study, which tracked 249,387 babies under six months old who were born between December 2005 and March 2014, only 0.35 percent (866 babies) met criteria for the broadest classification—a diagnosis of ""flu-like illness."" A mere 0.26 percent (658 babies) had lab-confirmed flu, and among those cases less than a quarter (151 babies) were hospitalized because of their illness.

Furthermore, only 10 percent of expecting moms said they'd gotten a flu vaccine. Immunization rates were actually much lower during the first four years of the study—around 2 percent—but jumped to 21 percent over the five flu seasons after the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic. When H1N1 struck again in 2013-2014, about half of the pregnant women in the study reported getting vaccinated for flu.

""Over time we're actually encouraged by the improvement in providers' ability to deliver the flu vaccine and strongly recommend it,"" says Shakib. ""There's been a culture shift."" A recent study of postpartum women found that expecting moms were far more likely to get a flu shot if their prenatal care providers recommended it.

Still, given the low overall immunization rate across the current study, the researchers collected data more than eight years to get 866 babies with at least one flu-like illness. Among those, 96 percent (834 babies) were born to moms who didn't get a flu shot—which means 4 percent (32 babies) developed the flu despite their moms getting immunized while pregnant.

Now let's figure out how this translates to flu protection for babies.

If the flu vaccine had no impact on infant illness rates, you'd expect the percentage of flu-afflicted babies to equal the percentage of unimmunized moms. Under this assumption 10 percent (87 babies) should have been born to vaccinated mothers, since we know that 10 percent of mothers reported getting a flu shot. However, in reality there were only 32 infant flu cases among vaccinated mothers, which suggests that 55 babies—or 63 percent—were protected. Applying a similar analysis to lab-confirmed flu, the study found that maternal vaccinations led to a 70 percent reduction in infant illness.

So how does mom's flu shot protect her baby? After getting vaccinated, a pregnant woman makes specialized proteins called antibodies, which recognize flu viruses and boost the body's defenses against these pathogens. ""Those antibodies can cross the placenta and go into the fetal circulation,"" says Mitch Kronenberg of the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.

The protection babies receive is known as passive immunity. Unlike mom's defenses, which were ""educated"" to recognize viral proteins in the vaccine, the baby's immune system ""didn't get trained but took something from the mother and used it,"" Kronenberg says.

Placental antibodies stick around in the baby for up to six months. They're thought to be different from the protective antibodies found in breast milk, which may help shape the immune system's relationship with gut-dwelling bacteria, according to a mouse study published Thursday by UC Berkeley researchers.

Shakib and coworkers have an ongoing study to determine if the immune protection a baby gets from maternal flu antibodies is stronger if mom breastfeeds. The researchers are analyzing blood and breast milk samples from 40 mother-infant pairs at the University of Utah Hospital. They expect to publish the results within a year, Shakib told NPR.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Dilley Rebecca Dilley

In the winter of 2006, the unthinkable happened. There was a shortage of aquavit, the Scandinavian spirit that's flavored with caraway and other botanicals like dill and anise. For Scandinavian-Americans who relied on aquavit to accompany the traditional julbord, or holiday buffet, it was a tragedy.

""It threw me into a bit of a panic,"" says Christian Krogstad, Norwegian co-founder of Portland, Ore. distillery House Spirits. ""The most important part for me about the holidays is the food."" There's pickled herring, smoked meats, sometimes the traditional gelatinous whitefish preparation known as lutefisk and many other strong flavors that combine on the Scandinavian Christmas dinner table. ""They really require aquavit as an accompaniment,"" Krogstad says.

So he set out to make his own, initially only for personal consumption. When bartenders came to visit over the following months, Krogstad would pull out a bottle of aquavit and give them a taste. ""They were really captivated by it,"" he recalls. Their interest made him decide to bottle and sell what he'd always thought of as a niche spirit.

It's #ScandiWeek On The Salt! Scandinavia is a land of cold winters and heart-warming (literally) Christmas food and drink traditions. This year, The Salt is celebrating the stories behind those traditions. So God jul! Glædelig jul! Hyvää joulua!

House Spirits — then just two years old — was one of the first American distilleries to make aquavit. In the last few years the once-niche spirit has become a way for distilleries and bartenders to make a name for themselves in an increasingly saturated market.

When Devil's Head Distilling in Colorado opened in 2015, aquavit was one of the first spirits they made. Often new distilleries release a gin and vodka for their first spirits since neither require aging but co-founder Ryan White thought aquavit would be a more interesting addition. Devil's Head was the first to produce it in the state, and found that having one unique spirit opened doors for them. ""When we go out to distribute it, the aquavit is the thing that gets us the buyer's ear,"" White says.

Traditionally, Scandinavians drink aquavit neat — throwing back one shot after another throughout the meal. But the bartenders Krogstad connected with immediately realized its potential as a cocktail ingredient. It found its way into Bloody Marys, gimlets, and, once aged-aquavits started being released, Negronis.

""I'm constantly surprised by it,"" Krogstad says of aquavit's growth in popularity. ""It's become not just a Scandinavian or Scandinavian-American thing. It's now a cocktail thing, and that opens it up to a much larger audience.""

Kyle Van Strien, co-founder of Michigan's Long Road Distilling, also realized its potential. ""If we're going to survive in the market with a lot of great booze, we've gotta do things different,"" says. Though aquavit isn't Long Road's top seller, thanks to the spirit's success at beverage competitions as well as its uniqueness among the whiskeys, gins, and vodkas most distilleries are producing, it's become the spirit for which they are known.

In 2012, there were fewer than 10 American aquavits, says Jacob Grier, the founder of Aquavit Week which involves events and cocktail specials that feature the spirit in 11 states. Five years later, Grier says there are more than 50 American varieties, and they are not just limited to traditional Scandinavian-American communities.

Grier attributes some of the growth to an increasing interest in Nordic cuisine, the sudden boom in Americans traveling to Iceland, and restaurants like Noma.

Before Americans started making their own aquavit, options were limited. As Emily Vikre of Minnesota's Vikre Distilling recalls, ""There were two aquavits imported to the United States and they were rarely seen and probably only bought by Scandinavians celebrating one of our important holidays."" (As Van Strien describes it, ""It was a thing you drank twice a year and got blackout drunk with."") Now, the growth of American aquavit is prompting Scandinavian bartenders and distillers to give the spirit another, less-hangover prone, chance.

A year ago, Norwegian spirits supplier Arcus announced Lysholm No5, an aquavit specifically designed for use in cocktails. Krogstad says he's been in contact with several people in the Scandinavian beverage industry who are interested in what's happening with aquavit in the United States. ""I think we're going to see American aquavits exported to Scandinavia soon.""

At least in the United States, any ""caraway-flavored distilled spirits product"" can be called aquavit under regulatory guidelines. Aquavit gives you a lot of freedom as a distiller,"" says Grier. ""You can play with all kinds of botanicals and come up with a unique recipe.""

For some, this means making something new. For others, it means continuing traditions. The famous Norwegian Linie aquavit got its name when an early-1800s era sea captain tasted spirits that had been stored on barrels in his ship after it crossed the equator and came back. Two hundred years later, Linie's barrels of aquavit still travel to Australia and back by ship before being sold in bottles. The company believes that something about the sea air, the ship rolling over the waves, or perhaps the oceanic temperature imparts a flavor to the beverage that can't be obtained on land. Today's bottles give the name of the ship as well as the date the batch crossed the equator. It's a hard story to beat.

When Vikre of Vikre's Distilling was testing her first aquavit, she brought it to a Norwegian independence festival. ""When people were like, 'I want that and not the Linie,' I knew we'd gotten it right.""

Health officials are warning that the United States may have an unusually harsh flu season this year.

But they stress that flu seasons are notoriously difficult to predict, and it's far too early to know for sure what may happen.

The concern stems from several factors, including signs that the season started a few weeks earlier than usual. ""When you have an early start with regional outbreaks, that is generally not a good sign,"" says Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""Sometimes that's the forerunner of a serious season.""

An early start could mean a longer season, which could mean more people end up getting infected with the flu.

Another reason for concern is that Australia had a severe flu season this year.

""We generally follow in our season what happened in the Southern Hemisphere, such as in Australia,"" Fauci says. ""And Australia had a particularly bad influenza season for a number of reasons.""



A major reason for Australia's struggle is that the main strain of flu circulating there was one known as H3N2. That kind of flu virus tends to make people sicker than other strains, especially the elderly.

YouTube

To make things worse, the flu vaccine appears to have been only about 10 percent effective against that strain in Australia. Part of the reason for that is that flu strains are constantly changing and the H3N2 strain used to make the vaccine mutated during production of the vaccine. This weakened the shot's effectiveness.

""The mutation just happened to be in a very bad spot on the virus to make it essentially be a mismatch for the vaccine,"" Fauci says.

The United States is using the same vaccine, and an H3N2 strain appears to be dominating outbreaks in this country so far too.

""It looks like not only are we using the same vaccine, but the virus that was circulating in Australia appears to be the same virus that we're starting to see now in the outbreaks in the United States,"" Fauci says.

But it could also turn out that the vaccine could be far more effective in the United States than it was in Australia, according to Brendan Flannery, an epidemiologist at the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That's because a slightly different H3N2 strain could end up dominating in this country, for example. Another possibility is that other flu strains could become more common. The vaccine provides stronger protection against those.

""It could be that we're going to have a severe season — and we have to prepare for that,"" Flannery says. ""But it's early to make a prediction for this season.""

U.S. officials also think they have a better system than Australia for estimating vaccine effectiveness. Last year, the vaccine was 32 percent effective against the H3N2 flu strain in the United States.

Another factor in America's favor is that ""the U.S. population overall is more highly vaccinated than the Australian population,"" says Lynnette Brammer, another CDC epidemiologist. ""So you may get some indirect effects of more people being vaccinated here.""

Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, also noted that there's evidence that Australia didn't use antiviral drugs as aggressively as it could have when treating the flu.

Regardless of what happens this year in the United States, infectious disease experts say it remains crucial that as many people get vaccinated as possible.

""They need to get it not only to protect themselves but so that they don't spread it around to other people — their loved ones, folks at the gym, and at work and at religious services — who are more vulnerable,"" says William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. ""No one wants to be a dreaded spreader."""

A new study finds that counties with teams in the Super Bowl experienced significantly higher influenza deaths for people 65 and older compared to counties that didn't have a team that participated.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

We know the Super Bowl this Sunday will feature the Philadelphia Eagles appearing in the big game for the first time in 13 years - also the New England Patriots, who appear in the Super Bowl apparently every year. I exaggerate, but this is their third appearance in the last four years. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam has some strong personal views about the game. But he's here to talk about something else. He's here to talk about the effect the Super Bowl can have on our health. Shankar, welcome.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Thanks, Mary Louise.

KELLY: Do you need to get your strong personal views out of the way first, Shankar?

VEDANTAM: Well, happily, I - my head says the New England Patriots are going to win, but my heart which bleeds green says the Philadelphia Eagles are going to win.

KELLY: You're an Eagles fan obviously.

VEDANTAM: I am indeed.

KELLY: No pretense whatsoever of journalistic objectivity in terms of how the score line goes, but what's the connection between the Super Bowl and our health?

VEDANTAM: I was talking to Charles Stoecker of the Tulane University School of Public Health. He told me he got interested in how the Super Bowl might affect health when he was working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention some years ago. And he saw a newspaper headline when the Super Bowl was being hosted in Dallas.

CHARLES STOECKER: A club owner claimed that the city as a whole would need 10,000 extra exotic dancers to meet the demand that spiked during the Super Bowl.

KELLY: Ten-thousand exotic dancers...

(LAUGHTER)

KELLY: OK, wow, that's nuts.

VEDANTAM: Well, Stoecker thought that this might actually prompt an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, Mary Louise. But when he looked at the data, he didn't find a connection between STDs and the Super Bowl. But he did find a connection between the Super Bowl and the flu.

KELLY: The flu.

VEDANTAM: Yes, and that's because the Super Bowl produces events that occur all across the country, Super Bowl parties.

STOECKER: The Super Bowl changes people's mixing patterns. They might go to a Super Bowl party. They might go to a bar. And if they're at, say, a Super Bowl party and they're in close confines with somebody who has the flu, that flu has more opportunities to move from person to person.

KELLY: OK, Shankar, I'm trying to catch you up here with you. The hypothesis here is you go to a party. You come into contact with people. Is that right?

VEDANTAM: That's exactly right.

KELLY: How did he then go about trying to test this hypothesis?

VEDANTAM: Well, it's tricky, Mary Louise. The Super Bowl is played in a different city each year. The intensity of the flu varies from year to year. Different parts of the country are affected differently because the influenza virus spreads fastest in places that are cold and dry rather than places that are hot and wet.

What Stoecker and his colleagues Alan Barreca at UCLA and Nick Sanders at Cornell did was track deaths caused by the flu among cities that send teams to the Super Bowl. Unsurprisingly, these are the cities that have the highest levels of excitement about the Super Bowl. And they analyzed mortality data over 30 seasons of the Super Bowl.

STOECKER: And we find that cases of influenza mortality among those age 65 and older increase by 18 percent when your team is in the Super Bowl, which is a pretty big increase.

KELLY: OK, deaths related to the flu increase 18 percent. This is in the population age 65 and older. Translate that for me, Shankar. How many actual deaths are we talking?

VEDANTAM: Well, the researchers guess that in 2014 when the Super Bowl featured teams from Denver and Seattle, there may have been 146 additional deaths as a result of the Super Bowl. Now, the effect is strongest, they find, in years when the Super Bowl coincides with the peak of the flu season and in seasons when the flu is more virulent.

KELLY: So a lot of factors here, then - flu season coinciding with Super Bowl, certain cities being colder and more prone to the flu in the first place. Does it matter if your city is hosting the Super Bowl? Should Minneapolis be worried?

VEDANTAM: Interestingly it does not seem to affect the cities that are hosting the Super Bowl. It seems to be primarily affecting the cities that are sending teams to the Super Bowl...

KELLY: Because they're more excited.

VEDANTAM: ...Which makes sense from the point of view that those are the cities where the excitement is going to be the highest.

KELLY: So what's the takeaway here? We should just stay home and eat our nachos and wings by ourselves, or what?

VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, in some ways, the study is telling us something that makes intuitive sense, Mary Louise. It's just the first attempt to notice the phenomenon and quantify the data. The flu spreads when people pass it to each other. So if you increase the amount of person-to-person contact, you're going to increase the spread of the flu. So things you can do if you want to reduce the spread of the flu is, you know, get a flu shot. And if you're sick, stay home.

KELLY: Common sense advice for the Super Bowl - and always, thanks so much, Shankar.

VEDANTAM: Go Eagles.

KELLY: (Laughter) Indeed. That's NPR's Shankar Vedantam. He is NPR's social science correspondent and also the host of a podcast and a radio show that explore unseen patterns in human behavior. That's called Hidden Brain.

Enlarge this image toggle caption /Reuters /Landov /Reuters /Landov

Joseph Paul Franklin, the white supremacist who was convicted of eight murders, suspected in as many as 20 others and who shot Hustler publisher Larry Flynt in 1978, was put to death Wednesday in Missouri.

St. Louis Public Radio followed the news overnight as Franklin ran out of legal challenges.

Alan Greenblatt wrote for us last week about how Flynt, who was paralyzed after being shot, didn't want Franklin to be executed.

""A life spent in a 3-by-6-foot cell is far harsher than the quick release of a lethal injection,"" Flynt wrote last month in The Hollywood Reporter. ""I have had many years in this wheelchair to think about this very topic.""

Franklin, as The Associated Press has reported, ""targeted blacks and Jews in a cross-country killing spree from 1977 to 1980.""

During a jailhouse interview, the 63-year-old Franklin recently told CNN about why he shot Flynt:

"" 'I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,' he says. Franklin is referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler that featured several photos of a black man with a white woman. 'It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.' ""

Franklin also shot and seriously wounded civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in 1980."

For archaeologist Eva Jensen, a happenstance find in Nevada has turned into an in-depth quest. Since stumbling across a Winchester rifle manufactured in 1882, she and other researchers have been seeking to unravel the mysteries behind it.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Here's a lost and found story. What we assume was lost more than a hundred years ago was a rifle. Archaeologist Eva Jensen found it during a survey in Nevada's Great Basin National Park. She was looking for Native American artifacts.

EVA JENSEN: Truthfully that's kind of what I was hoping to see in that rocky outcrop, but I guess I'll take a Winchester rifle.

SIEGEL: It was made in 1882, but who left it there and when remains a mystery. It had been there so long, its black barrel looked like a part of the juniper tree it was leaning against. Jensen says spotting it was a stroke of luck.

JENSEN: It just was the right time, the right light. Sometimes that makes the difference.

SIEGEL: The rifle will spend some time with the curators of the Buffalo Bill Cody Museum in Wyoming so it can be preserved. Afterwards, it will return to the park where it will be on public display through the National Park Service Centennial in 2016.

American shooter Matt Emmons was on Time Magazine's list of chokers after suffering some mental lapses in the last Olympics. On Monday, he competed in the finals in his best discipline and took the bronze medal.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

In the past two Olympics, American shooter Matt Emmons has led his rifle event going into the final shot, and then things fall apart. Today in London, the shooting events concluded and Emmons got another opportunity at victory. NPR's Mike Pesca has this story on what happened as Emmons tried to conquer his sport and his nerves.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Attention, three, two, one, start.

MIKE PESCA, BYLINE: Matt Emmons stood staring at his target. This was the final shot of competition, possibly Emmons' final shot after three Olympic games, which had already netted him a gold and a silver medal in other rifle events. But, in the three position event, the final shot for Matt Emmons has been harrowing.

In Athens, Emmons fired at the wrong target and tumbled out of medal contention. In Beijing, he was leading going into the last shot and pulled the trigger at the wrong time, earning a horrific score, which killed his medal chances.

These experiences, Emmons admitted afterward, had not completely faded away.

MATT EMMONS: I did everything I knew how to do to try to calm my body down and, really, on the last shot, I was just shaking so much and I said, OK, Matt.

PESCA: OK, Matt. Breathe. OK, Matt. Visualize. OK, Matt. Go through all the exercises you and your psychologist have worked on these last four years. Even that frank admission of nerves is somewhat taboo in the culture of sports. In most sports, admitting to nervousness is seen as admitting weakness, but the shooting sports are different. Shooting is almost anti-kinetic. The spectator who took a swig from his Olympics-approved water bottle as Emmons stood ready to fire, the journalist who scribbled a sentence in his notepad - they both moved their bodies much more than Emmons would.

When Emmons was labeled a choker by Time magazine or mocked in the sports media, those words didn't come from other shooters, says Katerina Emmons, Matt's wife, and a two-time shooting medalist for the Czech Republic.

KATERINA EMMONS: None of the shooters - the shooters were great. All of them know how hard it is to overcome fears because we all have them, so all of them appreciated Matt for who he is and there was huge support for him.

PESCA: The other competitors know that controlling adrenaline is a key part of the game. An adrenaline-filled running back may feed off his emotions to bowl over a tackler. That's not how it works with shooting, says Matt.

EMMONS: I honestly wish - there are so many times I wish I was in another sport where I could use those nerves to your advantage, like, you know, when I've been in ski races, if I was nervous, I would always race really well because it brought out the best in me. It brought out that little extra bit of endurance or speed or whatever you might want to get you through that I never was able to do in training.

PESCA: Matt was participating in this sport in this moment. Gold was out of reach. Emmons' friend, the Italian, Nicola Campriani, was about to set an Olympics record, but another good shot and silver would belong to Matt. Afterwards, here's how Emmons describes his mindset.

EMMONS: It was a little bit more challenging today than I thought it was going to be. I guess, really, just the magnitude of the situation kind of hit me, which is fine. I still worked with it pretty well, but even in the final, though, you know, I was trying everything I could on the last couple shot to really just calm myself down and take the best shot that I could and it was tough.

PESCA: Emmons shot his lowest score of the round, by far. The BBC announcer intoned, Emmons has failed again, but he still takes bronze. Emmons hunched over to check his score in the target. He grimaced, but as soon as he straightened up, he smiled. He walked over to his friend, Campriani, and smiled. He smiled through the medal ceremony. He smiled as he kissed his wife and he smiled as he did his interviews.

His teammates said they were thrilled for Matt. Matt said he was thrilled on the podium and the winners said that no one outside the sport could realize what an inspiration Emmons was to all the other athletes and that's when Emmons began to cry.

GLYNN WASHINGTON, HOST:

Now then - it's all well and good to fight the chain of command when it's just yourself on the line, but what if - what if you have a bunch of people depending on every single decision you make? Our first story today on the ""Chain of Command"" episode occurs on the streets of Iraq.

Sensitive listeners should be aware all of these scenes occur during a war zone and as such, it does contain some violence.

ANNA SUSSMAN, BYLINE: For 13 months Matt Cook managed to stay alive as an infantry soldier in Iraq.

MATT COOK: My platoon was hit by - we kind of lost count, but - maybe 15 to 18 IEDs. It soured me on Iraqis and I think that's kind of an inevitable reaction to something like that, when, you know, you lose really good friends. So the last bullet I fired from my rifle - we were, I think, about a month from going home. I think we were all really, really cautious because we've just survived 12, 13 months. You know, you don't want to take too many risks this close to making it through. It was afternoon, just before it gets dark. We're in Humvees. We're all in our gear, our vests, our body armor. We'd stopped traffic in both ways. We had our chem-lights out, we had some cones out. Everything possibly that we could signal traffic to stop was out. And in the middle of it, one of my soldiers who's in a Humvee screams, there's a car coming.

I turned to look and I see this sedan and it's just flying at us. It picks up speed as it comes towards us. You know, you don't have but a few seconds to decide what to do. I've been in this situation, you know, many, many times with my platoon and I think, is this going to be another situation where we shoot a civilian? Or is this a situation where if I don't do anything is this a car bomb and it's going to get inside our circle and blow us all up?

I don't have time to really think this through 'cause things are happening so quickly. So I look to my weapon and I was watching him, you know, watching the car come at us through my Acog, which is the scope of my rifle. I flip my safety to fire and I've got my finger on the trigger. Pulled the trigger, shot several times. I see my rounds enter this guy and the Acog on our weapons magnify really well. So he was wearing a white man-dress and I could just see my rounds going into him and polka-dotting his white man-dress with blood. And then you know, he just stops - the car stops and he slumps over.

I turn my back to it, thinking it's going to blow up and kill us all, to be perfectly honest. And then after a second or two, nothing happens. And I slowly turn around and I see this old man leaning against his door, motionless. He was dead.

I circle around the car. The glass is all broken and there's several bullet holes in his vehicle - his car's smoking. And I pull him out onto the street and his eyes are wide open and I immediately notice that they're just gray and they're covered with cataracts and that he's probably damn-near blind, which is why he came at us.

And while I'm searching the car, you know, I look at his glove box and inside his glove box he has his wallet. And that's where I find a picture of him with a young man. He's got his arm around this young man and I'm only assuming that it was his son.

SUSSMAN: And at that moment Matt, what did you feel, if anything?

COOK: It's hard to describe something like that. I'm in the middle of a really complicated place where people are out to kill us. And so I think I've done what I had to do to protect myself and to protect my soldiers.

SUSSMAN: And is there any guilt in there?

COOK: Well, I think it's hard to feel guilty in a moment like that, when you've spent a year in a place where you genuinely felt like everyone is trying to kill you. And it does - if you feel too guilty then you began to hesitate. What if that old man had actually been driving a bomb-laden vehicle? I knew I had to bury it and then deal with it later.

SUSSMAN: And when you went home - did you think about that old man when you went home?

COOK: I would say I knew that I should feel guilty, but I didn't. You know, my morals and everything I was ever taught about humanity, you know, is questioned because I know what we - you know, what I did, but I did not feel overwhelmingly guilty about it. What really wrecked me I think was this sort of survivor's guilt that - you know, I had a few friends and a soldier who I'd lost and the lingering sort of sorrow I felt for their loss, it was something I had to deal with in a much more difficult way, then, say the old man, for instance.

When I got back from my first deployment I felt very unfulfilled. I felt like there was a lot of unfinished business in Iraq and in Afghanistan and I really had a real desire to return. I knew I wanted to a story and I wanted to write about it. And then I contacted my old battalion commander, chatted with him about the possibility of doing it. Maybe it's extreme, but I felt like going back and embedding with my old unit was what I was really looking for. It all happened very quickly a once I fully committed and kind of bought my ticket, a sort of peace came over me about it. And it turned - I went from nervous to being just very, very excited. It was almost like getting ready for another deployment.

When I got to the airport in Kabul this one was incredibly different. You know, you're on your own - completely on my own and I didn't have the support of 25, 26 well-armed men, you know, ready to jump on a grenade for me if I needed. I had no weapon, I just had my camera and my pack. I generally started second-guessing myself in that moment. I was thinking about - I mean, I would be lying if I said I didn't think about just getting a return ticket and going back home, but Sayid(ph), my driver, finally calls and tells me that he's outside. I just sort of took a deep breath and just stepped out and we took off. So I rolled down my window and I was just smelling the city, looking at everything. And I had my cell phone and I did type in a message to my wife, in case anything were to happen I was just going to hit send. I think the message that I had typed was, need help call embassy, or something like that.

We were on our way to Bagram. He's driven this road how many times? So he knows the road. And we're just - he's weaving in and out of traffic. Well, we're cruising down this road and we're going really fast and we kind of turn this bend and I see this Afghan police unit or army unit checkpoint and they're stopping traffic. And Sayid's just paying no attention whatsoever, he's just flying at this checkpoint. And then I look at the Afghan soldiers and I see them see us. And I see them really tense up and posture up. I mean, I had seen it so many times from the other end, I hit the imaginary break below me and you know, I screamed at Sayid to stop. That's when he kind of jolts and he finally sees this Afghan unit on the street. They immediately raise their rifles at us. The dishka on the truck turns and - I couldn't - you know, maybe half a second, a second away from shooting at us. He slams on the break and we slide onto the shoulder of the road. They run at the car and they've got their AKs at our heads and I was frozen. It was probably the scariest few moments of my life. We were really lucky to be alive 'cause if I had been them, I think I would've pulled the trigger and I probably would've done it much sooner. There's no way I would've risked myself or any of my soldiers for a moment of hesitation.

SUSSMAN: So why do you think they didn't shoot? Why were they so slow on that trigger where maybe you wouldn't have been?

COOK: That's a good question. I've thought about that, but the truth is you just can't compare them to the U.S. forces. They know the culture and they know the dangers more than we do. When you're a soldier in a foreign country, everybody seems dangerous, everybody seems out to kill you. There's a term called pseudo-speciation, which is when a soldier identifies the entire race of a country as an enemy because he is under attack. I was in a state of shock, to be honest with you. I hadn't had a rifle pointed at me in a long time. One of the first things I thought of was that old man that I'd killed in Iraq. I think for the first time, it really hit me. And this old man, I remember so specifically I think because when you're in combat a lot of times everybody's shooting their weapons so you don't really know if it's your round hitting someone. And with the old man, I could see my rounds hitting him through my Acog, he'd gotten so close to us.

The weight of those consequences really, really sunk in. And I think I - thinking about this old man really kind of turned me inside out, to be honest with you.

SUSSMAN: What do you mean?

COOK: I always knew that what happened was a horrible thing, but I never really felt. I felt it for the first time in a way that I had never felt before but kind of knew that I should have.

Does that make sense? It made me kind of realize how maddening the whole thing this.

Tucked away in a back street of Semarang, a city in Indonesia's Central Java province, is a tiny, four-table restaurant. In the cramped kitchen, Mahmudi Haryono whips up a plate of ribs — lunch for two customers.

He brings it out and serves it to two Indonesian soldiers in olive drab uniforms.

Haryono is smiling and cool as a cucumber. But he acknowledges that after getting out of jail a few years ago, serving men in uniform set butterflies aflutter in his stomach.

""Sometimes, I felt insecure,"" he says, sitting down at a table to talk as the soldiers eat. ""I thought that perhaps somebody wanted me to be rearrested. Or maybe somebody was setting me up.""

Haryono, a former terrorist, has traded his rifle for a chef's spatula. His broken dreams of global jihad help to explain a little bit why Indonesia — home to the world's largest Muslim population — has not become the hotbed of terrorism that many have feared.

After all, between 2002 and 2009, homegrown Indonesian terrorist groups staged deadly attacks almost every year, making them some of al-Qaida's most effective affiliates. The most prominent of these is the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah.

The Birth Of A Jihadist

After graduating from high school in 1995, Haryono visited an Islamic boarding school founded by Jemaah Islamiyah's spiritual mentor, Abu Bakar Bashir, and run by younger radicals. The turbaned men there were among the very few Indonesians with personal ties to Osama bin Laden. Some of them would go on to stage the notorious Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, including seven Americans. He also read the work of famous Islamists, such as Egyptian Sayyid Qutb, a leading member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and '60s.

They inspired him to wage jihad in Bosnia and Afghanistan. But Haryono had no money, and no way to get there.

""Yes, they implanted in me the values and the spirit of jihad,"" he says, ""but if you look at the actual capability to wage jihad, we just didn't have it.""

He felt that compared to their foreign counterparts, Indonesian jihadis were too wimpy. A proper jihadi, Haryono believed, should be tall and fierce-looking with a long beard. But he is, in fact, a short, skinny fellow with a smooth, boyish face, much younger looking than his 37 years.

He tried to get to Indonesia's Maluku Islands, to join Muslims who were fighting Christians, beginning in 1999. But his lack of military training kept him from joining.

Being shunted around by recruiters between Indonesia and Malaysia made him feel a bit like a victim of human trafficking, Haryono admits. He made it as far as the island of Mindanao in the Philippines in 2000. There, he learned guerrilla warfare and jungle survival skills. He eventually saw combat with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, Muslim separatists fighting the Philippine government.

But two years later, the group made peace with Manila. So Haryono returned to Java and at first opened a shoe store.

Developing Alternatives To Violence



He was back in Indonesia, but he hadn't entirely put his past behind him. In 2003, Haryono was sentenced to 10 years in prison for terrorism. He says he did not know that friends had stored explosives in his store. Those explosives killed 12 people and injured 150 in an attack on the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta.

In jail, Haryono decided to mend his ways. He felt the need to take responsibility for his family, and he yearned for the recognition of fellow Muslims and mainstream society. He was paroled five years later. That's when he met fellow reformed radical Noor Huda Ismail.

Huda is a social entrepreneur and former journalist. His stint studying in the United Kingdom gave him a look at how Northern Ireland dealt with former Catholic and Protestant combatants.

After returning to Indonesia, Ismail tried opening several businesses to help former jihadis. First, he tried a T-shirt shop, then a shrimp farm. Neither was successful, and some of his ex-terrorist ""clients"" ended up in trouble again.

Now, Huda runs three modest restaurants that employ about a dozen former terrorists and school dropouts, including Haryono. He says helping to rehabilitate ex-terrorists works better than just punishing them.

""In the last 11 years, what we have been witnessing is a black-and-white approach,"" he says. ""My kind of initiative can provide alternative approaches to violent jihadi networks, using social enterprise, using a civil society approach.""

Changing Nature Of Indonesian Terrorism



Sidney Jones, a counterterrorism expert with the International Crisis Group in Jakarta, says that since 2010, Indonesian authorities have killed 50 suspected terrorists and arrested hundreds more.

""What we call terrorism in Indonesia now has degenerated into a kind of low-intensity conflict between police and terrorist suspects,"" Jones says.

Terrorists are so bent on revenge against the police that they have largely given up attacking foreign interests in Indonesia.

Human rights groups are concerned that Indonesian authorities, including U.S.- and Australian-trained police special forces, are uninterested in capturing terrorist suspects alive, and are shooting to kill.

Of course, Indonesia's jails and mosques are minting new extremists. But Jones says the country has generally avoided becoming fertile ground for terrorist organizations.

""If you look at where terrorism takes place around the world,"" she says, ""it's usually where you've got a repressive government — not true in Indonesia; occupation — not true in Indonesia; a war going on where local Muslims are dying,"" which is also not true in Indonesia.

Indonesia's success in combating terrorism bolsters its narrative of a thriving democracy in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. But as the story of Haryono and Huda suggests, credit may go not just to law enforcement, but also to civil society.

A Chance To Rejoin Society

Back in his restaurant, Haryono chops vegetables for his next customer. He appears to be brimming with confidence and grateful for the chance to rejoin society.

""Now I enjoy life. I'm happy with a wife and children, family and friends,"" he says with a smile. ""Back then, life was full of fear. I only hung out with other jihadis.""

Haryono has mixed feelings about his experience. He says he feels no remorse about fighting in defense of his faith. It gave him a sense of accomplishment. But he says he does feel guilty about the double life he once led.

""What I regret is that in the past, I lied to my parents,"" he says. ""I ran away without saying goodbye to them. I made up stories to tell them, which they believed, but which I knew were a lie."""

Ginny Thrasher, a 19-year old from West Virginia University, took the first of the more than 300 gold medals that will be awarded at the Olympics in Brazil, winning the 10-meter air rifle on Saturday.

Thrasher, the youngest of the 15 members of the U.S. rifle team, bested a field of 50 competitors, comfortably winning the final duel with China's Du Li, who won gold medals at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.

In the air rifle competition, shooters use pellets with flat fronts that leave clean holes in the paper target that determines scoring.

Thrasher is from Springfield, Va., and first began shooting five years ago when she went deer hunting with her grandfather.

""It was just a big rush of adrenaline,"" Thrasher said of her first hunting trip in an interview with The Washington Post. ""Things were happening very fast and all of a sudden, my aim was good and it was an exciting feeling.""

As a freshman at West Virginia this past year, she won both NCAA air rifle titles as she led her school to a national title in the sport.

""I didn't really care much about the Olympics,"" Thrasher told The Post last month, after she qualified for the U.S. team. ""I knew shooting was an Olympic sport, but I never really thought, 'Oh, I want to go to the Olympics in shooting.' I was just shooting because I loved shooting.""

After a dazzling opening ceremony on Friday night, the first full day of competition at the Rio Games on Saturday also featured swimming, water polo, cycling and beach volleyball."

Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid insist that gun control legislation is not dead — they say they're strategizing on how to bring the issue back to the Senate floor.

Even if it does return, one proposal unlikely to survive is an assault weapons ban. Military-style assault rifles now form a nearly $1 billion industry supported by gun owners who spend thousands of dollars collecting these firearms.

And while the gun-rights lobby keeps invoking the right of ""self-defense"" to defend Americans' right to buy these guns, home protection is low on the list of reasons gun enthusiasts keep buying military-style weapons.

'They Picture You As Some Kind Of Militant Freak'

There's a lot of name-calling in the gun control debate. Gun control advocates are slammed as elitist, urban liberals who want to take everyone's guns away. Gun rights people are accused of being paranoid rednecks who think the government is out to get them. And then there are the special labels reserved for people who love their assault rifles.

""You know, they picture you as some kind of militant freak. And that's not me,"" says Mike Collins, who owns more than a dozen military-style rifles with his wife.

Collins wants you to understand something: He is a rational, intelligent, regular guy.

""I spent 27 years in the military,"" he says. ""I defended this country all over the world. I've been in multiple combat tours. I'm not a nut. I'm not a crazy guy. I'm just a normal person who enjoys shooting.""

And for Collins, target practicing with an AR-15 is a hobby.

Next to Collins at the shooting range at Clark Brothers Gun Shop in Warrenton, Va., is Jason Glascock, who says if more Americans knew what it was like to shoot these weapons, they would see these guns can actually be good, clean fun.

""The AR — it's America's gun. It's what our troops carry. It's been our military firearm,"" Glascock says. ""It's our, if you will, symbol around the world, this gun.""

The fully automatic version of this gun — the M-16 — was introduced by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. The AR-15 is semiautomatic, which means you need to squeeze the trigger for each bullet.

Glascock was 3 years old when he started shooting a .22 caliber with his grandfather. By 5 years old, he moved on to shotguns. He started collecting military-style guns when he turned 18, and he just built an AR-15 for his 19-year-old son last Christmas.

'The Mr. Potato Head Of Firearms'

When Glascock explains why he keeps collecting military-style guns, he doesn't bring up self-defense or hunting. His eyes light up when he talks about all the fun ways you can customize an AR-15: flashlights, scopes, night vision, even an attachable beer-bottle opener. You can get the gun in neon green or with zebra stripes if you want. The accessories can cost more than the weapon itself, which starts at around $800.

Collins says when he modifies his AR-15, it's like a guy souping up his car.

""This is the man's Barbie doll — you know, the Mr. Potato Head of firearms,"" Collins says, ""because you can interchange so many different things to make it customized to you, to be able to make it comfortable when you shoot.""

But this Mr. Potato Head is deadly. The AR-15 was the gun used by Adam Lanza when he opened fire in Newtown, Conn., last December. Twenty-six people were killed, including 20 first-graders. Everyone was shot more than once — as many as 11 times. And that's what the military wanted out of this gun — the ability to kill even without good aim, a weapon with high-capacity ammunition magazines that could spray bullets within close to medium range.

""Those design features in a civilian market have horrific consequences,"" says Tom Diaz, a gun control advocate who has long followed the commercialization of military firearms. ""So you can call it whatever you want — tactical rifle, black rifle, assault rifle, modern sporting rifle. It has the capability that the military wanted for warfare.""

Instruments Of Warfare In The Civilian Market

How did warfare enter the civilian market? AR-15 rifles were sold to the public as early as the 1960s, but Diaz says their popularity really took off in the 1980s, after Chinese manufacturers began exporting the AR's Russian counterpart — the AK-47 — to the U.S. And then pop culture helped the market along. Television shows like Miami Vice made military-style firearms look sexy.

Military-style rifles have now ballooned into a nearly billion-dollar business. The main gun industry group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, tells NPR these weapons represent almost 20 percent of the entire industry's revenue. Data that the NSSF provided to NPR show imports and production of these weapons almost quadrupled in the past 10 years. After semi-automatic pistols, military-style rifles represent the next hottest-selling category of guns.

""AR-style modern sporting rifles are a major contributor to the success of the American firearms industry, no question,"" says Mike Bazinet of the NSSF.

In advertisements for these guns, there's a common message: Get in touch with your inner GI Joe. For example, a Web commercial from Sig Sauer features soldiers in combat boots crouching with their assault rifles next to military Humvees.

Bazinet says, despite these ads, the gun industry is not driving the market for military-style weapons — instead, it's the consumers who are clamoring for them.

But gun control advocates aren't buying that. Diaz says the industry is filling a demand it was forced to create. Data from the General Social Survey, a public opinion survey conducted every two years, show the percentage of American households that own guns is declining. Diaz says kids these days would rather pick up a video game than a hunting rifle.

""It's just a fact that hunting has been in serious decline, so those kinds of guns just don't sell as well,"" he says. ""Well, you're in business, you got to sell something. These assault rifles — these military-style rifles — appeal to a broader range of people.""

So he says the industry pounced on these products to stay relevant. With fewer households to sell to, Diaz says gun makers have to keep coming up with newer, sleeker, more high-tech weapons for people who already own guns.

Now, more than 30 gun companies make AR-15s. Almost 8.5 million assault rifles have been either manufactured in the U.S. or imported here since the 1990s, according to the NSSF.

Gun dealers like Clark Brothers Gun Shop say someone comes in to buy one of these rifles almost every single day they're open.

""We've got guys that come here on their 18th birthday and buy an AR-15 — the first gun they ever bought,"" says Mitch May, who has been the general manager at Clark Brothers since 1962. ""Just because it's a gun that the military uses, and they want to have one just like it, but they don't want to join the Army to get it.""

After the shootings in Newtown, May says he couldn't keep the AR-15 in stock. Between December and February, he estimates he probably could have sold 40 AR-15s per week. Even if most people think a federal assault weapons ban has slim hopes of passing any time soon, the mere threat of a ban always brings in great business.

""We've always sold more guns when Democrats are in office than we ever sell when Republicans [are] in office,"" says May. ""And we all here ... and everywhere else in the gun business vote Republican every time."""

The U.S. military is trying to figure out whether certain heavy weapons are putting U.S. troops in danger.

The concern centers on the possibility of brain injuries from shoulder-fired weapons like the Carl Gustaf, a recoilless rifle that resembles a bazooka and is powerful enough to blow up a tank.

A single round for the Carl Gustaf can weigh nearly 10 pounds. The shell leaves the gun's barrel at more than 500 miles per hour. And as the weapon fires, it directs an explosive burst of hot gases out of the back of the barrel.

For safety reasons, troops are trained to take positions to the side of weapons like this. Even so, they get hit by powerful blast waves coming from both the muzzle and breech.

""It feels like you get punched in your whole body,"" is the way one Army gunner described the experience in a military video made in Afghanistan. ""The blast bounces off the ground and it overwhelms you.""

During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military recognized that the blast from a roadside bomb could injure a service member's brain without leaving a scratch. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops sustained this sort of mild traumatic brain injury, which has been linked to long-term problems ranging from memory lapses to post-traumatic stress disorder.

Also during those wars, the military began to consider the effects on the brain of repeated blasts from weapons like the Carl Gustaf. And some members of Congress became concerned.

Rep. Louise Slaughter, a congresswoman from upstate New York and a member of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, says she was once told of a soldier whose ears bled after using the Carl Gustaf.

""Obviously,"" Slaughter says, ""we have to know. What kind of damage is that doing to soldiers in training and on the battlefield?""

The military got some hints about the risks of firing heavy weapons from a program it launched in Afghanistan.

In 2011, the Army equipped thousands of troops with blast gauges — coin-sized sensors worn on the head and shoulders.

The gauges, made by a company in Slaughter's district, were designed to measure the intensity of a blast from a roadside bomb. But they also revealed worrisome levels of blast exposure in some troops who were merely firing certain heavy weapons.

Last year, the military quietly pulled the blast gauges from wide use, saying they hadn't been useful in detecting brain injuries. Slaughter thinks that was a mistake.

""I don't understand the Pentagon's circular argument,"" Slaughter says. ""They aren't using the gauges because they don't have the data to prove how effective they are. But it doesn't take a great brain to understand you will not get the data if you don't use the gauges.""

The military declined several requests for an interview about the blast gauge program and the risks from firing weapons.

But in an email, an Army spokesperson said that the Department of Defense is still using blast gauges in research, including some studies that look at ""cumulative low-level blast"" effects.

And a scientist who works for a private company hired by the military to study blast exposure confirms that ongoing research includes studies of exposures during weapons training.

""The reason that these studies are being done is that at some point someone has said, 'I don't feel quite right,' "" says Laila Zai, director of neuroscience research at Applied Research Associates.

But it's really tricky to turn these anecdotes into usable data. Even results from the Army's blast-gauge program in Afghanistan are hard to interpret because there were so many variables on the battlefield, Zai says.

For example, she says, buildings and other structures tend to reflect blast waves from a weapon — and that can result in much greater exposure than when the weapon is fired in an open field.

So Zai has been working with a researcher from the Navy. ""What he's doing is putting sensors on people undergoing shoulder-mounted weapons training,"" she says. ""And he's looking to see if the overpressure [the force of a blast] generated by various training scenarios ever overwhelms the threshold of safety.""

It's all part of a five-year, $30 million effort by the Office of Naval Research to help the military figure out how much blast exposure is too much.

Last year, a military study showed that firing heavy weapons could temporarily impair learning and memory. Now, Slaughter says, the military needs to find out whether these short-term effects can lead to long-term injuries among members of the service.

""If we can save them from a lifetime of brain damage,"" she says, ""for heaven's sake, it's our obligation to do it."""

U.S. rifle shooter Matthew Emmons has won a bronze medal in the 50-meter three positions rifle event. That may sound like a slight let-down for the man who had been poised to win silver — a horrible final shot of 7.6 dropped him into third place — but it's far better than Emmons' earlier Olympic experiences.

First there was Athens 2004, when he inadvertently fired upon the wrong target.

Then there was Beijing 2008, when he rushed his pacing on his final shot. Instead of winning a gold medal, he missed the bullseye, and the podium.

Emmons, 31, had qualified for the 50m three positions event with the second-best score. And Monday, he had nailed scores of 10.7, 10.6 and 10.5 before shooting a 7.6 on his final shot at London's Royal Artillery Barracks.

Emmons didn't receive a medal in this year's 10m air rifle event, in which he won a gold medal in Beijing. At the Athens Games, he won gold in the 50m prone rifle event."

After more than a century, the classic Winchester rifle — the ""Gun that Won the West"" — is set to ride off into the sunset. This month, the European company that owns the Winchester plant in New Haven, Conn., said the gun will no longer be made in the United States. The iconic weapon just isn't as popular as it used to be. John Dankosky of member station WNPR reports.

MELISSA BLOCK, Host:

This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News, I'm Melissa Block.

MICHELE NORRIS, Host:

And I'm Michele Norris. The Winchester rifle was called The Gun that Won the West. But for 140 years it has been made in the heart of yankee New England, New Haven, Connecticut. Much like its sidearm counterpart, the Colt .45, the Winchester became an icon and a symbol of a way of life. But this month the European company that owns the Winchester plant announced it would close. Some classic models would be discontinued, others would be produced overseas. As John Dankosky of member station WNPR reports that means the Winchester, like all those cowboys, could be headed into the sunset for good.

JOHN DANKOSKY: The Winchester name is the stuff of myth and legend including that famous tag line.

HERB HOUSE: Probably one of the greatest advertising slogans that was ever devised is that phrase, The Gun that Won the West. It's not terribly accurate but it was a good selling point.

DANKOSKY: Gun historian Herb House lives in Cody, Wyoming. He says the early Winchester repeater rifles were out of the price range of most pioneers but for those who could afford them, House says, they came in handy.

HOUSE: They were a very good weapon for defense in the early years of the westward expansion. When you have a rifle that can fire 16 times with one loading against a single shot musket or something like that, then they became one of the most popular sporting guns, hunting rifles.

DANKOSKY: Not surprising with one of Winchester leading proponents being president and big game hunter Theodore Roosevelt. House says the Winchester was accurate, reliable and one of the only American rifles widely available overseas. He says that market only grew with the help of another larger than life figure, John Wayne.

SOUNDBITE: JOHN WAYNE

HOUSE: The world sees America through our film industry and for years the biggest export were cowboy films.

DANKOSKY: Do you personally have a favorite movie that features a Winchester rifle?

HOUSE: Actually it's the Winchester 73 with James Stewart.

DANKOSKY: That 73 is in 1873.

SOUNDBITE: JAMES STEWART

DANKOSKY: Then in 1958 the TV show The Rifleman with Chuck Connors help put dreams of Winchesters in the heads of young boys across America. But in the following decades demand for the gun shrank along with Winchester's workforce. From a high of about 19,000 employees to fewer than 200. In the 1980's the Olen Corporation, which ran Winchester for decades, sold the plants to a company from Belgium. Paul Demanato the facility director at the New Haven plants says it was all part of a changing American culture.

PAUL DEMANATO: There aren't as many young people going into the shooting sports. It could be a sign of the times, also, where fathers don't have time to take sons out and do the things with them that for example my dad did.

DANKOSKY: Demanato has been working here off and on since he was 19. His father worked here before him. He'd like to see Winchester stay in New Haven but he knows it can't keep losing money. New Haven Mayor John DeStefano says he's working to find a buyer who will keep the plant open but admits it won't be easy.

JOHN DESTEFANO: With the Winchester rife you basically had a product whose technology in many respects is a hundred years old and whose market was slipping away.

DANKOSKY: Mayor DeStefano says it is now up to the Olen Corporation, which held on to the Winchester name when it sold the company years ago. An Olen spokesperson says they're disappointed in the decision to close the plant and hope to license the name to another company that can carry on the Winchester tradition. Meanwhile gun enthusiasts see the writing on the wall. They say collectable Winchesters made in New Haven that might sell for $800.00 today could double in price overnight if the plant closes. It's like what happens with a painting, they say, when a great artist dies. For NPR News I'm John Dankosky.

""Why did he even have a gun?"" — it's a common refrain in America, often after mass shootings by people who legally aren't supposed to have firearms.

One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns.

It happened again a week later, when a man in Rancho Tehama, Calif., killed four people and shot up the outside of a school. He, too, had been ordered to give up his guns, but verification of his compliance was left to the ""honor system.""

""The system is reactive,"" says Chris Anderson, a prosecutor in the City Attorney Office in Seattle, Wash. ""The court says you're prohibited from possessing firearms, and if you're later arrested with a firearm, then you're guilty ... but there's never been a mechanism in place to go get those firearms.""

For the last couple of years, Anderson has been part of a collaboration between the city and King County to curb gun violence. One of the first things the group did was measure the compliance rate for orders to surrender weapons. It turned out to be shockingly low. In 2016, 56 percent of the people who received the orders simply ignored them. And of those who did respond, a suspiciously small number actually surrendered any guns.

That's why Seattle police are now following up on those court orders — in person.

Officers Ellen Kernan and Sean Hamlin spend their days contacting people who've just been ordered to surrender their firearms. The orders are usually the result of a domestic violence incident. The officers often seek out accused abusers at their workplaces, where they're more likely to be cooperative.

""Do you have any guns?"" Officer Kernan asks a barista, after she's asked him to step outside the coffee shop where he works. The barista's girlfriend has filed for a temporary protection order, and told investigators he owns a handgun. But the barista tells Kernan he doesn't.

""I've never even handled a gun,"" he says.

Right now, the officers have no choice but to accept that.

""Who to believe? I don't know,"" says Officer Hamlin, on the way back to their car.

It's complicated work, figuring out whether someone owns a gun. Government records are little help — the state tracks purchase histories, but only for licensed gun stores, not gun shows and one-on-one sales. One police officer on this task force dismisses the tracking system as ""full of holes.""

This is one of the main explanations for why police so rarely follow up on gun removal orders in America: It takes a lot of time and effort.

In Seattle, there are now money and staffers dedicated to the effort. Prosecutors and law enforcement meet on a regular basis to review the surrender orders coming out of the courts, and target the most urgent cases.

When they suspect gun owners are holding out on them, they have the option of asking for a search warrant. Officer Hamlin says that usually depends on how detailed the victim's claims are.

""If she has specific allegations of, 'I saw this gun, he always has this gun on him,' or, 'He always hides it under his pillow when he sleeps at night,' more likely than not we would get that search warrant signed by the judge and go do it.""

The problem with search warrants is they can provoke a defensive reaction by the gun owner, escalating the danger for police. That's why searches require the participation of a SWAT team.

So in most cases, the gun removal task force chooses the route of persuasion. Anderson says that means a lot of time on the phone, talking to the gun owners' lawyers — and their family.

""We call people's moms, we call their aunt, we call their uncle,"" he says. ""And we explain to them, 'look, he's not just a risk to the victims, and he's a risk to himself. And it's just better if we have the guns.'""

The approach is working, according to preliminary numbers. As the inter-jurisdictional gun removal effort ramped up last year, the number of guns surrendered sky-rocketed. As many as 134 firearms were turned over in 15 weeks — that's compared to 124 guns surrendered in all of 2016, before the effort was launched.

So far, the jump in surrendered firearms has not alarmed gun rights groups.

""We've had no complaints from anybody in the public that King County has violated anybody's rights,"" says Alan Gottlieb, with the the Second Amendment Foundation. ""We also don't want guns in the hands of prohibited people.""

This emphasis on improving the enforcement of existing gun laws is also giving hope to gun control groups, many of whom see it as the only politically viable strategy for reducing gun violence, at least in the short term. A number of states — including some in pro-gun rights regions of the country — have been changing policies to make it easier for law enforcment to find out whether felons and other ""prohibited persons"" are in possession of firearms.

""When we do polls and look at the data... we find that with issues like domestic violence restrictions, actually there are areas where there's a high fairly high amount of agreement,"" says Shannon Frattaroli, with the Center for Gun Policy and Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

National Gun Theft On The Rise Across The Country Gun Theft On The Rise Across The Country Listen · 3:40 3:40

Frattaroli focuses on guns and domestic violence, and says the research shows the life-saving value of having police remove guns from a house soon after an incident.

""We know that that period of separation, when a woman is separating from a man, is a very dangerous time for her,"" she says.

With that insight in mind, the gun removal program in Seattle often tries to visit the home of a domestic violence victim while the alleged abuser is still in jail.

SPD Sgt. Dorothy Kim, who leads the police portion of the gun removal team, is doing just that — visiting the apartment of a woman whose boyfriend just spent the night in jail on domestic violence charges. Kim wants to collect his firearms before he posts bail.

""It gives you guys a chance to cool off and make sure everybody stays safe,"" Kim tells the girlfriend. ""That's the point of getting the weapons before he's released. It's better for law enforcement, it's better for you, it's better for him, really.""

The girlfriend readily agrees. This approach doesn't require a warrant, because the girlfriend also lives here and can consent to the search. Just in the past few weeks, searches with the permission of live-in girlfriends or partners have led Seattle Police to discover two large caches of weapons and ammunition — dozens of guns and tens of thousands of rounds.

In this apartment, there's only one gun, a semi-automatic rifle. Still, Sgt. Kim says it's a step in the right direction. As she takes the rifle to her car, she says there's a good chance the boyfriend will avoid a domestic violence conviction and eventually get the gun back.

""But I feel better just knowing that at least during this time when emotions are running high, we've gotten it out, at least for a little bit,"" she says."

Kansas is being held up as an example of how states can pass meaningful gun laws. NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Republican state Sen. Barbara Bollier about what's being done there.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

As some of the students you just heard pointed out, often after a terrible event like last week's shooting, gun control advocates in particular complain that nothing is being done to address gun violence. And that might be true on the federal level, but we wondered what the states are up to. In our reporting, one state stood out - Kansas. It has a Republican governor and a Republican controlled legislature. Conventional wisdom suggests that they would be friendly to the gun lobby, but gun safety groups point to Kansas as a state where progress is being made. So to talk about that, we called State Senator Barbara Bollier. She is a Republican lawmaker in Kansas. We reached her in her office at the state capitol, and I asked her what the focus of the gun safety conversation is there.

BARBARA BOLLIER: You know, it depends on the year, Michel. And last year, we focused on making sure that guns were not permitted in our mental health hospitals. And thankfully, the legislature was able to pass laws that would disallow that so the hospitals can control that themselves and say no. So I would tell you that here because we have essentially three parties - we have a Democrat Party, we have a moderate Republican Party, and we have a conservative Republican Party - we are kind of all over the map on what might be introduced as far as legislation. But what actually goes through, it takes usually moderate Republicans and Democrats working together to have a majority to pass meaningful anti-gun violence legislation.

MARTIN: Well, what are some of the things that are being discussed in this legislative session? I know that last year there was a whole conversation about teaching gun safety in the schools. The NRA has a curriculum aimed at children. And I understand that there was an effort made to mandate that the NRA curriculum be used for the lower grades.

BOLLIER: Yes. And that legislation is still around. We have changed the legal age that someone can carry on campus. It passed in the House to move it down to 18. But we did add in on the House side as well the requirement to actually have training. The bill hasn't come to the Senate yet. I will tell you that, personally, I have Senate Bill 390 that is an extreme risk protection order. It is a way to say if law enforcement finds and knows that there's someone that either - there's a domestic violence issue or a possible suicide, this would give instructions on how you could legally remove with judge's orders temporarily a gun so that you would get out of the extreme risk time and prevent a death and make it so that people have a chance to say, yes, you can keep your gun, but right now, you shouldn't have your gun.

MARTIN: Well, I mean, it sounds to me as though you're still on a one step forward, two steps back kind of mindset there. Do you have any advice for colleagues in other states who are trying to, you know, keep in this?

BOLLIER: Yeah. The advice absolutely is don't stop trying because we are supposed to be a government of the people. And the people are crying out to us as government leaders to do something that's reasonable. And as long as you have politicians who are backed with millions of dollars from the NRA directly and indirectly, we're going to have a problem. So you have to make that a primary issue of why you're determining that you're voting or not voting for someone, whatever it is your issue is. This is a critical one in this country, and we need to wake up about it.

MARTIN: That's State Senator Barbara Bollier. She is a Republican. She's serving in Kansas. And we reached her in her office in Topeka. Senator, thank you so much for speaking with us.

BOLLIER: Thank you for having me. And let's hope something can change.

In the seven days that have followed the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people, students from the Florida campus have moved from terror to grief to activism, inspiring a national youth-led protest against political inaction on gun reform.

On Wednesday, the Parkland students — still mourning and fueled by anger — made their way to the state capitol in Tallahassee to confront lawmakers to demand a ban on assault weapons.

But as NPR reported, while Florida House lawmakers opened the day's session with a prayer for the victims, they did not open debate on a bill that would ban assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines.

Still, the Parkland victims' protest has mobilized students all over the country who are fearful of yet another fatal school shootings. From coast to coast teens are staging walk outs of their own, urging national and local legislators to enact laws that might prevent future gun violence in schools.

Dozens of students in Bellingham, Wash., began preparing for the walk-out gathering to make signs late Tuesday night. They planned to leave their classrooms at 11:22 — the same time as the Parkland shooting.

In an television interview with KOMO News, one student who's not quite 18 years-old and withheld her name said, ""We can't vote, so this is our voice. We're just hoping to make a change by having our voices heard.""

High school students in Missoula, Mont., trudged through the snow to participate in the national movement. The yelled, ""This is what democracy looks like,"" as they took their protest to Sen. Steve Daines' (R- Mont.) office.

In Minneapolis Fox 9 has been broadcasting video footage of high school students from the school district in a procession down city streets toward City Hall.

The network reported that ""Minneapolis City Council members are working on language to vote on the city taking an official position favoring a statewide assault weapon ban.""

Teen protesters from the D.C. metro area converged on the U.S. Capitol and in front of the White House. WAMU public radio reporter Mikaela Lefrak followed along as organizers read the names of the Florida shooting victims.

Hundreds of students held up homemade signs as they marched across the National Mall. One read: ""We want education without fear of annihilation.""

The Hill reported hundreds of students from Maryland also made their way toward the U.S. Capitol to demand action on gun control.

New Jersey students from Southern Regional High School walked out of class and staged a rally on the campus lawn.

In addition to Wednesday's events Marjory Stoneman Douglas students are also planning a rally against school and gun violence called ""March for Our Lives"" in Washington D.C. on March 24.

For those who can't make it to D.C. they are encouraging organizers to lead local rallies and protests around the U.S. on the same day.

The Women's March youth branch, EMPOWER, is also organizing a national school walk out on March 14, the one month anniversary of the Florida shooting. CNN says the rallies are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in every time zone and last for 17 minutes — one for each victim who lost their life in the massacre."

The U.S. Supreme Court has, once again, declined to hear a Second Amendment case, turning away a constitutional challenge to a 10-day waiting period for the purchase of guns in California. The court's decision not to hear the case came over an angry dissent from conservative Justice Clarence Thomas.

The decision to stay out of the California case is the latest sign of the justices' reluctance to enter the national debate over gun control. While the decision has no legal importance, the practical effect is to leave in place California's waiting period, and others like it. Such laws are designed in part to prevent impulsive violence and suicides.

Gun rights activists had argued that the 10-day waiting period violates the second amendment guarantee of a right to keep and bear arms, especially for those who already legally own guns and have passed background checks.

From The Archives 2017: Supreme Court Won't Hear Challenge To Calif. Gun Carry Law Supreme Court Won't Hear Challenge To Calif. Gun Carry Law Listen · 3:57 3:57

But the court, as it has done consistently in recent years, decided not to take up the case. The last major set of gun cases came in 2008 and 2010, when the court ruled for the first time that individuals have a right to own a gun for self-defense in their homes.

Although those decisions left considerable room for gun regulation, it also left many questions unanswered, and since then the court has rejected the pleas of gun rights activists to hear their challenges to other laws that limit when and where states may limit guns.

Referring to this record of nonintervention, Justice Thomas accused his fellow justices of treating the right to bear arms as a ""disfavored"" constitutional right.

He contended that his fellow justices would have easily agreed to hear other cases if they involved the right to free speech, the right to abortion, or the right to be free from unreasonable searches. Noting that the court has not reviewed an important gun rights case in eight years, he castigated his colleagues for treating gun rights as ""a constitutional orphan."""

In trying to clarify his Wednesday comments about arming teachers and other school personnel, President Trump, a day later, aligned himself even more closely with the National Rifle Association on the issue of teachers with guns and beefing up school security.

So much so, they seemed, at times, to be reading from the same script.

Here's how the day started — with NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC (emphasis ours):

""Can we protect so much with armed security, while we drop our kids off at school, that are so-called gun-free zones, that are wide-open targets for any crazy madman bent on evil to come there first? There first? In every community, PTAs, teachers' unions, local law enforcement, moms and dads – they all must come together to implement the very best strategy to harden their schools, including effective trained, armed security that will absolutely protect every innocent child in this country. That has to happen now. Evil walks among us, and God help us if we do not harden our schools and protect our kids. ... ""I refuse to leave this stage until I say one more time that we must immediately harden our schools. Every day— every day, young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open, soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder. It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewelry store or some Hollywood gala. Schools must be the most hardened targets in this country.""

Hours later, Trump was at the White House talking about school safety after last week's mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school. Notice, Trump used some of the same talking points, key words and phrases as LaPierre (again, emphasis ours):

""We have to harden our schools, not soften them. A gun-free zone to a killer or somebody who wants to be a killer, that's like going in for the ice cream. That's like 'here I am, take me.' We have to get smart on gun-free zones. When they see 'this is a gun-free zone,' that means that nobody has a gun except them, nobody's going to be shooting bullets in the other direction. And they see that, it's such a beautiful target. They live for gun-free zones. ""Now what I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus, we give them a little bit of a bonus, because frankly they'd feel more comfortable having the gun anyway, you give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free you've now made the school into a hardened target. ... ""You want a hardened school, and I want a hardened school, too.""

So when it comes to ""hardening"" schools, not a phrase that was in wide use before Thursday, and speaking out against ""gun-free zones,"" it appears the president and the NRA are, well, on the same page.

Trump does appear, however, to differ with the gun lobby when it comes to his support of increasing the age to be able to buy an assault rifle, from 18 to 21. Trump said he wasn't concerned, though, about that.

""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Trump said. ""I really think the NRA wants to do what's right. I mean, they're very close to me; I'm very close to them; they're very, very great people. They love this country. They're patriots. The NRA wants to do the right thing.""

And then in his next sentence, he may have given away the reason he and the NRA seem to be using similar, and sometimes the exact same, language.

""I've spoken to them often in the last two days,"" Trump acknowledged, ""and they want to do the right thing.""

Trump also reiterated his calls for arming more teachers and other adults working in the nations' schools, something LaPierre also called for. But Trump has made several conflicting statements on the controversial issue over the course of less than 24 hours beginning Wednesday.

At White House listening sessions Wednesday with students and parents, including some from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman killed 17 people last week, Trump said, ""If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, it could very well end the attack very quickly.""

But Thursday morning, the president put out a barrage of tweets, defending himself and clarifying, ""I never said 'give teachers guns' like was stated on Fake News."" He added that he wanted to look at the possibility of giving ""concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience.""

In his subsequent White House meeting Thursday with state and local officials to discuss schoool safety, Trump expanded on that.

""I don't want teachers to have guns,"" he said. ""I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns. If they really have that aptitude, because not everybody has an aptitude for a gun. I think a concealed permit for teachers and letting people know there are people in the building with a gun, you won't have, in my opinion, you won't have these shootings.""

An armed guard was present at the Florida high school last week, but resigned Thursday after video footage showed that he never went inside the building to engage the shooter.

""He never went in,"" Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference Thursday. ""Devastated. Sick to my stomach"" is how Israel described how he felt when he learned the school resource officer didn't engage the shooter. ""There are no words. I mean, these families lost their children.""

The idea of arming teachers, while pushed by the NRA, is opposed by the nation's largest teachers union. In a statement, National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen Garcia said:

""Bringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms. Parents and educators overwhelmingly reject the idea of arming school staff. Educators need to be focused on teaching our students. We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that.""

Trump on Thursday also expressed doubts about active shooter drills in schools, calling them ""a very negative thing,"" ""crazy"" and ""very bad.""

""I'll be honest with you,"" Trump said. ""If I'm a child, I'm 10 years old, and they say, 'We're going to have an active shooter drill,' I say, 'What's that?' 'Well, people may come in and shoot you.' I think that's a very negative thing to be talking about, to be honest with you. I don't like it. I'd much rather have a hardened school.""

The president said unless a school has ""offensive capability, you're wasting your time, you're wasting your time.""

The president also shifted blame from guns to violent movies and video games. They are ""really shaping young people's thoughts,"" Trump contended, reminding of the national debate after Columbine in 1999. The shooters at Columbine listened to the music of rocker Marilyn Manson, popular with high-schoolers all over the country at the time.

""The Columbine era destroyed my entire career at the time,"" Manson told The Guardian this past September.

Trump claimed Thursday, ""You see these movies, and they're so violent and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn't involved.""

He then called for a ratings system, something that has long existed for movies and video games.

Two survivors of the Stoneman Douglas shooting disputed the president's logic.

""My friends and I have been playing video games our whole lives, and seen, of course, violent movies,"" Samuel Zeif told CNN, ""but never have we ever felt driven or provoked by those action in those games to do something as horrible as this.""

Chris Grady called the presidents' comments ""a pathetic excuse.""

""I grew up playing video games,"" Grady said, citing Call of Duty and other first-person shooter games. ""I would never, ever dream of taking the lives of any of my peers.

""So it's just pathetic."""

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Could the reaction to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., actually result in some changes to gun laws? President Trump has come out in favor of arming teachers, banning bump stocks, raising the age to be able to purchase guns and tougher background checks. But what's the status of existing gun regulations? What has changed since Mr. Trump has become president?

We're going to turn now to James Burnett. He's editorial director of The Trace, a nonprofit news organization that reports on guns in America. He joins us from member station WVTF in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Burnett, thanks for being with us.

JAMES BURNETT: Thanks for having me on, Scott.

SIMON: Let's begin with the idea to raise the age to be able to purchase an assault weapon. What's the law now?

BURNETT: The law now differs whether the gun being purchased is a handgun or what is broadly defined as a long gun. So the law is that if it's a handgun, you need to be 21. But long guns - rifles, shotguns and assault-style rifles included - that's 18. And after Parkland, where the perpetrator was 19 and legally purchased an assault-style rifle, there has been a call to raise that minimum age for assault-style rifles and all long guns.

SIMON: What about arming teachers? What changes to the law would be required?

BURNETT: That gets complex. We do have the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which was signed with the first President Bush. But it allows for some discretion at the state and local level. And some states allow individual districts to set their own policies. And so we at The Trace of reported on districts in Ohio that allow certain designated teachers and other school staff members to access guns. Texas is another state where that happens. So, in fact, there are some states where there are guns in schools accessible to some teachers and staff members.

SIMON: Have there been gun laws that have been rolled back by the Trump administration?

BURNETT: The big picture under Trump is that not much has changed, which is interesting because Trump had such strong backing from the National Rifle Association. And they have two big priorities. One is something called concealed carry reciprocity. And the upshot is that if you have a license to carry a concealed gun in your home state, every other state would have to honor that license and vice versa. That does pass the House in December - not taken up by the Senate.

And the other one is silencers or suppressors - a push to deregulate those devices. And that hasn't gone through. So the big ticket items that the NRA wants the NRA doesn't get. You mentioned at the top there this idea of strengthening background checks. I think it's important to be specific about what's under discussion there. There is bipartisan legislation. And what it would do would provide grants to the states to make sure that all of the records that show that a person is prohibited from owning a gun get into the databases that are scanned during a background check.

SIMON: Mr. Burnett, there's renewed interest on the sale of assault weapons. A ban went into effect in 1994. It expired 10 years later. Based on your reporting, what effect did that ban have?

BURNETT: There is some evidence - and we talk about assault - bans on assault-style weapons. What a lot of public safety experts say is the most meaningful piece of that is a restriction on how large the magazine - the ammunition magazine - that's basically how many rounds the gun can hold at one time, can be fired at one time before you have to reload.

SIMON: Is there, in your mind, compelling evidence that the ban on assault weapons actually succeeded in banning assault weapons or reduced the supply or use of assault weapons and criminal activity?

BURNETT: I think the evidence on that is mixed. There is some evidence that fewer assault-style rifles were used in rampage shootings during that 10-year period. So if your goal is to reduce the use of assault-style rifles in school shootings, mass shootings, other forms of rampage attacks, there's some data or evidence that says yes. But it's a pretty small sample. If you're talking about reducing all forms of gun death and injury, you'd have to look more seriously at handguns because in the sheer quantity, that's the gun used in most shootings.

SIMON: James Burnett, editorial director of The Trace, thanks so much for being with us.

BURNETT: Thank you.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl about the narrow point of intersection between the worlds of mental illness and gun violence. He says there's not much more the mental health field can do to prevent potential mass shooters, since the best predictive factors fall out of the scope of the medical field.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Lawmakers are trying to decide what they can do now to prevent future mass shootings from happening. And one phrase that keeps coming up again and again is mental health.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LINDSEY GRAHAM: What I want to look at is the mental health science.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PAUL RYAN: Do we have the kind of mental health laws that we need on the books?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN CORNYN: ...Whether mental health officials could have done more.

CHANG: That's all from this week, all from Republican lawmakers - Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John Cornyn of Texas. We're now going to turn to Jonathan Metzl. He is a psychiatrist and professor at Vanderbilt University. Welcome.

JONATHAN METZL: Thanks so much for having me.

CHANG: First of all, I know that you take issue with this call from politicians that mental health professionals like you need to step up and help prevent gun violence. Why do you think that's the wrong way to approach this?

METZL: Well, certainly we should all do everything we can to prevent gun violence, and I think that mental health expertise is an important part of the conversation. But the reason that I and other people in my position write against this is first of all because people with mental illness are not a particularly high-risk group for gun violence or for mass shootings.

There's no psychiatric diagnosis that's aligned with harming other people, let alone shooting people. And the diagnoses that get thrown around in the aftermath of these horrible crimes like schizophrenia or depression, other factors like that, themselves are not aligned with violent attacks toward other people. And in that regard, there also are no tools that psychiatrists can use to say this one person with mental illness is going to harm somebody else, and this other person is not.

And I guess the last reason is that, as we're seeing after the horrible mass shooting in Florida, many mass shooters don't meet the criteria for severe mental illness in any way that would cause them to be flagged on a background check system, let alone hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.

CHANG: How much interaction is there between mental health professionals like you and the background check system?

METZL: Well, the only way that someone can get their name on the federal background check system from the perspective of mental illness is either to be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital or if a court or government body declares a person mentally incompetent. And this is a very small sliver of patients who psychiatrists see.

First of all, the bar for admitting someone to a psychiatric hospital is quite high and particularly if that person is being admitted against their wishes. And even then, most people are released within a 72-hour period so don't meet the criteria for the background check system where a judge decides that they have to stay in for a longer period of time.

And even after that, if their name is entered into a background check system, people can buy guns at gun shows - there are many different loopholes - or just borrow guns from family members. And so in this sense, it's a very inexact science and unfortunately not a very effective one at this point.

CHANG: After a mass shooting happens, it's easy to conclude that the person who committed mass murder is a mentally troubled person. But there are all these social and environmental factors going on in that person's life. Not everything rises to the level of a diagnosable, treatable disease. So it places you in this precarious position where you have to be predictive when it's a mushy assessment.

METZL: It's a very mushy assessment. That's - I think that's really the key take-home point - is that psychiatric diagnosis is itself not a predictive science. In other words, there's nothing in psychiatric diagnosis that's going to tell you how somebody is going to act in one week or one year. And in that sense, putting psychiatrists in the position of having to predict something in the future is really at odds with their expertise.

CHANG: So if it is so difficult to be predictive, how do mental health professionals get involved in this conversation about curbing gun violence?

METZL: Psychiatrists are really good at looking at broader societal factors that look at prevention - in other words, what kinds of people or communities are at high risk across the board. For example, we know that if there is an interpersonal altercation and people are inebriated, there's alcohol present and there's a gun lying nearby, that that altercation is more likely to end in some kind of shooting. And so why is it that we have policies that allow people to carry loaded handguns into bars in many states?

We also know that gun violence happens within social networks. For instance, you're much more likely to be shot by your neighbor, your cousin, your boyfriend, your partner than you are by some random stranger. And so we should also track gun violence within social networks. These are all societal factors that are not linked directly to mental illness diagnosis.

CHANG: So what it sounds like is the legislative options about mental health are limited.

METZL: I think they don't pay attention to trends that we know happen in gun violence in the society. This is not to say that mental health expertise isn't an important part of the conversation, but it's just one piece of the broader conversation about what our society should do to, on one hand, respect people's rights and, on the other hand, create safer society.

CHANG: All right, that's Jonathan Metzl. He's a psychiatrist who directs the Vanderbilt University Center for Medicine, Health and Society. Thank you very much.

METZL: Thanks so much.

Congress returns this week for the first time since a shooter killed 17 people inside a Florida high school. Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA who has written extensively about gun regulations, joins NPR's Ailsa Chang to talk about various proposals to regulate access to guns — and what impact those policies could have on preventing mass shootings.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

What laws will come out of all the gun control activism on display by Marjory Stoneman Douglas students? That's a big question as Congress reconvenes for the first time since the deadly Florida school shooting. The students are organized, and they have demands.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We want assault rifles off the market.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We just need age restrictions and higher checks when people are trying to purchase these weapons.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: There is no place in our society for large-capacity magazines capable...

CHANG: But a major argument often heard on the other side is that most of the proposals gun control advocates push for would be ineffective in preventing mass shootings. To run through various proposals and assess their impact, we're going to turn to Adam Winkler. He's a law professor at UCLA who's written extensively on gun control. Welcome.

ADAM WINKLER: Thank you so much for having me.

CHANG: So we should first mention that in assessing the impact of various gun proposals, there isn't a lot of data out there.

WINKLER: That's right. The NRA and its allies have pushed laws that restrict the ability of federal agencies to finance gun violence prevention research. But it's also a difficult problem because there are so many guns, and figuring out exactly what causes crime has bedeviled researchers for ages. So it's very difficult to know whether one particular reform will have a huge impact on gun violence.

CHANG: That said, I want to look a little more closely at various proposals that have been offered up time and time again. I want to start with something President Trump has talked a lot about in recent days, and that is raising the minimum age to buy a rifle.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18.

CHANG: Do you think that this is actually an effective proposal?

WINKLER: Federal law has traditionally prohibited 18- to 21-year-olds from buying handguns but not rifles with the idea being that rifles are traditionally hunting weapons. In recent years, the rifles have changed. They're more likely to be military-style assault rifles. At the same time, we should remember that raising the gun age won't stop someone like an Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter, from getting a gun because he just stole it from his mother.

CHANG: A federal assault weapons ban was in place for a decade from 1994 to 2004. It had been pushed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. She tried to revive it again after Newtown.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DIANNE FEINSTEIN: The weapons I talk about can fire hundreds of rounds a minute with velocities and energy far exceeding the standard handguns. They don't belong on the streets.

CHANG: There have been some studies about whether that 10-year ban reduced gun violence. Were those studies at all conclusive?

WINKLER: It's very difficult to make conclusive studies on this. The only one study that really looked at the effect of the assault weapons ban found that these weapons were found less frequently at crime scenes. But the authors cautioned that it was likely that they just replaced those weapons with handguns or other kinds of rifles. About half or more of the mass shootings are committed with a handgun.

CHANG: Right.

WINKLER: It's not clear that you take an assault weapon out of a shooter's hands, that they're not going to commit this killing.

CHANG: A proposal that's often paired with a possible assault weapons ban is a proposal that would limit high-capacity magazines. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida made some news last week.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARCO RUBIO: Because I traditionally have not supported looking at magazine clip size. And after this and some of the details I've learned about it, I'm reconsidering that position, and I'll tell you why.

(APPLAUSE)

RUBIO: I'll tell you why - because while it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack.

CHANG: Is that a proposal where we might actually see some overlap between the gun control and gun rights sides of the debate? Or is Rubio kind of out on a limb there?

WINKLER: I'd be very surprised if gun control forces could get a federal law banning high-capacity magazines. These magazines are incredibly common. They're standard issue in most handguns that are purchased today, also very common in rifles. It is a reform that does target the lethality of the weapon, how many rounds of ammunition a particular weapon can carry before it has to be reloaded.

The difficult thing is that California, for instance, has banned the possession of high-capacity magazines. But initial reports from law enforcement were that virtually no one has turned theirs in even though there's probably somewhere between 7 and 10 million high-capacity magazines in California.

CHANG: A huge part of the discussion going forward in these weeks after Parkland is going to be about universal background checks. The main argument on the gun rights side about background checks is that it's the database that's the problem - has too many holes. There are people who have domestic violence records who don't show up. There are people with interactions with law enforcement who don't show up.

WINKLER: That's right. The federal background check system is riddled with holes. For instance, Dylann Roof, the Charleston church shooter, was able to buy a gun despite the fact that he had previously admitted to gun possession and should have been flagged in the background check system. So we need better reporting into the background check system. But we also need to expand the background check system to cover gun shows and Internet sales and classified ad sales.

CHANG: I'm curious. What percentage of gun sales happen that way?

WINKLER: Estimates range from 13 percent to 40 percent. But even if it was just 13 percent...

CHANG: Yeah.

WINKLER: ...That's about 3 million guns a year that are being sold in America without a background check.

CHANG: Finally, I want to talk about banning bump stocks. This idea gathered traction after the shootings in Las Vegas.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: To modify his weapons and fire so many bullets and cause so much carnage in such a short amount of time.

CHANG: Does this feel like a proposal that's just kind of low-hanging fruit for lawmakers right now?

WINKLER: Indeed, banning bump stocks does seem like low-hanging fruit. Even the NRA has come out in favor of at least ATF regulations that would ban bump stocks. And while most mass shootings do not involve bump stocks, if you can even stop one or two mass shootings from using them, you could have a big impact.

CHANG: You know, as we're talking here, I'm reminded of sort of the ultimate argument often heard on the gun rights side, and that is, someone who is intent on murdering a lot of people can easily circumvent the law no matter what laws are passed. You've studied this for a very long time. What's your take? Is it still worth it to try to come up with legislative solutions?

WINKLER: It is true that in a nation that has 350 million guns in civilian hands, it's going to be hard to stop that one person who's really determined to kill. At the same time, we can do more to bring down the daily death toll from gun violence. Since the 17 people died in the Parkland shooting, we've seen hundreds of Americans lose their lives to gun violence. The best thing we can do to reduce the daily death toll of gun violence is universal background checks. Make it harder for a criminal or someone who's mentally ill to get their hands on guns.

CHANG: All right, Adam Winkler is a law professor at UCLA. Thank you very much.

WINKLER: Thank you so much.

msnbc7,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-republican-connects-gun-control-nazi-holocaust,"Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) has an unfortunate track record of making cringe-worthy comments. The most striking example that comes to mind was a story from four years ago when the Republican congressman spoke at an Alaskan high school, less than a week after a student had committed suicide.

Young proceeded to use “salty language,” told a story “that involved flying to Paris to get drunk,” compared marriage equality to “bull sex,” and said the boy who committed suicide must have lacked support from his friends and family. Asked to explain himself after the appearance, the GOP lawmaker added that welfare may have also led to the student’s death.

But as offensive as that was, Young may have topped himself.

Jewish people would have been able to fend off the Nazis if not for gun-control laws imposed by the Third Reich, Rep. Don Young, a Republican from Alaska, argued last week. “How many millions were shot and killed because they were unarmed?” Young asked at an event in Juneau, Alaska, before answering his own question. “Fifty million in Russia because their citizens were unarmed. How many Jews were put into the ovens because they were unarmed?”

If this seems at all familiar, it’s probably because Young isn’t the first Republican to suggest gun control contributed to the Nazi Holocaust. During his presidential campaign in 2015, Ben Carson argued, “]T]he likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.”

Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, explained at the time that Carson “has a right to his views on gun control, but the notion that Hitler’s gun-control policy contributed to the Holocaust is historically inaccurate.” Greenblatt added that “gun control did not cause the Holocaust.”

This isn’t especially complicated: the Nazis had a vast war machine. To believe Jews in Europe could’ve prevented the Holocaust with pistols and hunting rifles is madness.

Indeed, this whole idea that an armed populace is a free populace is belied by reality. Plenty of modern democracies, for example, have created all kinds of restrictions on consumer access to firearms, and none of them have slipped into dictatorial dystopias.

Iraq under Saddam Hussein’s rule, on the other hand, had one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world – but it didn’t stop Iraqis from living under tyranny.

I understand that many Republicans oppose new gun reforms, but perhaps they can leave the Holocaust out of their talking points?

Postscript: In response to the controversy over his remarks, Don Young’s office issued a written statement that said, “He was not implying that an armed Jewish population would have been able to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust.” One sentence later, that same statement added, “A defenseless people are left up to the mercy of its leaders.”"
msnbc8,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-plan-keep-restrictions-gun-research-place,"The day after the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a longtime opponent of new gun measures, said Congress needs to “take a breath and collect the facts.” The Republican leader added, “We don’t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.”

At face value, that seemed like an entirely sensible approach. After all, who could be against collecting facts and data before engaging in policymaking?

The trouble, of course, is that there’s already a federal restriction in place to prevent officials from collecting facts and data – and Politico reports today that congressional Republicans intend to leave it in place, despite recent developments.

Republicans are intent on preserving the so-called Dickey amendment, which prohibits the CDC from advocating on gun control, POLITICO’s Jennifer Haberkorn reports. […] Opponents say the Dickey amendment has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun deaths. But Republicans say they don’t want to add additional controversy to the upcoming spending bills by eliminating it.

I don’t imagine most Americans have heard of the Dickey amendment, but it’s an important policy. As Vox explained this week, “Congress has made it effectively impossible for federally funded researchers to study gun violence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health are the gold standards for public health research in the United States. But they are effectively barred from studying a problem that kills more than 35,000 people in a year.”

Let’s back up and review the context to all of this. The Washington Post reported last fall:

[O]ne reason the positions are so intractable is that no one really knows what works to prevent gun deaths. Gun-control research in the United States essentially came to a standstill in 1996. After 21 years, the science is stale. “In the area of what works to prevent shootings, we know almost nothing,” Mark Rosenberg, who, in the mid-1990s, led the CDC’s gun-violence research efforts, said shortly after the San Bernardino shooting in 2015. In 1996, the Republican-majority Congress threatened to strip funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unless it stopped funding research into firearm injuries and deaths. The National Rifle Association accused the CDC of promoting gun control. As a result, the CDC stopped funding gun-control research – which had a chilling effect far beyond the agency, drying up money for almost all public health studies of the issue nationwide.

As regular readers may recall, it’s common knowledge that the NRA and its allies have fought to kill any kind of restrictions on firearm ownership. What’s less recognized is the fact that the gun lobby also helped block basic data collection, to the point that there’s “no current scientific consensus about guns and violence,” in large part because the NRA “has been able to neutralize empirical cases for control.”

Nearly 20 years after this policy took effect, the principal author of that policy, Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey, conceded that he has “regrets” over the policy that came to be known as the Dickey Amendment.

But the policy remains in place anyway.

There’s been some chatter lately about possible limits of the Dickey policy. Alex Azar, Donald Trump’s new Secretary of Health and Human Services, suggested his agency may be able to do some research on guns and public health, current restrictions notwithstanding.

Those comments have led GOP lawmakers to believe they can turn their attention elsewhere and leave the Dickey amendment in place, presumably indefinitely. What’s unclear, however, is how far HHS can go and whether new legislation is necessary.

Watch this space.

Postscript: It’s worth emphasizing that there is some private research on guns and public health, including a new report from the Rand Corp. which was just released. The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent had a good piece this morning on the latest findings."

msnbc11,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/was-gun-used-crime,"On Sunday in New Orleans, Laderika Smith, 28, returned from the store to find her five-year-old daughter bloodied and lying on the bedroom floor with a gunshot wound to her head. The girl soon died. Her mother has been charged with Relative Cruelty to a Juvenile. She has not yet entered a plea.

“It is all too common,” Doctor Gary A. Smith, president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance, told msnbc. “Children are curious. They watch TV cartoons and a make-believe world,” he added. When kids see guns, “they don’t recognize the danger.”

Smith’s daughter fatally shot herself with a .38 revolver that her mother kept in the home, as Smith admitted to New Orleans police. For decades, a .38 revolver was the firearm most commonly used in crimes, according to ATF studies including a July 2000 report, which is the last time that the ATF issued any comprehensive report. Instead, for more than 12 years– since the first inauguration of President George W. Bush in 2001–the ATF has provided little or no such national data to the public.

“Why was it stopped for over 10 years?” ATF Acting Deputy Chief of Public Affairs Donna Sellers told msnbc. “I cannot really answer why a decision was made to stop publishing that information,” she added. “The decision was made this year to increase transparency and provide the public with more thorough information on crime guns.”

On June 19, the ATF published its findings for Firearms Trace Data for 2012. Data for previous years posted on the ATF website’s statistics page include no more than very general information for each state along with the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands, making in difficult to discern national trends of the types of firearms used in crimes, or where they were bought.

The data for 2012 includes nationally aggregated summaries including “Firearms Types” and “Top Calibers” of weapons “Recovered and Traced” in crimes, along with data on where the weapons used in crimes were purchased and where they ended up, and how long they have been in circulation.

“Tracing crime guns provides critical information that assists domestic and international law enforcement,” Sellers told msnbc.

Most “crime guns,” as ATF officials call them, end up in circulation for just over 11 years. Another trend that emerges from the data is that a .38 caliber handgun has become only the fifth most common caliber of firearm used in crimes (19,425) in 2012, after the 9 millimeter (42,560) of roughly the same size, the smaller .22 caliber handgun (34,130) long ago dubbed as a “Saturday night special,” and the far more powerful .40 caliber handgun (20,674), and the 12-gauge shotgun (20,606), according to ATF statistics now available online.

The ATF’s change to release firearms tracing information is consistent with White House policies since the Newtown tragedy. In January, President Obama signed a 23-point gun control order involving various U.S. agencies to expand their reporting and other activities involving firearms and violence.

Another new trend is that pistols were the most common type of weapon used in crimes in 2012, consistent with the rising use of 9 millimeter handguns in crimes (the overwhelming majority of which are pistols), and the increasingly commercial popularity of 9 millimeter pistols like Austrian-made Glock. U.S. authorities seized a total of 119,273 pistols and 46,037 revolvers from crime scenes in 2012, according to ATF figures published last week.

The common reason given by authorities for seizing firearms from suspects was for illegal possession of a weapon at 61,501 cases, the ATF statistics show. A total of 17,239 firearms were seized for an offense involving a weapon. The average age of the suspect from which a firearm was seized was lowest in the two U.S. territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands at 28, and the District of Columbia at 29, and highest in South Dakota at 45, and Hawaii at 47.

But the flow of firearms across state lines may be the most important statistic to emerge at a time when Congress is continuing to discuss the possibility of increased gun regulations including anti-trafficking legislation. Some states supplied a great many guns used in crimes across the nation. West Virginia was the source of 1,330 crime guns in 2012, nearly half of which were used in crimes in other states.

Other states supplied few guns but ended up being the place where many guns were used in crimes. New York supplied 2,153 guns used in crimes across the nation, and ended up having more than twice as many firearms, 4,850, recovered in crimes inside the state."
msnbc12,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/army-veteran-its-time-vets-speak-about-guns,"Every member of the United States military swears an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For most service members, that oath doesn’t expire when they take off their uniforms and become veterans. Army veteran Christopher Mintz demonstrated as much last month when he charged—unarmed—toward a gunman at an Oregon community college. However, Mintz’s laudable actions overshadowed the story of a different veteran also on campus that day.

John Parker, an Air Force veteran, was in another location on the Umpqua campus when he learned of the active shooter. Parker was carrying a concealed firearm but chose to not engage the shooter. Parker later explained that “not knowing where SWAT was on their response time, they wouldn’t know who we were, and if we had our guns ready to shoot, they’d think we were the bad guys.”

Firearms have the ability to take life, and in the military we take that seriously. Unfortunately, many of our lawmakers don’t.

The discipline Parker exercised didn’t come part and parcel with being a gun owner. Rather, Parker did the right thing because of his military training. Like every member of the military, Parker was trained on how to properly carry, clear, disassemble, clean, reassemble, load, aim, discharge, and safely store any firearm for which he was accountable. Because of his tactical training, Parker knew that, oftentimes, proper use of a firearm means not shooting.

The military asks this much of anyone allowed to possess a firearm, because firearms are lethal. Firearms have the ability to take life, and in the military we take that seriously. Unfortunately, many of our lawmakers don’t, and it’s time that veterans step forward and have our voices heard on the matter.

I too swore an oath to defend this country. Now, I am asking my fellow veterans help protect our citizens against firearm-related fatalities and injuries. Veterans – especially those who are gun owners – must speak up. Veterans must speak as voters, advocates, safety trainers, and examples of responsible gun owners. When it comes to firearms, people trust us because we’ve been trained extensively on how to use a lethal weapon responsibly.

Veterans should think back on how much training it took to earn the right to carry a weapon in the military. We should at least promote similar common-sense measures for the people who are allowed to carry guns in the neighborhoods where our kids play. Veterans know what common sense gun laws are, because they look a lot like the rules we used in the military to keep ourselves safe.

In the military, weapons do not get lost or stolen. Losing track of your weapon in an unthinkable scenario with consequences to match. As veterans, we need to tell lawmakers to make sure all that gun owners maintain accountability or face consequences for lost guns.

More Americans have been killed by firearms in the last half century than all fatalities in all of our country’s wars, combined. If veterans are not holding all gun owners to some of the basic gun safety standards that we learned in the military, then we are failing to uphold our oath. Many of us fought for our country overseas; now veterans have a chance to speak up and start fighting to save lives here at home.

msnbc13,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/look-back-gun-control-history,"In 1994, the Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. The key factor in the major Democratic loss pointed to the federal assault weapons ban that was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994. A part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the assault weapons ban banned semiautomatic weapons from having two or more military features, and placed a ten-year ban on the sale of assault weapons and large ammunition magazines. The ‘94 election was significant because gun control became a deciding factor in the election and wedged two ideologically distant parties further apart.

In 2004, a report to the U.S. Justice Department that assessed the impact of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban on gun markets and gun violence found that “… the most important feature of military-style weapons may be their ability to accept [large-capacity magazines], and this feature has been addressed by the LCM ban and the LCMM rifle ban. Whether changing other features of military-style firearms will produce measurable benefits is unknown.”

Earlier this week, President Obama and the House Democratic Caucus vowed to reduce gun violence by focusing on the following four areas–closing background check loopholes, banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, providing schools with safety resources, and increasing access to mental health services. But the history of gun legislation has shown that one bill does not prevent another massacre from occurring and fuels a recurring pattern.

After a mass shooting, political leaders call for action, then introduce bills that drag out legislative battles, and a law riddled with loopholes finally gets signed. But manufacturers have found ways around even those laws that are deemed legislative milestones: fter the law defined what an assault weapon was, manufacturing companies came up with modified designs and built weapons that became somewhat mainstream. Because the assault weapons ban did not outlaw the sale of semiautomatic rifles and handguns that had been manufactured before 1994, the country quickly discovered that the ban wasn’t all that effective.

For example, Connecticut’s assault weapons ban allowed the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle Nancy Lanza purchased and kept in her home, easily accessible to her unstable son. He used the gun to shoot 20 children and six educators dead. The state ban was modeled after the 1994 federal assault weapons ban.

Mother Jones researched the gun violence of the past 30 years and found that since 1982, there have been at least 62 mass shootings. Twenty-five of these shootings occurred since 2006, and seven took place in 2012. What’s striking is that most of the killers obtained their guns legally.

Generally, the gun control versus the gun rights debate exists focuses on an individual’s right to bear arms and the government’s obligation to counter violence and crime. The wording of the Second Amendment–specifically “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”–seems unambiguous but in fact the interpretation of the law has evolved.

In the 18th and 19th century, armed civilians used guns as a means of survival and protection from foreign enemies. As westward expansion occurred, frontiersman used guns to arm themselves against Native Americans and potential threats in the uncharted territories. Then in 1927, Congress outlawed the mail-order sale of guns or concealed firearms after mob violence broke out from Prohibition. However, mob violence escalated so quickly with the usage of Tommy guns in gang wars that Congress passed the National Firearms Act of 1934, which taxed firearms under 18 inches and on machine guns and required gun registration. This act became the first federal gun-control law.

President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination spurred leaders to pass the Gun Control Act of 1968. This act prohibited the sale of guns to convicted felons, drug users and the mentally ill, and also required firearm dealers to obtain licenses and imposed interstate sale restrictions. The law also raised the age to legally purchase a handgun to 21.

Although the ATF was granted expanded power, the NRA became increasingly agitated, prompting the gun lobby to create a new lobbying branch, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which aimed to nullify the 1968 law. In 1986, President Reagan signed the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act which eased the penalties from the 1968 law, banned a federal registry of gun owners, and disallowed the ATF’s power to inspect gun dealers.

But the gun culture changed again in 1981 when John Hinckley, Jr. tried to assassinate President Reagan and nearly killed his press secretary James Brady instead. He and his wife Sarah became activists. “You can begin to see a sea change of attitudes during this time,” said Sarah Brady. “The NRA was fighting against the cop-killing bullets and plastic guns, and we got into an alliance with law enforcement and we just got together and said, ‘What’s the first thing we should do?’ And we all said, ‘Background checks.’”

In 1991, Ronald Reagan said at a ceremony at George Washington University: “I want to tell all of you here today something that I’m not sure you know. You do know that I’m a member of the NRA. My position on right to bear arms is well known. But I want you to know something else. And I’m going to say it in clear unmistakable language. I support the Brady bill and I urge the Congress to enact it.”

The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed in 1993. This law created a system for background checks of licensed gun buyers, which was maintained by the FBI.

Although this national system prevented convicted criminals and potentially violent people from purchasing handguns, a loophole existed. The 1993 act did not cover private sales from one individual to another. In 1993, 57% of people surveyed by the Pew Research Center said that controlling gun ownership was more important than protecting gun rights; in 2012, the percentage went down to 47%.

In 2004, President George W. Bush said, “I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don’t get in the hands of people that shouldn’t have them.”

Ten years earlier, his father wrote a letter to the NRA just two weeks after the Oklahoma City bombing, resigning as a life member of the NRA. And while Ronald Reagan was the Governor of California, he stated his view on guns in May of 1967 when Black Panther Party members walked into the California Statehouse carrying rifles to protest a gun-control bill. “There’s no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons.”

Former Nixon speechwriter, William Safire, wrote in 1999 how Nixon felt about gun control. “His on-the-record reply: ”Guns are an abomination.’ Free from fear of gun owners’ retaliation at the polls, he favored making handguns illegal and requiring licenses for hunting rifles.”

Now, with the recent Newtown shootings, the issue of gun control and gun rights has returned to national prominence. Americans purchased a record number of guns in 2012 and gun makers have reported a record high in demand. Firearm sales have surged recently as politicians have urged stricter gun laws and a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban following the shooting in Connecticut.

TIME published a list of the worst mass shootings in the last 50 years, excluding Newtown; 15 of the 25 worst mass shootings took place in the United States. Recent research from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center linked guns and homicide and found evidence that shows that more guns means more homicides. Internationally, America is a much more violent country, as Duke University’s Kieran Healy points out in this graph.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicates that 56% believe that the laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter, as opposed to 42% who believe laws should be less strict or kept the same. This 56% number is the highest since 2006, but is still less than the 60-70% who supported stricter laws during the 1990s, including when the federal assault weapons ban was enacted in 1994. Additionally, 69% said that being able to purchase assault and military style firearms played “a good or great role in recent mass shootings”; 38% said it played little to no role. Lastly, 59% said that the availability of high capacity ammunition clips played a good or great role and 39% said it played little to no role.

The poll presents an even larger divide between Republicans and Democrats. The Republican House seems unlikely to budge on gun control, but perhaps a reminder of the Nixon-Reagan-Bush stances on gun control could prove useful."

msnbc17,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-ed-show/new-gun-laws-kentucky-surprise-just-about,"Months before the murders of 20 first graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied the Kentucky legislature to pass one of the most liberal gun laws in the nation. Only 10 lawmakers in both houses voted against the bill last summer and it quietly took effect at the beginning of this year. In fact, the law took effect so quietly it took transportation officials, security guards and firefighters by surprise.

One of the best investigative reporters I’ve ever worked with, Duane Pohlman, has put together a series of stories for WLKY/Hearst about how this new gun legislation has turned Kentucky into what one lawmaker called the “new wild west”. They’re worth watching. For instance, people can bring guns, but not knives into Louisville’s City Hall.

Guns are legal on public buses, according to the state lawmaker who wrote it, though transportation officials have decided to enforce a gun ban anyway.

Firefighters in special districts are given extra rights to carry concealed weapons. Duane talked to one fire chief who explains why that could be seriously dangerous. EMTs can carry too.

I asked Duane a few questions about the law and his reports:

Ed Show: What inspired you to investigate the change in the gun law? Anything beyond fully reporting on the basic change in the law? Duane Pohlman: It wasn’t much to investigate the law and its effect, but getting clear answers was difficult. The law was overwhelmingly and quietly passed by the Kentucky legislature in the Summer of ’12, with backing from the NRA. It was so quiet that many of the public officials and entities were caught off guard when it took effect this January. I received several calls from fire chiefs and mid-level managers who were in disbelief when they were informed. They called me to get some answers. That led to this simple series of stories laying out the law and its impacts. Ed Show: I was surprised that the guard in your first story wasn’t armed with a gun, that knives were not allowed, and that one fire chief is worried about guns on his own crew. What, if anything, surprised you about the response to the law change? Duane Pohlman: Everything! I could not believe this had passed and passed so overwhelmingly (only 10 votes opposed in both houses). I was surprised that Kentucky’s constitution provided more protections than the US Constitution, allowing guns to be carried for personal and property protection. I was surprised by the lack of caring about allowing open guns in urban areas. Above all, I was stunned by the lack of media attention to this issue, which I believe led to it quietly being passed. Ed Show: You reported that public transportation does not allow concealed-carry. If some organizations make exceptions to Kentucky’s law, does it become hard for regular citizens to figure out where they can and cannot carry? Duane Pohlman: It will be hard for citizens to know where they can bring their guns because, frankly, the political leaders are still scurrying for answers. For instance, TARC, the mass transit system in Louisville, is continuing its ban on guns on its buses, though the Executive Director tells me TARC leaders are still researching the legal ramifications of continuing the ban. In addition, I have been told by other leaders they truly don’t know how it applies in places where public gatherings occur. About the only places guaranteed (for now) not to be gun free zones in Kentucky are schools, colleges and universities, and prisons. Again, many of the leaders say they were simply caught off guard when the law took effect and are still sorting it all out. The author of Kentucky’s new gun law, State Rep. Bob Damron, D-Nicholasville, makes it clear. “ I feel more comfortable when citizens have a weapon to protect themselves because, chances are, they’ll protect me as well,” he told me. Fact is many, many people in this part of the country (and other parts) agree.



Kentucky is clearly out-pacing the rest of the nation in allowing citizens to carry guns in public places. The question is, will other states follow?"
msnbc18,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/free-guns-vulnerable-women-houston,"One Texas group wants to stop violence against women–by giving away free guns.

While the national debate over gun control rages on, the nonprofit Armed Citizen Project has begun training and arming single women and single moms with pump action shotguns. On its website, the group describes itself as “dedicated to training and arming vulnerable women” and “fighting the war on women, one free shotgun at a time.” The group is also geared toward providing residents of high-crime neighborhoods with firearms at no cost as long as they complete a 4-to-5 hour firearms class and pass a background check.

“We’re empowering citizens and creating new and responsible gun owners,” Kyle Coplen, the group’s 29-year-old founder, told msnbc on Monday. “Criminals have no intention of dying in your hallway. We think that society should use their fear to deter crime.” An early 2013 visit to the vandalized home of a World War II vet inspired Coplen to create the project, he says.

Armed Citizen Project started equipping Houston-area women with free firearms in March, then rolled out phase two, centered around the city’s Oak Forest neighborhood, in early May. It appears to be a relatively small operation at this stage–they have given away only 35 guns to date–but it’s a message that may resonate despite studies to the contrary.

Coplen argues that guns help protect citizens from potentially dangerous home invaders–an aspect that appeals to women who tend to be physically smaller than the stereotypical burly male robber. “Generally, women who live alone have reached out to us for a reason,” he said. “Having a firearm in the home is a forced equalizer.”

However, a recent study conducted by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center suggested women are in fact less safe with guns in the home. It found that women living in states with more accessibility to guns are at a greater risk for violent death via “unintentional gun deaths, suicides and homicide, particularly firearm suicides and firearm homicides.”

A 2003 study from the University of Pennsylvania indicated that a woman with a gun in her home was nearly three times more likely to be murdered compared to a woman without a gun in the home.

Coplen said the reaction from the community has been “overwhelmingly positive,” especially from law enforcement officials in Texas. Not that that matters, he added: “I really have no interest from hearing elected officials on this.”

Houston City Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who represents Oak Forest, does not see the increased distribution of guns as an effective tool to prevent gun crime. “Statistics show that guns are more likely to be involved in an unintentional shooting than in a self-defense shooting,” said Cohen in an emailed statement to msnbc. “That being said, while I support the Second Amendment, I think we should focus on common-sense solutions such as universal background checks.”

Cohen said her offices received several concerned calls about the program. The group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense requested a formal meeting with her.

msnbc reached out to Houston Mayor Annise Parker’s office for a comment, but received no response.

Before launching in Houston, Coplen and his team pored over crime stats to pick a neighborhood and reached out to community members with an old-fashioned, snail mail postcard–a model they hope to replicate elsewhere.

The Armed Citizen Project has ambitious plans to expand into other cities soon: Tucson, Dallas, San Antonio, Indianapolis Detroit, Chicago, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Atlanta."

msnbc24,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/lindsey-graham-his-ar-15-and-the-rodney-kin,"Lawless behavior in the wake of the Rodney King riots—including “marauding gangs” that were “raping” the women of Koreatown—justifies the need for an AR-15 assault rifle in your home arsenal, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham.

The South Carolina Republican delivered that assertion, during Wednesday’s Senate judiciary committee hearing on gun violence in America while challenging the notion Congress should regulate the size of firearm magazines.

Graham cited a question that came during the Google Hangout his “good friend” and vice president Joe Biden held last week on the topic of guns. “What if there’s an earthquake out here and there’s a lawless situation,” Graham said, inaccurately paraphrasing the question from video blogger Philip DeFranco.

Graham then invoked the six days of racially charged rioting that followed the Rodney King verdict and resulted in 53 deaths, thousands of arrests, and ultimately a military presence on the streets to restore calm.

“In 1992 you had the riots in Los Angeles, I think it was the King event, but you could find yourself in this country in a lawless environment through a natural disaster or a riot,” Graham said, making his own jump from earthquake to race riot.

“And the story was about a place called Koreatown,” the Senator said. “There were marauding gangs going through the area, burning stores, looting and robbing,” he continued, with a pause, “and raping.”

Evidence of “marauding gangs” who were “raping” the women of Koreatown is hard to find—and may not exist at all. Two scholars who have written extensively on the Los Angeles riots, which marked a 20-year anniversary in 2012, characterized Graham’s imagery as “unfounded hyperbole” and “political theater.”

To Graham, however, this violent moment in American history 2400 miles away from South Carolina, requires big at-home firepower.

“And the vice president said, in response to—that’s why I want my AR-15 [again, an inaccurate characterization of DeFranco’s question]—he said no, you would be better off with a 12-guage shotgun. Well, that’s his opinion, and I respect it.”

Of course, he also disagrees with it.

“I have an AR-15 at home and I haven’t hurt anybody and I don’t intend to use it,” he flexed. “But I think I would be better off protecting my business or my family if there was law and order breakdown in my community, people roaming around my neighborhood to have the AR-15, and I don’t think that makes me an unreasonable person.”

The political motivation of Graham’s casual description of “marauding gangs” of rapists was further exposed in his strident defense of gun advocate Gayle Trotter, who called the AR-15 the weapon of choice for “millions” of American women and testified that women need high capacity weapons to protect themselves and their children.

“When you start telling me that I’m unreasonable for wanting that women to have more than six bullets, or to have an AR-15 with people roaming around my neighborhood, I reject the concept,” he said."
msnbc25,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/gop-group-celebrating-mlk-gun-raffle,"An Oregon County Republican Party group is raffling off an AR-15 rifle in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. and President Abraham Lincoln.

The Multnomah County Republicans announced the raffle as a celebration of “the legacy of two great Republicans who demonstrated leadership and courage” and “the denial of the rights they fought so hard against.”

Despite the Multnomah County Republicans’ claim to the contrary, King was not a Republican, and denied any party affiliation.

The raffle will be held next month at the group’s Lincoln Day Dinner, where Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s father and conservative firebrand Rafael Cruz is scheduled to speak. Cruz might have trouble with King’s legacy and ideals, were he to investigate them thoroughly, since he regularly rails against Pres. Obama’s “socialist” efforts, while King advocated a guaranteed income for the jobless and a redistribution of economic power to benefit the poor in his time.

“We are here to reaffirm our strong defense of the Second Amendment and the right to personal protection. The Bill of Rights is inviolable, despite what the gun-grabbers in Salem might try,” Multnomah County GOP Chairman Jeff Reynolds said in a statement.

The Portland-based GOP group is not the first to tout gun rights in connection with King. Last year Larry Ward, a gun activist behind Gun Appreciation Day, argued that King would have supported gun rights and that if he had owned a gun he might have prevented his own assassination.

Ward joined Rev. Al Sharpton on PoliticsNation in Jan. 2013 to debate that very issue, and Sharpton pointed out that King was in fact a staunch advocate for gun control.

“You do realize that Martin Luther King was killed by a gun and that he preached all of his life against the use of any weapons and preached turn the other cheek? So you do realize that what you said was the total antithesis to Dr. King?” Sharpton said.

Gun activists regularly point to Dr. King’s decision to apply for a concealed carry permit as a sign that he strongly supported gun rights, but a closer look reveals otherwise.

“How could I serve as one of the leaders of a nonviolent movement and at the same time use weapons of violence for my personal protection?” he wrote of that incident in his autobiography. “Coretta and I talked the matter over for several days and finally agreed that arms were no solution. We decided then to get rid of the one weapon we owned. We tried to satisfy our friends by having floodlights mounted around the house, and hiring unarmed watchmen around the clock.”

Gun activists in the Portland-area have come under fire for their gun appreciation efforts in the past. This time last year residents became agitated when two activists carried assault rifles around the city."
msnbc26,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/jared-michael-padgett-oregon-shooting,"Police have identified the gunman in Tuesday’s deadly shooting at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon as Jared Michael Padgett, a 15-year-old freshman at the school.

On Wednesday afternoon, police told reporters that Padgett arrived at the school Tuesday morning on a school bus carrying a guitar case and a duffel bag. Police said they believe the case and bag contained the weapons found with the shooter’s body – an AR-15 rifle, a semi-automatic handgun and a large knife, along with nine loaded ammunition magazines “with the capability of holding several hundred rounds.”

Police said only the AR-15 rifle was used during the attack and that Padgett was also wearing a “non-ballistic vest used for carrying ammunition and other items” and a camouflaged helmet.

According to Troutdale Police Chief Scott Anderson, after arriving at the school, Padgett entered the gym and went into the boys’ locker room, where he shot and killed 14-year-old Emilio Hoffman, also a freshman.

“We have not established any link between the shooter and the victim,” said Chief Anderson.

Anderson said after killing Hoffman, Padgett hit Reynolds High School gym teacher Todd Rispler with a “grazing wound” to the hip. According to police, Rispler then fled the locker room and made his way to the school’s office to tell his colleagues what was happening and initiate the school’s emergency lockdown procedure.

Commending Rispler and his police force, Anderson said, “I cannot emphasize enough the role that Mr. Rispler and the responding officers played in saving many, many lives yesterday.”

After leaving the gym, Padgett encountered responding officers in a school hallway, according to Anderson, and he exchanged gunfire with at least one of them before hiding in a bathroom. That is where Padgett was found by authorities dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“The shooter obtained the weapons from his family home,” Anderson told reporters. “The weapons had been secured, but he defeated the security measures.”

“At this time it would be inappropriate to discuss a possible motive for the murder,” he added."

msnbc45,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/man-shot-28-times-police-gives-thanks-after-being-freed,"At an emotional and celebratory press conference Friday, Howard Morgan, the Chicago man who was shot 28 times by police then convicted of attempted murder, maintained his innocence after having his sentence commuted earlier this week.

“Right now I’m just concentrating on clearing my name,” Morgan said, “because I’m absolutely innocent of those charges.”

Morgan was freed Monday after outgoing Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn commuted his 40-year prison sentence. He is now working with lawyers to have his conviction reversed.

“He was no criminal when I married him, and he’s no criminal now,” said Morgan’s wife, Rosalind Morgan, who led the fight for his freedom.



RELATED: Police charged with murder of homeless man

Quinn hasn’t explained the reason for his decision, which angered some police unions, as well as one of the officers wounded in the incident. But Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Morgan, said Quinn was well within his rights.

“What Governor Quinn did was not secretive or mysterious in any way,” said Crump. “It’s what the constitution of this state gives him the power to do.”

“There were thousands and thousands of people who signed the petition after they looked on the record as to what took place,” Crump added.

“What I really believe this is is an example of driving while black,” said Crump. “And we don’t need to go much further than that.”

In 2005, Morgan, a former Chicago police officer who was working as a railroad detective, was stopped by four police officers while driving the wrong way on a one-way street near his home. From there, a scuffle ensued, leading to gunfire. Police said Morgan was belligerent and fired first, while Morgan said police started firing as soon as they saw his gun, and denied firing a shot. In the end, Morgan was shot 28 times, 21 in the back, while three officers were wounded.

At a 2007 trial, Morgan was found not guilty of discharging his firearm, but there was no verdict on a charge of attempted murder. At a second trial, a jury convicted Morgan on the attempted murder charge. He was sentenced him to 40 years in prison.

Lawyers for Morgan, 63, have said key evidence was suppressed at trial, and have complained about double jeopardy.

Morgan’s supporters have said his case is an example of the kind of over-zealous policing that lately has been in the national spotlight thanks to the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and several other unarmed blacks.

But John Wrigley, one of the officers who was shot, told a local news station he has questions for Quinn.

“Why do you think he needed to be released? Why do you think he deserved to be released? Did you sit in on the trial? Did he look at the details of this case? I don’t think he did,” Wrigley said.

Morgan’s was one of 43 clemency petitions that Quinn, a Democrat, granted Monday just before leaving office."

msnbc49,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/nra-obama-will-take-your-rifle-shotgun-han,"Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association, appeared on Fox News Sunday just days after testifying during a congressional hearing on gun violence, to stoke fears that President Obama will disarm “law-abiding citizens” of their most basic weapons.

“During the campaign, when [Obama] said to people, ‘I will not take away your rifle, shotgun, handgun.’ They leafleted the country with flyers like this, ‘Obama’s not gonna take your gun,’ ‘Obama will protect gun rights,’” LaPierre said. “And now he’s trying to take away all three.”

Host Chris Wallace pushed back on LaPierre’s accusations, confirming that shotguns were never a target for tighter gun restrictions.

“Have you looked at the Feinstein bill that’s he’s supporting? That’s exactly what it does,” LaPierre fired back, referring to the renewed assault weapons ban California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced last month. The bill bans the sale and manufacturing of more than 150 types of military-style weapons, which expands on the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban that expired in 2004.

LaPierre continued: ”I think what they’ll do is they’ll turn this universal check on the law-abiding into a universal registry of law-abiding people. And law-abiding people don’t want that.”

Wallace did not let LaPierre skate by with his claims. “There’s nothing that anyone in the administration has said that indicates they’re going to have a universal registry,” he said.

“And Obamacare wasn’t a tax until they needed it to be a tax,” LaPierre retorted.

“I don’t think you can trust these…” he added, trailing off.

In another heated exchange, the Fox News host lashed out at LaPierre for suggesting that President Obama’s children were under the same kind of threat as other children in America.

“That’s ridiculous and you know it, sir.”"
msnbc50,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/hunting-and-high-capacity-magazines,"The news from Colorado is now joined by a discussion of gun laws. Senator John McCain responded to a question Monday about having a gun law debate in the Senate:

Q: Reporter: Can you support some limits on guns and still support the second amendment because the NRA seems to suggest that you can’t? A: McCain: Again, somebody would have to prove that it would actually have a beneficial effect, some of the strictest gun laws in the country are in places where crime is at its worst.

As “The Last Word” staff worked on Friday night to gather information about the shooting at the Batman movie screening, I read reports from Colorado about the types of guns used in this crime. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said four weapons were used in the attack: “Two 40-caliber Glock handguns, a Remington 870 single-barrel pump shotgun and a Smith & Wesson AR-15 assault-style rifle.” As someone who grew up in a rural part of the southeastern United States, most of those sound pretty familiar with the exception of the AR-15 rifle.

From the age off about 10, as soon as the weather changed from summer to autumn and the leaves started to change, so did my sleep schedule as my father would wake me around 3:30 or 4:00 am to go hunting. I would slowly climb into camouflage coveralls and meet my dad at the gun cabinet in the den, where he would choose the appropriate guns for that mornings hunt: Semi-automatic 20-gauge shotguns for duck, goose and other bird hunting; rifles and a 12-gauge shotgun with buckshot for deer season. Pulling a military-style weapon out of the gun cabinet in the den just didn’t happen.

The rifle used in Colorado was made by Smith & Wesson according to reports and thus is an AR-15 “style” rifle, as another company actually owns that name. The AR-15 is the civilian version of the M-16 military assault rifle and was banned from 1994-2004 when the assault weapons ban expired. One of the arguments for the ban were the various attachments available for purchase for this gun like bayonets. I have never seen a bayonet on a bolt action hunting rifle.

In the 1980s and early ’90s when I hunted with my father, the men he hunted with often talked about the laws concerning gun ownership and especially how to make certain that they were abiding by the law. There was a limit as to how many bullets each gun held and thus a limit to how many shots before you had to reload, three four or five as far I remember. I also remember we had no problem returning home with at least a few ducks, geese, or doves. One pull of the trigger, one shot from a shotgun, and usually at least one bird would go down. If you missed, it took just a second to pull the pump and put another shell in the chamber to fire again. Our chocolate lab did not want for ducks to retrieve in the cold November waters of eastern North Carolina.

The Aurora Police Chief says “these weapons can accommodate large ammunition clips.” The AR-15 used in this attack had a ”drum clip” attachment that could have carried more than 100 rounds and with that clip, the gun “could have fired 50 to 60 rounds in a minute, even if the rifle was considered semi-automatic, not automatic.” Oates added “There were 3,000 rounds of ammunition for this rifle.” 3000 rounds.

One of my most vivid memories of hunting was during middle school, very early on a school day. We climbed a deer stand before sunrise and watched over a field that had probably grown soybeans. About an hour later, a buck with small but legal antlers walked out from the woods, into a field and into his final moments. The deer was too far for me to take a shot at, I was armed with a shotgun. Its been a long time and I don’t remember if my dad was carrying the Remington or the Winchester but I do remember it took him just one shot with his rifle for the deer to go down. It took just one shot across a field that was at least 50 yards.

Think about that. One shot from that rifle took down a deer weighing several hundred pounds that likely was as far from us as half the length of a football field. In comparison the rifle used in the Colorado shootings had a drum magazine attachment that holds as many as 100 bullets. Attachments like that were also banned from 1994-2004.

It took my dad and me some time to climb down the tree and walk across that field. The deer was still alive when we got there. It was an awful sight, his eyes were wide open looking panicked or maybe shocked. I looked away as my father put him down and then we carried the carcass to the pickup truck and headed back to town. My dad dropped me off at school with the deer still in the truck bed, with enough time to change out of my camo coveralls before class. In all the time I hunted with my father, he was a loyal NRA member and I never heard him once complain that his rifle held too few bullets."
msnbc51,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/two-students-suspended-massachusetts-school-posing-rifles,"Two Massachusetts students were suspended from their high school after they posed for a photograph holding replica assault rifles, the same day a gunman opened fire inside a school in Washington.

RELATED: Second Washington school shooting victim dies

Last Friday, Tito Velez and Jamie Pereira stood next to each other with their Airsoft rifles, which shoot plastic pellets and resemble assault weapons, for a picture ahead of their Homecoming dance, The Boston Globe reported on Wednesday. The students posted the image to Facebook with a caption that read, “Homecoming 2014.”

That day, an alleged gunman opened fire at Marysville-Pilchuck High School in Washington, killing fellow schoolmate Zoe Galasso and critically wounding four others before turning the gun on himself. One of the victims, Gia Soriano, died from her injuries on Sunday. Local officials, including the police chief, called on the community and the entire country to make societal changes to prevent future mass shootings.

Administrators at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School in Taunton on Monday suspended the teenagers for 10 days. The caption, which consequently linked their image to a school event, has been removed from the photo.

Velez later defended his actions during an interview with a local Boston news station.

“This isn’t dangerous, you can’t kill someone with it. We didn’t shoot anyone; we were pointing them at the floor,” he told WBZ-TV earlier this week. When the reporter asked if the couple intended to take the guns to school, Velez responded: “Never. That would be stupid.”

Pereira, Velez’s girlfriend, said their suspension and possible expulsion from school “is way too much.”

RELATED: Mass shootings are on the rise

People have rallied online in defense of the students. The United States Constitution guarantees their freedom of speech through the First Amendment. But their decisions not only linked the guns to a school event, but also created a disruption among other students in the midst of news headlines about recent shootings inside academic buildings. About 25% of the mass tragedies in the past 13 years occurred in an educational setting, according to a report published last month by the FBI.

“To tie that to one of our school events kind of puts it over the top, which brings us into it,” Richard Gross, superintendent of Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School, told WBZ. Taunton police said they would have canceled the dance if authorities were aware of the post on Friday."

msnbc54,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-gun-the-heart-the-assault-weapons-d,"National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre is set to appear Wednesday morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee. His testimony, released Tuesday, repeats the same tired ideas that he has already articulated and that much of the nation has already rejected, including putting armed guards or police in schools. And he makes a pragmatic-sounding case for avoiding action, saying we all need “to be honest about what works–and what doesn’t work.”

LaPierre also defends military-style semi-automatic weapons, which gun-control backers in Congress recently introduced legislation to ban. “Semi-automatic firearms have been around for over 100 years,” he tells lawmakers. “They are among the most popular guns made for hunting, target shooting and self-defense.”

The firearm at the heart of the “assault weapons” debate is a Bushmaster AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. A Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was used last month in the Newtown, Conn. shootings that killed 27. Ten days later in Webster, New York, a man set to fire to his house and used a Bushmaster AR-15 to kill two responding firefighters before killing himself. An AR-15 was also used in last summer’s shooting at a Batman movie theater premiere in Aurora, Colo., and a decade ago in and around Washington by the D.C. sniper.

It’s less suited for hunting and home defense, although some people do use it for both purposes, and more ideally suited for other, more complex scenarios ranging from defending against rioters and looters, participating in the demanding sport of High Power target shooting, or arming oneself to deter police or military forces in the case of a citizens’ insurrection. The popularity of Bushmaster rifles also makes them excellent money-makers for gun manufacturers, too.

Designed as a civilian version of the fully automatic M-16 rifle, issued to American soldiers since the Vietnam war, the AR-15 is named after the original manufacturer, Armalite; the AR does not refer to “assault rifle,” as some have erroneously suggested. The same weapon did appear, however, in the Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Assault Weapons, until pressure from the NRA and gun manufacturers demanded that the author change the digest’s title for his next edition to a Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Tactical Rifles.

Gun-rights supporters have rushed to defend the weapon. In a piece titled “The AR-15: The Gun Liberals Love to Hate,” NRA president David Keene wrote online last month that gun-banning politicians and journalists don’t “understand the nature of the firearms they would ban, their popularity or legitimate uses.”

Some people do use a Bushmaster AR-15 to hunt. But most Bushmaster AR-15’s fire small, but high-powered rounds that can make it difficult to stop a deer or other big game without multiple shots. Only in the past decade or so have AR-15 rifles have become good enough to match the accuracy of most other hunting rifles, and many hunters still seem divided over what some derisively call “black guns.” A few years ago, Field & Stream posed the question in an online forum, Are assault rifles for hunting? One young, but experienced hunter searching for middle ground, wrote:

“I am NOT ‘buying into’ liberal media’s ideas. I don’t mind one bit if someone wants to hunt with a[n] AR-15. I just have a personal opinion about them and their place in hunting,” wrote longliner13, describing himself as a young man and avid hunter. “If you enjoy hunting with an assault rifle, great. Do it. I have myself. But I just have the strong opinion that the AR-15 is not necessary in the field.”

What about for home defense? Most experts, along with many others, recommend keeping either a handgun or shotgun over any other long rifle in a house or apartment. The tight confines of any residence make it difficult to wield a long rifle. And if a long gun were still preferred, a shotgun is both easier to aim and more effective at short-range. While the Bushmaster’s high-powered, small rounds could end up penetrating walls and putting family members or neighbors at risk.

Outside the home, however, over more open ground, a Bushmaster AR-15 might be ideal for self-defense. Many gun-rights activists still point to a 1992 video on YouTube of ethnic Korean store owners and other men on the rooftop of their retail business to defend against looters during the riots over the Rodney King police beating trial. Although the store’s defenders appear to have been armed with only rifles and shotguns, there is no doubt that a Bushmaster rifle capable of firing up to 45 rounds a minute would be an effective deterrent against multiple assailants in a riot or other lawless scenario.

There is one area, however, where a military-designed, semi-automatic rifle like the Bushmaster AR-15 does clearly excel. High Power Competition target shooting is now more common than traditional benchrest shooting competitions “by a huge margin,” according to one expert and blogger. “[T]here are no mechanical crutches in High Power—your arms and body must support the full weight of the rifle as you engage the target from a variety of positions,” placing “a premium on good eyesight, training, and overall fitness.”

The Bushmaster AR-15 is among the weapons of choice for High Power Competition. Shooters fire from standing, sitting, kneeling and prone positions, firing up to 20 rounds at a time. Competitions organized by the NRA have helped make High Power shooting competitions a fast growing sport. The proposed legislation to ban many military-style semi-automatic rifles and limit high capacity magazines announced last week by California Sen. Feinstein would at least alter, if not threaten the future of this expanding field of American gun culture.

Why else might someone need a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle? Perhaps so armed citizens might one day deter, if not overthrow a future tyrannical government. This may sound like rhetoric, but it has been the position of modern NRA leaders and other Second Amendment activists for years. “They’re God-given freedoms. They belong to us as our birthright. No government ever gave them to us and no government can ever take them away,” said NRA chief LaPierre last week in Reno.

Since gun control has come under debate in the wake of the Newtown Sandy Hook shooting, similar views have flooded the Internet. “Hunting is a BI-PRODUCT of #2ndAmendment. The #RightToBearArms is TO DEFEND Self, Family & #USA from MURDERING MEN or #Government. #tcop #GOP,” tweeted last week @johnmatthew19, a self-described “Christian,American,Father,builder”.

Another purpose that Bushmaster rifles serve is to make profits for their manufacturer. Bushmaster rifles have made record sales in the wake of the Newtown grade school massacre. The Bushmaster AR-15 retails for about $1,048.99, making it more expensive that most traditional hunting rifles. People who buy it also tend to buy and use more ammunition. “They are fun, accurate, don’t kick, and before you know it, you’ve sent $100 worth of ammunition downrange with a few twitches of your trigger finger,” wrote one Field & Stream columnist.

The rising popularity of the Bushmaster AR-15 has helped make Remington Arms and its North Carolina-based parent company, Freedom Group, one of the nation’s largest and most profitable gun manufacturing consortiums. To continue sales, Freedom Group quietly collaborates with the gun lobby. In 2011, the same year a new CEO, George Kollitides II, took over Freedom Group, Kollitides was appointed to the NRA’s Nominating Committee to hand-pick candidates for elections to the NRA’s current board of directors, as I reported two weeks ago in Mother Jones. Freedom Group has grown from making nearly $80 million in profits five years ago to making an average of almost $250 million a year since 2009, much of it from sales of Bushmaster rifles.

“Bushmaster was one of the first companies to introduce modern sporting rifles to the consumer market,” reads Freedom Group’s last available annual report, “a market that is growing faster than the general firearms industry.”"
msnbc55,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/national-rifle-association-nra-convention-draws-gun-lovers-and-vote-seekers,"Tens of thousands of firearms enthusiasts gathered in Indianapolis over the weekend for the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) annual meeting, a celebration of gun culture that’s also a magnet for Republican candidates looking to court the movement’s support.

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin delivered the most discussed line of the weekend at a rally Saturday when she called on the government to return to torturing suspected terrorists.

“Well, if I were in charge, they would know that waterboarding is how we’d baptize terrorists,” Palin said.

On Friday, a bevy of potential GOP presidential candidates spoke, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio, former Senator Rick Santorum, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. Others, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, participated remotely by video.

The gun rights movement had plenty to celebrate over the weekend. Despite a push to restrict assault weapons, large ammunition magazines, and expand background checks in the wake of mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Newtown, Connecticut, states have mostly moved to expand the ability of residents to legally obtain and carry firearms in recent months. Organizers of the NRA meeting hope to carry that momentum to Congress, where they’re pushing for new laws that would force state and local governments to recognize gun permits issued elsewhere.

The movement’s recent successes are largely attributable to the intense political support generated by Second Amendment activists through groups like the NRA, whose clout forced politicians to think carefully before supporting even modest gun control measures that enjoy overwhelming majority support among the public.

msnbc56,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rubio-right-the-assault-weapons-ban-failed,"During CNN’s forum on school shootings this week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) faced an outraged parent, whose daughter was shot, and who couldn’t understand the Republican senator’s opposition to an assault-weapons ban.

Rubio responded that the original assault-weapons ban “failed” after its passage in 1994. But is that true? The Washington Post had a good piece on this yesterday, taking a closer look at the data, and concluding that the since-expired law “had a significant impact.”

The 1994 law included a ban on 18 specific models of assault weapons, as well as a ban on any firearms containing certain military-style features, like a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor or a folding stock. It also banned high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 bullets. The bill allowed individuals already in possession of such weapons to keep them. It was also set to expire after 10 years’ time. “The original intent of the assault weapons ban was to reduce the carnage of mass shootings,” [Louis Klarevas, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who wrote a 2016 book on mass shooting violence] said. “And on that front the data indicate that it worked.” Klarevas has compiled data on gun massacres involving six or more fatalities for the 50 years before 2016. His numbers show that gun massacres fell significantly during the time the assault weapons ban was in place, and skyrocketed after the ban lapsed in 2004.

In the American tradition, the country has repeatedly responded to brutal gun violence by imposing new restrictions – each of which was permissible under the Second Amendment. One of the reasons fully automatic weapons aren’t generally available to the public, for example, was the response to the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929.

The massacre in Parkland, Fla., last week was also on Valentine’s Day. There’s no reason policymakers can’t take similar, legal steps in the name of public safety now.

* Postscript: At the same CNN event, Rubio said any attempt to ban assault weapons would open the door too widely: “Once you start looking at how easy it is to get around it, you would literally have to ban every semiautomatic rifle that’s sold in America.” Much to the Republican senator’s chagrin, the crowd erupted in applause.

Yesterday, he followed up by saying this idea may have received cheers, but it’s outside “the mainstream.” First, Rubio opposed a popular and bipartisan background-check bill in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, so I’m not sure he should be commenting on who is and isn’t within “the mainstream.”

And second, there’s ample evidence to suggest Rubio’s assessment is factually wrong."

msnbc67,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/idaho-bill-allow-permitless-concealed-carry-inside-city-limits,"Beginning July 1, Idaho residents age 21 or older will be allowed to carry a concealed firearm without a permit inside city limits.

Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter has signed Senate Bill 1389 into law, which will relax the state’s gun policy and remove permitting requirements for concealed carry. Prior to SB 1389, residents age 18 or older could carry concealed firearms without a permit outside of city limits. Open carry is already legal within city limits.

Despite giving SB 1389 his signature, Otter expressed concern about the bill’s lack of a training or education requirement for those who would carry concealed. In a letter to the president of the Idaho Senate, Otter addressed public safety concerns that law enforcement raised throughout the development of the bill and urged individuals who are considering concealed carry to receive training in firearm safety.

“While S1389 is consistent with the U.S. Constitution, Idaho values and our commitment to upholding our constitutional protections from government overreach, I am concerned about its lack of any provision for education and training of individuals who choose to exercise the right to concealed carry,” the Republican lawmaker wrote. “Such a safeguard would seem to be part of the Second Amendment’s ‘well-regulated’ standard. What’s more, the addition of a simple training requirement in this bill could have addressed the concerns of our valued law enforcement leaders and others who cherish both the shooting culture and the safety of shooters and non-shooters alike.”

Otter added that in the absence of an educational provision, ”I also encourage the Legislature to monitor the exercise of this new law and respond appropriately when and if the lack of statutory education and training requirement undermines public safety.”

Other states that allow concealed carry without a permit include Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Vermont, Wyoming and West Virginia."

Durham County District Attorney Roger Echols on Feb. 25 filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty against the suspect, Craig Hicks, 46, of Chapel Hill, the assistant, Candy Clark, told msnbc. A hearing is expected in early April.

msnbc69,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congress-eyes-bills-undetectable-guns,"It hasn’t gotten much attention yet, but a federal ban on undetectable guns will expire in just a couple of weeks. Some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for congressional action ahead of the Dec. 9 deadline.

Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) introduced a bill Thursday that would ban guns designed to escape detection by metal detectors. S. 1774 would reauthorize the Undetectable Firearms Act, which first passed in 1988. Schumer tried to get unanimous consent to pass the bill Thursday evening, but Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) objected, saying it wasn’t a day to be passing any legislation.

“I hope as soon as we come back, we might get this body to pass it, and maybe get the House to pass it,” Schumer said. “We are in a dangerous world. To allow terrorists, criminals, those who are mentally infirm, to walk through metal detectors with guns that are made of plastic and then use them at airports, sporting events, and schools is a very bad thing.”

It’s hardly a secret that congressional Republicans oppose any new gun measures, no matter how popular or sensible they may be, but at issue here is whether an existing law can remain in place.

Under the status quo, federal law prohibits the “manufacture, sale, import or possession of guns that are undetectable by metal detectors and X-ray machines.” The Undetectable Firearms Act was first signed into law by President Reagan in 1988, and it’s been renewed with relative ease twice since then, but with the radicalization of Republican politics, and limited time remaining, the law’s future is very much in doubt.

The irony is, the law is arguably more necessary now than ever. Quite recently, 3-D printing has become more common and readily available to consumers, making it that much easier to produce deadly weapons, quickly and cheaply, that include no metal parts."

Everytown for Gun Safety on Wednesday published the results of an investigation in Washington that show most of the criminals in the state purchase firearms from the online marketplace to avoid background checks. Of the identified people seeking guns in unlicensed sales over the Internet, nearly one in 10 had been convicted of crimes that prevented them from legally possessing firearms, including rape domestic abuse, and assaulting police officers. The investigation also found that 44,000 guns are posted for sale annually on the Internet.

“Of the identified people seeking guns in unlicensed sales over the Internet, nearly one in 10 had been convicted of crimes.” U.S. Department of Justice.

The pro-reform gun group, backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, examined five major Washington classified websites, including Armslist.com, the self-described Craigslist for guns. Those platforms illegally transfer about 4,000 firearms each year. The websites range in size, with hundreds to tens of thousands of firearms listed at any given time. Once each day from Feb. 25 until July 12, 2014, investigators extracted online data from all gun-related ads posted by the self-described “private sellers.”

The findings of the report, “Online and Off the Record,” came on the heels of a ballot initiative in Washington that would require criminal background checks on all firearms sales and transfers in the state — including at gun shows and on the Internet. In an unusual move, philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates last month donated $1 million to the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility, a reform group attempting to reduce violence in the Evergreen State.

Early last year, 345,000 Washington residents began pushing for the initiative, known as “I-594,” to appear on a ballot. They will have a chance to vote on the measure, the country’s only statewide background checks initiative, during the midterm elections in November.

Recent polling reveals that 72% of Washington residents support I-594.

The same day as the organization disclosed the results, Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS) began airing two new television commercials in New Hampshire that highlight two Republican congressional candidates’ opposition to sealing the loophole that allows domestic abusers, stalkers, and other individuals who pose a threat to society to buy guns. Members target Congressman Frank Guinta and state Rep. Marilinda Garcia for holding beliefs contrary to those of most residents in the Granite State.

Many of the pro-reform campaigns, such as the national petitions initiated by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, are focused on addressing the loophole in the federal background checks system. Earlier this year, members of the group successfully convinced Facebook and Instagram to regulate all sales and trades on those sites of firearms that are not subject to background checks."
msnbc73,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/burger-chain-prohibits-customers-openly-carrying-guns,"If you want to bring a gun into a Whataburger, you better keep it out of sight.

The iconic Texas fast-food chain recently announced that it will not allow customers to openly carry firearms in its restaurants, despite a new law that empowers Texans to display their guns while walking the state’s streets.

In an open letter to the “gun rights community,” Whataburger CEO Preston Atkinson explained that while he supports Second Amendment rights, “We’ve had many customers and employees tell us they’re uncomfortable being around someone with a visible firearm who is not a member of law enforcement, and as a business, we have to listen and value that feedback in the same way we value yours.”

RELATED: The states could be the only hope for new gun control laws

Texas Restaurant Association CEO Richie Jackson told the Associated Press that he expects other restaurants in the state to adopt a similar policy before the new law goes into effect next January.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation in June, following years of protests and rallies by gun rights advocates. Among the group’s favorite acts of civil disobedience was the repeated practice of bringing military-style assault rifles into Texas Chipotle Restaurants, prompting push back from the burrito chain.

The new law overturned a ban on open carry that dates back to the post-Civil War era, when it was used to disarm former Confederate soldiers and facilitate the emancipation of slaves in the state.

While Texas’ streets, sidewalks, and parks will soon be open to the visibly armed, the law gives private property owners the right to ban guns in their homes or establishments.

Whataburger patrons will still be allowed to carry firearms in the chain’s restaurants, so long as they keep them concealed. But that gives little comfort to Open Carry Texas founder C.J. Grisham, who told the A.P. that the policy was “premature and irresponsible.”

“I think most gun owners that know this policy are simply not going to go to Whataburger, like me,” he said."
msnbc74,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/americans-favor-stricter-control-over-gun-rig,"A strong majority of Americans still favor stricter gun control laws, according to a new national Morning Joe/Marist poll. The new figures indicate that support for gun control is not waning, as another national poll found in March.

The Morning Joe/Marist poll found that 60% of Americans—83% of Democrats, 43% of gun owners, and 37% of Republicans—support stricter laws. That number is virtually unchanged from the 61% who favored the laws in another NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that asked the same question in February.

The Morning Joe/Marist poll also found an uptick in the number of Americans who prioritize controlling gun violence over gun rights: 53% of Americans believe stopping gun violence should have a higher priority, a step up the 49% that another Marist poll found last month.

Congress has struggled to find politically viable legislation to move forward on the matter, despite the strong support from the public.

While 87% of those surveyed believe in background checks for private and gun show gun sales—a key provision of the Senate’s background check bill—Republicans have vowed to fight such legislation. Only 12% of Americans oppose universal background checks; just 1% in the Morning Joe/Marist poll said they were unsure on the issue.

Fifty-nine percent of Americans favor banning assault weapons, but the bill was dropped in the Senate because it lacked the votes to pass. Democrats are expected to offer the ban as an amendment to the legislation, but it is not expected to pass.

Chuck Todd, msnbc host and NBC News chief White House correspondent, broke down the findings.

“You see why this is going nowhere on Capitol Hill,” explained Todd, on Wednesday’s Morning Joe. “If you look at it by party and you say there’s an overwhelming majority because there’s a majority of Democrats who would like gun laws to be more strict and a majority of independents who would like that. But if you look at it with Republicans, it’s a majority that do not believe gun laws should not be more strict, it’s a majority of Republicans who do not want the assault weapons ban. The only place where there’s a significant Republican support in line with Democrats and independents is on the issue of expanded background checks.”

The party breakdown is stark: 63% of Republicans favor protecting gun rights over controlling gun violence, while only 34% prioritize controlling gun violence. Meanwhile, 77% of Democrats believe controlling gun violence should be the priority; 22% prioritize gun rights. Independents are divided evenly: 48% prioritize stopping gun violence, 48% prioritize gun rights.

“It’s a reminder,” he added. “If a majority of Republicans aren’t on this, it’s not getting through the House–none of this is getting through the House.”

The poll was conducted March 25-March 27 among 1,219 national respondents using both landline and cell phones. It has a margin of error of plus-minus 3.0 percentage points."
msnbc75,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-republicans-vote-expand-gun-access-mentally-impaired,"When an American suffers from a severe mental illness, to the point that he or she receives disability benefits through the Social Security Administration, there are a variety of limits created to help protect that person and his or her interests. These folks cannot, for example, go to a bank to cash a check on their own.If congressional Republicans have their way, these impaired people will, however, be able to buy a gun. USA Today reported

The House of Representatives approved its first effort of the new Congress to roll back gun regulations, voting to overturn a rule that would bar gun ownership by some who have been deemed mentally impaired by the Social Security Administration. The House voted 235-180 largely along party lines Thursday to repeal an Obama-era rule requiring the Social Security Administration to send records of some beneficiaries to the federal firearms background check system after they’ve been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs. The rule, when implemented, would affect about 75,000 recipients of disability insurance and supplemental insurance income who require a representative to manage their benefits because of a disabling mental disorder, ranging from anxiety to schizophrenia.

The full roll call on yesterday’s vote is online here . Note that 97% of House Republicans voted for the measure, while 99% of House Democrats voted against it.While GOP proponents of the bill argued that it’s unfair to limit the rights of the mentally disabled, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), among others, explained, “These are not just people having a bad day…. These are people with a severe mental illness who can’t hold any kind of job or make any decisions about their affairs.”This did not prove persuasive to Congress’ far-right majority, which supported the measure that enjoyed the enthusiastic backing of the National Rifle Association.In terms of the substantive details, the Social Security Administration reports the names of those who receive disability benefits due to severe mental illness to the FBI’s background-check system. The House bill intends to block that reporting, making more people eligible to legally buy a firearm.Often, in the wake of the country’s brutal mass shootings, Republican policymakers have a reflexive set of talking points, and near the top is something intended to sound constructive: working on mental-health issues is a potential area for bipartisan common ground.Yesterday was a reminder that the gap between the parties on issues such as these couldn’t be much greater.And while much of the political world’s attention has been focused on Donald Trump’s alarming antics of late, let’s not overlook the fact that House Republicans have been quite busy this week. The GOP majority voted to make it easier for coal mining debris to be dumped into nearby streams ; Republicans approved a measure to allow oil companies to hide payments to foreign governments ; and yesterday they moved to expand gun access for the mentally impaired.It’s quite an institution."
msnbc76,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/police-three-males-six-females-killed-charleston-church-shooting,"CHARLESTON, S.C. – Police have captured the suspected gunman believed to have fatally shot nine church members gathered Wednesday night for Bible study and prayer, officials said Thursday. Dylann Storm Roof, 21, was taken into custody in Shelby, North Carolina, nearly 250 miles from the scene of the deadly shooting.

RELATED: The question hanging over Charleston

Among the dead in the massacre at one of the nation’s oldest black churches here was beloved pastor Clementa Pinckney, a longtime state senator.

Roof waived his right to an attorney and said he would not fight extradition to South Carolina in his first court appearance later Thursday, an employee of the local Cleveland County Clerk’s office said. He is expected to appear for a 2 p.m. ET bond hearing Friday in North Charleston, South Carolina.

“This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America,” Obama said. ”Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace. In a place of worship.”

Shots rang out Wednesday evening after Roof allegedly joined a weekly prayer group gathered at the historic church and asked members to identify the pastor. Roof sat next to the church leader for nearly an hour, authorities said, when around 9 p.m., the gunman opened fire. Police said three men and six women were killed in the massacre.

Local, state and national law enforcement launched a massive manhunt that concluded Thursday morning after a tipster reported a suspicious-looking car to authorities. Police arrested Roof at a traffic stop, Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said in a news conference.

“I cannot say how thankful I am and how appreciative I am of all the people who came together during a very tragic situation, a horrific situation, one that has touched the heart and soul for every person who lives in this community,” Mullen said.

Charleston County coroner Rae Wooten released the names of the victims Thursday afternoon. In addition to Pinckney, other victims identified are Tywanza Sanders, 26, a recent graduate of Allen University; Cynthia Hurd, 54, a library manager at St. Andrews Regional Library; Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, a reverend and mother; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59; Reverend Depayne Middleton, 49; and Rev. Daniel Simmons, 74, who died shortly after being taken to a local hospital.

The Justice Department has opened a hate crime investigation into the shooting, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Thursday, calling the deadly incident “heartbreaking and deeply tragic.”

“Acts like this one have no place in our country and no place in a civilized society,” Lynch said. “Even as we struggle to comprehend this heartbreaking event, I want everyone in Charleston and everyone who has been affected by this tragedy to know that we will do everything in our power to heal this community and make it whole again.”

South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley struggled through tears during a press conference Thursday morning, urging communities across the state to come together and heal. “We woke up today and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,” she said while choking up. “And so we’ve got some grieving too. And we’ve got some pain we have to go through. Parents are having to explain to kids how they can go to church and feel safe. And that’s not something we’ve ever thought we’d deal with.”

The violence erupted at Charleston’s historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, the oldest such congregation in the South, known as much for the role it played at significant moments of racial distress as for its grand Gothic architecture.

It was the second time in three months that violence, death and race mixed in Charleston, where in April a white police officer fired eight bullets at Walter Scott, an unarmed African American man, killing him. The officer was charged with murder and is currently facing trial.

On a campaign stop in the city Wednesday, presidential contender Hillary Clinton spoke passionately about police violence, calling Scott’s death a “terrible tragedy.” She left the city before the shooting occurred, a campaign aide confirmed. There had been local reports that Pinckney was campaigning with Clinton in the state. But a campaign official told msnbc that he was not at her fundraiser.

Community members, clearly distraught, held impromptu prayer circles and gathered into the night as tensions ran high and new details emerged about the deadly shooting. In an interview with NBC affiliate station WIS, a woman claiming to be Pinckney’s cousin relayed an account from a survivor in the room.

“She said that he had reloaded five different times and her son was trying to talk him out of doing that, killing people, and he just said, ‘I have to do it’ and he said, ‘You rape our women and you’re taking over our country and you have to go,’” Pinckney’s cousin said.

Few details are known of the alleged gunman. Roof had been previously jailed on drug charges in March, NBC affiliate WIS-TV reported. He was arrested on trespassing charges a month later. The 21-year-old’s uncle told Reuters that Roof had received a .45-caliber handgun for his birthday in April.

Except for the immediate block by the church, movement was free Thursday morning. Buses rumbled by, people cooled off in the shade of the park across the street. The brutal heat kept the streets relatively clear. Onlookers were, all things considered, few and far between. One man set up a banner “PUT DOWN THE GUNS YOUNG PEOPLE.” A Coca-Cola van stopped by to drop off free cold water for reporters camped out across the street.

Pastor John Paul Brown of nearby Mt. Zion Church said churches in Charleston are generally welcoming of strangers. “Charleston is called the Holy City for a reason,” Brown told msnbc. “To have that apprehension about the safety of churches, there’s just no way to lock every door and check everyone who comes in … You can’t say ‘I represent Christ, let me frisk you.’”

JA Moore, a family friend of Pinckney, said he had known the late pastor since he was a child.

“People are just trying to process it, people are trying to figure everything out, it’s hard to respond to this because it’s this fringe group of people, and it’s not like you can go after an establishment like the police department or the governor’s office,” Moore told msnbc. “It’s a powder keg. You’ve got to think this community that is just getting over Walter Scott, I think everyone is kind of on edge. I think right now people are just kind of waiting to see what happens. This is crazy.”

Bakari Sellers, a lawyer and former state legislator, described Pinckney as a “really good guy” who gave voice to the underserved. “People are just trying to figure out why. And asking the question, where can you be black, if you can’t be black in the street and you can’t even be black in church. That is a big question,” Sellers said.

“There are bad people in this world who are motivated by hate. Every decent person has been victimized by the hateful, callous disregard for human life shown by the individual who perpetrated these horrible acts,” Graham said in a statement. “Our sense of security and well-being has been robbed and shaken.”

“My heart is breaking for Charleston and South Carolina tonight,” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said in a statement. “Tonight we stand together in prayer for Pastor Pinckney and his congregation at Emanuel AME, and for the families who are enduring unimaginable pain at the loss of their loved ones.”

A prayer vigil was scheduled for noon Thursday at Morris Brown AME Church, Rev. Norvel Goff said during the late night press conference.

Jeb Bush, who had been scheduled to hold a town hall-style meeting in the city Thursday, cancelled the event “due to the tragic events unfolding in South Carolina,” a member of his campaign said.

The family of Walter Scott, a black man who was unarmed when he was shot and killed by a white police officer in North Charleston in April, released a statement Thursday condemning the “horrific tragedy” at Emanuel AME Church. “It is our hope that justice will come swiftly,” they said.

msnbc77,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pentagon-nominee-accidentally-tells-the-truth-about-gun-policy,"Dr. Dean Winslow, Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the Pentagon’s top health official, was on Capitol Hill yesterday for his confirmation hearing, and as Politico reported, it turned out to be a little more interesting than expected.

The most provocative exchange came when the discussion turned to Devin Patrick Kelley, who’s believed to be responsible for Sunday’s mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked if Winslow believes service members who are convicted of domestic violence charges should be dishonorably discharged.

“I’d also like to – and I may get in trouble with other members of the committee – just say, you know, how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy … a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used,” Dean Winslow, a physician and retired Air Force colonel nominated to be the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs, said during his Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) quickly interjected, “Dr. Winslow, I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise.”

I suppose there’s some truth to that, though Winslow is an experienced medical professional with an opinion.

As it turns out, of course, that opinion is deeply at odds with the beliefs of the president who nominated him for this Pentagon post. Donald Trump, for example, responded to the massacre in a Texas church by saying this “isn’t a guns situation.”

At this point, I haven’t seen any evidence that Winslow’s nomination is now in doubt as a result of his moment of candor, though it’s not difficult to imagine Trump’s far-right allies in the NRA and elsewhere raising concerns following yesterday’s hearing.

In theory, the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs doesn’t have any role in shaping gun policy, so it shouldn’t necessarily matter what Winslow believes about American consumers’ access to semi-automatic assault rifles, but recent history suggests that doesn’t matter: Senate Republicans delayed President Obama’s pick for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, for more than a year because he had the audacity to describe gun violence as a public-health issue.

The fact that the surgeon general doesn’t have a vote in crafting gun policy was deemed irrelevant."

When a president tweets insults at a Hollywood star, the dignity of his office is tarnished. When a commander in chief uses Twitter to attack a loyal military ally, America’s friends across the globe become unsettled. But when a president uses social media to question the legitimacy of a federal judge following an inconvenient (and temporary) outcome, that is simply unacceptable.

… when the president tries to undermine the legitimacy of the federal judiciary, he must be told in short order that the White House is picking a fight it will not win. For the sake of the country, let us hope the attacks on “so-called” Judge James Robart were merely reckless and not politically calculated. Because speeding further down that path would end in an ugly constitutional crash."
msnbc104,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trial-verdict-extended-ex-south-carolina-cop,"A trial verdict might not be reached until next July for a former South Carolina police officer who was fired after shooting an unarmed black man for a seat belt violation.

WATCH: Chilling new audio uncovered from S.C. shooting tape

On Monday, a solicitor requested that 270 days — the longest time possible — be allotted to reach a conclusion in the case of State Trooper Sean Groubert, The State reported. The solicitor can determine that a decision should be reached in 120, 180, or 270 days depending on the complexity of the hearings and the severity of the offense. The process was implemented in January 2003 to reduce the backlog of the county’s cases.

Groubert, who is white, stopped Levar Jones, who is black, for a seat belt violation on Sept. 4 in a gas station parking lot near Columbia, South Carolina. When Jones reached into his vehicle to grab his ID, Groubert suddenly discharged several gunshots at him, a dashboard camera in the officer’s cruiser allegedly showed.

“Get out of the car! Get out of the car!” Groubert is heard in the video shouting before firing off several rounds and telling Jones to drop to the ground.

“What did I do, sir?” Jones asked the officer after being shot. He was treated at a local hospital for an injury to the hip.

South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which acts as an investigative unit, stated that Groubert “did without justification unlawfully shoot Levar Jones.” Groubert was fired, arrested, and charged with assault and battery of a high and aggregated nature, a felony with a penalty upon conviction of as many as 20 years in prison. He plead not guilty, and according to his lawyer, was justified in shooting Jones because he feared for his life and the safety of others.

South Carolina Department of Public Safety later released another version of the dashboard camera video, which is almost an hour long, in which Groubert tells an individual, who appears to be his supervisor, his own version of the incident. His account appears to be in stark contrast of the footage recorded by the camera.

“Before I could even get out of my car he jumped out, stared at me, and as I jumped out of my car and identified myself, as I approached him, he jumped head-first back into his car … he jumped out of the car. I saw something black in his hands.”

Police brutality recently has received renewed national attention since the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. Protests and violence broke out in the St. Louis suburb following Brown’s death, and the community continues to demand justice. A grand jury is currently weighing whether or not to indict the officer who shot and killed Brown on criminal charges.

In Kansas City, Missouri, the FBI is investigating the case of a police tasing that put another cop’s son in critical condition and a medically-induced coma. And in Baltimore, Maryland, a cop was recently suspended after video footage surfaced of him apparently repeatedly beating a man."

msnbc107,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gun-lobby-who-got-elected-the-nra-board,"This year’s gun lobby board election brought a few surprises, as the National Rifle Association has been trying to keep the results (and the low voter turnout) quiet.

George K. Kollitides II is the founder and CEO of Freedom Group, America’s largest and most profitable firearms consortium. One of the company’s products is the Bushmaster AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that was used last December in the Sandy Hook school massacre.

Last year Freedom Group led the gun industry with record sales of almost $1 billion, or $931.9 million. Kollitides also quietly served last year on the NRA’s shadowy Nominating Committee for the NRA’s 2012 board elections, as reported in January in Mother Jones. His place on the Nominating Committee likely helped get his name on the NRA’s official ballot this year.

Yet he still lost his bid for the NRA board, according to election results just published in the August edition of the NRA’s American Rifleman magazine, available only to NRA dues-paying members, a copy of which was obtained by MSNBC. Kollitides remains a Trustee of the NRA Foundation, according to its latest annual report. The foundation’s activities include organizing gun safety and target shooting competitions for children.

Calls to Kollitides’ office at Freedom Group’s headquarters in Madison, North Carolina, requesting comment were not returned.

Other gun industry executives sit on the NRA’s board. Pete Brownell is the third-generation family CEO of Brownells, Inc., America’s largest supplier of firearms parts, tools and accessories. He easily won his reelection. His father and chairman of the board for the family business, Frank R. Brownell III, is also President of the NRA Foundation.

A representative of Brownells in Montezuma, Iowa, told MSNBC.com that neither executive was available for comment.

Two more gun industry executives sit on the NRA board. One is Ronnie G. Barrett, the CEO of the Tennessee-based Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, who designed the first .50 caliber rifle for civilian use. (Last week Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill that would have banned .50 caliber rifles in New Jersey.)

Another is Stephen D. Hornady, an NRA board director who, like Kollitides, is an NRA Foundation Trustee. Hornady is the second-generation family CEO of the Nebrasksa-based ammunition-making firm, Hornady Manufacturing.

Other gun industry figures like Larry and Brenda Potterfield of MidwayUSA, a Missouri-based retailer and wholesaler of firearms products, have contributed generously to the NRA through programs like “Round-Up,” which allows firearms consumers to round-up their purchase to the next dollar to make a donation in the name of defending the Second Amendment. To date MidwayUSA’s Round-Up program alone has contributed $8.9 million to an NRA endowment.

This year, as in previous years, the top two vote-winners in NRA elections have been Oliver North and Ted Nugent. North is the Fox News host who became famous as the protagonist of the 1980s-era Iran-Contra affair. Nugent is the rocker last seen on national television in January scowling down from the Capital gallery at President Barack Obama during the State of the Union Address.

Another popular NRA board director is Marion P. Hammer. A grandmother, under five feet tall, Hammer has long been the most influential gun rights activist in her home state of Florida, where she was also, by all accounts, instrumental in helping to pass Florida’s Stand-Your-Ground law.

Two other long-standing NRA board members were re-elected this year, despite an organized campaign among NRA Second Amendment activists against one, and a notable degree of negative comments online against the other.

H. Joaquin Jackson is a former, storied Texas Ranger-turned-actor who has played lawmen in films like Extreme Prejudice starring Nick Nolte and The Good Ole Boys directed by Tommy Lee Jones. But a video-recorded interview that Jackson gave back in 2005, saying that military-style semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 rifle have no place in hunting, led NRA activists this year to mount a Facebook campaign against him.

Former Senator Larry Craig is the longest-standing NRA board director, having been first elected in 1983. In 2007 Craig pled guilty to the charge of disorderly conduct for his behavior in a men’s room in Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, leading some NRA activists to turn against him.

Only NRA Life Members are eligible to vote, and this year, as in past years, no more than 7.2% of them, or 123,646 voters out of a total of 1,718,786 Life Members, cast a ballot, according to the independent, pro-NRA, Pennsylvania-based gun rights blog, pagunblog.com.

Life members were asked to vote for up to 25 out of 29 candidates. “No write-in candidates received 250 or more votes to quality,” reads an NRA note on the election results in American Rifleman.

The NRA has even failed to publish a list of its latest board of directors online. Earlier this year the group quietly took down a webpage roster of its board members, rerouting the page, www.nra.org/board, to the gun lobby’s home page.

NRA officials at the group’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia declined to comment.

Other notable NRA directors include the actor Tom Selleck, the former NBA basketball star Karl Malone, who is one of several African-American directors on the NRA’s 76-member board, and Grover G. Norquist, the Republican anti-tax crusader."
msnbc108,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-nra-finds-new-ways-stoke-the-fires-the-culture-war,"The National Rifle Association has a challenge: the far-right organization has allies running the federal government. In practical terms, that leaves NRA members with very little to fear, at least in political terms. The chances of a far-right Congress approving gun reforms that will be signed into law by Donald Trump are zero.

To be sure, the NRA still has to contend with public opinion. A new Quinnipiac poll, for example, released yesterday, found that 94% of Americans – including 93% of Republicans and 92% of voters in gun-owning households – support requiring background checks for all gun purchases.

But the fact remains that the NRA’s Republican allies will simply ignore public attitudes on the subject – a fact the NRA’s members are no doubt aware of.

How, then, will the group keep its supporters engaged? By pointing to a different enemy: Democratic officials may not be in position to approve any national policies, but there are still liberals out there who, the NRA says in a new video, need to be defeated in a culture war:

“They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse ‘the resistance.’ “All to make them march. Make them protest. Make them scream ‘racism’ and ‘sexism’ and ‘xenophobia’ and ‘homophobia.’ To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding – until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. “And when that happens, they’ll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. “I’m the National Rifle Association of America. And I’m freedom’s safest place.”

It’s quite a worldview.

As Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum noted, the NRA has clearly evolved from being an organization interested in the rights of gun owners, and become “a purveyor of wholesale culture war zealotry.” This video is powerful evidence of this: NRA members aren’t told to worry about legislation; they’re told to direct their fears at “comedy shows” and liberals who “terrorize the law-abiding.”

At the root of NRA propaganda in recent years is an unhealthy dose of paranoia and cultural resentment, and the byproduct is bizarre videos like the one the group released this week.

Vox’s report added, “It’s not hard to figure out what the narrative is here. A liberal insurgency is destroying American society. The ‘only way’ to protect yourself from this surge in left-wing violence (a made-up threat, to be clear) is to donate to the NRA.”"
msnbc109,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-meets-nra-tells-group-what-it-wants-hear,"At his White House meeting with senators on Wednesday about gun policy, Donald Trump offered hearty praise for the National Rifle Association, but seemed eager to suggest he doesn’t really care whether the NRA is satisfied with his agenda or not.

“They do have great power, I agree with that,” the president said of the far-right group and its members. “They have great power over you people. They have less power over me.”

At one point during the discussion, when Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) explained his bipartisan background-check bill, Trump effectively mocked his ostensible ally, telling the Republican his proposal didn’t deal with age limits “because you’re afraid of the NRA.”

Soon after, referring to no one in particular, the president added, “Some of you people are petrified of the NRA.”

Just one day later, Trump welcomed NRA representatives into the Oval Office, and while we don’t know exactly what was said, the far-right lobbying group certainly seemed pleased.

The top lobbyist for the National Rifle Association claimed late Thursday that President Trump had retreated from his surprising support a day earlier for gun control measures after a meeting with N.R.A. officials and Vice President Mike Pence in the Oval Office. The lobbyist, Chris Cox, posted on Twitter just after 9 p.m. that he met with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, saying that “we all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control. #NRA #MAGA.”

Around the same time, Trump boasted about the “good (great) meeting” he had with the NRA’s lobbyist.

The New York Times’ report noted that the twin messages “suggest that it may have taken the gun rights group only a little over a day to persuade the president to back away from his apparent embrace of gun control during a remarkable, televised meeting on Wednesday with members of Congress.”

I think “suggest” is the right word under the circumstances, because Trump himself doesn’t seem to know what he wants, or even intends, to do on gun policy.

After the mass shooting in Parkland, he called for action, but stuck to vague generalities. When the president started pointing to specific ideas, the White House took steps to backtrack.

On Wednesday, Trump seemed eager to embrace progressive reforms, bucking the NRA, only to meet privately with the NRA a day later, and apparently tell the group what it wanted to hear.

One of the more common criticisms of the president from public officials is that he invariably agrees with the last person he talks to, even if he said the opposite to the person before. There’s no great mystery as to why this happens – Trump doesn’t know or care about public policy – but on guns, he’s going out of his way to prove that those criticisms are accurate.

For their part, Senate Democrats yesterday unveiled a package of reforms, including universal background checks and a debate on assault weapons, because these are the exact ideas the Republican president expressed support for a day earlier. In effect, the Dems’ plan is a put-up-or-shut-up challenge to Trump.

I think we know which option the president will choose."

msnbc111,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pentagon-nominee-forced-withdraw-after-candid-comments-about-guns,"A month ago, Dr. Dean Winslow, Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the Pentagon’s top health official, was on Capitol Hill yesterday for his confirmation hearing, which seemed to be going well. Then the doctor made the mistake of being candid.

With the mass shooting in a Sutherland Springs church on the minds of many at the time, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked Winslow about service members convicted of domestic violence charges and whether they should be dishonorably discharged. As part of his answer, the doctor shared his belief that it’s “insane” that “in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy … a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used.”

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the committee’s chairman and a beneficiary of the NRA’s generous support, quickly interjected. “Dr. Winslow, I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise,” the Republican said.

Soon after, Winslow’s nomination was put on hold. This week, he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post explaining that his nomination is now over.

Last week, I withdrew my name from consideration to be assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. My appointment had been put on indefinite hold by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I felt the Defense Department needed to fill the position without undue delay. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines deserve the full complement of Pentagon appointees to support them. I am sorry not to be able to assist Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whom I deeply respect, in building the best and most efficient military health-care system possible. I have the credentials to help, including 35 years of experience in the Air Force (including four deployments to Iraq and two to Afghanistan after 9/11), in military and academic medicine, and in private practice, public hospitals, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries, and public health. But unfortunately, I do not possess one credential the committee wanted to see: I do not support the unrestricted ownership of semiautomatic assault weapons by civilians.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) noted yesterday, “Over the course of his six deployments, Dean L. Winslow wielded weapons of war and saw what they did to the bodies of soldiers. When he said those weapons don’t belong on our streets, his nomination to serve the Dept. of Defense was shut down.”

As we discussed in early November, it’s worth appreciating the fact that if Winslow had been confirmed to the position for which he was qualified, he wouldn’t have been able to affect gun policy in any way. Whether the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs agrees with the NRA’s agenda or not is ultimately irrelevant in a policymaking sense – because consumer access to weapons of war falls far outside the office’s purview.

But for Republicans, that didn’t matter. Winslow, a Trump nominee, shared the wrong thought out loud. Like much of the country, he thinks it’s “insane” for civilians to be able to buy semi-automatic assault rifles, and in this Congress, it’s a disqualifying sentiment.

“I have no regrets,” Winslow concluded in his op-ed. “Having semiautomatic weapons makes no sense. It is a public-health issue that, as a doctor, I felt compelled to bring to the Senate’s attention. As a citizen, I am saddened that our government has become so dominated by pro-gun lobbyists that an appointment such as mine – which has no responsibility for gun control – can be sidelined by a single sentence of informed, personal opinion. And that really is insane.”"

msnbc113,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/following-mass-shootings-house-gop-votes-expand-gun-rights,"It’s rare to see bipartisan agreement in Congress on any kind of legislation related to gun policy, but Democrats and Republicans recently agreed to a modest measure to improve national background check system.

But before the proposal could pass the House, Republicans decided to add something to it.

The House approved a Republican bill on Wednesday making it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. The “concealed carry” bill is the first gun legislation in Congress since mass shootings in Nevada and Texas killed more than 80 people. The House approved, 231-198.

The Associated Press’ report added that the change “is a top priority of the National Rifle Association,” which helps explain why GOP lawmakers made this change to an otherwise bipartisan bill.

The point of the policy is to effectively override state-based conceal-carry restrictions. As the New York Times’ article explained, “Some states … require that permit applicants have live-fire experience and safety training, along with a clean criminal history. Others are more lenient, and a dozen states do not even require a permit. The House bill would not force states to change their own laws, but it would treat a concealed-carry permit like a driver’s license, letting individuals allowed by one state to carry a concealed weapon with them into another state.”

As a political matter, it’s likely that the House bill will struggle in the Senate, where the bill will need 60 votes, which means the bipartisan effort on the background check system will die because of House Republicans’ efforts to approve the NRA-backed measure.

But let’s also not miss the larger context: two of the five deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have occurred since October. It’s already been a brutal year for mass killings in the U.S., and the year isn’t quite over yet.

It’s against this backdrop that congressional Republicans are pursuing policies to expand gun rights, not limit them."
msnbc114,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/nra-backs-cornyn-not-texas-tea-party-challenger,"Even gun giveaways aren’t enough for the National Rifle Association.

The NRA announced its support on Wednesday for incumbent Republican Sen. John Cornyn over challenger Steve Stockman, the tea partier famous for raffling an AR-15 rifle and sending outrageous tweets about abortion.

“The choice is clear for law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen in the U.S. Senate Republican primary election in Texas, and that choice is John Cornyn,” said Chris Cox, chairman of the group’s Political Victory Fund. “We urge all NRA members and like-minded supporters to vote John Cornyn for U.S. Senate.” He also noted the senator’s “A+ rating” on gun issues.

The support from the powerful lobbying group adds heft to Cornyn’s campaign, already millions of dollars ahead in fundraising with a $7 million war chest compared to Stockman’s $32,000.

In an effort to earn some extra dough, Stockman unveiled Obama “barf bags” for sale on his website Tuesday. For a $10 donation, voters will receive a bag with the president’s face on it accompanied by the tagline, “Socialism Makes Me SICK!”

Earlier in the year, he also offered bumper stickers reading, “If babies had guns, they wouldn’t be aborted.”

Stockman entered the Texas Senate race in the 11th-hour and he’s got a long way to go against the second-highest ranking Republican in the Senate. A GOP-leaning poll showed Stockman trailing Cornyn by 44 points.

Early voting in the Texas primary begins on March 4."
msnbc115,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/florida-gop-rejects-gun-measures-declares-porn-health-hazard,"It appears the Republican majority in Florida’s state legislature has a rather macabre sense of humor.

Just a week after a gunman killed 17 people in a massacre at a South Florida high school, the GOP-led state House had an opportunity to debate a ban on assault weapons; As the Miami Herald reported, the right had reason to be pleased with the outcome.

The bill (HB 219), which would ban the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines like the kind used by Nikolas Cruz, has been mired in a House subcommittee for months and has not been heard. Amid rising tensions at the Capitol, Democrats used a highly unusual procedure to try to move the proposal directly to the House floor for a debate and vote. Republicans voted it down, 71-36. Several survivors of the high school massacre, watching from the visitors’ gallery, were overcome with emotion, and the action set off a firestorm of controversy on social media.

The outcome was not unexpected, but that was little solace to those who hoped last week’s bloodshed might help Republican policymakers to reconsider their assumptions about gun restrictions.

But to fully appreciate the absurdity of the circumstances, consider the fact that while Florida’s state House wasn’t willing to tackle efforts to prevent gun deaths, it was willing to debate the public health risks associated with porn. The Tampa Bay Times reported:

The Florida Legislature is declaring pornography as a health risk. The state’s House of Representatives approved the resolution by a voice vote on Tuesday. The resolution states a need for education, research and policy changes to protect Floridians, especially teenagers, from pornography. Republican Rep. Ross Spano says there is research that finds a connection between pornography use and mental and physical illnesses, forming and maintaining intimate relationships and deviant sexual behavior. Spano is also a candidate for attorney general.

State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D) sponsored the assault-weapons measure and highlighted the depravity of yesterday’s developments.

“Has anyone had to bury their child because of pornography?” Smith asked reporters.

That’s hardly an unreasonable question."
msnbc116,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/nra-convention-feature-nonoperational-guns-floor,"The National Rifle Association’s annual convention kicks off in Nashville this week, with 70,000 people expected to participate in the three-day gathering.

Attendees can expect to find the usual NRA fare and exhibitors at the 350,000-square-foot Music City Center, but they shouldn’t expect to find functioning weapons. The Tennessean reports this week on the “multilevel security plan,” which includes an important safety measure: “All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational, with the firing pins removed, and any guns purchased during the NRA convention will have to be picked up at a Federal Firearms License dealer, near where the purchaser lives, and will require a legal identification.”

The New York Daily News sees some irony in the convention policy:

The National Rifle Association wants guns at schools, but not its own annual convention. […] NRA boss Wayne LaPierre has called repeatedly for allowing guns in schools, and other facilities. LaPierre says arming teachers and guards will help prevent gun violence. At least, outside the NRA’s own events.

Of course, there’s also a political angle to keep in mind as the far-right group gathers in Tennessee.

A s the local report noted, at least eight likely Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to speak at the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum: Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Mike Pence, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum, and Scott Walker.

Donald Trump and Sarah Palin are also expected to appear.

Correction/Update : Rather than leaving a confusing series of updates , let’s summarize what we now know. The original report from the New York Daily News , which said the NRA had “banned working guns” from the convention, was inaccurate – Tennessee’s open-carry laws still apply at the NRA event. The Memphis Daily News published a piece explaining Tennessee gun laws in more detail. Similarly, when The Tennessean reported, “All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational,” that referred to the guns on display at exhibitors, not the guns attendees bring themselves. updatesNew York Daily NewsMemphis Daily News

This does not mean, however, that convention attendees face no limits on where and when they can carry loaded firearms. We learned late Wednesday, for example, that no guns are allowed in the convention room during performances from Alan Jackson and Jeff Foxworthy. There’s also an expectation that gun owners will have the proper permits before bringing loaded weapons to see speeches from presidential candidates.

We’ve also since learned that Sarah Palin and Mike Pence have canceled their scheduled appearances."

msnbc126,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/public-attitudes-gun-policy-shift-quickly-following-parkland,"At an event in Florida last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) seemed displeased when his constituents applauded the idea of banning consumer access to semiautomatic rifles. The morning after, the Republican senator said such an approach would be outside “the mainstream.”

As a factual matter, Rubio’s understanding of public attitudes is clearly askew, but just as importantly, he and the rest of the political world should probably pause to appreciate just how much “the mainstream” has shifted of late.

Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to the highest level since 1993, and almost two-thirds say government and society can take action to prevent future mass shootings, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The findings suggest the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, has shifted public opinion on gun laws in a way other recent mass shootings have not. Overall, 70% now say they back stricter gun laws, up from 52% who said so in an October poll not long after a mass shooting in Las Vegas killed 58 people. Just 27% oppose stricter laws.

To be sure, it hasn’t quite been two weeks since the mass shooting in Stoneman Douglas High School, but if it feels like the reaction to the gun violence is different this time, it’s not your imagination.

After the Sandy Hook massacre and Las Vegas slayings, for example, CNN polling found about 37% of Americans “strongly” favored stricter gun control laws. Now, it’s 52%.

After Sandy Hook, about a third of Americans said government and society could take action that would be effective in helping prevent future tragedies. After Las Vegas, it was up to 47%. Now, it’s 64%.

There are some aspects of this that are not yet clear. We don’t know, for example, whether this is a short-term shift, which will fade when the immediacy of the bloodshed is no longer at the forefront of the public’s consciousness. We also don’t know whether Republican policymakers, generally resistant to any new gun laws, are going to ignore public attitudes, just as they did during recent fights over health care, immigration, and tax policy.

I’d also love to hear from polling experts whether – and to what degree – the broader support for new gun restrictions is tied to a broader public backlash to Donald Trump and his far-right agenda. In other words, 70% of Americans now support a more progressive approach to gun laws, but how much of that is the result of the prevailing political winds blowing to the left, bolstering the “resistance”?

Regardless, if the momentum on this issue can be sustained in the coming months, the Parkland issue may have helped change the 2018 midterms in a way the right won’t like.

Postscript: In this poll, 57% of Americans said they’d support “a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of rifles capable of semi-automatic fire.” Someone should probably let Marco Rubio know."
msnbc127,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-senator-gun-show-loophole-doesnt,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), after having been a senator for three weeks, made his second “Meet the Press” appearance yesterday, and was asked whether there are any regulations and/or restrictions on gun rights that he could support. The Republican said background checks to “prevent felons and those with serious mental illnesses from acquiring” firearms “make perfect sense.”

So, is Cruz on board with a universal background check system? Well, it’s complicated.

Though Cruz supports licensed firearm dealers running background checks as part of existing law, host David Gregory noted that 40% of gun sales don’t involve licensed firearm dealers – this includes firearms purchased at gun shows. Cruz disputed the statistic, adding, “You know, there actually isn’t the so-called gun show loophole. That doesn’t exist.”

And why not? Because as Cruz sees it, licensed firearm dealers are the ones conducting sales at gun shows, and these dealers already follow the law on background checks, so there’s no problem. Except, the senator is confused – as we’ve seen over and over again, background checks aren’t conducted at gun shows, and the loophole does exist.

Cruz can’t have it both ways. He can’t say he supports background checks in the interest of keeping weapons out of the hands of felons and the mentally unstable, while also saying he supports a system in which felons and the mentally unstable can get guns without background checks from private sellers.

On a related note, Cruz raised another argument that suggests he doesn’t quite understand the nature of the policy debate.

“[Y]ou have a lot of people that are worried about preserving the safety of their own home. If you’re talking to a single woman living in Anacostia, who has the misfortune to live next to a crack house, to hell her she doesn’t have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, I think is fundamentally wrong.”

Here’s the follow-up question I have for Cruz: who’s arguing that a single woman living in Anacostia can’t legally purchase a firearm? As best as I can tell, no one. Maybe she shouldn’t have access to an assault weapons intended for a military battlefield, and maybe she doesn’t need a high-capacity magazine, but the policy argument is not about whether Americans can have a firearm in their home. That debate has already been settled.

And given this, I can’t help but wonder if Cruz either doesn’t understand the nature of the conversation or if he’s trying to mislead the public with smoke-screen arguments that don’t make any sense."
msnbc128,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/georgia-house-passes-controversial-gun-bill,"The Georgia House passed a sweeping gun bill late Thursday night that allows firearms in bars, nightclubs, school classrooms and certain government buildings that lack security personnel or devices.

Lawmakers moved the bill through the House during the last hour of the night on Thursday, meeting their midnight deadline before the end of the current legislative session. If signed by the state’s governor, the law will give religious leaders the option to “opt-in” to allow guns on their worship premises, where violators cannot be arrested or fined more than $100 each. Additionally, it could grant citizens the right to carry firearms in bars, nightclubs, libraries, sports facilities, senior citizen and youth centers, and on K-12 premises by authorized administrators and teachers.

The law would also allow permit-holders to carry guns into Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints in airports with no penalty, which is a reduction from the maximum felony punishment currently in place. Individuals who claim ownership of a permit would be allowed to leave the security area without consequence, and officials could not detain them or ask to see firearms documentation.

The legislators’ decision is not only a “slap in the face” for victims of gun violence in Georgia, but also for all American sufferers, said Brian Malte, senior national policy director for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

“We know more guns is not a solution to gun violence, so it’s a very sad day in Georgia,” he told msnbc.

Though supporters are pleased with the approval of the bill, many wish it treated religious establishments similarly to bars, nightclubs and municipalities. The government does not belong in church affairs, said Jerry Henry, executive director of Georgia Carry. His group is a main proponent of the bill, also backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA).

“[The bill] means that if you are one who likes to protect yourself, that you have a whole lot more places to protect yourself. It means that if you’re a bad guy, you might want to think about going into some of those places,” Henry told msnbc.

Among other provisions, the law also changes Georgia’s self-defense measures by removing the penalty for possessing a firearm in an unauthorized location. If passed, the legislation will provide security to individuals carrying guns in unauthorized locations, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and without a license in locations currently prohibited.

“There are some states that take guns anywhere, anytime, and virtually for everyone, and they do it in piecemeal. Georgia has decided to do it all in one bill,” Malte said.

Opponents of the bill refer to the measure as an expansion of Stand Your Ground because it has the potential to give felons and other individuals currently banned from owning a gun permission to carry in unauthorized areas. George Zimmerman’s acquittal last summer in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin brought renewed national attention to the Stand Your Ground defense.

Georgia lawmakers, who passed the bill Thursday by a 112-58 vote, will now present the legislation to Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who plans to run for re-election on Nov. 4. Previously, Deal supported loosening gun restrictions, which earned him an “A” rating from the NRA and an endorsement for the GOP primary runoff election in 2010.

The bill is part of the “Safe Carry Protection Act,” which, until earlier this week, contained both a bill from the House and a revised bill from the Senate, as msnbc previously reported. Americans for Responsible Solutions deemed the original House bill “the most extreme gun bill in America.” The Senate version, however, offered fewer allowances for guns in certain places, including the opt-in provision not only to church leaders, but also to bar owners and municipal officials.

RELATED: Georgia bill could allow guns in bars, churches and airports

State senators passed the bill earlier this week before it went to the House. But a lack of transparency left many residents and organizations puzzled about which measures were included and which were removed from the legislation. Ultimately, House lawmakers took out language that would reduce the penalty for a permit-holder caught carrying a gun on a college campus from a misdemeanor to a fine.

“We were pleased that the final bill did not include the guns on college campuses and guns in churches provisions. But the fact remains this bill moves Georgia out of the mainstream,” Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, said in a comment. “Thousands of Georgians and tens of thousands of Americans will continue to show they are tired of the gun lobby advancing its extreme agenda at the expense of their families’ safety.”

House legislators passed a similar bill last year, but it failed in the state Senate. Until this week, legislators had not passed a gun bill since 2010, when they repealed the state’s public-gathering law and replaced it with a more defined list of places off-limits for carrying firearms. Georgia had the highest number of gun deaths per capita among the 50 states that same year, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Opponents view the current bill as a disturbance for places of worship, establishments that serve alcohol and school campuses where parents expect their children to remain safe.

Some institutions, including the Roman Catholic Bishops of Georgia, declined to comment on Friday until they analyzed and determined the effects of the possible changes.

Parts of the Georgia bill have surfaced individually in other states – including Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee – as the national debate about gun rights continues in the wake of the 2012 tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Oklahoma legislators passed a bill this week that would allow any college, university or technology school to establish a policy to permit license-carriers to possess firearms on campus. In Idaho, Republican Gov. Butch Otter last week signed into law a bill that prohibits state colleges and universities from regulating guns.

Ninety-one percent of Georgians supported mandatory background checks for all gun buyers, according to a poll published in March 2013 in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Conn.

Colin Goddard, senior policy advocate for Mayors Against Illegal Guns and a former Georgia resident, told msnbc: “You get to the point where you want to ask: ‘Who exactly are they doing this for?’”"
msnbc129,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jay-nixon-vetoes-bill-allowing-teachers-carry-concealed-guns,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon vetoed a measure Monday that would have permitted certain educators to carry concealed weapons on school property.

Nixon, a Democrat, cited student safety in public schools as a reason for concern.

“Arming teachers will not make our schools safer,” the governor said in a statement. “I have supported and will continue to support the use of duly authorized law enforcement officers employed as school resource officers, but I cannot condone putting firearms in the hands of educators who should be focused on teaching our kids.”

The measure would have allowed teachers to become “school protection officers,” according to the governor’s office.

“This bill, which would create a new mechanism for the arming of teachers, would not make schools safer,” added Nixon, who is also a former chief law enforcement officer in Missouri.

Monday was the final day Nixon was expected to take action on measures passed earlier in the year. But the legislation could survive if the Republican-led state legislature revokes Nixon’s temporary ban on the bill with a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate during a September session.

Some districts believe schools need armed teachers because they think law enforcement takes too long to respond to emergencies.

In the wake of school shootings across the country, some school board members sent voluntary faculty to a concealed-weapons training. At least 10 districts across Missouri have completed the instruction in the past 18 months.

Districts in other states – including Kansas, Ohio and Indiana – have also demonstrated interest in the training.

Ninety-one percent of teachers said they believe an armed guard would improve school safety at least somewhat, according to a membership poll published earlier this year by the Association of American Educators. Additionally, 75% of the surveyed members feel safe or very safe in their schools. About 20% of the organization’s 20,000 members responded to the survey.

"
msnbc130,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/cruz-acknowledges-dismisses-reality,"The right’s favorite talking point on expanded background checks is pretty straightforward: the popular, bipartisan proposal must be defeated because it’ll create a national gun registry. Reality proves this is the exact opposite of the truth, but the NRA’s allies keep saying it anyway.

Today, in an interesting twist, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) grudgingly acknowledged the truth, only to dismiss it in the next breath. For those who can’t watch clips online, Cruz told Capitol Hill reporters:

“I don’t disagree that on its face, the currently pending legislation does not purport to create a national gun registry. But the Department of Justice has been explicit that when you require background checks for private firearms transactions, the only way to make that effective is through a national gun registry. So if the bill that is pending on the floor of the Senate passed, the next step in the process would be that critics would say, ‘Well this isn’t effective. We don’t know if you’re selling your firearm to someone else unless we know you have your firearm.’ “And in my judgment a federal registry of firearms – the federal government keeping a list of every firearm that is lawfully owned by every law-abiding citizen – would be terrible policy and would be inconsistent with the Constitution.”

So, there is no federal registry. The legislation explicitly prohibits a federal registry. Under the pending bill, anyone even trying to create a federal registry would be a felon, subject to 15 years behind bars. No one has even proposed the possibility of a federal registry. But Cruz and his allies are convinced one will organically evolve to prevent private gun sales, even though the Manchin/Toomey measure targets gun shows and online sales.

In other words, Congress has to kill one idea, because there’s a paranoid fantasy about the possibility of a different idea coming up at some point in the future.

If this sounds familiar, it’s what unhinged critics of the Affordable Care Act said about “death panels.” Sure, there’s nothing in the proposal that would create “death panels,” but if you close one eye, tilt your head, and use your imagination, you’ll see it’s possible to envision a system in which the federal government starts murdering senior citizens.

This is no way for a mature democracy and ostensible superpower to debate public policy."
msnbc131,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-toll-gun-violence-children,"Over 7,000 children are hospitalized or killed due to gun violence every year, according to a new study published in the medical journal Pediatrics. An additional 3,000 children die from gun injuries before making it to the hospital, bringing the total number of injured or killed adolescents to 10,000 each year.

The new study, led by researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, highlights the toll gun violence has on child mortality rates in the country. Doctors surveyed the most recently released data from 2009 that tracked pediatric hospital stays.

“This study reinforces what we know from the mortality data,” Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told NBC News. “We have an extraordinary health burden in our youth associated with firearms injuries.”

In the 2009 Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID), 7,391 children under the age of 20 had been hospitalized for injuries from firearms and the majority of those gunshot injuries —4,559—resulted from intentional firearm assaults. 2,149 of those injured were accidents, and 270 were suicide attempts. Of the children who were hospitalized, 453 – 6% – died from their injuries.

“That’s more than 7,000 children injured badly enough to be hospitalized,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. John Leventhal, a pediatrics professor at the Yale School of Medicine. “All are unnecessary hospitalizations because preventing gun violence is something that can actually be done.”

Levanthal pointed out that parents should keep their guns locked in a safe hiding place and keep them separate from the ammunition to decrease the high number of accidental injuries, especially for smaller children.

Webster also suggested to NBC News that the government should make it illegal for individuals under 21 to own a firearm, referring to research that shows a peak in homicides between young adults age 18 and 20. “While you have to be 21 to purchase a handgun from a dealer, if you’re an 18-year-old you can go to a private seller and legally purchase a handgun in 38 out of 50 states,” Webster said.

Webster also compared the U.S.’ standing with other high income nations and pointed out that the mortality rate from firearms in the U.S. is nearly 10 times higher than the rates in other wealthy nations. “This is a very unique and abnormal problem that such a wealthy nation should have such high mortality and morbidity in youth related to firearms,” he said.

After the devastating tragedy at Sandy Hook in December 2012, the gun policy debate intensified, coinciding with the rising number of children killed by guns in the U.S. every year. In the first 14 school days of 2014, there have been at least 7 school shootings: at Wakefield Elementary School in Calif., Berrendo Middle School in New Mexico, Liberty Technology High School in Tenn., Albany High School in Georgia, Delaware Valley Charter School in Penn., Widener University in Penn., and most recently, Purdue University in Indiana. In 2013, there were 28 school shootings.



The American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in 2012 that “firearm-related deaths continue as 1 of the top 3 causes of death in American youth.”

“America’s pediatricians remain undeterred and united in our desire to see significant policy change to address this public health crisis,” the AAP wrote on the one-year anniversary of Newtown, pushing for tighter background checks, an assault weapons ban, and federal research on gun violence prevention."
msnbc132,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/court-upholds-strict-san-francisco-gun-laws,"A federal appeals court dealt a blow to the gun lobby on Tuesday by upholding two San Francisco gun laws requiring owners to securely store their weapons and regulating ammunition dealers.

Handgun owners in San Francisco currently must use trigger locks or secure weapons in a safe inside their homes when they are not carrying them. The restriction aims to prevent unauthorized users and children from accessing guns. Additionally, the city forbids licensed ammunition dealers from selling hollow-point bullets, which expand upon impact and can cause massive damage to the human body.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, defended the two separate pieces of legislation this week as reasonable attempts to increase public safety without destroying residents’ Second Amendment rights.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) and several other gun supporters objected to both laws with the belief that gun locks burden Second Amendment rights. The NRA did not respond to msnbc’s request for comment.

“Even when a handgun is secured, it may be readily accessed in case of an emergency,” Judge Sandra Ikuta wrote Tuesday in the three-judge panel’s decision. Residents are allowed to use handguns to defend their homes, she added.

The restriction on ammunition “imposes only modest burdens on the Second Amendment right,” Ikuta wrote of the other bill.

The Second Amendment protects individual rights, but the judges agreed the government can impose restrictions with the intent of enhancing safety, said Christine Van Aken, chief of appellate litigation and San Francisco’s deputy city attorney.

“The Ninth Circuit took the view that as long as it’s not a significant burden on the ability of people to have guns and use them when they’re needed, the government is allowed to regulate for good reasons. Here the idea is public safety and protecting children,” Van Aken told msnbc.

The case was the first that involved the safe storage of firearms at the federal level since a landmark decision in 2008 when the U.S. Supreme Court held the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense. The court then also struck down the portion of an act that required all firearms be kept unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock. (Similar to the San Francisco circuit court, the highest court in Massachusetts affirmed the state’s tough gun storage law last January.)

“It should encourage other communities that are thinking about safe storage laws that they’re perfectly consistent with the Second Amendment and constitutional. We hope it spurs action elsewhere,” Cody Jacobs, staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told msnbc.

The national debate about gun rights continues in federal and state courtrooms across the country more than a year after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Supreme Court this week ruled unanimously that federal law bans people convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse charges from owning guns.

But at the state level, Republicans lawmakers in Georgia last week passed a controversial “guns everywhere” bill that will allow firearms in bars, nightclubs, classrooms, and certain government buildings upon signature from the Republican governor. Legislators in the state House passed a similar bill last year, but it failed in the state Senate.

Similarly, Oklahoma legislators recently passed a bill that would allow any college, university or technology school to establish a policy to permit license-carriers to have guns on campus. In Idaho, Republican Gov. Butch Otter signed into law a bill that prohibits state colleges and universities from regulating guns.

Also in San Francisco, a district court last month crushed an attempt by gun advocates to block a city law banning magazines of more than 10 rounds. But the NRA continues to challenge a similar ruling in Sunnyvale, Calif., where a federal judge earlier this month permitted the city to enforce a voter-approved ban on high-capacity magazines.

Eight states and Washington, D.C., have enacted laws banning large-capacity ammunition magazines. Though the numerical definition varies, magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition generally are considered “large capacity.” The accused gunman in the Aurora, Colo., movie theater massacre used a 100-round magazine during the shooting, which killed 12 people and left scores wounded.

Lawmakers recently litigated these bans in both Connecticut and New York, where judges upheld the prohibitions on large-capacity magazines that can hold more than than 10 rounds, because the legislation balances Second Amendment gun rights and the Obama administration’s call to reduce violence.

By the end of last year, Americans’ support for tight gun-control laws had dropped to pre-Sandy Hook levels.

The nonprofit Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ranked California No. 1 and gave the state an “A-” grade for enacting 10 new laws in 2013 that strengthen gun restrictions. In 2010, the Golden State had the ninth lowest number of gun deaths per capita, according to the center. But California is the fourth largest supplier – among all 50 states – of crime guns to Mexico when population is taken into account."

msnbc134,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fireworks-and-firearms-freedomworks,"It’s been a few weeks since David Corn first reported on the behind-the-scenes drama at FreedomWorks, a powerful and well-funded right-wing organization, including the ouster of Dick Armey, who departed with an $8 million payout. We’ve since learned that allegations of wrongdoing and legal threats have intensified, and Corn obtained a memo from Matt Kibbe, president of the group, accusing board members of mounting a “hostile takeover.”

But to appreciate just how out of control things have become at the Tea Party group, take a look at this remarkable piece from Amy Gardner.

The day after Labor Day, just as campaign season was entering its final frenzy, FreedomWorks, the Washington-based tea party organization, went into free fall. Richard K. Armey, the group’s chairman and a former House majority leader, walked into the group’s Capitol Hill offices with his wife, Susan, and an aide holstering a handgun at his waist. The aim was to seize control of the group and expel Armey’s enemies: The gun-wielding assistant escorted FreedomWorks’ top two employees off the premises, while Armey suspended several others who broke down in sobs at the news. The coup lasted all of six days. By Sept. 10, Armey was gone – with a promise of $8 million – and the five ousted employees were back.

Like Josh Marshall, I noticed some chatter overnight about Dick Armey leading an “armed coup” at FreedomWorks, but it never occurred to me that the phrase was being used literally.

But it was. In early September, Armey marched into FreedomWorks’s office with his wife, his executive assistant, and an unidentified man with a gun. Matt Kibbe, the group’s president, and Adam Brandon, its senior vice president, were “promptly escorted” out of the building.

“This was two weeks after there had been a shooting at the Family Research Council,” a junior staff member told the Washington Post. “So when a man with a gun who didn’t identify himself to me or other people on staff, and a woman I’d never seen before said there was an announcement, my first gut was, ‘Is FreedomWorks in danger?’ It was bizarre.’ ”

That sounds like a perfectly good adjective under the circumstances.

We’re also learning, by the way, about some of the mysterious financiers behind FreedomWorks’ operation."
msnbc135,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/duncan-fears-irs-firearms,"With Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) retiring at the end of this Congress, I don’t think there’s any doubt who’ll replace her as Congress’ silliest conspiracy theorist.

Rep. Jeff Duncan wants to know why IRS law enforcement agents are training with AR-15 rifles. As chairman of the House Homeland Security oversight subcommittee, Duncan (R-S.C.) toured a federal law enforcement facility in late May and noticed agents training with the semi-automatic weapons at a firing range. They identified themselves as IRS, he said. “When I left there, it’s been bugging me for weeks now, why IRS agents are training with a semi-automatic rifle AR-15, which has stand-off capability,” Duncan told POLITICO. “Are Americans that much of a target that you need that kind of capability?”

If Duncan’s name sounds familiar, it’s because he’s developed quite a reputation lately. The South Carolina Republican, for example, is afraid of the Census Bureau. He’s also the same congressman who spewed bizarre conspiracy theories – which he apparently learned from Glenn Beck – about the Boston Marathon bombing, going so far that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano felt the need to say Duncan’s ignorant inquiries were “full of misstatements and misapprehensions,” and “not worthy of an answer.”

But what the rifle training for IRS officials? Maybe Duncan has a legitimate concern? Actually, no.

In a statement, the tax agency explained, “As law enforcement officials, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents are equipped similarly to other federal, state and local law enforcement organizations. Special Agents receive training on the appropriate and safe use of assigned weapons. IRS Criminal Investigation has internal controls and oversight in place to ensure all law enforcement tools, including weapons are used appropriately.”

All of this has the benefit of being true. Indeed, the IRS often investigates drug-trafficking operations, so it stands to reason officials would be well armed.

What’s more, as Steve M. noted, IRS guidelines were revised in this area in 2003. Note to Duncan: that was before President Obama took office.

I’ll just throw one more thought out there, in the hopes that the House GOP leadership will think it over: maybe this guy shouldn’t be the chairman of the House Homeland Security oversight subcommittee?"
msnbc136,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/restraining-orders-often-dont-require-surr,"One of the lesser-known battlegrounds of the gun violence debate is the relationship between firearms and restraining orders. In many states, those served with protective orders are not required to surrender their guns, even if gun-related threats have been made. Now, stats are surfacing that suggest seizing firearms in circumstances like these could prevent domestic homicides.

Take Barbara Diane Dye of Oklahoma. According to The New York Times, Dye got an emergency protective order against her husband, Raymond Dye, in 2010. She did this because she was afraid he would react violently when she served him with divorce papers. Approved for a temporary order, with a hearing for a lengthier one in three weeks, Dye hid out in Texas. When she came back in advance of the hearing, her husband cornered her in a bank parking lot, shot her repeatedly with a .357 revolver, and then shot himself with a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol. As he shot her, witnesses say, he kept repeating, “I love you, I love you…”

In her petition, Dye had revealed that her husband had an “arsenal” of weapons. Raymond Dye, however, was not required to surrender them after the protective order was approved.

This isn’t the only case of men disregarding restraining orders to come after their partner with guns. A 2001 study published in the Criminal Justice Review said that approximately one in five women who are shot by a partner had obtained restraining orders first.

The 1994 crime bill addressed this issue by disallowing those served with full protection orders the ability to purchase or possess firearms. Almost twenty years later, the provision is rarely enforced. Last year, prosecutors filed fewer than 50 such cases, according to a Times analysis of data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. This means the issue has largely been left to state regulation.

Some states–like California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts–require anyone served with a domestic violence order, temporary or not, to surrender their guns. Others–like Maryland and Wisconsin–require a full injunction before guns can be taken away. Many have no surrender requirement at all.

Advocates for domestic violence victims say the most dangerous time for a woman are the first days after the temporary restraining order is filed. Barbara Diane Dye, for example, was killed one week before her hearing for a full injunction. But the NRA has pushed back against federal and state measures pertaining to this issue. Being served with a restraining order is not a felony, and, according to Brian Judy, NRA lobbyist for Washington State, ”any crime that is serious enough to cause an individual to lose a fundamental constitutional right should be classified as a felony.”

“The NRA likes to think in terms of hypotheticals,” said msnbc’s Frank Smyth on The Last Word Wednesday. “But we’re not talking, in the real world, about hypotheticals. We’re talking about women who are intimidated, threatened, beaten, injured, and killed by men who have been subject to retraining order but still have their firearms.”

Domestic violence is a major contributor to gun deaths in America. A woman is two times more likely to be shot to death by male intimates than killed in any other way by a stranger. In 2010, 547 women were shot to death by a boyfriend, husband, or ex-husband."

msnbc151,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/all/hayes-thinking-always-our-best-weapon,"The most dangerous moment for any society is the moment France, and everyone who feels solidarity with its citizens, is now going through: when we are trying to process and respond to terrorist acts.

Because it is when our grief and our sorrow and our justifiable rage are at their peak that we are most vulnerable to the seductions of foggy, simplistic, emotion-driven thinking and to the acceptance of reactionary policies that, as we learned during a long and bloody 13 years in this country, don’t necessarily make things better, no matter how much we want them to.

“These moments call for rigor, for resolve and the courage to be clear-eyed and to resist the tug of cheap sentiment.” Chris Hayes

It has been inspirational to watch the courage and resilience of the French people taking to the streets in response to these horrific attacks, and the pluralistic message offered by people like Malek Merabet, the brother of the slain Muslim police officer, who condemned the killers as false Muslims and called for tolerance.

But we are also seeing all the familiar no good, horrible, bad thinking, once again, rush to the fore.

Whether it’s the French far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, who warns of a creeping Islamization of France that threatens civilization and whose message is seen by many as one of the chief beneficiaries of the violence, or the bad thinking of powerful News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, the man behind Fox News, who tweeted what, I shudder to think, a whole a lot of people are thinking: That while most Muslims may be peaceful, they still, quote, “must be held responsible” for the actions of terrorists.

The tweet prompted responses from J.K. Rowling and comedian Aziz Ansari, among many others, with Ansari sarcastically tweeting that Murdoch is responsible for pedophilia committed by anyone Catholic and asking why he is pro-pedophile, complete with sad emoticon.

The thinking reflected in Murdoch’s tweet suggests we are in the midst of some sort of clash of civilizations, with the West on one side and Islam on the other. It is precisely the sort of thinking that took hold after the September 11th terrorist attacks and led to a set of world-historical miscalculations and horrible mistakes and horrific death and destruction.

France is already on a war footing, with its defense minister proclaiming that ISIS must be wiped out and the country deploying 10,000 troops to boost security. France’s lower house of Parliament voted 488-to-one to extend French airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. Four hundred and eighty-eight to one.

I recognize those kind of margins. It’s the sort of margin that the Patriot Act passed by, and the Authorization for the Use of Military Force to invade Afghanistan.

This past Sunday, on Murdoch’s network, Fox News, a terrorism expert named Steve Emerson took anti-Muslim fear-mongering to a new low, claiming there are no-go zones throughout Europe where non-Muslims cannot visit, including one entire British city:

“In Britain, it’s not just no-go zones, there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in.”

Birmingham is actually only about 22% Muslim and Emerson’s bit of idiocy prompted a twitter hashtag, #foxnewsfacts, in which people made jokes like: ”Birmingham has a chain of fast food restaurants called ‘Burqa King.’”

Emerson later apologized profusely, though not before the British Prime Minister called him, quote, “clearly a complete idiot.”

And Emerson’s comment wasn’t even the dumbest to come out of all this. That honor belongs, sadly, to a member of Congress.

Representative Randy Weber, Republican of Texas, tweeted in response to President Obama not joining the Paris unity rally, ”Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris. (For all the wrong reasons.) Obama couldn’t do it for right reasons.” You’ll notice he didn’t bother with the spell check.

Weber offered a rambling and semi-incoherent apology saying he was not trying to trivialize the Holocaust nor to compare the president to Hitler.

When we see the blood spattered on the floor of the Charlie Hebdo offices, the mourners at the funeral of the French Jews killed solely because they were Jews, we naturally reach for words like evil, and conjure figures like Hitler and feel for a moment that the crimes we have witnessed have suddenly clarified everything. But that clarity is a trap. It’s the terrorists’ own lie, the one they wish to peddle to us all. The propaganda of fools and butchers.

These moments call for rigor, for resolve and the courage to be clear-eyed and to resist the tug of cheap sentiment. The terrorists want us not to think – they want us to cower, to rage, to fight.

But thinking is always our best weapon."
msnbc152,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/most-guns-mass-shootings-obtained-legally,"Authorities say Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27 — the shooters who killed 14 people and injured 21 others this week in San Bernardino — had two legally purchased .223 caliber assault-style rifles and two 9 mm semi-automatic handguns. Police want to speak to a friend of Farook who purchased the two semi-automatic rifles used in the massacre, authorities told NBC News Friday.

For gun control advocates, the shooting, which officials announced Friday is being investigated as an act of terrorism, resurfaced long-time concerns.

“The way our laws are structured unfortunately often times allow people to legally buy guns who shouldn’t,” said Mike McLively, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence based in San Francisco.

“The way our laws are structured unfortunately often times allow people to legally buy guns who shouldn’t.” Mike McLively, staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

Such was the case in other horrific mass shootings, including Virginia Tech in 2007 and the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting in June: in both instances the records of the gunmen likely would have raised red flags had they been fully examined through the federal background check system.

A large part of the problem: When an individual goes to buy a firearm, they are subject to investigation under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). A 72-hour hold is put on the sale.

But because federal law operates under the idea of “default proceed,” the sale can legally go through after 72 hours — even if a background check hasn’t been completed. About 9% of background checks require further investigation, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Officials have not said whether there was anything in the San Bernardino shooters’ backgrounds that would have popped up in a background check when they bought their weapons, and little is known about the friend who purchased the assault rifles that they used.

Alan Lizotte, a professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Albany, said secondary firearm transfers — private sales of weapons between individuals that don’t involve a gun dealer or manufacturer — are difficult to track.

“By and large, those secondary transfers aren’t regulated at all,” he said.

And even when they are, states don’t always get the information they need. In New York, for example, the SAFE (Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement) Act of 2013 requires a universal background check, meaning anyone who owns an assault rifle must register it with their county sheriff, whether it’s from a private sale or a gun dealer."
msnbc153,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/the-secret-weapon-could-save-the-voting,"Voting rights advocates are testing whether a little-used provision of the Voting Rights Act could limit the damage of the Supreme Court ruling that struck down a key part of the landmark civil rights law.

Hours after the Supreme Court’s verdict was announced, representatives for the state of Texas celebrated its demise by announcing that they would move ahead with restrictive voting law changes that will disproportionately disenfranchise minorities. Those changes were previously blocked by the Justice Department, through a part of the Voting Rights Act the forces jurisdictions with a history of discrimination in voting to submit their election law changes to Washington in advance, often referred to as “preclearance,” under Section 5. Preclearance prevented discrimination in advance, rather than relying on drawn out litigation that might not be resolved until long after ballots are cast.

Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which the high court struck down as unconstitutional, determined which jurisdictions were covered by that requirement. But Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act allows the federal government to subject jurisdictions with recent records of deliberate discrimination to the preclearance requirement. With Congress polarized and unlikely to come together to fix Section 4’s coverage formula, Section 3 could become the primary tool for the Justice Department and voting rights activists seeking to patch the gaping hole left by the Supreme Court’s verdict. Travis Crum, now a clerk for federal judge David S. Tatel, laid out this approach in an article for the Yale Law Journal in 2010, anticipating that the Supreme Court would someday strike down part of the Voting Rights Act. Crum called Section 3 the Voting Rights’ Act’s “secret weapon.”

Related: How Section 5 stopped a modern day ‘poll tax’



Voting rights advocates are already putting the Section 3 strategy to the test. Last Tuesday, attorneys representing the Texas branches of the NAACP, the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, and Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis in a legal battle with the state over Texas’ redistricting plan asked a federal court to place the entire state of Texas back under preclearance in accordance with Section 3.

“What the court found in the case as a factual matter, their findings were that the congressional map and the senate map were both intentionally discriminatory,” says Gerald Hebert, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center who represents the groups who filed the request. “That kind of intentional discrimination violates the 14th and 15th amendments.”

That high standard of proof is also part of what limits the effectiveness of Section 3 as a replacement for Section 4. To impose preclearance on a jurisdiction not covered by the now-defunct Section 4 formula, you have to prove that officials intended to discriminate. Under the old formula, all that had to be proven was that the election law changes would have discriminatory effects—precisely because most people are smart enough to hide when they’re deliberately trying to discriminate.

In Texas, state officials weren’t that smart. Nevertheless, the requirement that deliberate discrimination be proven means that it will be very difficult to subject states that try to disenfranchise minority voters to preclearance, because all they need is a superficial “race-neutral” reason for making the change.

“What you’re likely to see in states where these actions are brought is states trying to avoid an adverse Section 3 ruling by saying, our real intent here is to hurt Democrats. Since that’s our intent, that’s not a racial intent and that’s not forbidden by the Constitution,” says Brenda Wright, a legal expert with liberal think tank Demos. Judges might not subject jurisdictions to preclearance even if deliberate discrimination is proven, or they might do so only in areas related to the discriminatory policy.

Related: It begins: Republicans rush to change voting laws



Wright pointed msnbc to a 2004 Section 2 case in Massachusetts where officials said they were just trying to protect incumbents when they redrew legislative districts in a manner that weakened the voting powers of minorities. It just so happened that the incumbents happened to be white and the voters they were disenfranchising were black and Latino. The court didn’t buy it, but under Section 2, unlike Section 3, you need to prove only the changes will adversely affect minorities, not that they were intended to.

“Proving intent is not easy,” says Hebert, pointing out that in 1982 Congress changed the standard for proving discrimination in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in order to define changes that would have the “effect” of disenfranchising minorities as discriminatory. That was a change that Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion striking down Section 4, vigorously opposed as a young attorney in the Reagan Justice Department. Section 2 however, unlike preclearance, isn’t as useful for stopping discriminatory election law changes before they happen.

That’s why voting rights advocates are hoping that Congress will not only fix Section 4’s coverage formula, they will strengthen Section 3 so that jurisdictions who make election law changes that have the effect of disenfranchising minorities can be subject to preclearance. Relying on Congress to do anything to strengthen voting rights, however, is a gamble.

In the past Southern conservatives have bristled at being subject to Section 4’s preclearance formula, arguing that they are being punished for the past. Strengthening Section 3 could bypass their opposition. In the meantime, the Justice Department could divert some of the staff and resources once assigned to evaluating states subject to preclearance to ensuring that those jurisdictions with the worst records of discrimination are brought back into the fold under Section 3.

“It’s an important avenue for the department and other litigants to look at,” says Wright. “By no means is it going to be an adequate substitute for what we’ve lost with the Shelby County decision.”"
msnbc154,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-secret-weapon-fight-against-climate-change,"What if we could slow climate change with a few good inventions? That’s the promise of “geoengineering,” often described as plan B if all the politics and protests fail to spur a response to global warming.

RELATED: SCOTUS rules against pollution regulations

Some experts have suggested we repel the sun with cannon-fired reflective dust or clouds of reflective bubbles. Others have mused about free-floating filters to suck carbon from the air. Still others have never given up the old military dream of controlling the weather.

But besides being dangerous beyond belief – akin to levering the earth without knowing exactly where it will roll – these proposals might also be pointless. We already have the perfect geoengineering technology, as President Obama made clear in a joint press conference Tuesday with the president of Brazil.



They’re called trees.

Brazil has done more to slow global warming than any country on earth, primarily by protecting the trees of the rain forest, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday. Those trees were the offstage and understated star of a press conference between Presidents Obama and Dilma Rousseff.

Some environmentalists walked away grumbling, because Brazil didn’t announce a hard cap on greenhouse gases. The bigger news in terms of impact, however, is the country’s new pledge to stop illegal deforestation and regrow a patch of forest the size of Pennsylvania.

You could call it the Lorax-approved solution to global warming.

The Lorax is the Dr. Seuss character who speaks for the trees (because they have no tongues). Brazil already had more trees than most countries. Tuesday’s announcement—to restore 12 million hectares of the Amazon—means millions of additional green, barky things and a huge boost for global efforts to avoid catastrophic climate change.

That’s because trees gobble up carbon, cleansing the sky of the heat-trapping emissions that are blamed for the world’s rising temperatures and increasingly severe weather. If you don’t believe it, just ask a fifth grader: it’s called the earth’s “carbon cycle.”

In the last decade, the Brazilian government has overseen an 80% drop in deforestation, from 28,000 square kilometers a year in 2004 to about 6,000 square kilometers in 2013. It has also boosted agricultural yields, defraying one of the main motivations for further clear-cutting: the need to feed a growing population.

RELATED: Obama administration lays out doomsday climate change scenario

The amount of carbon dioxide sucked up by the Amazon may have fallen in recent years, studies show. But it’s still believed to be north of 1 billion tons a year. That’s equivalent to a two week slurp of all the carbon emissions on earth. If the country succeeds in replanting and restoring as much forest as it promised on Tuesday, it could add another 22 million tons of annual absorption capacity. That offsets thousands of cars and trucks.

“Brazil has reduced its emissions by around 41% as compared to 2005,” the two presidents said in a joint statement issued by the White House.” By comparison the United States has only cut its emissions by about 10%, which is enough to make us the second most aggressive country.

Of course, we can’t entirely plant our way out of danger. That’s why the two countries also agreed to expand the use of renewable energy, promising to generate 20% of electricity from wind, solar and other clean sources by 2030. Brazil also promised to put a limit on emissions ahead of the Paris Climate Change Conference this December.

That gathering could be the world’s last chance to avoid deeper changes to the climate, including more punishing droughts, severe storms and longer heat waves. Scientists insist that a cap on carbon emissions is the only long-term solution.

Trees can help us along the way, however, buying us time for the slow work of politics and preventing the need for more radical interventions. Plus, more trees would redeem the work of the Lorax, giving him a fan-fiction ending that just happens to be real."
msnbc155,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/golden-state-warriors-success-shouldnt-overshadow-openly-gay-team-president,"Largely overlooked amid the pomp and circumstance of the Golden State Warriors’ historic 73-win regular season, captured Wednesday night in front of a ferocious Oakland crowd, was team president Rick Welts, an NBA lifer who helped craft one of the league’s all-time great squads around MVP point guard Stephen Curry.

The fact that the sexual orientation of Welts, the first openly gay president of a major professional sports team, is a non-issue is itself historic. Although his journey to this point – helming a reigning champion commercial juggernaut – was anything but smooth.

Welts, who knew he was gay in his early teens, has been with the league since 1969. He started as a ballboy for the now defunct Seattle Supersonics, and then rose to the top echelons of the league’s front office, as a master of public relations. Welts was the architect behind the expansion of the All-Star Game into a full weekend, adding the three-point shooting competition. He helped Magic Johnson make the transition from HIV victim to advocate, and he was the brains behind the wildly successful marketing of the original Dream Team in 1992. He would later go on to successfully run the Phoenix Suns, but he had a secret – he was gay – and in the world of sports at that time, he felt he couldn’t divulge his truth.

“I just didn’t see how in men’s professional sports this would fit in and I wouldn’t be looked at differently than I wanted to be looked at,” Welts told Soledad O’Brien during a February appearance on HBO’s “Real Sports.”

It wasn’t until his partner succumbed to AIDS that Welts came forward and identified himself as a member of the LGBT community to then-NBA Commissioner David Stern. The warm embrace he received helped push him to be more public about his personal life (while he was still serving as president of the Suns), and in a small, symbolic way his gay pride has helped change attitudes and perspectives.

“People who once thought that gay people couldn’t be in sports, and couldn’t be out in sports are seeing someone succeed wildly. It’s really special,” OutSports managing editor Cyd Zeigler told MSNBC..

Still, the league has a long way to go before it can be considered a champion of inclusivity. Despite that fact that just three years ago, Jason Collins became the first openly gay active male athlete in one of America’s premier sports, the NBA has not yet heeded calls to relocate next year’s All-Star game in North Carolina in protest of the state’s controversial legislation that overturned local anti-LGBT discrimination ordinances, which was signed into law on March 24.

“If the NBA was so far ahead of the other leagues they would have gotten in front of the camera the next day [to decry the N.C. law],” said Zeigler.

In just the last few years, marquee players like Joakim Noah and Kobe Bryant have been fined for hurling gay slurs on the court. This past season, Sacramento Kings point guard Rajon Rondo was suspended for a game after hurling an anti-gay remark at a referee who was later to revealed to be a gay man. Meanwhile, players including Chris Bosh and Tim Duncan have been subjected to rumors and innuendo about their sexuality via memes and salacious gossip.

While the WNBA boasts many openly gay players and coaches, the NBA has still not been seen the same kind of representation on or off the court. Still, Zeigler believes the fact that Welts was able to successfully transition between two major NBA franchises without his sexuality being an issue is “powerful.”



According to Zeigler, Welts proved that what matters is who is “the best person for the job, whether they’re gay or straight.”

“It’s important to acknowledge him being gay,” Zeigler added, “but really nobody cares.”

“I hope in some ways just the way I am leading my life and what I represent to other people can be that person that I didn’t have,” Welts told HBO Sports. “That person that they can really relate to and say, ‘Wow that worked out pretty well for him.’”"

msnbc157,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/white-house-sends-provocative-shot-across-the-gop-congress-bow,"In a moment that raised eyebrows in D.C. yesterday, Nancy Pelosi said that if the Republican-led Congress can’t address the nation’s problems, these failing lawmakers should be replaced with members who know how to get things done.

Wait, did I say Nancy Pelosi? My mistake. It was actually White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, apparently indifferent to the fact that it’s her party that controls the legislative branch.

“I don’t think the American people elected Congress to do things that were easy. They elected them to make a government that works, to work properly, and to work for American people. And that’s their job. And if they can’t do it, then they need to get out of the way and let somebody else who can take on a heavy lift and get things accomplished. [„,] “If Congress doesn’t want to do the job that they were elected to do, then maybe they should get out of the way and let someone else do it.”

In all, the president’s chief spokesperson said three times at yesterday’s briefing that members of the GOP-led Congress should be prepared to “get out of the way” and let someone else do their jobs.

I can’t think of a modern precedent for rhetoric like this, with a White House controlled by one party threatening a Congress controlled by the same party. A former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called Sanders’ rhetoric “senselessly provocative.”

And yet, there’s no reason to think Trump World cares. Indeed, the president himself has picked all kinds of fights with individual Republican lawmakers, so Sanders sending a shot across the GOP-led Congress’ bow is consistent with the White House’s curious political strategy.

Don’t be surprised if Sanders’ quote ends up in some Democratic campaign ads next year. It’s a sound bite that could do some damage to incumbent Republicans in 2018, especially if lawmakers end up with no meaningful accomplishments after two years’ worth of work: “If Congress doesn’t want to do the job that they were elected to do, then maybe they should get out of the way and let someone else do it.”"

msnbc159,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-under-fire-after-obamas-warning-shot-guns,"TOLEDO, Iowa — Sen. Bernie Sanders is under fire from Democratic rival Hilary Clinton amid a new campaign by the White House to pressure Democrats into backing his gun control proposals.

On Thursday night, President Obama published an op-ed in The New York Times in which he warned he would “not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform.” Among other measures, the president called on Democrats to support ending a law that grants gun manufacturers immunity from certain lawsuits. Sanders voted for legislation that included the immunity provision in 2005 and indicated earlier this year that he still supports shielding gun companies and dealers from legal action.

Clinton called in to MSNBC’s “Hardball” on Friday to highlight the issue and criticized Sanders for voting multiple times against the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks on firearm purchases, as a congressman in the 1990s.

“When it really mattered, Sen. Sanders voted with the gun lobby, and I voted against the gun lobby,” she said.

RELATED: Sanders knocks Clinton on taxes

Regarding the immunity issue raised in the president’s op-ed, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs told Politico that Sanders was “willing to take another look at that legislation.” In an October debate, the candidate said he did not agree with the entire 2005 bill and was mostly concerned with protecting small gun shop owners rather than large companies.

Sanders told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Friday that he did not believe Obama’s Times piece was aimed at pushing him to the left on gun control and emphasized their agreement.

“You know, there are a lot of candidates and money in the House and the Senate who may be opposed to sensible gun control legislation,” Sanders said. “ I happen not to be one of them. I strongly support the executive order that the president is working on right now. “

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday that breaking down opposition to gun immunity among Democrats like Sanders was exactly Obama’s intention.

“I certainly noticed that Senator Sanders told one of your [colleagues] here when asked this very question, he was eager to point out that Senator Sanders had made clear that he was willing to revisit that position,” Earnest said. “That’s exactly the goal here, right? We want people to change their minds.”

Earnest added that he was not familiar with Sanders’ record and that the op-ed was “not any sort of secret or subtle signal to demonstrate a preference in the presidential primary” when it came to candidates. Nonetheless, he said that any Democratic nominee would need to prove their commitment to “common-sense measures” on guns in order to earn Obama’s support.

After lying dormant for years, gun control has increasingly become a core issue for the Democratic Party over the last four years after a wave of high-profile mass shootings. Even among Sanders fans on Friday, there was some unease over the current debate.

Waiting for Sanders to speak at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Tracy Carstensen, 33, said he was “95%” of the way to supporting the senator, but was concerned about the gun issue.

“He’s been very political about it,” Carstensen told MSNBC. “It’s the only issue where he seems somewhat insincere.”

Jeff Weaver, campaign manager for Sanders, issued a statement Friday afternoon reiterating that the candidate believed “Congress should re-examine a law on manufacturers’ liability” and raising doubts about Clinton’s commitment to the issue. As Weaver pointed out, Obama and Clinton clashed over guns in their 2008 primary, with Obama mocking Clinton as “Annie Oakley” after she accused him of alienating gun owners with his rhetoric."

msnbc167,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fbi-examines-whether-russian-money-went-the-nra,"Close video Russian money ties to NRA under FBI scrutiny Greg Gordon, investigative reporter for McClatchy DC, talks with Rachel Maddow about news that the FBI is looking into whether Russian money was funneled to the Trump campaign through the NRA. share tweet email save Embed

The National Rifle Association’s interest in recent presidential elections is, at face value, mundane. The NRA has repeatedly expressed its support for Republican candidates, and the fact that it backed Donald Trump in 2016 was one of the least surprising developments of the year.

But many have wondered about the degree to which the NRA intervened on the GOP ticket’s behalf in 2016. Four years earlier, for example, the far-right group was eager to defeat Barack Obama, and to that end, it spent $10 million to boost Mitt Romney’s candidacy.

In 2016, the NRA spent triple that to support Trump.

What’s more, most of money the group spent on the election was spent by part of the NRA’s operation that isn’t required to disclose its donors. McClatchy News reported this week that the FBI, according to the reporting, is exploring possible connections to Russia.

The FBI is investigating whether a top Russian banker with ties to the Kremlin illegally funneled money to the National Rifle Association to help Donald Trump win the presidency, two sources familiar with the matter have told McClatchy. FBI counterintelligence investigators have focused on the activities of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who is known for his close relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the NRA, the sources said.

As Rachel explained on last night’s show, Torshin, Putin’s friend, has faced allegations of money laundering and connections to organized crime.

He’s also a longtime NRA member who, during the 2016 campaign, made multiple efforts to arrange behind-the-scenes meetings between Trump and Russians.

Indeed, you may recall a New York Times report from December about the “Kremlin Connection” email.

A conservative operative trumpeting his close ties to the National Rifle Association and Russia told a Trump campaign adviser [in 2016] that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between Donald J. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, according to an email sent to the Trump campaign. A May 2016 email to the campaign adviser, Rick Dearborn, bore the subject line “Kremlin Connection.” In it, the N.R.A. member said he wanted the advice of Mr. Dearborn and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, then a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump and Mr. Dearborn’s longtime boss, about how to proceed in connecting the two leaders. Russia, he wrote, was “quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S.” and would attempt to use the N.R.A.’s annual convention in Louisville, Ky., to make ” ‘first contact.’ ” The email, which was among a trove of campaign-related documents turned over to investigators on Capitol Hill, was described in detail to The New York Times.

The efforts, the article added, centered on the NRA’s 2016 event and “appeared to involve Alexander Torshin.”

New York’s Jon Chait, noting this and other links between the NRA and Russia, made the case yesterday that the far-right group “is part of the Trump–Russia scandal now.”"
msnbc168,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/gen,"Former Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led the war in Afghanistan, endorsed strong gun control laws Tuesday on Morning Joe.

“I spent a career carrying typically either an M16 or an M4 Carbine. An M4 Carbine fires a .223 caliber round which is 5.56 mm at about 3000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It’s designed for that,” McChrystal explained. “That’s what our soldiers ought to carry. I personally don’t think there’s any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America.”

The AR-15, the civilian version of an M-16 or M-4, has been the weapon of choice in many recent mass shootings —both Adam Lanza and James Holmes used them in Newtown and Aurora, respectively. Since Lanza massacred 20 young children in Newtown, Connecticut, gun control has returned to DC’s front-burner and the president has called for strict gun control measures.

“We’ve got to take a serious look—I understand everyone’s desire to have whatever they want—but we’ve got to protect our children, we’ve got to protect our police, we’ve got to protect our population,” McChrystal said. “Serious action is necessary. Sometimes we talk about very limited actions on the edges and I just don’t think that’s enough.”

McChrystal led the American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, but resigned amidst scandal after Rolling Stone magazine published a controversial profile that portrayed the General and his staff as dismissive and disrespectful of the president.

Tragic shooting sprees aside, McChrystal also pointed to the more deadly and common gun violence—32 people die each day from gun violence—as another reason he believes gun control is necessary.

“The number of people in America killed by firearms is extraordinary compared to other nations, and I don’t think we’re a bloodthirsty country,” he said. “We need to look at everything we can do to safeguard our people.”"
msnbc169,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/gun-lexicon-if-you-speak-out-speak-accura,"I bet you can tell the difference between a horse and a zebra. But can you identify the family, genus, species and subspecies of every animal on the planet?

Like zoo animals, guns are familiar to us all–we see them in movies, many of us own guns. But few of us are experts.

The vast lexicon of gun verbiage is arcane and incredibly technical, and misused most often by the voices most vocal on gun control. Sometimes it’s ignorance, but more often it’s an effort to scare and confuse the public to advance a political agenda. Either way, if we’re going to solve gun crime, we have to get our facts straight. Here’s a crash course.

The term “rapid fire” is meant to conjure scary images of fully automatic bullet spray. Think Rambo–squeeze the trigger and 30 rounds spit out. But the weapons used in Aurora, Newtown, and virtually every other mass shooting in recent history were not fully automatic. They were semi-automatic, meaning one trigger pull, one round.

Rapid fire doesn’t describe the gun used, it describes the shooter’s ability to shoot and reload quickly. So when you say you want to ban “rapid-fire guns,” you might be talking about the handgun your mom keeps by her bed or even the shotgun your dad hunts deer with.

There is no such thing as “high-capacity ammunition,” as the Washington Post called it, or “high-capacity weapons,” as Politico called them. High capacity refers only to magazines, the ammunition-feeding device.

But even when used correctly, the term is arbitrary. There’s no single definition for what makes a magazine high-capacity. The 1994 assault weapons ban limited magazines to 10 rounds, because that probably sounded sufficiently scary.

But banning high capacity magazines is like banning big gulps. Shooters can get around magazine restrictions by–you guessed it–buying more magazines.

Assault weapons is the mother of irresponsible, meaningless catch-all terms.

The term is so ambiguous that neither the federal government nor individual states have a single definition. The 1994 ban defined an assault weapon as a rifle or pistol that has a detachable magazine and at least two other largely cosmetic features, like a bayonet mount, flash suppressor, or pistol grip.

Even each of the seven U.S. states that has an assault weapons ban defines them differently.

Gun control activists most likely mean semi-automatic weapons, and again, that’s a category that includes the most popular guns used for self-defense, competition shooting and hunting.

This may seem like nitpicking. But when President Obama promises that “no one is talking about taking away your hunting rifle or your self-defense handgun” it matters that gun control activists may in fact be talking about taking away your hunting rifle or your self-defense handgun, whether they know it or not.

So let’s forgo the arbitrary, ambiguous, fear-mongering terms and get specific about what we actually mean by gun control. It may be politically effective to rail against “rapid-fire, high-capacity assault weapons” but it doesn’t actually mean anything. If we’re serious about solving gun crime, we should at least start by getting the terms right."
msnbc170,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/nra-blames-hollywood-culture-violence,"After the nation observed a moment of silence at 9:30 a.m. this morning, exactly one week after 20 children and six teachers were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the National Rifle Association broke its silence and delivered its highly anticipated message to the nation. NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre blamed a range of factors but specifically targeted Hollywood, the media and the video game industry for the heightened culture of violence, specifically gun violence, in the United States.

LaPierre discussed the “dirty little truth that the media try their best to conceal”–that the media’s celebration of violence and the glorification of killers “act as silent enablers.” Equally, video games allow players to simulate mass murder. His solution? The nation must deploy armed guards for every school. The lobbying group plans to initiate this effort by launching the National School Shield Program, headed by former Congressman Asa Hutchinson.

There’s the blood-soaked slasher films like “American Psycho” and “Natural Born Killers” that are aired like propaganda loops on “Splatterdays” and every day, and a thousand music videos that portray life as a joke and murder as a way of life. And then they have the nerve to call it “entertainment.” But is that what it really is? Isn’t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? In a race to the bottom, media conglomerates compete with one another to shock, violate and offend every standard of civilized society by bringing an ever-more-toxic mix of reckless behavior and criminal cruelty into our homes—every minute of every day of every month of every year.



LaPierre said the media’s emphasis on violence breeds a more violent society. But James Poniewozik of TIME wrote that “violent video games, and other gory entertainments, are popular in Japan, where guns and gun murders are scarce. If this doesn’t exonerate, or excuse, dumb violence, it at least indicates that armed assaults don’t leap fully formed from American TVs.” He points to a media scholar’s research that pop-culture violence does not directly cause real violence.

Hollywood stars released a new ad today petitioning President Obama and Congress to end gun violence. President Obama responded personally via YouTube today to the 32 separate gun control petitions and once again backed “common sense legislation that has the support of the majority of American people,” such as banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. “I will do everything in my power as president to advance these efforts, because if there’s even one thing we can do as a country to protect our children, we have a responsibility to try.”

Since LaPierre did not take any questions at the press conference, a flurry of celebrities responded on Twitter.

msnbc171,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/introducing-the-nra-kingmakers,"The rites of spring rarely change. Every year, even before the season opens for wild turkey shooting, hunters begin sighting-in their shotguns in the field. And just like the beginning of the hunting season, every spring, members of the National Rifle Association will learn whom their leaders have quietly picked for reelection to the NRA’s governing board. Eligible NRA members will also receive their paper ballots in the mail.

The NRA board appoints a shadowy committee to handpick almost every candidate appearing on the ballot annually. The Nominating Committee members for this year’s NRA board elections include highly-connected Republican leaders, along with figures connected to the nation’s largest conservative lobbying group, gun manufacturers, and even the New York State Police, reporting and internal documents obtained by msnbc show.

The NRA board appointed nine individuals, including six board members and three people from outside the NRA, to the 2013 Nominating Committee last summer—before Mitt Romney’s loss in the presidential race and December’s Newtown, Connecticut Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

But few NRA members—less than 7%—even take the time to vote. “I don’t bother anymore,” posted an NRA member in California, under the screen name HunterJim, “the insiders have set this system up so no outsider is going to be elected.”

Learning who is on the board’s Nominating Committee provides a rare window into the usually obscure gun lobby. At a time when the Obama administration and California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein have proposed a ban on assault or military-style semi-automatic weapons, the NRA is moving in the other direction—having placed three “black gun” or Bushmaster AR-15 advocates on the 2013 Nominating Committee. The NRA is also reaching out to Latinos, perhaps realizing that, like the GOP, it must diversify if it is to survive. Even as some conservatives begin to wonder out loud whether the gun lobby has become a liability, the NRA is connecting with different camps within the Republican Party, along with the conservative and neo-conservative movements.

“These people don’t have the slightest idea how to make their case before a skeptical and increasingly liberal public,” recently wrote one blogger with the user name kowalski, on RedState.com. “It’s not their ideas—it’s the presentation of those ideas by these toupeed old white males who are positively hated in this culture right now but they still cannot face the music.”

There are usually up to 30 candidates on the ballot to elect 25 directors, or nearly one-third of NRA directors, to serve a three-year term. (One director, the 76th board member, is elected annually from the NRA’s convention floor to serve for one year.)

Although a few candidates often make the ballot through a grassroots petition, the rest are placed there by the Nominating Committee and almost all of their choices win. It “is a sad testimony to how seriously flawed the NRA election process is” noted gun rights blogger Jeff Knox, “and the NRA’s unwillingness” to change it.

Matt Schlapp, one of the 2013 members of the Nominating Committee, is a former senior White House adviser to President George W. Bush who served as deputy assistant to the president and director of political affairs. Schlapp is also a board member of the American Conservative Union. He is not an NRA board member and holds no publicly discernible position on the NRA.

“I’ve only attended one meeting,” said Schlapp who confirmed his role on the 2013 Nominating Committee in a brief telephone interview with msnbc.

Another committee member, Joseph P. DeBergalis Jr., is a 25-year-veteran New York State Police Officer and supervising investigator, according to a report by the Albany Times Union. DeBergalis has been a board director for the NRA since 2009. DeBergalis, whose name is not listed on the NRA website’s list of board directors, is from New York, which recently passed the strictest assault-weapons restrictions in the country.

The N.Y. State Trooper is a competitive sports shooter and a “black rifle”, or Bushmaster AR-15 advocate, according to the website of ARFCOM or AR-15.com, a gun rights community that endorsed DeBergalis’ past two successful bids for the NRA board. The Bushmaster AR-15 gained notoriety in 2012 after it was used in December’s grade school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. DeBergalis did not return calls requesting comment and NRA officials at the organization’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, declined to comment on why his name was not listed on the site.

DeBergalis also has ties to Brownells Company, an Iowa-based firearms manufacturer specializing in selling firearms accessories, parts, and gunsmith tools to the public, as well as police departments across the nation. The company’s website boasts that Brownells “respects and supports the 2nd Amendment—protecting your right to keep and bear arms.” Brownnells Company chief executive officer, Pete Brownell, serves with DeBergalis on the NRA board. DeBergalis is also a Brownells Company “Volunteer Training Instructor,” according to the Brownell Company’s website.

The make-up of this year’s Nominating Committee also suggests that the NRA may be attempting to diversify beyond what one gun rights blogger called “the OFWG” or “Old Fat White Guy hoe-down.” Nearly a handful of African-Americans are now on the NRA’s board, most notably the former Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers forward Karl Malone, who has been the face of the gun lobby’s “I’m the NRA” national advertisements. Yet it is still hard to find many African-Americans at NRA conventions. “I met twelve black persons in attendance at [last year’s NRA] conference in St. Louis,” wrote Rick Ector in his blog Legally Armed in Detroit.

Will the gun lobby do any better with Latinos? Another Nominating Committee member is Antonio Hernández. He is one of the first Hispanics recruited for the Nominating Committee; since 2001, there has been one Chicano on the NRA board. Hernández is the deputy legal counsel of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico, and endorsed Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Hernández holds no other position in the NRA. In a brief telephone interview, he confirmed his assignment and said that he is a sports shooter.

Following the intense scrutiny the NRA has faced in the wake of the Newtown massacre, some Republicans have begun to openly worry about their association with the gun lobby. At a time when Republican leaders are trying to reach out to both Latinos and women, some fear the NRA and its stubborn response to gun violence may only hinder the GOP’s appeal.

The experience of NRA director H. Joaquin Jackson underscores the gun lobby’s challenge as it tries to diversify. Already a storied Texas Ranger, Jackson gained national prominence when he was recruited by the actor/director Tommy Lee Jones to play a Texas Sheriff in the 1995 TV film “The Good Old Boys.” In 2001, the NRA’s then-Nominating Committee put Jackson on the election slate for the board, where he has served since. But in 2005 Jackson told the Texas Monthly in an on-camera interview that he opposed both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, leading some NRA members to demand he be recalled. Jackson, who later said he misspoke, is one of the board members up for reelection this spring.

“I was very disappointed watching that news conference—which it wasn’t—it was just a painful slog from one end to the other,” posted kowalski on RedState.com following NRA chief executive officer Wayne LaPierre’s press conference one week after the Newtown shooting. “What LaPierre said in the abstract was helpful, but he really did look and sound like he was delivering the message from a funeral home, as the undertaker of something already dead.”

Last month, reporting for Mother Jones, I obtained the NRA Report of the 2012 Nominating Committee to elect candidates to the NRA’s current board of directors.

“There is little change of any injection new blood,” complained gun rights blogger Knox. “Historically we can expect that at least 23 of the 25 incumbents will win reelection.”

The NRA’s 2012 Nominating Committee Chairman was Patricia A. Clark, a competitive sports shooter and longtime NRA board director who happens to live in Newtown, Connecticut just a few miles from the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Quietly serving under her on the same 2012 Nominating Committee was George Kollitides II, the chief executive officer of the North Carolina-based Freedom Group, one of the nation’s largest gun making consortiums that made the Bushmaster AR-15 rifled used in Newtown, last summer in Aurora, Colorado, and in and around Washington by the DC sniper a decade earlier.

One 2013 Nominating Committee member, Carolyn D. Meadows, sits on the board of the both the NRA and the American Conservative Union. Two other NRA directors, the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist and NRA President David Keene, are also on the ACU board. (Another ACU director, Asa Hutchinson, is an NRA consultant. A former U.S. Attorney, Arkansas Republican Party chairman, and Bush administration drug enforcement chief, Hutchinson was recently appointed by NRA CEO LaPierre to lead the NRA’s National School Shield Emergency Response Program that aims to put armed guards or police in every school.)

The rest of this year’s Nominating Committee are pulled from the gun lobby’s own locker. William H. Allen, this year’s Nominating Committee chairman, serves as Inspector with Tennessee’s largest Sheriff’s office. Allen is also a champion competitive shooter and Second Amendment activist who, like DeBergalis, enjoys the support of the AR15.com “black gun” group.

Charles L. Cotton, pulls double-duty as the NRA’s trustee of its Civil Rights Defense Fund and takes up cases to establish legal precedents in favor of gun owners, along with his work on the Nomination Committee. Longtime NRA director, Ret. Air Force Gen. William H. Satterfield served in the Reagan administration as both general counsel of the Federal Regulatory Commission, and as deputy solicitor in the U.S. Interior Department. Rounding out the committee is J.D. Williams a Texas-based lawyer and former trustee of the NRA Foundation. Williams and Satterfield each seem more like older generations of NRA leaders, as they are both hunters and conservationists involved in preserving wildlife habitat for game fowl and waterfowl.

Richard Pearson is not an NRA director but, like fellow committee members DeBergalis and Allen, Pearson competes in High Power matches using AR-15 and other long-range, semi-automatic rifles. He is the third person appointed by the board from outside the gun lobby—after Schlapp and Hernandez–to the Nominating Committee. An insurance broker, Pearson is executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association and a certified semi-automatic firearms instructor.

This year, some of the better known NRA directors up for reelection include former Republican Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, Brownells gun maker CEO Pete Brownell, retired All-Pro NFL defensive tackle, sports shooter, and former spokesman for Winchester and Fiocchi Ammunition Dave Butz, former Idaho Senator Larry Craig –who resigned over allegations of sexual impropriety in a men’s room, Marion P. Hammer, the petite grandmother and gun rights advocate most responsible for Florida’s Stand-Your-Ground law, former Iran-Contra-era White House official and news commentator Oliver North, and the rock artist and Vietnam War-era draft dodger, who last year was visited by the U.S. Secret Service after using threatening language against President Obama, Ted Nugent.

The Nominating Committee controls the slate for board and knowing the composition of this year’s Nominating Committee suggests that –despite America’s worst gun tragedy two months ago at the Sandy Hook school—the NRA is already planning to dig in and fight any proposed restrictions or regulations of guns, no matter how reasonable they may seem to the rest of the nation."

In the wake of the devastating mass shooting in Las Vegas, several Democratic policymakers are renewing their push for measures intended to reduce gun violence. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), for example, said yesterday he’s moving forward with a proposal to strengthen background checks – an idea that’s long enjoyed broad national support.

Also yesterday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reached out to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), requesting that Congress create a bipartisan select committee on gun violence to examine which policies are most effective in saving lives.

In all likelihood, Republicans will ignore these requests. In fact, as the Washington Post reported, GOP lawmakers are eyeing new proposals to weaken gun restrictions, not strengthen them.

Last month, a House committee advanced a bill, the Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, that would make it easier to buy firearm silencers, which are treated akin to machine guns and explosives by federal authorities. Advocates of the measure, including the National Rifle Association, have cast it as a safety enhancement. […] The legislation also includes provisions that would loosen restrictions on transporting firearms across state lines and prevent certain types of ammunition from being designated as “armor-piercing” and thus subject to tighter federal oversight.

The bill, which we’ve been keeping an eye on in recent months, was poised to come up for a vote this week, but in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, GOP leaders have delayed consideration of the legislation.

If that sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because this isn’t the first time: Republicans initially delayed the bill on silencers because of the mass shooting that nearly killed House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). In other words, a mass shooting delayed a Republican gun bill, which made a comeback, only to be delayed by another mass shooting.

GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, are also eyeing a bill to allow states to honor conceal-carry permits across state lines, potentially weakening state-based restrictions, though it too will probably be delayed by the Las Vegas slayings.

If either (or both) of the measures pass, it won’t even be the first gun bill approved by this Congress. A bill to expand gun access for the mentally impaired was approved in February.

Indeed, we appear to be looking at an arrow that’s only allowed to point in one direction. After the gun massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, the only federal gun measures that passed eased gun restrictions. A year after Newtown, the Boston Globe examined state laws and reported, “Today, it is easier, not harder, to carry a gun in many parts of the nation than it was before the Newtown massacre last Dec. 14.”

So long as GOP officials have power, this will continue indefinitely."
msnbc173,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/lawmakers-introduce-measure-ban-high-capacity-magazines-0,"A group of lawmakers introduced a measure in Washington on Thursday that aims to end the sale of large-capacity ammunition, used by mass shooters in Newtown, Connecticut; Aurora, Colorado; Tucson, Arizona; and Fort Hood, Texas.

Co-sponsors Rep. Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut and Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, both Democrats, unveiled the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act. The bill would ban the importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

“The only thing more senseless than the gun violence that has taken too many of our nation’s children and countless innocent Americans is the failure of Congress to pass common sense gun safety measures, like this one, that are supported by 90 percent of the American public,” Menendez said.

RELATED: Newtown families sue rifle manufacturer

High-capacity magazines can hold up to 100 rounds of ammunition. During the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, the gunman used a 30-round high-capacity magazine to fire 154 shots in less than five minutes. He killed 20 first-graders and six educators. Eleven students escaped because the gunman had to pause to reload his gun. Supporters argue the new bill could save lives by forcing potential future shooters to change magazines more often.

Eight states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning large-capacity ammunition.

Several gun-control advocates joined Esty and Menendez during their afternoon press conference, including House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and advocates from the Newtown Action Alliance. The measure also includes the authorization of buyback program for high-capacity magazines.

RELATED: The gun control success stories you haven’t heard

For almost two years, Congress has been in a stalemate about gun-safety legislation, following the failure of the Senate to pass a comprehensive and bipartisan background checks bill in April 2013. In that time, nearly 100 school shootings have occurred on American soil, the FBI says mass shootings are on the rise, and active-shooter and lockdown drills have become part of children’s academic routines. A review of 62 mass shootings in a 20-year span found that large-capacity ammunition magazines were used in half of the incidents.

Ten families that were affected by the mass shooting at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, 2012, filed a lawsuit in December against Bushmaster for making, distributing, and selling the AR-15 rifle. The action alleges negligence and wrongful death."
msnbc174,msnbc,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/slideshow/inside-the-2016-nra-convention,"This May, Louisville, Kentucky played host to the National Rifle Association convention — an annual meeting of pistols and politics that this year boasted a 500,000 square foot firearms display. The convention, conceived by the Union officers who founded the NRA after the Civil War, is in its 145th year.

On its opening night, NRA leaders endorsed Donald Trump for president just before the presumptive Republican nominee took the stage and declared, “crooked Hillary Clinton is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office.”

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre also chimed in on the Democratic front-runner, saying that “if she could, Hillary would ban every gun, destroy every magazine, run an entire national security industry right into the ground and put gun-owners’ names on a government registration list.”

“Hillary Clinton,” warned NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox, “has a legitimate chance to be the next president as long as people like us stay home.”

In response, Clinton, who has advocated for change in American gun policy but has never suggested, despite Trump’s claims, abolishing the Second Amendment, tweeted that the country should not accept 33,000 gun deaths in a year as “normal,” adding that “we can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence.”

Meanwhile, hundreds of NRA members, toddlers in tow and guns in hand, shopped the grounds of the convention showroom, where patriotic emblems abound and defense of the “Constitutional right to bear arms,” is key.

BlackRock Inc. BLK -1.75% went public with the questions that it is asking gun makers and sellers in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., an unusual step by the world’s largest money manager by assets.

The notice, posted to BlackRock’s website Friday, is the latest sign that some money managers are ramping up pressure on companies that make and sell weapons. The questions range from litigation risks and gun safety to background checks and staff training.

“We cannot dictate what a company should do,” BlackRock said, but warned it generally has the ability to vote against individual directors or in favor of shareholder proposals.

Blackstone Group LP last weekend asked outside fund managers to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns. State Street Global Advisors, another big money manager, has said it also plans to reach out to gun makers with questions.

A number of U.S. companies have reassessed their relationships with the gun industry and the National Rifle Association following last month’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Major retailers, including Kroger Co. , Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., said this past week that they would stop selling guns to anyone under 21 years old.

BlackRock is the largest shareholder in gun makers Sturm Ruger & Co. and American Outdoor Brands , AOBC -0.81% formerly known as Smith & Wesson, as well as a large shareholder in firms such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods. BlackRock said in the notice that it doesn’t own any gun makers in its actively managed stock funds, and in its index-tracking funds, those companies account for 0.01% of assets under management.

The New York money manager has met with clients, including pension funds and other institutional investors, to discuss ways they can exclude gun stocks from their portfolios if they wish to and what BlackRock is asking of executives at companies that make or distribute guns, according to people familiar with those efforts.

It held one such conference call for large customers as recently as Friday morning, with executives focused on corporate stewardship and client relationships.

BlackRock and other large money managers that control funds tied to market indexes say they prefer not to use their heft to make immediate demands such as putting an individual on the board or divesting business units, in contrast to more aggressive dictates from activist directors. Instead, they say they like to work behind the scenes and question their portfolio companies routinely about their policies and plans.

But it is rare for BlackRock to make those questions public.

Last year, BlackRock stopped short of detailing the types of questions it asked company boards and executives in a paper that broadly laid out how it engaged with its portfolio companies on climate-change risk.

In the notice Friday, BlackRock called gun violence “an issue of tremendous urgency.”

The questions the firm said were being posed to gun makers and distributors include broad inquiries such as how they measure the “financial, reputational and litigation risk” of those respective businesses and what actions they take to support gun safety and education.

But BlackRock is also posing specific queries of gun makers, such as if they monitor whether the distributors of their weapons “have a high volume of their guns identified as having been used in crimes,” if they are spending money on research to improve gun safety, and if they require retailers to train their staff or certify that they conduct background checks.

For gun distributors, BlackRock asked what steps they take to make sure gun laws are followed such as “prohibiting felons or domestic abuse offenders from purchasing firearms; sales to minors of certain products; training provided to employees so they comply with applicable laws and regulations.”

BlackRock previously said that it planned to meet with weapons-related companies but stopped short of publicly articulating what type of information it planned to seek from them. It and other managers of index-tracking funds typically keep the contents of their engagements with portfolio companies private.

“We are fundamentally looking to understand whether the company has the appropriate policies and controls in place and is sufficiently managing the risks associated with these issues,” the new BlackRock notice said.

It’s the newest question facing CEOs: Should they thrust their businesses into polarizing political debates?

In the two weeks since a gunman killed 17 people at a Parkland, Fla., high school, many companies have taken a stand on gun control, prompted partly by a movement with the online rallying cry #NRABoycott.

But when companies take sides in a charged issue, they often have to grapple with a new set of risks to their reputation and business, not least the risk of offending a sizable portion of consumers on the other side.

On Wednesday, Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. DKS -1.78% —two of the biggest gun sellers in the U.S.—joined the growing list of companies taking action after the Florida massacre. Both companies said they would raise its minimum age for gun buyers at their stores to 21. Dick’s also said it would stop selling all assault-style weapons at its 35 Field and Stream stores and would no longer sell high-capacity magazines of ammunition.

“We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms,” Walmart said in a statement. The retailer, which sells rifles, shotguns and ammunition in thousands of its stores, had stopped sales of assault-style rifles in 2015.

“Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America—our kids,” Dick’s Chief Executive Edward Stack said in a letter posted on Facebook and the company’s website. Many consumers took to Twitter and Facebook to either condemn or praise the move.

Rival Academy Sports + Outdoors, in Katy, Texas, though, defended its gun sales. It said it is committed to the legal and safe transfer of firearms and favors strengthening the nation’s background-check system.

Business leaders are increasingly under pressure, largely from younger generations of socially conscious and digital-media savvy consumers and employees, to take a stand on everything from immigration to gay rights to climate change.

Nearly half of millennials, a generation largely born in the 1980s and 1990s, believe CEOs have a responsibility to speak up about issues important to society, according to a 2017 survey by Weber Shandwick. In contrast, only 28% of Generation Xers, now in their 40s and early 50s, and baby boomers agreed.

Michael Dowling, CEO of Northwell Health, the biggest hospital chain in New York state with 66,000 employees, said he feels more responsibility now to speak up on social issues than when he took the helm in 2002.

“We are, at the end of the day, community leaders,” Mr. Dowling said. “We are people that other people look up to.”

In some cases, companies’ responses have unleashed an online backlash as heated as the initial social-media firestorm—a reminder to companies that in placating one consumer group, it’s easy to alienate another.

A recent survey found companies that have ended discounts for National Rifle Association members in recent days lost more than they gained in reputation. For example, while MetLife Inc.’s 45% favorable rating didn’t change after respondents learned it ended its NRA discount, the proportion of respondents with an unfavorable view of MetLife doubled to 24%. The poll of 2,201 Americans was conducted by market-research firm Morning Consult. A spokesman for MetLife declined to comment.

Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. incurred the wrath of Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, after dropping its discount on flights to the NRA’s annual convention. He also threatened to kill a pending bill that would provide a jet fuel tax break at Atlanta’s airport, Delta’s main hub. Mr. Cagle called on Delta to fully restore its relationship with the NRA, which claims nearly five million members.

“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” he tweeted.

Delta didn’t respond to requests to comment. When the airline ended the discounts, it said it supported the Second Amendment right to bear arms but cut the program to reflect its “neutral status” in the national gun debate.

The NRA lashed out at companies that canceled loyalty programs for its members, calling the moves “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.” “These companies seem to have forgotten that using their businesses as political platforms…isn’t a particularly bright business strategy,” said Brad Lena, an NRA member and retired marketing consultant in Pittsburgh. “If companies are going to start punishing certain segments of their consumers, then consumers are going to realize they can also punish those companies.”

Wary of such vitriol, some companies tried to walk a fine line. Walking a fine line, FedEx Corp. said Monday it supports restricting assault rifles and large-capacity ammunition magazines to military use only, but would continue to offer discount shipping for NRA members.

“FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues,” the company said.

That didn’t sit well with DJ Hanson, co-owner of BlueprintNYC LLC, an event-planning company with offices in New York and San Mateo, Calif. BlueprintNYC suspended preliminary talks to have FedEx as a client, he said.

“We feel strongly about working with companies that share our values and beliefs,” Mr. Hanson said, citing the shipper’s decision to continue discounts to NRA members.

A FedEx spokesman didn’t respond to requests to comment.

Companies often beat legislators in pushing social change. The corporate world began offering same-sex couples health-care benefits long before politicians on either side of the ideological spectrum began endorsing same-sex marriage en masse.

Bill Penzey, the CEO of Wauwatosa, Wis.-based spice seller Penzeys Ltd., has written long online posts about the president, the NRA and Russia. He found taking on President Trump has, at times, jump-started orders. A July post on the company’s Facebook page promoting Mexican vanilla extract and accusing the president of racism resulted in the 32-year-old company’s best day of sales ever.

Penzeys has lost some longtime customers but gained new ones. Society no longer seems to find it strange that he’s selling politics alongside peppercorns, Mr. Penzey said. “I think we’re even getting to the point where those things are inseparable—business and social issues are inseparable.”

“If you’re an investor or asset manager and you see these rock-bottom evaluations of Equifax, it had to have given you pause,” said Jon Hale, head of sustainability research at Morningstar Inc. “This is an instance where ESG analysis was really ahead of the curve.”

Asset management firms including BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. , Oppenheimer Funds and Nuveen have been pushing ESG as a feel-good flavor of index investing that offers a chance to beat plain-vanilla peers. More than 20 new exchange-traded funds have been launched since the start of 2016.

It is an outgrowth of ethical investing, but instead of boycotting heavy polluters or human-rights violators, these loosely defined strategies preserve broad market exposure. Instead of investing based on a company’s market value, like most traditional indexes, the ESG approach weights investments based on how companies score on issues like carbon emissions, workplace safety or executive pay.

The concept is popular in Europe and Asia, particularly among big institutional investors. In July, insurance giant Swiss Re pegged its $130 billion portfolio to MSCI ESG indexes, and the Government Pension Investment Fund for Japan, the world’s largest pension fund, did the same with a slice of its assets.

“We believe it makes economic sense,” said Guido Fürer, group chief investment officer for Swiss Re, in an email. “Data suggest that taking a long-term view on responsible investing is at least as much about limiting downside risks as benefiting from upside potential.”

While this approach may make investors feel good, critics say many ESG funds often deliver similar returns to their traditional competition but at a higher cost. For example, the ESG version of an iShares ETF that buys emerging markets returned 22.5% in the past year, compared with 21.2% for the plain-vanilla version. The cheapest iShares emerging markets ETF returned 19.8%.

“If the main virtue of ESG, from an investment perspective, is that it keeps you out of trouble, and trouble makes you lose money, then you should lose less money over time,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research for FactSet. “But that’s not what we see.”

To come up with the rankings, analysts comb through news stories, financial records, regulatory filings and company reports looking for risks that traditional financial analysis might miss. Each firm is then scored on the key risks facing its industry, and those results feed into the overall rating for the firm.

For example, MSCI downgraded Wells Fargo & Co. in November 2015 noting a high level of customer service complaints, months before the company was fined for “widespread illegal” sales practices.

Linda-Eling Lee, MSCI’s global head of ESG research, said the scores aren’t meant to predict share prices or financial results, but to measure key risks that may have a long-term impact on a company’s long-term returns.

“We’re not in the business of trying to predict scandals or fraud. We’re trying to give a gauge of vulnerabilities,” Ms. Lee said.

MSCI deemed privacy and data security a key risk for 740 firms of the 2,500 companies in its popular all-word index. Equifax was one of only 25 to score zero. By comparison, competitor TransUnion Corp. scored 4.9 on a 10 point scale, and Experian PLC earned a 6.9.

When MSCI issued its report on Aug. 2, 2016, Equifax was trading around $131 a share, about $18 higher than it is now.

“The reason Equifax stood out was that it was one of the few companies that had already experienced data breaches,” Ms. Lee said. She declined to name other firms that scored zero on privacy and data security, citing a firm policy not to single out particular companies.

Sustainalytics, an MSCI competitor in ESG scoring, also flagged data security issues at Equifax months before the Sept. 7 announcement of a “cybersecurity incident” in which criminals gained access to Equifax customers’ names, social security numbers, birth dates and addresses.

An Equifax official said in an email that the firm has taken steps to prevent future intrusions: “We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security of the information in our possession.”

There are only a handful of retail funds using the MSCI ESG index that expelled Equifax, but at least a couple of mutual funds sold their Equifax stock last November when the index rebalanced. A Northern Trust mutual fund sold 1,870 Equifax shares, and the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund sold 36,000 shares.

Equifax shares closed at $114.45 on Nov. 30, just 1.3% higher than Thursday’s close.

It be Mr. Barton’s second time at the club in his more than 31 years in Congress – and the two coaches spent most of their joint press conference talking about how times have become more partisan in Washington, and attributing it to a climate that may have led to the shooting on Wednesday morning.

“Members are not looked at as people anymore, we’re kind of looked at, I won’t say targets, but people think they can come to our town hall meetings and just say the most obnoxious things and think we won’t feel it,” Mr. Barton said, referencing the rowdy constituent meetings that members have faced as they’ve gone home this year.

Mr. Doyle pointed to the pressure on members to get home right after votes on Thursday or Friday said to not assimilate to Congress, saying it limits time to socialize.

“We’re not allowed to stay here because then we’ve gone Washington,” he said.

The two hope that the game brings a sense of camaraderie and raises money for charity – though they both adamantly refused the idea that the teams should not be drawn across party lines, an idea floating around on Twitter as a sign of bipartisanship. Both said they were plotting ideas to honor Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and hoped he could watch it on CSPAN from the hospital."

Several companies have cut ties to the National Rifle Association after consumers took to social media to voice outrage against the gun lobby, days after a Florida high-school shooting left 17 people dead.

Insurance giants Chubb Ltd. CB -0.53% and MetLife , MET -0.72% cybersecurity company Symantec Corp. SYMC -3.29% , and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Enterprise, Alamo and National rental-car chains, were among those that said they would end partnerships with the NRA.

Saturday, both Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL -1.01% and United Airlines, a unit of United Continental Holdings Inc., UAL -1.16% ended their discount travel programs with the organization. The airlines also asked the NRA to remove their information from its website.

Companies are reacting partly in response to a social-media movement to pressure or boycott entities with NRA ties, energized by the emotional calls for gun-control action from survivors of the shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and students around the country. On Friday, the hashtag “#BoycottNRA” was among the top trends on Twitter nationally.

One of the first companies to sever ties was First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately owned bank in the U.S. The bank said Thursday it wouldn’t renew its contract with the NRA for a co-branded credit card, which was promoted as the “official credit card of the NRA.” The NRA Visa card offered a $40 cash-back bonus, enough to pay for the gun lobby’s $40 annual membership fee.

“Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA,” the bank said in a Twitter post, following which it decided not to renew its contract.

An NRA spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the companies’ decisions to cease such partnerships. But in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, NRA head Wayne LaPierre railed against “the elites” for renewing calls on gun-ownership limits. “As usual, the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,” Mr. LaPierre said.

In recent years, companies and their leaders have become vocal on issues such as transgenderism, immigration policy and gay rights. Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN -2.21% Jeff Bezos last month granted $33 million in college scholarships for illegal immigrant high-school graduates in the U.S. In the aftermath of North Carolina’s now-repealed “bathroom bill,” which required transgender people to use public bathrooms based on their birth sex, companies including PayPal Holdings Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Adidas AG scuttled or froze plans to add jobs in the state.

However, the business community has been more reticent about wading into the gun-control debate. Many companies worry about the threat of boycotts from the NRA, which claims some 5 million members, said Larry Hutcher, a co-founder and managing partner at New York law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, who has advised companies on public-relations crises.

That corporate reluctance may be changing as public support for some gun-control measures appears to be building, Mr. Hutcher said. A Quinnipiac University National Poll conducted earlier this week found that two-thirds of American voters support stricter gun control, the highest level of support measured by the survey ever.

“Companies are looking at the same numbers as we do,” Mr. Hutcher said. “That’s why they feel confident enough to terminate these relationships.”

Enterprise Holdings, which had a partnership with the NRA to provide discounts to the association’s members, said Thursday that its three rental-car brands would end the discount program on March 26. Hertz Global Holdings HTZ -1.67% and Avis Budget Group followed with similar announcements on Friday.

Symantec said it would stop a discount program for its LifeLock identity-theft and Norton anti-malware software for NRA members. Chubb said it planned to stop underwriting NRA-branded insurance policies for gun owners, though it said it had made the decision several months ago.

The NRA, like many member associations, has had discount partnerships with numerous companies listed on its website for products ranging from wine to hotel reservations to FedEx shipping expenses. Lists of many of those companies have circulated on social media with calls to pressure them to end their relationships with the gun lobby.

FedEx didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other companies targeted in the boycott campaign include Amazon. Under the hashtag #StopNRAmazon, consumers on Twitter have demanded that the company ban NRATV, the gun lobby’s news outlet, from being streamed on Amazon platforms.

Amazon representatives weren’t immediately available for comment.

“I’m someone who will buy napkins from @Amazon rather than go to the store but if @Amazon, @Amazonhelp, and @JeffBezos don’t stop streaming the violent rhetoric of NRAtv, I may have to leave the house again,” tweeted one user.

Lisa Murkowski, shown in June in Washington, is a strong gun-rights supporter who hails from a state that has legalized marijuana use. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty images

Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s husband and sons ordered her a new Benelli 12-gauge shotgun as a gift, but when the Alaska Republican—and enthusiastic duck hunter—went to pick it up, she was puzzled by a question on the federal background form she had to fill out.

The form asked if she used marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes, both of which are legal in Alaska. If she answered yes, she would be unable to get the gun, because federal law prohibits anyone who uses illegal drugs from buying a firearm.

The senator doesn’t use pot, but she was taken aback by the notion that an activity that is legal in her state could block gun ownership. “I don’t like marijuana—I voted against legalization—but we passed it,” she said in an interview. “Now, you’ve got this conflict.”

The scope of that conflict just grew, as voters in eight states last week approved marijuana-related ballot initiatives. Now, 29 states and Washington, D.C., allow marijuana use in some form, including eight that allow recreational use. Yet federal law still holds that anyone who uses marijuana, even medicinally, is doing so illegally and can’t buy a gun.

That is upsetting advocates for both gun owners and pot smokers, groups that don’t always find themselves on the same side of the cultural divide.

“This idea that you somehow waive your Second Amendment rights if you smoke marijuana” is wrong, said Keith Stroup, founder of NORML, which advocates marijuana legalization. “In particular, if you are using marijuana as a medicine, the idea that you have to choose between your health and the Second Amendment is offensive.”

“The Gun Control Act prohibitions are governed by the Controlled Substances Act, and marijuana remains an illegal, controlled substance under federal law,” said Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr.

Justice oversees the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which regulates licensed gun dealers; as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which runs background checks; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which classifies drugs.

The marijuana-gun issue is one of the stranger outcomes of an unusual conflict between state laws, which increasingly allow marijuana use, and federal law, which continues to view pot-smoking as a crime.

At issue are the applications that would-be gun buyers must fill out when they visit licensed firearms dealers. Question 11(e) on ATF Form 4473 asks whether the purchaser is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana.

Related Video The legal, recreational use of marijuana passed in four states on Tuesday with another three states passing it for medicinal use.

Under ATF guidance distributed to gun dealers, anyone who answers affirmatively can’t buy a firearm. If a dealer has reason to believe the would-be gun purchaser is a marijuana user, the ATF says it is the dealer’s responsibility to halt the sale of a firearm or ammunition.

“There are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana purportedly used for medicinal purposes, even if such use is sanctioned by State law,” the guidance says.

The issue can be tricky, especially for those who oppose drug use but support gun rights. Perhaps for that reason, gun-rights groups have been relatively quiet on the issue. The National Rifle Association, for example, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Officials at Gun Owners of America highlight the medicinal-marijuana issue. “GOA finds it very troubling that the Obama administration would use medical issues to ban law-abiding Americans from owning firearms,” said the group’s executive director, Erich Pratt.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled recently that banning gun sales to medical marijuana users doesn’t violate their Second Amendment rights. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law, the court noted, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use in treatment.” The DEA reaffirmed that status just last August.

States that passed and/or expanded medical marijuana proposals Nov. 8: Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota States that passed full legalization proposals Nov. 8: California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada

Ms. Murkowski wrote Attorney General Loretta Lynch in March urging her to reconsider the policy. “In my judgment, the disqualification of an entire class of marijuana users acting consistent with state law from possessing any firearm merits a review of federal legal policy,” Ms. Murkowski wrote.

Mr. Carr said the Justice Department responded to the senator’s letter in October. “It is not the department’s general practice to release publicly private communications with members of Congress.”

Ms. Murkowski said she understands the concerns about gun owners using marijuana, but said similar dangers could arise regarding alcohol. The conflict will likely intensify, she added, as more states approve marijuana use.

Marijuana advocates say legal users of the drug are discriminated against in other ways as well, from child custody and banking to student loans and public housing.

“Even if you’re a progressive who doesn’t like guns or a libertarian who doesn’t like public housing, you should still be outraged by the discrimination that people who use marijuana face,” said Tom Angell, founder of Marijuana Majority, which supports legalization.

BEIRUT—Gunmen early Saturday stormed an office of a Syrian paramedic group that is active in opposition-controlled areas, killing seven of its members and stealing two vehicles and other equipment, the group and opposition activists said.

The Syrian Civil Defense group, more popularly known as the White Helmets, said in a statement that the attack happened in the early hours in the town of Sarmin, in the northwest of the country.

The first responders have been known to risk their lives to save people from the civil war, now in its sixth year. The group was also nominated for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the rare attack but it came amid tension in the area. Sarmin is in Idlib province, which witnessed clashes recently between al Qaeda-linked fighters and members of the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham group that ended with al Qaeda fighters capturing much of the region.

The al Qaeda-linked Hay’at Tahrir al Sham said over the past weeks that its members had discovered Islamic State sleeper cells. The Al Qaeda affiliate that used by to be known as Nusra Front fought deadly battles with Islamic State over the past years.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the seven were killed after being shot in the head, adding that the killings were discovered when volunteers arrived to start a shift and found the bodies of their colleagues.

“Until now it is mostly likely a crime. It might also be an attack aimed to harm the image of Nusra Front and to show that Idlib is not safe,” said Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the observatory.

An opposition activist based in Idlib said the attackers used pistols equipped with silencers, adding that people living nearby didn’t notice anything unusual.

The activist, who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals, said Islamic State sleepers have been discovered in Sarmin. The activist said the HTS-linked Judicial Committee is investigating the case."

Dick's is ahead of the government on this particular issue is and Dick's asking the government to enact the same higher minimum age on gun purchases along with other stricter measures ... right so this the company is not only changing the rules internally but is also publicly advocating for the rules be changed by state and national loss I believe politicians they've been requested to enact a lot of the policies proposed not just the assault style rifle banner the minimum age did you know they also wanted and ...

These are some of the victims.

The Florida school shooting that killed 17 people has prompted national leaders to again call for stricter gun laws, but such measures face a tough road as a wave of states have moved to expand gun owners’ rights.

In the past six years, after three of the deadliest shootings in modern history—at a Las Vegas concert, an Orlando nightclub and a Connecticut elementary school—efforts in Congress to tighten gun regulations have all failed. Legislation in states, meanwhile, has led largely to wins for supporters of broader gun rights.

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s calls for changes to gun laws in the wake of last week’s Florida school shooting push Congress toward a new politically fraught debate just months before the midterm elections.

For more than a decade, and after multiple attacks on students, lawmakers have shied from making any significant changes to gun legislation in part because of the influence of the National Rifle Association. The NRA not only donates large amounts of campaign cash, mostly to Republicans, but its scorecards on politicians’ pro-gun-rights positions are often the sole driver of the votes of many of its members.

Mr. Trump said “hardened” school security would be central to stopping future shootings, which echoes the NRA position, while he also floated proposals to keep weapons out of the hands of young people and the mentally ill.

Speaking Thursday with state and local officials at a White House meeting about school safety, Mr. Trump said students should be protected the way banks are. He repeated his call for arming teachers to help protect students, both as a deterrent and to provide a quicker response, but he said that only highly trained people would carry weapons in school.

“I think a concealed permit for teachers, and letting people know there are people in the building with a gun, you won’t have…these shootings,” said Mr. Trump.

The comments came eight days after a 19-year-old shooter at a Parkland, Fla., high school killed 17 people, the latest in a series of school shootings in recent years.

Any debate on gun measures will add complexity to a legislative agenda that already includes proposals to overhaul immigration, which also carry political risks for members of both parties just as the midterm primary season is about to begin in March.

Most of Mr. Trump’s ideas for deterring gun violence don’t have a direct path to becoming law. The prospect of any gun-control bill making it through Capitol Hill is likely tied to how much he keeps the issue in the spotlight, putting pressure on Republicans, congressional aides said.

Mr. Trump ran on a gun-rights platform, but a few of his proposals mark a modest step toward gun-control advocates. On Thursday, he reiterated his proposals to improve gun-purchaser background checks, limit access to firearms by people with mental illnesses and ban devices that allow certain firearms to mimic automatic weapons. He also called for raising the minimum age for some gun purchases to 21.

The NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, has in the past opposed restrictions on gun purchases for people under 21, as well as proposals to expand background checks. A representative didn’t return a request for comment.

Opponents of arming certain teachers in schools say the move would distract from the educational mission and increase the risk of accidental shootings. The heads of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers both dismissed the idea. “Anyone who pushes arming teachers doesn’t understand teachers and doesn’t understand our schools,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten on Thursday.

At a conservative conference on Thursday in Oxon Hill, Md., NRA Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre emphasized security, also saying policy makers needed to “harden” schools. He proposed the hiring of armed guards to protect students, but made no mention of arming teachers.

The NRA chief and Mr. Trump also sounded similar notes decrying what they termed gun-free zones at schools. At the White House, Mr. Trump said that a “gun-free zone to a killer…that’s like going in for the ice cream.” Ten miles away, in his conference speech, Mr. LaPierre said that “gun-free zones” are “wide open-targets for any crazy madman.”

In his comments Thursday, Mr. Trump praised the NRA and said he had spoken with top NRA officials “often” in the past two days as he developed proposals to address school shootings. He played down potential policy differences with the group, which spent more than $30 million helping him win the 2016 election.

Mr. Trump also said he had called many lawmakers in recent days. “They’re into doing background checks that maybe they wouldn’t be thinking about” a few weeks ago, he said.

Mr. Trump spoke late last week with Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) about his bipartisan gun bill, backed by Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), that would encourage states and federal agencies to submit records to the national background-check network. Their bill would provide incentives for states to upload criminal-conviction records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Those records already are required to be uploaded, but can slip through the cracks.

The Cornyn bill, known as the “Fix NICS,” has passed the House, but only coupled with legislation that would enable gun owners who legally carry concealed firearms in one state to carry them in the other 49 states—a major expansion of gun rights. Conservatives are reluctant to pass the Fix NICS bill without the concealed-carry reciprocity legislation, aides said Thursday.

Most Democrats oppose the concealed-carry bill, but largely support the Cornyn bill, though they call it an insufficient response to the recent gun violence.

“The Fix NICS bill won’t come close to making a significant dent in the problem, and must be only the beginning of a legislative remedy that at a minimum fully strengthens and funds background checks, closes loopholes and keeps guns away from those who shouldn’t have them,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in a statement this week.

Mr. Trump’s support for “comprehensive” background checks also renewed attention on a bill from Sens. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) that would expand background checks to all online sales and sales at gun shows, with the goal of flagging people with criminal or mental-health histories that disqualify them from gun ownership. Currently, the checks are needed only for sales by federally licensed dealers.

Chinese state-backed hackers have recently targeted South Korean entities involved in deploying a U.S. missile-defense system, says an American cybersecurity firm, despite Beijing’s denial of retaliation against Seoul over the issue.

In recent weeks, two cyberespionage groups that the firm linked to Beijing’s military and intelligence agencies have launched a variety of attacks against South Korea’s government, military, defense companies and a big conglomerate, John Hultquist, director of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye Inc., said in an interview.

The California-based firm, which counts South Korean agencies as clients, including one that oversees internet security, wouldn’t name the targets.

While FireEye and other cybersecurity experts say Chinese hackers have long targeted South Korea, they note a rise in the number and intensity of attacks in the weeks since South Korea said it would deploy Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, a sophisticated missile-defense system aimed at defending South Korea from a North Korean missile threat.

China opposes Thaad, saying its radar system can reach deep into its own territory and compromise its security. South Korea and the U.S. say Thaad is purely defensive. The first components of the system arrived in South Korea last month and have been a key issue in the current presidential campaign there.

One of the two hacker groups, which FireEye dubbed Tonto Team, is tied to China’s military and based out of the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, where North Korean hackers are also known to be active, said Mr. Hultquist, a former senior U.S. intelligence analyst. FireEye believes the other, known as APT10, may be linked to other Chinese military or intelligence units.

China’s Ministry of Defense said this week Beijing has consistently opposed hacking, and that the People’s Liberation Army “has never supported any hacking activity.” China has said it is itself a major hacking victim but has declined to offer specifics.

Mr. Hultquist said the two hacking groups gained access to their targets’ systems by using web-based intrusions, and by inducing people to click on weaponized email attachments or compromised websites. He declined to offer more specific details.

Hack Attacks Recent cyberattacks attributed to Chinese state-backed groups. Since February Spear-phishing* and watering hole** attacks were conducted against South Korean government, military and commercial targets connected to a U.S. missile defense system.

Sources: FireEye, Trend Micro, Fidelis, PricewaterhouseCoopers and BAE Systems, WSJ reporting

Mr. Hultquist added that an error in one of the group’s operational security provided FireEye’s analysts with new information about the group’s origins.

South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last month that its website was targeted in a denial-of-service attack—one in which a flood of hacker-directed computers cripple a website—that originated in China.

A spokesman said that “prompt defensive measures” ensured that the attacks weren’t effective, adding that it was maintaining an “emergency service system” to repel Chinese hackers.

The ministry this week declined to comment further, or to say which cybersecurity firm it had employed or whether he thought the attacks were related to Thaad.

Another cybersecurity company, Russia’s Kaspersky Lab ZAO, said it observed a new wave of attacks on South Korean targets using malicious software that appeared to have been developed by Chinese speakers starting in February.

The attackers used so-called spear-phishing emails armed with malware hidden in documents related to national security, aerospace and other topics of strategic interest, said Park Seong-su, a senior global researcher for Kaspersky. The company typically declines to attribute cyberattacks and said it couldn’t say if the recent ones were related to Thaad.

The two hacking groups with alleged ties to Beijing have been joined by other so-called hacktivists—patriotic Chinese hackers acting independently of the government and using names like the “Panda Intelligence Bureau” and the “Denounce Lotte Group,” Mr. Hultquist said.

South Korea’s Lotte Group has become a particular focus of Chinese ire after the conglomerate approved a land swap this year that allowed the government to deploy a Thaad battery on a company golf course.

Last month, just after the land swap was approved, a Lotte duty-free shopping website was crippled by a denial-of-service attack, said a company spokeswoman, who added that its Chinese website had been disrupted with a virus in February. She declined to comment on its source.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t respond to questions about the website attacks. The ministry has previously addressed Lotte’s recent troubles in China by saying that the country welcomes foreign companies as long as they abide by Chinese law.

The U.S. has also accused Chinese state-backed hacking groups of breaking into government and commercial networks, though cybersecurity firms say such activity has dropped since the two nations struck a cybersecurity deal in 2015.

The two Chinese hacking groups named by FireEye are suspected of previous cyberattacks.

FireEye linked Tonto Team to an earlier state-backed Chinese hacking campaign, identified by Tokyo-based cybersecurity firm Trend Micro Inc. in 2012, which focused on South Korea’s government, media and military. Trend Micro declined to comment.

Two cybersecurity reports this month accused APT10 of launching a spate of recent attacks around the globe, including on a prominent U.S. trade lobbying group. One of those reports, jointly published by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and British weapons maker BAE Systems, said the Chinese hacker collective has recently grown more sophisticated, using custom-designed malware and accessing its targets’ systems by first hacking into trusted third-party IT service providers.

Because of the new scrutiny from that report, FireEye said in a recent blog post that APT10 was likely to lay low, though in the longer run, it added, “we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.”

Corrections & Amplifications

FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, believes that a Chinese hacking group known as APT10 may be linked to Chinese military or intelligence units. A previous version of this article incorrectly said that FireEye had linked APT10 to China’s Ministry of State Security. (April 21, 2017)

AL-DAHLA, Iraq—Islamic State fighters under siege by Iraqi forces have increasingly sent explosive-packed cars and trucks barreling toward the front lines. The Iraqi military’s answer to armored vehicle bombs is a Russian-made antitank missile mounted atop an American-made Humvee.

The successful use of the Kornet missiles—price tag $250,000 apiece—helped clear the way for the Iraqi army’s advance on Mosul, the extremist group’s last major stronghold in Iraq.

Many weapons can disable vehicle bombs, but only the Kornet, which can penetrate 3 feet of metal, can stop an armored vehicle bomb, Iraqi military commanders said.

The laser-guided missiles, introduced by Russia in 1994 as an antitank weapon, can be launched from more than 3 miles away.

The Kornets have been in the Iraqi military arsenal for more than a decade and were used against American troops during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, disabling Abrams tanks and other armored vehicles.

The Kornet scope has 10 times the resolution of the human eye and has also been used for surveillance. The operator can lock onto a target and fire one missile a minute. Iraqi forces use them mostly against bomb-rigged vehicle bombs, but also fire them at buildings where enemy fighters are gathered.

The 25-year-old was assigned to the army’s anti-armor battalion and selected as a Kornet specialist because he was literate, he said.

With missiles so costly, Kornet specialists are stingy with their launches. Pvt. Taha said he doesn’t keep a count of successful hits. He does, however, keep a tally how many armored car bombs he has taken out in his two years with the army: already 20, as his unit neared Mosul in late October.

The fact that most electronic devices these days need memory hasn’t always been enough for Micron . MU -2.13%

Few companies reflect the boom-and-bust cycle of tech as well as the memory chip maker. The last decade has seen several instances of sales gains quickly fading and profits swinging to losses. Micron’s stock price has followed a similar roller coaster, most recently illustrated by a huge two-year bull run in 2013-14 followed closely by a crash that wiped nearly three-quarters of the company’s market value in half the time.

That is why investors who have done particularly well with Micron of late could be forgiven some trepidation. The company’s share price has jumped nearly 133% over the past 12 months, making it one of the best-performing chip stocks in that period. Micron has benefited from strong memory price gains, yet it is fair to wonder when the inevitable turn will take place.

That doesn’t appear to be in the cards anytime soon. Memory prices have risen sharply in the past year but aren’t near their peak yet. Spot prices for the mostly commonly tracked version of 4 gigabyte DRAM memory hit $3.09 last month compared with the five-year high of $4.37 from mid-2014, according to DRAMeXchange. Tim Arcuri of Cowen & Co. estimates that Micron’s DRAM average selling price will show a 19% sequential jump when the company reports its fiscal second quarter results later this month.

It helps that DRAM is no longer so closely correlated with the sluggish personal computer market. Because anything with a CPU chip also requires memory, DRAM usage has been helped by demand from cloud-service operators building their own servers. And while smartphone sales have slowed considerably, manufacturers are putting more DRAM into their devices to boost performance. Apple Inc.’s latest iPhone 7 Plus contains 3 gigabytes of DRAM compared with 2 gigabytes for its predecessor, and the next iPhone could add even more if Apple wishes to keep up with rivals like Samsung and Huawei.

Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal’s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.

Still, Micron is highly sensitive to shifts in chip supply. A big jump in DRAM production by Samsung in 2015 pushed prices, and thus, Micron’s revenue, down.

The potential of more memory production coming online later this year bears watching. Spending on capital equipment by DRAM producers fell in 2016 from the previous year, but it is expected to pick up about 8% this year, estimates Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest.

But it helps that—despite its recent gains, Micron’s shares aren’t terribly expensive at just 7 times forward earnings. That is a 45% discount to its three-year average, so not such a stretch even for those whose near-term memories of this stock remain painful.

WSJ's Peter Loftus and Dr. Paul Offit explain on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty

Health officials are warning that a popular nasal-spray vaccine isn’t sufficiently effective to prevent the flu, and pediatricians worry many parents won’t get their children vaccinated this year.

The result could be that more people fall sick this flu season, which can begin as early as October. A flu shot is the only recommended option to get vaccinated, but some parents may skip the painful procedure for their children.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently adopted a committee’s recommendation that people shouldn’t get the nasal-spray vaccine, called FluMist, for the 2016-2017 influenza season. A CDC review found the spray vaccine provided insufficient protection against the flu in recent years.

Bite the Bullet Getting vaccinated is the best way to reduce chances of getting the flu. U.S. health officials recommend routine influenza vaccination for all people 6 months and older who don’t have certain contraindications such as a history of allergic reactions to flu vaccines.

and between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

FluMist, available in the U.S. since 2003, had been an appealing alternative for those who don’t like needles, especially children. It accounted for one-third of all flu vaccines given to children in recent years, and, before the CDC warning, it was projected to comprise about 8% of all vaccine doses for the coming season. The CDC recommends most people 6 months and older get vaccinated against seasonal flu.

“I am concerned that families will opt not to get any influenza vaccine this year,” says Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician and professor at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine in Long Island, N.Y. “It puts those specific children at risk, as well as their family members and the community at large,” says Dr. Bernstein, who helped write guidelines published in September by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommending against use of FluMist.

Laura Campion, of Glenside, Pa., says her son, Jack, 9 years old, is terrified of needles. When the boy was 5, he became so upset about getting an injected flu vaccine that two nurses had to hold him down to administer it, Ms. Campion says. After that, she switched to FluMist. Jack became upset when he recently learned the only vaccination option was a shot, she says.

Laura Campion, of Glenside, Pa., says she isn’t sure how she will get a flu vaccination for her son, Jack, 9, who is afraid of needles. She says she and her daughter, Shea, 5, will both get flu shots. Photo: John Campion

“I’m at a crossroads and I just don’t know what to do,” Ms. Campion says. “I want him to get vaccinated” but she says she delayed scheduling an injection at the doctor’s office while she comes up with a plan. Ms. Campion says she and her 5-year-old daughter, Shea, will both get flu shots.

Paul Offit, an infectious-disease doctor and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, expects fewer children will get vaccinated for flu this year because of the recommendation against FluMist.

“Although it does hurt and it’s no fun getting a shot, it’s really important to get an influenza vaccine,” Dr. Offit says. Flu causes an estimated 200,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. each year and anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths—a wide range, partly because flu often isn’t listed as a cause on death certificates, the CDC says.

Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, says he expects fewer children will get vaccinated for flu this year after health officials recommended people not rely on FluMist. Photo: Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia

According to CDC estimates, FluMist reduced incidence of the flu by just 3% compared with unvaccinated people in the 2015-16 flu season—meaning it offered virtually no protection. Injected vaccines reduced the risk by 63%. FluMist’s effectiveness began declining in the 2013-14 flu season, the agency says.

Wanda Filer, a family physician in York, Pa., worries the FluMist setback will fuel skepticism about the usefulness of flu vaccines in general. Many people mistakenly think flu shots can cause flu, or that they’ll be fine without a vaccine, she says.

“You don’t want to see anything that takes us backward,” says Dr. Filer, who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. “We need to move forward in improving our immunization rates around flu.” She recommends that doctors try to help patients overcome their fear of needles, or even use “distraction techniques” such as talking to a patient while the shot is quickly administered.

Some 47% of Americans got a seasonal flu vaccination, including 59% of children and 44% of adults, for the 2014-2015 season, the most recent for which data are available, the CDC says.

FluMist’s manufacturer, AstraZeneca PLC, says only a limited supply of the nasal spray will be available for U.S. customers who want it despite the recommendations. The CDC expects manufacturers of the injected vaccines will fill the supply void. Sanofi SA, one of the biggest manufacturers, says it has increased production of its Fluzone shot in response to the CDC recommendations.

Health officials and AstraZeneca don’t fully understand why FluMist hasn’t worked as well as in the past. The company says FluMist has had a particular low effectiveness against the H1N1 viral strain, one of four strains in the vaccine. AstraZeneca is working to develop a more effective H1N1 strain, possibly in time to get FluMist recommended again next flu season, says Chris Ambrose, vice president of the company’s U.S. medical affairs for infectious diseases.

Dr. Offit, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, speculates the problem may have started when AstraZeneca added a fourth flu strain to FluMist in 2013. He says this may have undermined the H1N1 strain’s replication needed to trigger proper immunity in recipients.

Another mystery is that FluMist was as effective as an injected flu vaccine in a Canadian study involving children in a close-knit religious community, published in August in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Some experts say the difference might be because the study included years when the older three-strain version of FluMist was used. But that theory hasn’t been proved, says Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and molecular medicine at McMaster University’s medical school in Hamilton, Ontario, who led the Canadian study. “For people in Canada, based on the availability of data that I’ve seen, I’d still recommend it,” Dr. Loeb says about FluMist.

FluMist continues to be available and recommended for use in several countries, including Canada, the U.K. and Finland, AstraZeneca’s Dr. Ambrose says.

Families of some of those killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting asked the Connecticut Supreme Court on Tuesday to hear an appeal on a ruling that dismissed claims against the companies involved in the making and selling of the gun used in the attack.

A gunman in 2012 killed 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Conn., with a Bushmaster XM15-E2S semiautomatic rifle.

Attorneys for the families argued in their 2014 lawsuit that civilians shouldn’t be allowed to own the rifle.

But Connecticut Superior Judge Barbara Bellis in October ruled that the families failed to show that the companies could have foreseen any misuse of the weapon.

“We feel strongly that the critical issues raised in this case belong before our state’s Supreme Court, and we hope the Court agrees,” said Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the families.

The defendants have said they are immune under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act from lawsuits seeking to hold them liable for crimes committed with their products.

“Remington expects the Connecticut appellate court to come to the same conclusion as the trial court,” said James Vogts, an attorney for Remington Arms Co. LLC, the maker of the rifle.

The other defendants are Camfour Inc., a firearms distributor, and Riverview Sales Inc., the East Windsor, Conn., gun shop that sold the rifle.

An attorney for Riverview didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“The court concluded that the plaintiffs claims were not viable under Connecticut law and also barred by” the federal law, said Christopher Renzulli, an attorney for Camfour.

The attorneys for the family have pursued a claim under an exception of the federal law known as a negligent-entrustment claim. Under such a claim, a seller can be held liable for supplying a product to a person it reasonably could have known posed a risk to himself or others.

The families are asking the Connecticut Supreme Court to examine the scope of the common law of negligent entrustment in the state and how it could apply to the circumstances and technology of today.

The families also have alleged violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, a consumer-protection law. Judge Bellis ruled that the families lacked the commercial or consumer relationship with the gun companies needed to pursue such a claim.

The language of the consumer-protection law, however, doesn’t explicitly state that as a requirement, attorneys for the family say. They have asked the state Supreme Court to clarify the meaning of the statute.

Photo: Associated Press

Major U.S. sporting goods retailer Academy Sports & Outdoors has instructed its store employees to remove modern sporting rifles from displays and advertising in the wake of this week’s deadly shooting in Orlando.

Employees have been asked by Academy’s corporate office to remove rifles based on the AR-15 platform from displays, according to a sales representative at an Academy store.

The retailer will continue to sell the firearms, this person said, but is removing them from displays out of sensitivity for victims of the shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub early Sunday that left 49 dead and 53 injured.

Academy didn’t respond to requests for comment. The retailer is owned by private-equity firm KKR KKR -1.68% & Co. and has more than 200 U.S. store locations, mostly in the South and Midwest, according to its website.

A spokeswoman for KKR, which acquired the Katy, Texas, retailer in 2011, declined to comment.

The debate about gun control has escalated in the wake of the Orlando shooting. Following a nearly 15-hour filibuster on Wednesday, Senate Democrats fought for the passage of legislation to tighten access to firearms.

AR-15s and similar rifles are described by opponents as assault weapons because they can resemble military versions. Gun makers coined the modern sporting rifles, or MSR, branding for the semiautomatic weapons, which alongside small handguns have been the biggest sellers during the surge in domestic sales over the past several years.

News of Academy’s change was earlier reported by TheFirearmBlog.com, which also included a photo of a memo from the retailer’s corporate office.

Academy’s sales of hunting and fishing equipment have given the retailer leverage in an otherwise contracting sporting goods market, industry analysts say. Rival Sports Authority Inc. cited its decision to abandon that market in new and remodeled stores as among factors leading to its bankruptcy, the retailer said in a filing this spring.

Sporting goods retailers have previously taken measures to alter their merchandising in the wake of mass-casualty shootings. Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., the nation’s largest chain, suspended sales of modern sporting rifles after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Chief Executive Edward Stack said at the time.

Last year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stopped selling modern sporting rifles, including firearms based on the AR-15 platform. The company said the change was because of changing shopper demands, and that it would carry more shotguns and other hunting weapons.

High-school students who survived Florida’s deadly school shooting last week descended on the state capital Wednesday to plead for stricter gun-control measures, raising pressure on lawmakers in the normally firearm-friendly state to pass legislation.

At a boisterous rally with hundreds of demonstrators outside the State Capitol, students took the microphone to decry elected officials’ inaction in the face of bloodshed.

“Ninety-percent of my fellow Americans support background checks, yet you lawmakers have failed to act,” said Florence Yared, a 17-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last Wednesday. “Some of you said it was too soon to talk about gun control. No, it is not too soon.”

The eruption of student activism, including other rallies and walkouts across the state, has brought a new energy to the gun-rights debate in Florida and nationally, prodding GOP politicians who usually are staunch defenders of Second Amendment rights to consider legislative changes.

Yet political analysts question whether the passionate response will coalesce into a movement that can exert enduring pressure on officials.

“After past shootings, a lot of people speculated that Congress would act,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Washington. “That has yet to happen.”

In Tallahassee, state elected officials have expressed openness to new gun restrictions, moderated their rhetoric and called for the tabling of a bill that would expand gun access. But the path to tighter gun rules has already faced obstacles. The Florida House voted Tuesday against debating a measure to ban outright semiautomatic weapons—something student activists are pushing.

Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims.

Among the GOP lawmakers who voted against debating the House bill was Rep. Chris Latvala. He said in an interview that he opposes barring guns for law-abiding citizens but supports other measures to curb gun access, such as banning bump stocks, devices that enable semiautomatic firearms to mimic fully automatic weapons. Mr. Latvala holds a “D” rating from the National Rifle Association, the lowest in his caucus—“and that’s something I’m proud of,” he said.

In the aftermath of the shooting, President Donald Trump and members of his administration have demonstrated an openness to new gun restrictions. Mr. Trump, in a directive Tuesday, asked the Justice Department to draft a federal regulation effectively banning bump stocks. While that accessory wasn’t used in last week’s Florida shooting, it was used in the Las Vegas gun massacre in October that stands as the deadliest in U.S. history.

Mr. Trump held a meeting Wednesday with parents of victims and survivors of the Parkland shooting to host a discussion about how to prevent another school shooting.

Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed at the school, said the country needs to improve school safety. “How many schools, how many children need to get shot? I am not going to sleep until it is fixed,” he said.

Ideas discussed ranged from arming teachers, to better funding mental health service, to tightening gun laws, to requiring regular lockdown drills.

“Let’s never let this happen again,” said Samuel Zeif, a Parkland student who was in the building where the gunman opened fire. “Please, please, please.”

States also are looking at the issue anew. In North Carolina, a new legislative committee is studying whether to arm teachers in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. At least 10 other states, including Florida, are weighing similar measures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

In Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who received an A+ rating from the NRA and is a potential 2018 candidate for U.S. Senate, said on Tuesday that “everything for me is on the table” in weighing policy responses to the school shooting. His office has said he plans to unveil a package of proposals later this week.

Some candidates vying to replace Mr. Scott, who is barred from running for a third term, have expressed support for more gun control.

Former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, launched a television ad calling for a ban on AR-15-style rifles like the one used by the Florida gunman. On the GOP side, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam asked state lawmakers to delay a vote on a measure that would allow his agency to issue concealed-weapon licenses without a full background check.

A political committee founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in 2011, is running a TV ad attacking Mr. Scott for signing into law a measure that year that prevents doctors from discussing gun possession with patients.

With little more than two weeks left in the Florida legislative session, lawmakers are responding to pressure to pass new gun restrictions. Republican Sen. Bill Galvano is putting together a package that could include increasing the minimum age to purchase AR-15-style rifles to 21 from 18, and adding a three-day waiting period to buy them.

In a televised town hall on CNN Wednesday night, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who has publicly wavered over the past week on the question of backing tighter gun restrictions, said he was reconsidering his position on the size of gun magazines and came out in favor of the proposal to raise the minimum purchasing age. “If you are 18 years of age, you should not be able to buy a rifle,” he said.

Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas spent hours Wednesday meeting with lawmakers and state officials in Tallahassee, the state capital. Many emerged angry and disheartened, but fired up.

“I’ve maybe only spoken to three representatives, two of which already agreed with me,” said Ryan Deitsch, an 18-year-old student, at a press conference organized by Democratic Sen. Lauren Book.

“I want to see those people who shot down that bill,” Mr. Deitsch said, referring to the semiautomatic-rifle ban. “I just want to see your face and know why.”

Alfonso Calderon, a 16-year-old student, said elected officials should heed their call, or face a potential backlash. “What we need is action, and we need it now,” he said. “People are losing their lives, and it is still not being taken seriously.”

Organizers of the March 24 protest are now seeking a permit to use Pennsylvania Avenue on a route that would take them from the Capitol to Trump International Hotel, NBC-4 reported.

The massive anti-gun rally, spearheaded by survivors of the Feb. 14 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people, is expected to draw 500,000 marchers. It was planned for an 11-block stretch of the mall, with sound systems, 14 Jumbotrons, 2,000 chairs, 2,000 portable johns and 14 tents, according to the permit application the group filed Feb. 20. Students and other speakers, musicians and video tributes are planned for the event.

“March for Our Lives is created by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,” organizers wrote in the application.

But another application, written by hand, was filed earlier for the space for the same day. That group sought permission for a “student project” related to “filming for a talent show,” according to the paperwork. The name of the school was redacted by the Park Service. The event will require jump ropes, two bikes and two tables. The project “takes a day to finish. Games will be the main activity for filming,” according to the application.

National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said permits are granted on a first-come, first-served system, regardless of what the space is used for.

“By regulation, when there is a conflict of time and location for events, precedence is established by the order in which the permit application was received,” Litterst told National Public Radio.

Litterst said the Park Service typically works with organizers of displaced events to find an alternative space. He suggested West Potomac Park and Pennsylvania Avenue.

The stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue now being eyed by the marchers —3rd Street NW to 12th Street NW — is within the District of Columbia’s jurisdiction, not a federal agency’s.

Anti-gun marches are planned for the same day at other locations across the country, as well as in other countries.

A message on the March for Our LivesFacebook page reads: “On March 24 we will take to the streets of Washington, DC and our communities across the country. We will be the last group of students who have to stand up for fallen children due to senseless gun violence. March with us.”

Gerald Herbert/The Associated Press After 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida, gun control advocates say they have momentum to enact new state laws. But in the years since the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, more state laws have actually expanded access to guns.

By Matt Vasilogambros

In the two weeks since the Florida school massacre, state lawmakers around the country have introduced bills to ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, and expand background checks — and also to arm teachers, lighten penalties for carrying without a permit, and waive handgun permit fees.

If history foretells, the gun-rights bills will have a better chance at success. In the years since Sandy Hook, when 26 were slain in 2012, states have enacted nearly 600 new gun laws, according to data compiled separately by the National Rifle Association and the Giffords Law Center to Reduce Gun Violence.

Nearly two-thirds of those were backed by the NRA.

It is “indisputably true” that there have been far more new laws that loosen gun restrictions than tighten them, said Michael Hammond, the legislative counsel at Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based “no compromise” gun lobbying organization. The way a state reacts to mass shootings depends on who controls its legislature, he said. And in the case of the states that expanded access to firearms, most were controlled by Republicans.

“If you are in favor of the Second Amendment, grow up with guns, are comfortable with guns, don’t want to see kids turned into sitting ducks, you’re more likely to say the solution is more guns,” Hammond said.

By the NRA’s count, governors since 2013 have enacted 382 “pro-gun” bills — many widely expanding access to firearms.

Governors in Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas and Texas, signed bills that would allow people with concealed carry licenses to bring guns onto college campuses, joining seven other states with similar laws.

New laws in at least five states — Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and West Virginia — allow gun owners to carry loaded firearms without a permit or training. So-called permitless carry laws now are in effect in more than 10 states.

After the latest massacre in Florida, Indiana lawmakers are close to making their state the next that allows people to carry guns on church grounds, even if there is a school on church property. Jack Sandlin, the Republican state senator who wrote the bill, said it’s “common sense” to want to pass this kind of legislation after mass shootings.

“People want to know how to protect themselves and protect their families,” Sandlin said. Before being elected to public office, he spent 35 years in law enforcement.

Successes in Gun Control

Also in the past five years, 210 “gun safety laws” were enacted in 45 states, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonprofit named after former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who survived an assassination attempt in 2011.

That’s far fewer than the number backed by the NRA, but advocates for restricting access to firearms don’t see things that way. Comparing the number of laws that expanded gun access to the number of laws that tightened restrictions on guns is “a false paradigm,” said Dan Gross, the former president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

“Sure, if you count every one of those little BS things that the corporate gun lobby has put out that you can say has weakened gun laws, it’d probably be a losing tally for us,” Gross said. “But when you look at it through the lens of what states have done to make them meaningfully safer, you can make a strong case that momentum has shifted.”

Since Sandy Hook, states such as Colorado, Delaware, New York, Oregon and Washington have expanded background checks for gun purchases.

During that same period, Alabama, Louisiana, Nevada, Tennessee, Utah and several other states enacted laws that prevent people convicted of domestic violence from possessing a gun. Nearly 30 states now have similar laws, and Oregon passed a similar bill last month.

Unlike NRA-backed legislation that is passed mostly in red states, these measures are being passed in both blue and red states, said Allison Anderman, the managing attorney at the Giffords center.

“The NRA is not getting permitless-carry and campus-carry laws enacted in true blue states like California, New Jersey, Connecticut or New York,” she said. “Whereas we’re getting laws that we think are extremely impactful in states like Alabama and Louisiana. How many people would have been shot and killed if we hadn’t passed those bills?”

What States Will Do Now

Two-thirds of Americans now support stricter gun control laws, polls have found. Further, nearly 90 percent of Americans support background checks for gun purchases.

Gun control activists say there is clearly a momentum right now. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, signed a “red flag” executive order this week that keeps guns away from people “who pose a danger to themselves and others.” Similar measures are being considered in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey.

The governors of Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and Rhode Island have joined forces to create a “States for Gun Safety” coalition to expand gun control efforts.

Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott proposed raising the age to buy assault rifles — a move that was also called for this week by President Donald Trump.

But even with this action, many states are far from enacting new gun restrictions. Already, some states are struggling to pass bills that would ban bump stocks, the devices that allow assault weapons to fire continuously. The Las Vegas gunman used a bump stock to quickly shoot more than 500 people.

States such as Idaho, Kentucky and South Dakota are now considering measures to further loosen gun laws in the wake of the Florida shooting.

In Arizona, a state with some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country, lawmakers are unlikely to pass new restrictive bills, said state Rep. Daniel Hernandez Jr., a Democrat. He interned for Giffords in 2011, and he was there when she and 18 others were shot in the parking lot of a supermarket in Tucson. He came to her aid and is credited with helping save her life.

Hernandez said it’s hard to pass restrictive gun bills in Arizona because of strong opposition from special interest groups, such as the Arizona Citizens Defense League, but also because guns are a part of the state’s history and culture."
huffpo2,huffpo,"['Sara Boboltz', 'Reporter']",2018-03-03 17:49:34-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/connecticut-high-school-student-national-school-walkout_us_5a987630e4b0479c0250a7af,"At home in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the news that a gunman had killed 17 people — mostly teenagers ― at a Parkland, Florida, high school didn’t come as a shock to 15-year-old Lane Murdock.

“When I found out, I was horrified, but kind of in the way of ‘Oh, another one?’” she told HuffPost.

That feeling didn’t sit right with her. Murdock hadn’t been very politically active, but her own reaction to the images coming out of Florida compelled her to dive headfirst into one of America’s most divisive issues: gun violence.

“It’s ingrained in American culture and that’s not OK ― the fact that I didn’t feel an overwhelming amount of emotion because it’s so normal,” she said. “I had such a numb reaction, I knew it was time for change. I know that the whole nation is numb to things like this, and that’s why change isn’t happening.”

So Murdock set out to organize a massive student walkout.

More than a thousand miles away, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High students were diving in, too. Suddenly confronted with news cameras, the teens spoke about the horror that had engulfed their school, appearing on national television visibly angry and sometimes in tears. They crafted a social media campaign, Never Again, and proposed a march on Washington, D.C., called the March for Our Lives. It’s scheduled for Saturday, March 24.

Lane Murdock Max Cumming (left), Paul Kim and Lane Murdock are organizing a national anti-gun walkout on the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine shooting.

Murdock doesn’t know any of the Parkland students. But in the hours after the shooting, she created a petition, “National High School Walk-Out for Anti Gun Violence,” on the activist platform Change.org. Murdock’s petition calls on the U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump to enact legislation aimed at preventing gun violence. She also proposes a day of protest on Friday, April 20, the 19th anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado that shocked the nation but sparked little action on gun reform.

The idea is that students across the country will leave their classes at 10 a.m. local time, followed by 17 minutes of silence — one minute for each victim of the Parkland shooting. Then, students will share their views on guns with peers and adults in an open-mic session. Individual schools are encouraged to add to the day’s schedule as they wish.

As of Saturday, the petition had around 242,000 signatures with a goal of 300,000. An accompanying website offers more details on the planned walkouts and graphics for DIY T-shirts.

Murdock’s event is scheduled for nearly a month after the March for Our Lives, which is expected to feature several high-profile speakers. With help from gun reform groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage, the latter event consists of at least 375 planned “sibling” marches. Murdock’s protest will also come around five weeks after #ENOUGH: A National School Walkout, which is set for Wednesday, March 14, by the organizers behind the Women’s March. Similar to Murdock’s event, #ENOUGH is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and last for 17 minutes to protest legislative inaction on gun policy.

Galvanized by the Stoneman Douglas students ― some of whom are now familiar faces on television and social media ― kids across the country are stepping up and speaking out for gun law reform.

Yet with so many events vying for their support, can they keep up the momentum?

“That’s the question of the year for me,” Murdock said, adding that organizing is especially difficult now that “our attention spans have never been shorter.”

Still, she sees the preceding events as “a nice ramping-up” to her National High School Walkout that “will keep the movement in people’s minds because they’re nicely spread apart.”

Organizing a nationwide protest when you’re attending high school five days a week is no simple thing. When she’s not in class or doing homework, Murdock, a sophomore, is checking her email, posting to Twitter and speaking with reporters. A few days after launching her petition, she enlisted the help of two seniors at her school, Paul Kim, 17, and Max Cumming, 18. Together, they’ve partnered with Indivisible, a nonprofit resistance organization, to come up with a guide for student activists on what to do on the day of the walkout.

Given their inherently disruptive nature, walkouts have proven controversial in some school districts, and some administrators have announced they will suspend kids who participate. In response, a number of universities said that disciplinary measures doled out to anti-gun protesters won’t count against them in the admissions process. Hundreds of students across Florida and other states have already staged anti-gun walkouts in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting.

Although Murdock refers to the National High School Walkout as “mine” as much as she calls it “ours,” she wants to be clear that she’s not pushing specific policy changes.

On Friday, April 20th we want students to attend school and then promptly WALK-OUT at 10:00 am. Sit outside your schools and peacefully protest. Make some noise. Voice your thoughts. ""We are students, we are victims, we are change."" — National School Walkout (@schoolwalkoutUS) February 17, 2018

“I think it’s important that this movement isn’t just about me or my ideologies. I mean, I have them, and I have them very strongly,” she said. (She doesn’t buy the National Rifle Association’s argument that the problem is not guns, it’s mental health, and she’s skeptical of Trump’s plan to incentivize armed teachers.) “But it’s also about giving a platform for kids of all sorts of backgrounds.”

Speaking for herself, Murdock said she’s “not one of those kids who’s been in New England and has never seen a gun before.” Her mother’s family hails from Texas, where Murdock was born. Several of her relatives own guns.

“I’ve definitely known people who are proud of their gun ownership and who see it as a part of their right as an American and American culture,” Murdock said.

She believes she understands the point of view of gun rights activists. Seeing so much gun violence concentrated in the U.S. has simply led her to disagree. Living just 30 minutes from Newtown, Connecticut ― the site of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that took the lives of 26 small children and adults ― has also had an impact. Gun violence is something people talk about in her community, and Murdock encourages other kids her age to start a dialogue with friends and family on the issue.

Teens can also contact their representatives at all levels of government, she noted. Their voices matter, even if they’re a few years away from hitting the voting booths.

“It’s important for people to know that my movement ― as well as being about gun control and solidarity with the Parkland kids ― it’s also about youth empowerment,” she said.

Murdock said she would like to meet the Parkland students whose tragedy inspired her to take action. As she explained it, she wanted to give them space to attend funerals and mourn before making an effort to get in touch. She plans to travel to Washington for the March for Our Lives, where many of those students are also expected to appear."

REI said on Thursday that it would place a hold on any future orders with Vista Outdoor, a conglomerate that recently acquired several popular adventure brands that have long been featured in REI locations. But Vista Outdoor also owns Savage Arms, a gun manufacturer and retailer that stocks several models of semi-automatic “modern sporting rifles.” Such manufacturers are facing backlash after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.

The Seattle-based REI said it had been in discussions with Vista Outdoor for the past week, and that the two companies’ relationship would be put on hold since REI learned that Vista Outdoor would not make a public statement “that outlines a clear plan of action” regarding common-sense gun control measures.

“REI does not sell guns. We believe that it is the job of companies that manufacture and sell guns and ammunition to work towards common sense solutions that prevent the type of violence that happened in Florida last month,” REI said in a statement. “We have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds. Companies are showing they can contribute if they are willing to lead. We encourage Vista to do just that.”

Numerous petitions have been calling for some of the nation’s biggest retailers, including REI, to end their relationships with gun manufacturers and firearm lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association. This week, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Walmart said they would no longer sell guns to anyone under the age of 21. Dick’s also said it would immediately end all sales of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines in its stores.

Companies including Delta, Hertz and MetLife have also terminated their relationships with the NRA in the weeks following the Parkland shooting.

CamelBak, one of the companies owned by Vista Outdoors, said efforts to boycott the brand were misplaced after another outdoor retailer, Canada’s Mountain Equipment Co-op, announced that it would suspend orders of the company’s products.

Dünzl\ullstein bild via Getty Images REI said it would suspend its relationship with Vista Outdoor, a conglomerate that owns several popular adventure brands but also a major gun manufacturer.

“Our brand falls within the Outdoor Products segment of our company, which operates separately from Vista Outdoor’s Shooting Sports segment,” CamelBak said in a statement. “Since 1989, CamelBak has been committed to forever changing the way people hydrate and perform. Our passion and love for the outdoors is unchanged. We are deeply committed to the individuals and communities we serve and we proudly partner with organizations to promote the enjoyment of the outdoors.“

REI has been no stranger to political statements in recent months. CEO Jerry Stritzke said he was “mad as hell” after the Trump administration decided to dramatically scale back two national monuments in Utah ― Bears Ears, which was cut by about 85 percent, and Grand Staircase-Escalante, which was reduced roughly by half."

There is NO SUCH THING as Dick’s Sporting Goods selling “an assault rifle” because it does not exist. Rather it would be a termed a semi-auto rifle or semi-auto carbine. Also, there is no such thing as a “high capacity” magazine. Over 5? Over 10? Over 15? Over 20? Over 30? Over 90?

Kinds of firearms have nothing to do with these mass murders. Think about it: The SAME firearm that the school children call to save them is the SAME firearm that only some of the perps use.

Example: During a church murder spree earlier this year where members were caught unarmed, an NRA member with an AR-15 STOPPED the carnage by scoring three hits on the murderer and then chased him down in a truck until the perp bled out. So there is no such thing as a “bad gun” or an inappropriate firearm in the hands of a “good guy”. Why would you ban a firearm? There is a Second Amendment in effect. Two, there are 450 million firearms in this country – nearly one for every man, woman and child!

My customers want the SAME firearm that the “bad guys” have so they can over-power them. I use my AR-15 for hunting and personal defense. The AR-15 started out in the civilian market, NOT the military.

I am sure I will have MANY MORE semi-auto rifles and semi-auto carbines offered on my online auction site because now EVERYONE will want one. When liberals attempt to introduce legislation for “bans” (no such thing as there are MILLIONS and MILLIONS of semi-auto rifles and semi-auto carbines in this country and NO ONE is going to “give up” any) they stimulate the market like never before. We always say Bill “Monica” Clinton was the world’s greatest gun salesman ever with his “Assault Weapon Ban” (did not work whatsoever as production kept going with just a few cosmetic changes and it caused MILLIONS of Americans to arm up with them anyway – hence no one reinstated the “ban” – not even the most liberal of legislators), however Obuma was the world’s best salesman (2016 there were 27.5 million firearm checks through NICS and way over that figure in private sales). A new record!

So will I make changes? Yes. I will be accepting even more semi-automatic firearms for sale! The market will go out of sight. I figure if someone can go to war with firearms, then they can surely buy one when they get back at age 18!

America’s school teachers and staff MUST arm up. I am on the Cody School Board and we are currently putting through a policy that will arm our teachers and staff. We need the correct firearms to do this.

Good Americans will NEVER give up any kinds of firearms. Period. Rather they will more heavily arm up with mass murder sprees as reported by the media.

History clearly shows us this.

The first surveys, conducted with the tragedy still flashing across TV screens, show a brief uptick in concern about gun violence, and maybe a spike in the national appetite for tighter firearm restrictions. Then, as soon as the story fades from the headlines, the increase is gone.

This time looks different.

A HuffPost/YouGov survey taken immediately after the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, found the same familiar uptick. But in the days since, the numbers have continued to shift in favor of congressional action on guns. There’s also a rising belief that Congress could actually take such action.

The deaths of 17 students and staff members Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School ― and the surge of activism that’s followed, led by surviving classmates ― have, the polling suggests, moved the national debate in a way that last year’s shootings at a Las Vegas concert and a Texas church did not.

Americans now say by a nearly a two-to-one margin, 50 percent to 26 percent, that it’s politically possible to pass stricter gun laws ― a high in polling since 2015, and a remarkable swing from less than two weeks ago, when just 38 percent saw it as feasible.

HuffPost

The shift spans political lines and includes both those who favor such a change and those who don’t. The share of Hillary Clinton voters believing new laws can be passed rose by 13 percentage points, while the share of Donald Trump voters rose 17 points.

Active support for making gun laws stricter has increased more modestly in the HuffPost/YouGov poll: It currently stands at 58 percent, up from the 48-to-54-percent range it occupied from last year.

But other questions show more substantial movement in a willingness to accept new restrictions, and in a sense that they’re legislatively achievable.

Sixty percent of Americans now say that mass shootings are something that can be stopped, rather than a fact of life in the country ― up 18 points from as recently as last October. A 51 percent majority say Congress should take action to reduce mass shootings, up 10 points since last year.

And 65 percent, including a majority in both parties, now say that it’s possible to enact some kinds of new gun regulations while still maintaining Americans’ right to bear arms. Immediately after last year’s Las Vegas shootings, just 53 percent said so.

Much of the change on this question appears due to a shift of opinion on the right. A majority of Trump voters, 52 percent, now say gun laws could be tightened without violating the Second Amendment, up from 43 percent immediately after the Parkland shooting and just 33 percent after last year’s Las Vegas shooting. Among Republicans, the number is currently 61 percent, up from 42 percent last fall.

The change in opinion on guns should come with a sizable helping of caveats. Public support for gun control ― and especially for specific measures like background checks, which enjoy near-universal support ― has long outpaced the implementation of actual policy on the issue, in part because opponents of gun restrictions have been more likely to make their views heard to officials.

And though the 21 percent who count gun issues among their top priorities in the HuffPost/YouGov poll is notably higher than it was last year, the topic still ranks behind issues like health care and the economy. It’s also unclear whether the momentum behind this push for gun control will last the months until the midterm elections.

At this moment, however, the political landscape looks more promising for gun control advocates than it has in some time.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll is among a slew of recent surveys finding a substantial shift on gun control. A roundup of the latest from other outlets:

CNN: “Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to the highest level since 1993, and almost two-thirds say government and society can take action to prevent future mass shootings, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The findings suggest the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, has shifted public opinion on gun laws in a way other recent mass shootings have not.”

Politico: “Support for stricter gun laws has spiked in polls conducted after the fatal South Florida school shooting, hitting its highest level in at least a quarter-century. Roughly 2 in 3 Americans now say gun control laws should be made more strict in the wake of the murder of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to a number of polls, including a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll that shows support for stricter gun laws among registered voters at 68 percent, compared with just 25 percent who oppose stricter gun laws.”

Quinnipiac: “American voters support stricter gun laws 66-31 percent, the highest level of support ever measured by the independent Quinnipiac University National Poll, with 50-44 percent support among gun owners and 62- 35 percent support from white voters with no college degree and 58-38 percent support among white men.”

YouGov: “A majority of the public consistently has supported many gun control proposals: just over half in last week’s Economist/YouGov Polls say they want stricter gun laws in general. But support has not grown beyond that ― until now. ... The movement towards supporting stricter gun laws has taken place across the political spectrum.”

Marist: “Following the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 71% of Americans, including 58% of gun owners, agree the laws governing the sale of firearms need to be stricter. This is up from 64% in October 2017. ... Of note, 77% of Americans who say a candidate’s position on gun policy will have a major influence on their vote in this year’s midterm elections assert gun laws need to be strengthened.”

USA Today: “Americans overwhelmingly support tougher gun laws, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but they also overwhelmingly agree on this: Congress isn’t likely to act anytime soon.”

CBS: “Sixty-five percent of Americans now say laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter ― an eight-point increase from December. It is the highest number recorded in this poll for stricter gun sale laws. The rise has been primarily among Republicans and independents, with a large increase among Republicans from last December. Democrats remain in favor.”

The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 26-28 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

A gun amnesty program that ran last year from July to September compelled people to turn in 57,324 firearms and 2,432 parts and accessories, plus more than 80,000 rounds of ammunition, the country’s Department of Home Affairs announced Thursday.

The program enabled people to register their firearms, sell them to a licensed dealer or have them destroyed, according to the department. It also provided protection from prosecution for people who aren’t criminals but still had unregistered firearms from what Australia calls the “grey market.”

“It’s critical to get them off this grey market … so they don’t end up in the black market,” said Angus Taylor, the country’s federal law enforcement minister. “Taking these unregistered firearms off the streets means they will not fall into the hands of criminals, who might use them to endanger the lives of innocent Australians.”

Some grey market weapons have been found to have been passed onto the black market and used in several recent attacks in Australia, including a siege on a cafe in Sydney in 2014.

But the country hasn’t experienced a mass shooting since 1996, when a gunman wielding AR-15 and L1A1 rifles killed 35 people during the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania. Then-Prime Minister John Howard implemented a series of gun control measures, which banned certain types of firearms and created a registry for gun owners. He also introduced the idea of a government buy-back program, in which gun owners handed in hundreds of thousands of firearms between October 1996 and September 1997.

Australia has been cited as a potential model for the U.S., where calls for gun reform typically go unheeded.

“I have no doubt that a debate will be raised again about United States gun laws,” foreign minister Julie Bishop told “Sunrise” morning show in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas last fall. “Each state has different laws. What Australia can do is share our experience.”

Yet gun control advocates in Australia are concerned about the hundreds of thousands of firearms that remain in the hands of private citizens, as well as about insufficient enforcement of gun laws. A 2017 review of the National Firearms Agreement, the law put in place following the Port Arthur shooting, determined that most states had significantly loosened their gun laws since 1996."

The study, released Wednesday by the Violence Policy Center, found there were 258 justifiable homicides involving civilians using firearms in 2012, compared with 8,342 murders by gun. Even if a criminal isn't shot down, the study found that civilians rarely use guns to protect themselves. ""Intended victims of property crimes engaged in self-protective behavior with a firearm"" only 0.1 percent of the times they were targeted by a crook.

The report, titled ""Firearm Justifiable Homicides and Non-Fatal Self-Defense Gun Use"" relied on FBI and Bureau of Justice data. The Violence Policy Center said the report disproves the premise of arguments by the National Rifle Association that more guns in the hands of regular people will reduce crime.

“The NRA has staked its entire agenda on the claim that guns are necessary for self-defense, but this gun industry propaganda has no basis in fact,” the group's executive director, Josh Sugarmann, said in a statement. “Guns are far more likely to be used in a homicide than in a justifiable homicide by a private citizen. In fact, a gun is far more likely to be stolen than used in self-defense.”

In addition to the thousands of annual murders, roughly 22,000 people die accidentally from a gun or use one to commit suicide.

Gun rights advocates, however, have long armed themselves with contrarian statistics, saying people are safer thanks to the Second Amendment.

The Cato Institute, which advocates against restrictions on gun ownership, maintains a map showing where a firearm has successfully stopped a crime. The group says there are many unreported incidents in which a would-be criminal flees when a civilian brandishes a gun in self-defense.

""Gun control proponents cannot deny that people use guns successfully against criminals, but they tend to play down how often such events take place,"" the Cato website says.

The Gun Owners of America maintains a section on its website ""just for skeptics"" that cites reports that Americans each year use guns 2.5 million times in self-defense.

Claims that guns are used millions of times each year in self-defense are untrue, however, according to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, which also found that ""firearms are used far more often to intimidate than in self-defense.""

“Purchasing a gun may help enrich the firearms industry, but the facts show it is unlikely to increase your personal safety,” Sugarmann said. “In fact, in a nation of more than 300 million firearms, it is striking how rarely guns are used in self-defense.”

The Second Amendment is highly contested. There is no doubt that people do have the right to carry and have a stockpile of guns (""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"") and a state has the right to organize a well-regulated Militia. But, the main issue is on the right to self-defend with a firearm.

The main problem with the notion of self-defense is it imposes on justice, for everyone has the right for a fair trial. Therefore, using a firearm to defend oneself is not legal because if the attacker is killed, he or she is devoid of his or her rights. In addition, one's mental capacity is a major factor in deciding whether a man or woman has the right to have a firearm. There are two reasons for ensuring mental capacity. First, one of the Five Aims is to ensure domestic tranquility and there can be no tranquility if one does not have the capacity. Second, if one's brain is distorting his or her reality, they do not have the proper reasoning and deduction skills to use a firearm.

Therefore, if we ponder and meditate on the recent events in news about guns, it would be obvious that the current state is incorrect. A gun for civilians is a weapon for a revolution and not for ordinary use. The belief that a gun is a useful tool to protect one is counterintuitive because guns get into the hands of people who use them for horrible reasons. In addition, there are reasons why cops are trained to use a firearm in stressful situations. It is not to keep their mind at ease or anything of that sort, but to be able to fire accurately at the target in the correct location. It is immensely difficult to fire when under pressure. Moreover, one may argue this is an analogous argument and yes it is because the United States government is lobbied to not study or fund research that observes the effects of guns. This cripples the chance of evaluating a proper policy to deal with gun violence. But, there was one study by ABC, which observed using guns in a classroom. All the participations poorly performed at the mock situation.

Once again, if there is an argument in the reasoning of this amendment and others, one must filter it through the Five Aims of the USA and the Bill of Rights. This is to ensure that any argument can be answered, avoiding a political divide."
huffpo12,huffpo,"['Melissa Jeltsen', 'Senior Reporter']",2016-02-26 10:20:30-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-lite-domestic-abusers-own-guns_us_56cf6822e4b0871f60eaa82b,"In 2009, an anonymous tipster contacted authorities with a hunch: A bald eagle had been shot and killed, and they knew who did it.

A Maine man, Stephen Voisine, was arrested for the crime. He turned over his rifle to police. As it turned out, he was not legally allowed to own guns. Six years earlier, he’d been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor against his girlfriend after she called police and said he’d slapped her -- and not for the first time. Two years later, he was convicted of assaulting her again.

Under a federal law called the Lautenberg Amendment, if you’ve been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor, you can’t own or buy a gun. If you’re caught with one, as Voisine was, you can face up to 10 years behind bars. In 2011, Voisine was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a prohibited person.

On Monday, he and another Maine man with a similar story are taking their case to the Supreme Court. Lawyers for the two men are arguing that their convictions for violating the amendment should be reversed -- because they never should have lost their gun rights to begin with.

Both men were convicted of domestic violence under Maine statutes that include ""reckless"" conduct. Their lawyers argue that the men acted in the heat of the moment and their impulsive, reckless acts of domestic violence are not serious enough to qualify under the federal gun ban.

In essence, as The Trace explains, they're arguing for a hierarchy of domestic violence offenses. In their estimation, not all domestic violence convictions should result in a gun ban. Instead, they say, only intentional, purposeful acts of violence should trigger the loss of gun rights under federal law.

The question put to the court boils down to this: Does it matter what mental state you are in when you commit domestic violence? Under the law, if you commit such a crime recklessly, as opposed to knowingly or intentionally, should you still forfeit your right to buy or possess guns?

Why should I care about this case?

If the court sides with the two men, it's possible that only some types of domestic violence convictions would result in abusers losing their gun rights.

That would be a dangerous scenario, according to the many anti-violence organizations that filed friend-of-the-court briefs. Research shows that if an abuser has access to a gun, victims are five times more likely to be killed. A recent Associated Press analysis found that an average of 760 Americans were killed with guns annually by intimate partners, though that is likely an undercount. More than 80 percent of the victims were women.

It also appears to go against the spirit of the Lautenberg Amendment, which was enacted to make sure that all domestic abusers -- whether convicted of felonies or misdemeanors -- can't own guns.

Oh, right, the Lautenberg Amendment. Why is it important again?

In 1996, Congress passed the amendment to the Gun Control Act, which barred individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from owning or buying guns.

At the time, people who were convicted of felonies were already banned from owning guns. But Congress noticed that domestic abusers were falling through the cracks. Even if they were alleged to have committed serious, violent crimes against their partners, the offenses were frequently charged as or pleaded down to misdemeanors.

“The fact is, that in many places today, domestic violence is not taken as seriously as other forms of criminal behavior,” then-Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) argued on the Senate floor.

In the past few years, there’s been state-level drive to strengthen laws keeping guns away from domestic abusers and ensuring that those who are barred from owning weapons are actually required to hand them in.

So why do the petitioners believe their convictions don’t count under the federal gun ban?

Lawyers for the men are arguing that the gun ban should only apply to people who intend to hurt their partners, not those who merely act recklessly or impulsively.

But as the government lawyers point out, most states' simple assault and battery laws --- which are typically used to address domestic violence -- lump crimes committed recklessly or intentionally together.

The stakes of this decision will be measured in lives. Everytown for Gun Safety

For example, under Maine law, a person is guilty of assault if he or she ""intentionally, knowingly or recklessly cause bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person."" Many states use similar language.

It’s important to note that reckless acts don’t mean accidental. Under Maine law, a person acts recklessly when he or she ""consciously disregards a risk that the person’s conduct will cause such a result.""

What does the government think?

The government’s position is that the federal gun ban on domestic abusers was clearly intended to include reckless acts of violence. Excluding those acts from the Lautenberg Amendment would ""frustrate (if not destroy) Congress’s manifest purpose"" to keep firearms from convicted domestic abusers, according to government lawyers.

Many types of violence that are common in abusive relationships, such as pushing, slapping, hitting and restraining a person, could be considered reckless, they argue. ""[T]o exclude reckless conduct would be to exclude exactly those familiar forms of domestic abuse from [the Lautenberg Amendment]. Congress could not have intended that result.""

However, the Supreme Court may think the language in the Lautenberg Amendment is constitutionally vague, in which case it may agree that the federal charges against the two men should be dropped. This is because criminal law requires statutes to be written very specifically and any provision that sweeps too broadly is in danger of being restricted.

If the court goes that route, it's likely to simply decide that the ""reckless"" use of physical force, without more specificity at the state level, means someone can't be federally prosecuted under the anti-gun law.

Why does it matter if domestic abusers have access to guns?

More women in this country die at the hands of their intimate partners -- their boyfriends, husbands and exes -- than any other type of perpetrator. Most of those homicides are committed with guns.

In a recent project, The Huffington Post tracked all the people killed in suspected intimate partner homicides over the month of January. We found that 112 people were killed, including children and bystanders. Firearms were responsible for 57 percent of those deaths.

In addition, most U.S. mass shootings are related to domestic violence.

Laws that make it harder for domestic abusers to get guns are shown to save lives. One study, for example, found that state laws restricting firearm access for people subject to protective orders were associated with a 25 percent lower rate of gun-related intimate partner homicides.

As Everytown for Gun Safety summed up in a friend-of-the-court brief for the case, ""the stakes of this decision will be measured in lives.""

huffpo13,huffpo,"['Peter H. Stone', 'Ben Hallman', 'Senior Editor For Projects', 'Investigations', 'The Huffington Post']",2013-01-11 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/nra-gun-control-firearms-industry-ties_n_2434142.html,"Throughout its 142-year history, the National Rifle Association has portrayed itself as an advocate for the individual gun owner’s Second Amendment rights. In turn, the NRA relied on those gun owners, especially its 4 million or so members, to pressure lawmakers into carrying out its anti-gun control agenda.

In the last two decades, however, the deep-pocketed NRA has increasingly relied on the support of another constituency: the $12-billion-a-year gun industry, made up of manufacturers and sellers of firearms, ammunition and related wares. That alliance was sealed in 2005, when Congress, after heavy NRA lobbying, approved a measure that gave gunmakers and gun distributors broad, and unprecedented, immunity from a wave of liability lawsuits related to gun violence in America’s cities.

It was a turning point for both the NRA and the industry, both of which recognized the mutual benefits of a partnership. That same year, the NRA also launched a lucrative new fundraising drive to secure “corporate partners” that’s raked in millions from the gun industry to boost its operations.

But that alliance, which has grown even closer in recent years -- and includes ties both financial and personal, a Huffington Post examination has found -- has led to mounting questions from gun control advocates about the NRA's priorities. Is the nation’s most potent gun lobby mainly looking out for its base constituency, the estimated 80 million Americans who own a firearm? Or is it acting on behalf of those that make and sell those guns?

According to a 2012 poll conducted by GOP pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, 74 percent of NRA members support mandatory background checks for all gun purchases, a position that the NRA has stridently opposed. “There’s a big difference between the NRA’s rank and file and the NRA’s Washington lobbyists, who live and breathe for a different purpose,” Mark Glaze, the executive director of the gun control group, said.

The questions about the NRA's ties to the gun industry, and whether those ties have influenced its agenda, have come to the forefront in the wake of horrific mass shootings last year in Connecticut, Colorado and Wisconsin.

A week after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in a Newtown, Conn., school, Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president and top lobbyist, gave a tense, combative performance at a press conference in which he signalled the organization wouldn't budge from its long-held opposition to most gun control measures.

Instead, LaPierre revealed that the NRA favored putting thousands of armed guards in schools to curb shootings. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he said.

The NRA’s deep ties to the gun industry dismays some lawmakers who have introduced gun control bills responding to the mass shootings.

“The NRA is basically helping to make sure the gun industry can increase sales,” Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat and longtime gun control advocate, told The Huffington Post. McCarthy last week proposed a bill that would ban new sales of new large ammunition clips that increase the lethality of weapons like those used in mass shootings in Connecticut, Colorado and Wisconsin.

“No one is challenging NRA members' right to own guns,” McCarthy said. ""We’ve had large mass shootings which have [involved] large mass assault weapons clips. These clips aren’t used for hunting.”

McCarthy’s husband and five other people were shot dead in a brutal assault in 1993 on a New York commuter train by a man wielding a gun with a large-capacity ammunition clip.

The Obama administration is reportedly considering a much broader approach to curbing gun violence: bans on assault weapons and large ammunition clips, mandatory background checks on all gun purchases, increased mental health checks and expanded penalties for carrying guns near schools. On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden said that the White House had determined that ""executive action can be taken,"" though the specifics have not been settled.

The administration is also trying secure backing from big retailers like Walmart that sell guns, with an eye to undercutting the influence of the NRA and gun industry allies -- a strategy that might peel off some of their gun-owner grassroots. Walmart leaders announced this week that they will attend a Thursday meeting at the White House.

Gun control advocates who have lagged badly behind the NRA in fundraising and organization are now are accelerating their efforts. On Tuesday, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), who was badly wounded two years ago in a mass shooting, launched a new gun control political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, to counter the NRA’s legendary financial and political clout with Congress.

The NRA declined to comment. In recent years, it has argued that defending gun owners and the gun industry is one in the same. Any new laws or regulations that would limit the availability of firearms, or restrict who can own them, would violate the Second Amendment, the organization has said. The NRA has said it does support efforts to keep guns out of the hands of felons, those who have been adjudicated as mentally incompetent, or unsupervised children.

The NRA forwarded a letter to The Huffington Post that the group sent to Congress. The letter is signed by Chris Cox, who runs the NRA lobbying arm. “We know that the facts prove gun bans do not work and that is why they are not supported by the majority of the American people,” the letter said. Cox promised that the NRA would adopt a “constructive” stance in the debate, and reiterated past NRA positions that existing laws need to be better enforced.

In 2011, 32,000 Americans died due to gun violence. The homicide rate in the U.S. is about 20 times higher than in other advanced nations.

'YOUR FIGHT HAS BECOME OUR FIGHT'

Close ties between the NRA and gunmakers go back at least to 1999, when the NRA publicly declared its support for the firearms industry as it prepared to defend itself from a rash of liability lawsuits filed by cities and municipalities.

“Your fight has become our fight,” then-NRA president Charlton Heston declared before a crowd of gun company executives at the annual SHOT Show, the industry's biggest trade show. “Your legal threat has become our constitutional threat,"" he said.

Following the passage of the shield law that dismembered those lawsuits, the NRA launched a new fundraising drive targeting firearms companies the organization had just helped in a big way. That effort, dubbed ""Ring of Freedom,"" paid off handsomely. Since 2005, the NRA drive has pulled in $14.7 million to $38.9 million from dozens of gun industry giants, including Beretta USA, Glock and Sturm, Ruger, according to a 2011 study by the Violence Policy Center, a group that favors gun control.

The Violence Policy Center study cited an NRA promotional brochure about the corporate partnership drive, noting that LaPierre promised that “this program is geared towards your company’s corporate interests.”

Despite the millions of dollars it has collected from the gun industry, the NRA’s website says “it is not affiliated with any firearm or ammunition manufacturers or with any businesses that deal in guns and ammunition.”

Besides its heavy lobbying for the special legal protections for gunmakers and distributors, the NRA pushed successfully in 2004 to ensure that a 10-year ban on assault weapons, enacted in 1994 over strong NRA objections, wasn’t renewed. Since then, annual rifle production by U.S. gunmakers has risen by almost 38 percent, according to federal gun data.

“The NRA clearly benefits from the gun industry,” William Vizzard, a former agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told The Huffington Post. “There’s a symbiotic relationship. They have co-aligned goals much more than 30 or 40 years ago.”

Vizzard noted that the gun industry has evolved slowly in recent decades from a “stodgy and conservative” business, which sold mostly rifles and sporting arms, to one that now traffics in paramilitary weapons and handguns. The NRA and the gun industry “have grown closer as the business has changed,” he said.

The intertwining interests of the NRA and the gun industry are also underscored by the gun company executives on the NRA board.

Among the gun industry heavyweights on the 76-seat NRA board are Ronnie Barrett, CEO of Tennessee-based Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, which makes a military-style rifle sold with high-capacity magazines. Pete Brownell, who heads Iowa-based Brownells Inc., another maker of high-capacity magazines, also sits on the NRA board.

These companies and other gun industry giants have ponied up big bucks to the NRA since 2005, according to a list of NRA corporate partners posted at its last convention.

For instance, Brownells is in an elite group of donors that have given between $1 million and $4.9 million since 2005. Barrett Firearms in the same period chipped in between $50,000 and $99,000.

Another notable donor is Freedom Group, which owns Bushmaster, the company that made the AR-15 military-style rifle used by Adam Lanza in his bloody assault on Sandy Hook. The Freedom Group has donated between $25,000 and $49,000 to the NRA’s corporate effort.

The NRA’s most generous gun industry backer is MidwayUSA, a distributor of high-capacity magazine clips, similar to ones that Lanza loaded into his Bushmaster rifle and Glock pistol. These clips increase the lethality of weapons by allowing dozens of shots to be fired before the shooter has to reload. According to its website, Midway has donated about $7.7 million to the NRA through another fundraising program that dates back to 1992. Under this program, customers who buy Midway products are asked to “round up” the price to the next dollar, with the company donating the difference to the NRA.



While the bond between the NRA and the gun industry has tightened, the NRA’s annual budget of about $250 million is still largely derived from other sources, including membership dues, merchandising and ads in NRA magazines. The magazines, though, are chock-full of gun industry ads.

Still, veteran gun control advocates said the NRA’s links with the gun industry may backfire as it deploys its lobbying to stave off new curbs.

“I think it’s much easier for policymakers to defend the NRA when they’re perceived as efforts on behalf of gun owners,” Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, said. “That equation changes dramatically when they’re seen as defending the gun industry.”

Whether this prediction holds true in the looming debate over gun control remains to be seen. But in the early-2000s, most lawmakers had few reservations about showing their support for the NRA -- even when the organization was lobbying for a law that would carve out a legal safe haven for the gun industry from civil negligence lawsuits.

'HOW'S THE WAR GOING?'

The fight to pass the liability shield law, known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, began after state attorneys general won a landmark $200 billion settlement against tobacco companies on claims they knowingly misled smokers about the dangers of cigarettes.

The success of the smoking cases led more than 30 cities and municipalities to sue the gun industry, citing negligence in the marketing and sale of firearms. The industry also faced increasing negligence lawsuits filed by victims of gun violence.

The most significant of these cases was brought by the families of the 13 people killed or seriously injured over a three-week span by the Washington, D.C.-area snipers, John Muhammad and Lee Malvo. The pair used a .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle, the same model as Lanza. The weapon was allegedly stolen from a gun shop with a history of weapons ""disappearing"" from its inventory. The victims' families claimed the shop was negligent, as was the gunmaker, for not better policing problem stores.

In 2004, Bushmaster and the gun dealer settled the lawsuit for $2.5 million in a case that gun control advocates hailed as a ""major breakthrough.""

The gun company warned that cases like this could bankrupt it. Gunmakers described the legal fight in militaristic terms.

""As I walk through the plant, employees stop to ask me 'How's the war going?'"" said Rodd Walton, the top lawyer for Sig Sauer, then called Sigarms, at a congressional hearing in 2005. “It's the war we are fighting against plaintiffs filing junk and frivolous lawsuits.""

Though the gun industry has its own lobbying arm, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, based in Newtown, Conn., its influence pales in comparison with the NRA, which grades lawmakers on their fealty to the Second Amendment, and runs attack ads against candidates it perceives as on the wrong side of the fight. In the wake of its last major defeat -- the 1994 assault weapons ban -- the NRA mounted a successful campaign to push many of the ban's supporters, especially Democrats from rural areas, out of office.

The gun industry found a ready ally in the NRA, as Heston’s 1999 call to arms demonstrated. To aid its cause in Congress, the NRA enlisted one of its most trusted and powerful soldiers: then-Republican Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a longtime NRA board member.

The NRA and its allies argued that the lawsuits could destroy the gun industry, thus endangering Second Amendment rights.

""The cost of these lawsuits threatens to drive a critical industry out of business ... jeopardizing Americans' constitutionally protected access to firearms for self defense and other lawful uses,"" Craig said.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence fiercely opposed the bill to protect gunmakers from liability. ""This was entirely a fight for the gun industry and more specifically for the worst actors in the gun industry,"" said Jonathan Lowry, a lawyer for the organization.

One of the bill's congressional opponents was Rep. Mel Watt. (D-N.C.). ""I had no animosity toward guns, I had an animosity for setting precedents for other industries,"" Watt recently told The Huffington Post. Watt said he didn't understand why gunmakers should gain a legal shield available to no other industry.

But the NRA won the day, handily. Craig, who did not respond to a request for comment made through his lobbying firm, spearheaded the effort to get the bill through the U.S. Senate, where it eventually collected 15 Democratic votes, including that of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

In May 2006, the NRA's lobbying arm awarded Craig the Harlon B. Carter Legislative Achievement Award, its highest honor.

'MASSIVE OBAMA CONSPIRACY'

Since the passage of the 2005 law, ties between the NRA and the gunmakers have deepened.

The gun industry and other large corporate and individual donors chipped in $71.1 million in 2011 to NRA coffers, compared with $46.3 million in 2004, according to a Bloomberg News review of NRA tax returns.

The NRA’s fierce lobbying for other laws -- especially bills that have passed in almost every state allowing the carrying of concealed weapons -- also seem to have endeared the pro-gun goliath to many companies. After Wisconsin passed its concealed carry law, Fifer of Sturm Ruger told analysts in an earnings call that sales in the Badger State should get a boost.

As the debate about gun control moves forward, some analysts said the NRA's hard-line rhetoric benefits the gun industry in another way: it boosts sales.

“The NRA is generating fear,” said Vizzard, the former federal agent. “The industry has learned that the more controversy there is about guns, the more guns sell -- whether it’s a legitimate controversy over a bill, or a trumped-up one like, 'Obama’s been re-elected, they’re going to take away our guns.'”

A case in point has been the NRA’s strident rhetoric about the threat posed by President Barack Obama. The president, to the dismay of gun control advocates, failed to back new gun curbs in his first term, even though he endorsed renewing the lapsed assault weapons ban during his 2008 campaign.

Even so, the NRA's LaPierre fiercely opposed Obama's reelection, warning in late 2011 of a ""massive Obama conspiracy to deceive voters and hide his true intentions to destroy the Second Amendment in our country.” Interestingly, stock prices for gunmakers Sturm, Ruger and Smith & Wesson jumped in the wake of Obama’s November win.

After the Newtown massacre, sales jumped again. Given the NRA's past rhetoric, the odds are good that it will characterize any new gun legislation as proof that it was right to be wary of the president's motives.

Even so, the NRA would be wise to consider whether its rhetoric and agressive anti-gun control stance might alienate some of its membership, Vizzard said. Historically, he said, the NRA membership ""appears to be more amenable,"" to certain types of regulation than the NRA leadership is.

The NRA’s ability to intimidate legislators at the polls may also be waning after last fall’s election. The NRA spent $17.4 million on the presidential and congressional contests in last year's general elections, according to Open Secrets, the web site for the Center for Responsive Politics. The NRA failed to unseat Obama and lost six out of seven Senate races, where it spent more than $100,000, according to Media Matters.

That gives hope to Rep. McCarthy as Congress begins to consider new legislation, including her bill to ban the sale of new high-capacity clips: “We’ve had members of Congress who’ve stood up the NRA and they’ve survived elections,” McCarthy said."
huffpo14,huffpo,"['Erin Schumaker', 'Senior Reporter']",2016-11-04 10:45:47-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/99-percent-chance-you-know-gun-violence-victim_us_581920c5e4b0f96eba96c42e,"For many people hearing about gun violence, it can feel really far away ― a mass shooting on the other side of the country, a death in the home of a gun owner, the street violence described in Donald Trump’s offensive appeal to African-American voters: “You walk down the street, you get shot.”

Indeed, racial segregation helps further the myth that many Americans won’t be affected by gun violence.

“Because everyday gun violence is concentrated in racially segregated neighborhoods, it’s easy for millions of Americans to think they won’t be affected,” the Guardian reported in a June investigation into America’s gun problem.

But in reality, firearm injuries and death will impact nearly every single American over the course of his or her lifetime.

According to a study published this month in the journal Preventive Medicine, there’s a 99 percent chance that someone in your social network will by injured or killed by a gun over the course of your lifetime. Those statistics don’t differ much by race, with 97 percent of white Americans, 99 percent of black Americans, 99 percent of Hispanic Americans and 90 percent of people of other races knowing at least one person affected by gunfire by the time they turn 60.

“When you start talking to people, you realize that everybody knows somebody who’s been injured by a gun,” said study author Dr. Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and a dean at the Boston University School of Public Health. “This is a challenge that we all need to wrap our brains around. Not simply a challenge that affects people who are ‘other’ or unlike us.”

Galea and his BU colleagues relied on fatal and non-fatal gun injury data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as research that estimates the average person’s social network to be a relatively similar group of 291 people.

Of course, not all social networks lack diversity. “I would expect that there is more heterogeneity across groups than the paper could actually capture,” Galea said, noting that he and his colleagues applied gold standard social network assumptions to their model, but in the end, the results are group averages.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 82,000 people are injured and 33,000 people are killed by firearms every year. One statistic that often goes underreported: More than 21,000 of those gun deaths are by suicide.

Focusing on so-called ‘inner-city’ gun violence obscures much of the problem

Firearms kill black Americans at twice the rate of white Americans, according to a 2014 study published in the British Medical Journal. And as the Guardian rightly notes, poor and racially segregated neighborhoods (the south and west sides of Chicago for example) have higher levels of gun violence.

But ignoring the widespread nature of firearm injuries and deaths flattens the picture: It discounts deaths by suicide and discourages communities outside of the gun violence spotlight from investing in solutions to a problem that affects everyone.

For example, suicide is concentrated in white America.

Two-thirds of gun deaths are suicides and white men make up the majority of those deaths, accounting for 83 percent of suicides in 2014. And the problem is growing. Suicide by any method increased by 43 percent among middle-aged men, ages 45 to 64, over the last 15 years.

What’s more, white Americans are more likely than black Americans to view guns positively. According to a 2014 Pew survey on gun ownership attitudes, white Americans (62 percent) are more likely than black Americans (54 percent) to say that guns protect people rather than put people’s personal safety at risk.

Coupled with the new study, the Pew survey suggests that the majority of Americans ― and especially white Americans ― perceive firearms as safer than they are.

Starting from scratch on firearm research

The new study, like most gun violence research, doesn’t have much to build on.

“Gun violence is probably the only thing in this country that kills so many people, injures so many people, that we are not actually doing sufficient research on,” Dr. Alice Chen, the executive director of Doctors for America, told HuffPost last year.

The Dickey Amendment, passed in 1996 following National Riffle Association pressure, effectively stifled firearm research for the next two decades by forbidding CDC funding “to advocate or promote gun control.” But in 2013, after the Sandy Hook massacre, President Barack Obama issued an executive order to the to CDC to resume studying gun violence causes and prevention.

Still, the CDC hasn’t done much to wade back into the field, and even an executive order from the president can’t undo 20 years of missed research."
huffpo15,huffpo,"['Sara Gates', 'Law Student', 'Former Journalist']",2013-02-27 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/teachers-guns-schools-survey-firearms_n_2773558.html,"Following the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, several state lawmakers introduced proposals that would enable teachers and staff to carry firearms in schools, or allow districts to hire armed guards. However, the results of a national teacher survey, released Wednesday, suggests the goals of the ""guns-in-schools"" bills may be far from what teachers really want.

According to the online poll, 72.4 percent of teachers would not likely bring a firearm to school, if allowed. Administered by the School Improvement Network in January, the questionnaire surveyed 10,661 educators from all 50 states.

The results echo a similar poll, conducted in January by the National Education Association, that found 68 percent of its members -- primarily teachers, faculty and education support staff -- opposed a proposal to arm teachers.

""They are the ones that are living with the risk as it relates to school safety and violence,"" Chet Linton, chief executive officer of the teacher-training company that administered the most recent survey, told USA Today about the motivation behind the poll, ""so we thought it would be good just to share what they had to say.""

The survey paints an interesting picture of how gun violence in schools -- especially in the wake of Sandy Hook -- has shaped teacher opinions about school safety. While 91.6 percent of respondents said they feel safe in school, educators are far from unanimous when it comes to school safety and guns.

According to the poll's results, 31.1 percent of teachers say their schools are not safe from gun violence.

While legislators in states such as Arizona, North Carolina and Mississippi have proposed bills that would enable teachers to carry firearms in schools, a majority of teachers (87.8 percent) would prefer armed police officers over arming themselves (27.6 percent).

Recently, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan spoke out on behalf of educators, calling such proposals to arm teachers ""a marketing opportunity"" for the gun industry.

""The vast majority of teachers have spoken pretty loudly and said they're not interested in being armed, so that's a red herring,"" Duncan told reporters during a meeting at the U.S. Education Department.

Instead, the White House has suggested allowing individual school districts the opportunity to hire armed guards -- but only if they want them. In January, President Barack Obama addressed school safety issues, recommending that resource officers be placed in schools in order to help prevent crime and violence. Though these in-school police officers would be federally funded, they are by no means a requirement for all districts."

In Nevada, like in most states, it’s legal to openly carry long guns, like rifles and shotguns. No permit is required for this sort of display. That means people are allowed to walk down the Las Vegas Strip with a military-style rifle slung over their shoulder, although casinos and other private businesses can bar those individuals from their premises.

It’s also legal in Nevada to own a fully automatic firearm, such as a machine gun, though federal regulations require owners to pay a $200 fee and submit to an extensive federal background check and fingerprinting, which can take up to a year to complete. This weaponry is regulated under the National Firearms Act. Some states have laws specifically restricting machine guns, but most don’t.

Because of the rarity of these weapons, however, fully automatic firearms can be incredibly expensive ― usually between $20,000 and $30,000, said Benjamin Bunker, a Las Vegas attorney who specializes in firearms-related matters.

“If he was gonna buy a full-auto machine gun, he would’ve found a dealer online selling it, they would have entered into a purchase agreement, he’d pay the guy, the guy would then transfer the full-auto machine gun to a dealer, and then the dealer holds on to that gun until the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] gives him the green light,” said Bunker.

There are plenty of firearms on the black market. But illegal full-automatic machine guns are a top priority for ATF, and are harder to find, said Bunker.

That said, Nevada does not specifically restrict open carrying of machine guns.

“Nevada doesn’t make any distinction, semi-auto versus full auto,” said Bunker.

Authorities have not yet publicly identified any weapons the gunman used on Sunday, but confirmed that the shooter rained down fully automatic gunfire on a crowd of concertgoers, killing at least 58 people and injuring more than 500 from his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino. Las Vegas police said there were at least 10 firearms in his hotel room, including “long rifles.”

Typical military-style rifles are semi-automatic and are not capable of automatic fire, but they can be illegally altered to do so. Nevada does not restrict this popular type of semi-automatic weaponry, nor does it limit high-capacity magazines. Most states don’t."

But few people may know that the California Democrat used to own a firearm herself.

During an appearance at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club on Wednesday, Feinstein recounted the time she was targeted by a domestic terrorist group, the New World Liberation Front, while a member of the city's Board of Supervisors in the mid-1970s.

She described finding an unexploded bomb outside her San Francisco home, the lives of her family members saved only by a rare overnight freeze that disarmed the weapon's mechanism. Shaken from the scare, and another incident in which the windows of her beach house were shot out, Feinstein obtained a revolver that she kept in her purse.

""I thought if they were going to take me out, I wanted to take a few of them with me,"" she told the audience with a laugh.

But after witnessing the assassination of City Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone in 1978, Feinstein's views on guns shifted. She later gave up her concealed weapons permit.

""I was the one that found Supervisor Milk's body, and I was the one to put a finger in a bullet hole, trying to get a pulse,"" Feinstein, who succeeded Moscone as mayor following his death, told the Advocate in an interview earlier this year. ""Once you have been through one of these episodes, once you see what the crime scene is like -- it isn't like the movies -- it changes your view of weapons.""

""I know from first-hand experience what damage ... weapons can do to bodies,"" she explained at Wednesday's event. ""I have a deep belief that these weapons are antithetical to our values.""

Feinstein said that one of her proudest moments was handing a cross made of melted-down firearms, including her own revolver, obtained through a San Francisco gun buyback program to Pope John Paul II while on a trip to Rome in the early 1980s. Feinstein later authored the since-expired federal assault weapons ban signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994.

On Wednesday, she expressed frustration with Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) decision to cut a new measure banning assault weapons from a broader package of gun control legislation pushed by congressional Democrats in the wake of the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn. As the chief sponsor of a proposed ban on many semi-automatic weapons, she was unable to guarantee the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster. Reid has promised the provision will later be submitted as an amendment to a gun control package, to be voted on separately.

Feinstein blamed much of the reticence of lawmakers to come out in favor of gun control squarely on the outsize influence of the National Rife Association.

""[Some officials] are afraid the NRA will come into their state with $5 million -- in Arkansas or in North Dakota or in Montana -- and defeat them,"" she said. ""These rural states are much more difficult for people to stand tall on when it comes to guns.""

She added that she believes many lawmakers' decisions are motivated by fear.

""There's fear [among some senators] that if they vote for the [gun control] bill they wont be reelected,"" she charged. ""I say, if they're not willing to vote [for what they believe in], they shouldn't be in the Senate in the first place."""

Greg Abbot signed legislation permitting people with proper licenses to carry handguns in plain view. Though this so-called ""open carry"" law won't take effect until January, one Texas restaurant chain has already prohibited visible firearms from its properties, and experts say other local eateries will follow.

While only 5 states and Washington, D.C., now ban open carry in public places, businesses can issue their own no-gun policies. In fact, a HuffPost/YouGov poll in 2014 found that 55 percent of Americans prefer that shops and restaurants forbid guns.

In recent years, several major restaurants and retailers across the country have asked customers to refrain from openly carrying firearms -- some have even banned concealed guns altogether from their locations. Here are a few of the businesses that have taken a stand against open carry laws:

1. Whataburger

We’ve had many customers and employees tell us they’re uncomfortable being around someone with a visible firearm who is not a member of law enforcement, and as a business, we have to listen and value that feedback. ... We have a responsibility to make sure everyone who walks into our restaurants feels comfortable. For that reason, we don’t restrict licensed concealed carry but do ask customers not to open carry in our restaurants.

On July 2, the Texas-based hamburger chain asked customers to refrain from openly carrying firearms in its restaurants. Whataburger President and CEO Preston Atkinson affirmed his company's commitment to serving the gun rights community -- even mentioning that he has his own open carry license -- but went on to say that customers had expressed concerns over visible firearms in the restaurants. Concealed carry, he added, is fine for Wataburger patrons, but he asked people not to open carry in his stores:

2. Chipotle

The display of firearms in our restaurants has now created an environment that is potentially intimidating or uncomfortable for many of our customers.

Chipotle, which noted that it traditionally complies with local laws regarding open and concealed firearms, asked customers in 2014 to refrain from bringing firearms into its stores. The move came after a group of open carry activists appeared at a Dallas-area store , bearing military-style assault rifles. When the gun-control advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America started a petition for Chipotle to publicly denounce the open carry of firearms in its stores, the company complied:

3. Panera Bread

Within our company, we strive to create Panera Warmth. This warmth means bakery-cafes where customers and associates feel comfortable and welcome. To this end, we ask that guns not be brought into this environment unless carried by an authorized law enforcement officer. Panera respects the rights of gun owners, but asks our customers to help preserve the environment we are working to create for our guests and associates.

Following Chipotle's lead, Panera Bread also asked customers not to bring guns into its restaurants. In a statement, the company said:

4. Sonic

Sonic and our franchise owners work hard to provide an inviting environment for customers and employees alike. While we historically have relied upon local laws to guide how we address the display of guns at drive-ins, recent actions required we carefully reconsider this approach. We’ve considered the views and desires of our customers and employees that staff the drive-ins across the country. Accordingly, we’re asking that customers refrain from bringing guns onto our patios or into our indoor dining areas. With respect to the storage of guns in vehicles, we ask that our customers continue to honor local laws.

In 2014, Sonic waded into the debate, announcing that firearms were no longer allowed in its restaurants. Patrick Lenow, Sonic's vice president of public relations, told HuffPost

5. Chili's

We recognize that the open carry of firearms creates an uncomfortable atmosphere and is not permitted under many local liquor laws. So, we kindly ask that guests refrain from openly carrying firearms into our restaurants and we will continue to follow state and local laws on this issue.”

Chili's launched a coordinated statement with Sonic to take a stand against open carry policies. Ashley Johnson, a spokeswoman for Chili's' parent company, Brinker International, explained the company's decision in a 2014 email to HuffPost:

6. Starbucks

Recently ... we’ve seen the 'open carry' debate become increasingly uncivil and, in some cases, even threatening. Pro-gun activists have used our stores as a political stage for media events misleadingly called 'Starbucks Appreciation Days' that disingenuously portray Starbucks as a champion of 'open carry.' To be clear: we do not want these events in our stores. Some anti-gun activists have also played a role in ratcheting up the rhetoric and friction, including soliciting and confronting our customers and partners. For these reasons, today we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer bring firearms into our stores or outdoor seating areas—even in states where 'open carry' is permitted—unless they are authorized law enforcement personnel.

Starbucks was among the first chains to request that customers leave their firearms at home. In 2013, CEO Howard Schultz wrote an open letter to customers regarding the polarizing issue of open carry:

7. Target

This is a complicated issue, but it boils down to a simple belief: Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create.

In 2014, the third-largest retailer in the U.S. told customers not to carry guns in its stores. Target's interim CEO said in a statement:"

The Violence Policy Center, a research group that advocates for gun safety legislation, has found in past reports that traffic fatalities have been declining due to what the organization calls ""effective regulation,"" such as safety prevention initiatives, improved vehicle and highway design, and efforts from the government and advocacy groups. Firearm-related deaths, meanwhile, have only climbed.

The VPC analyzed the latest available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tallies all gun deaths, including suicides and accidents, and all fatalities in car crashes. As the number of people who die in car crashes goes down, the organization says, the number of people who die from guns is going up needlessly.

""Firearms are the only consumer product the federal government does not regulate for health and safety,"" VPC Legislative Director Kristen Rand said in a press release. ""Meanwhile, science-based regulations have dramatically reduced deaths from motor vehicles in recent decades. It’s well past time that we regulate firearms for health and safety just like all other consumer products.""

When VPC first compared firearm and traffic deaths in 2009, gun deaths exceeded fatal motor vehicle accidents in only 10 states. That number more than doubled in just six years.

(A full list of the 21 states can be found here.)

""The historic drop in motor vehicle deaths illustrates how health and safety regulation can reduce deaths and injuries that were at one time thought to be unavoidable,"" the report stated.

Nine out of 10 American households in 2014 had access to cars, while only one-third had access to guns, according to the group.

Automobile deaths far outpaced gun deaths for years, but that gap has been closing steadily over the past decade. In 2014, the Center for American Progress predicted that more young Americans would die from guns than motor vehicles in 2015. Other reports have made similar predictions across all age groups, suggesting that 2015 could be the first year gun deaths would top automobile deaths nationwide.

Last year's data isn't available yet, but the VPC shows that vehicle deaths still exceeded gun fatalities nationwide in 2014 -- 35,647 to 33,599. However, the organization says gun deaths will surpass motor vehicle deaths in more and more states if current trends continue.

Violence Policy Center

Gun violence kills an average of 36 people a day in the U.S. -- a number that doesn't include suicides, which account for more than 60 percent of all firearm deaths -- and many experts say the time to rethink our approach to the problem is overdue.

Doctors For America, an organization for medical professionals and students promoting health, now calls gun violence a public health crisis, and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has referred to gun violence as a health epidemic.

Congress has not budged on restrictions it passed two decades ago that have kept the CDC from researching gun violence as a public health issue. Earlier this month, a number of senators called for a hearing on the years-long blockage and pushed for the agency to research the issue.

Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) also presented legislation that would invest $10 million a year over the next decade into the CDC’s gun violence research."

This time, it was technically a Sig Sauer MCX, but it's in the same classification of gun. It's a category of weapon called ""military"" or ""assault rifles."" And while some people would like to blame that nomenclature on the ""ignorance"" of liberals, it's how they are actually marketed.

But there is also a technical distinction between an assault weapon and the ""semi-automatic rifles"" which the gun advocates want you to know about.

I will quote the Blaze here, so as to not be called ""gun grabber"" or be accused of any bias in my definition:

For the purpose of this article, we'll focus on AR-15s since it is what CBS calls ""the most popular rifle in America"" and one often designated an ""assault"" rifle. An AR-15 is the civilian equivalent to the military's M-16. So what's the difference? Kelly Alwood, a firearms trainer and consultant, told TheBlaze the only difference is that one is fully automatic and the other is semi-automatic. It's a small yet simultaneously big distinction. Firearms for use by the military are able to shoot continuously with one pull of the trigger, machine-gun style. Civilian firearms, on the other hand, only allow one shot per trigger pull.

So one is semi-automatic, and the other is fully automatic. Got it.

See, with a semi-automatic weapon, you have to pull the trigger each time you want to fire a round. You can't just hold the trigger down and have a steady stream of bullets come out like you can with a fully automatic.

Doesn't that sound a lot less deadly?

This, to the gun-rights advocate, is the quintessential distinction between them. But that's a distinction without a difference.

Then there's what's called a ""bump stock.""

You can buy one right here for just $135.95.

So what is a bump stock, you ask?

I'll let this guy tell you because he seems like he knows what he's talking about. After all, he's selling them, right?

At about the 20-second mark, what did he say?

""This stock will let you use your semi-automatic rifle to bump-fire--or mimic automatic firing--without breaking any laws.""

""Mimic automatic firing... without breaking any laws.""

Those are his words, not mine. And while he goes on to adhere to the semantic distinction, he's doing it emphasizing that in practicality, there is not one.

Alright, so what does that mean.

At 38 seconds:

""Bump firing is the use of a recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to simulate the effect of firing fully auto.""

So basically, it lets you do the same thing as a fully automatic weapon; it just lets you do it in a slightly different way. Each time the gun recoils, it bounces back, which causes it to automatically pull the trigger again, which causes another recoil and so on.

With both an automatic weapon and a bump stock, you're holding your finger still while the gun automatically fires, but on a technicality, the trigger is being pulled each time with a semi-automatic.

Using the word ""automatic"" as an adjective, you can describe a semi-automatic with a bump stock as an automatic weapon, even you can't call it one by its technical definition.

Perhaps a visual will help. Here's a guy bump-firing 100 rounds in a matter of seconds:

Visually, does that seem any different than an automatic gun to you? Would you feel terrified if you were pinned in with a crowd as someone fired into it with a gun like that? Or would you feel safe and secure in knowing that it's not really an assault rifle?

But there's a problem with the guy in the last video. He's using what's called a double drum, and they suck. They tend to jam up, and that's the last thing you want to happen if you're trying to murder 100 people in a matter of minutes. Just ask James Holmes.

So what's a would-be psychopath to do?

Well he could go buy himself the top-rated AR-15/M16 50RD 223/5.56X15 DRUM Magazine which sells for $215.00 and describes itself as:

Rugged, reliable 50-round drum magazine designed for .308/7.62x51mm & .223/5.56x45mm, full metal jacket ammunition provides plenty of capacity and reduces reloading time. Rated for full-auto fire, the low-profile drum is still compact enough for shooting from the prone position. Integral hand wheel makes it easy to crank back the spring for quick loading/unloading. X-15 magazine fits AR-15/M16 style rifles, and functions with .223/5.56x45mm & 300 Blackout ammunition. The X-15 is also shorter than a standard 30rd magazine.

It's designed to reload quickly, and it's rated for full auto fire--their words, not mine.

Becuase in case the first 50 rounds that went into the deer didn't do the job, you need to be able to dump another 50 into him fast, or Bambi might get away.

Look, let's stop with this nonsensical distinction without a difference between automatic and semiautomatic. With a bump stock, it's effectively the same thing. The ""gun rights"" people know it because they're the ones buying it; the gun manufacturers know it because they're the ones selling it.

And the killers know it because they're using them to shoot over 100 people in a matter of minutes.

Do you think those victims feel any less ""assaulted"" because they weren't ""technically"" shot by an assault weapon?

What they're hoping for is that the rest of us won't know, and we'll just buy into the ""one pull per bullet"" nonsensical rhetoric and let it go.

I don't think the founders had the Orlando shooting in mind when they wrote the Second Amendment.

But we should in considering our gun legislation and start recognizing the difference between a weapon to defend yourself and your family and one designed for assaulting others."
huffpo21,huffpo,"['Andy Campbell', 'Senior Reporter', 'Roque Planas', 'National Reporter']",2016-06-14 19:18:48-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-orlando_us_576059f3e4b0e4fe5143fd4d,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- It took us 38 minutes to walk out of a gun shop with a death machine.

Just two days after Omar Mateen used a semi-automatic rifle to murder 49 innocent people and injure dozens more, we were able to purchase an AR-15 -- a rifle similar to Mateen’s that has been used in several other mass shootings on American soil -- in less time than it takes to buy a cart full of groceries.

We would have been locked and loaded within five minutes, but the gun shop employee we spoke to said the queue on background checks was longer than usual because people were scrambling to buy AR-15s in the wake of the shooting. That’s both terrifying and unsurprising -- gun sales often skyrocket after mass shootings.

But the ease with which we purchased our AR-15, a Vietnam-era gun hailed by the military as being the perfect killing machine, was surreal. This, despite the fact that Florida Gov. Rick Scott had declared a state of emergency in Orange County, which includes Orlando.

On any given day, regardless of whether your town has endured a horrific tragedy, it’s not hard to purchase a weapon of mass murder like we did in most of America. A reporter for the Philadelphia Daily News was able to get one in just seven minutes in Pennsylvania on Monday.

Within seconds, we had it in our hands: A rifle that weighs less than a small watermelon and can, like the MCX Sig Sauer that Mateen used, easily fire several dozen rounds in less than 10 seconds. Our Diamondback DB15's killing power is striking, and at $644, it’s a relatively affordable murder weapon.

Huffington Post HuffPost's Andy Campbell gets the feel of the Diamondback DB15.

Gun shop employees were happy to discuss lethality. When another customer looking to purchase a small, .22-caliber handgun noted that it wouldn’t fare well against a “6-foot-3, 350 pound man,” the employee agreed.

“You’d have to hit him in the neck or the heart,” said the employee, whom we aren’t naming for this story.

He went on to joke with the customer that he should either pick a bigger gun or use the .22 to “shoot him in the stomach 15 times, that’d really piss him off.”

Behind him, the TV blared Fox News coverage of the massacre at Pulse nightclub, located nearby. On the wall, a framed photo of President Barack Obama with the caption, “Firearm Salesman Of The Year,” hung next to an array of other long rifles, some of them higher caliber than the AR-15, and some of them more affordable, too.

Semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 have been used in several of the most deadly shooting rampages in the United States in recent years, even before the attack in Orlando. The killers behind the mass shootings in San Bernardino, California, the elementary school at Newtown, Connecticut, and the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, all used AR-15s.

Huffington Post

Andy Campbell/Huffington Post

They’re not the cheapest rifles around -- another, higher-caliber carbine hung on the wall at our shop for half the price. But the National Rifle Association calls the AR-15 the most popular weapon in the U.S. ""It is customizable, adaptable, reliable and accurate,"" the organization says on its blog.

Shop workers told us we’d have to wait if we wanted to buy a smaller gun. There’s a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases in Florida, but that rule does not apply to rifles.

The employee made some small talk, declaring that all guns fall under one of three classifications: Leisure, defense and hunting. We aren’t sure which category Mateen’s gun falls under.

Under any of the gun shop employee’s definitions, there seems no reason for a weapon that can fire 10 or more bullets in quick succession. The AR-15 and its close cousins are not made to hunt deer. They’re made to kill people.

All it took to attain one was a driver’s license (the one we used was from out of state) and a few minutes to wait for the background check to clear. We signed state-issued proof of sale documents that asked whether we were felons or drug addicts, and where we lived.

Waiting for the background check was the hardest part -- and that only involved a few minutes of idle time. We requested data from the state Department of Law Enforcement on the current volume of background checks for similar guns, but did not get an immediate response. The department has been overwhelmed by public records requests since the shooting, a spokeswoman said.

Nothing that we or the store employees did was illegal or unusual. You can buy semi-automatic rifles at several stores in the Orlando area.



As of this writing, we have the same firepower that Mateen had when he opened fire at one of Orlando’s most famous gay clubs. We don’t have any ammunition, though -- the shop ran out of .223-caliber rounds.

We plan to return the gun. Eventually, it will join countless other rifles of its kind on the legal, Great American gun market.

UPDATE: 6/15 -- We attempted to return the AR-15 to the shop where we purchased it. Despite having a return policy, they refused. So we opted to turn the gun over to Orlando police, who said they would have it destroyed."
huffpo22,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter']",2016-06-17 12:52:37-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/assault-weapons-deaths_us_5763109de4b015db1bc8c123,"In the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, the political debate has quickly turned to the weapon a gunman used to massacre 49 people and injure 53 more at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday.

Some supporters of stricter gun laws argue it's far too easy to obtain firearms like the shooter's Sig Sauer MCX, an $1,800 semi-automatic rifle and a cousin of the highly popular AR-15. They say the same features that have made these weapons fit for the battlefield render them unfit for civilian use. In the wrong hands, their accuracy, reduced recoil, large magazine size and high rate of fire make these guns perfectly suited to inflict mass casualties in a short period of time. And it's hard to discount that concern: In seven of the last eight high-profile mass shootings -- as well as in earlier incidents in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado -- perpetrators were armed with assault-style rifles.

But as momentum builds for a new assault weapons ban, data shows just how small of an effect such legislation would have on the overall levels of gun violence in the U.S.

At least 84 people have been killed and 119 have been injured so far this year in 86 shooting incidents involving assault-style rifles, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation that tracks gun violence. Those numbers include the casualties at Pulse nightclub over the weekend.

There have been at least 267 incidents involving assault-style rifles in 2016, including reported weapons thefts, crimes in which the guns were brandished, arrests for illegal possession and other legal interventions in which they weren't fired.

Those deaths account for about 2 percent of the 6,153 gun deaths and less than 1 percent of the 12,560 gun injuries the Gun Violence Archive has counted so far this year. This tally consists largely of homicides and assaults, but also includes suicides that were part of a murder-suicide. It also counts accidental deaths, the majority of which involve handguns, not rifles.

If those numbers seem high, that's because they are. The U.S. has the highest gun death and ownership rates in the developed world. Americans are 10 times more likely to be killed with a gun than people in other developed nations; with an estimated 300 million to 400 million civilian firearms, the U.S. is by far the most heavily armed nation per capita. About 20 million to 30 million of those guns are assault-style rifles, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobbying group that wants you to refer to these weapons as ""modern sporting rifles.""

Gun Violence Archive notes that its count could be incomplete because it relies on news and police reports, which don't always include full details on the weapons used. Its data also only specifies incidents involving AR-15s and AK-47s, two of the most popular types of assault-style rifles but not the only ones available to civilians.

While these rifles hardly factor into the routine gun violence that rips through the nation every day, we found plenty of incidents that underscore the inherent danger they present.

In May, for example, a military veteran engaged in a standoff with police in Houston managed to fire off 212 shots from an AR-15 before a SWAT sniper killed him. He injured six people with the rifle, all after killing a man in an ambush with a handgun. The suspect's family claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Earlier this week in Detroit, armed gunmen used an AK-47 and another weapon to open fire on a vehicle, killing two and injuring one more in a hail of 30 bullets. An AK-47 was also used in a mass shooting in Pittsburgh earlier this year, when gunmen unloaded 49 rounds into a crowd of partygoers, killing five and wounding three.

Other shootings have flown further under the radar, likely because they didn't result in casualties. Earlier this week, a man reportedly armed with an AR-type rifle fired between 40 and 50 shots at police officers in Georgia. Nobody was injured.

With so many assault-style rifles already in circulation, gun advocates believe these rare instances of misuse shouldn't outweigh evidence suggesting that the overwhelming majority of owners are law-abiding citizens. But opponents argue that this level of firepower is unnecessary for civilians, especially considering how easy it is for them to obtain. They say these guns -- which have an average price tag of $1,000 but often come much cheaper -- give pretty much anyone the means to carry out a mass casualty event. Some lawmakers want to address that by renewing the sort of assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.

Which side is right? It's a worthwhile debate. And maybe we don't need to choose between nearly unlimited access and total prohibition. Maybe would-be buyers of assault-style rifles should have to first provide endorsements from people willing to vouch for their intentions. Maybe ""modern sporting"" riflemen and riflewomen should be required undergo periodic certification to make sure they're fit to be members of the ""well-regulated militia"" referenced in the Second Amendment. At the very least, maybe we shouldn't just let people buy these weapons on a whim, with no waiting period whatsoever."

I asked, ""Why are you wearing that?"" and he said, ""Because I can."" In Arizona, he could.

Then I told him he could either work for network news that day, or wear the gun, but not both.

But I've thought about that moment many times in trying to understand guns, and passionate gun people. The attraction to guns and the ""because I can"" mentality is foreign to people like me who don't care about guns, but it is the central conflict in the national debate. Millions of Americans own guns because they can, not because they particularly need them, or have plans to use them. Most guns are never fired. But since President Obama was reelected, and the Newtown massacre, gun shops have been selling out as buyers snap up guns for fear that in a few months they won't be able to. They're buying guns now, while they can, because they can.

The president's proposal for a renewed assault weapons ban and other tighter restrictions on gun buying will only further whip up the frenzy. It's what the gun guys have been afraid of since he was first elected.

Very popular is the AR-15 and its multiple clones, the semi-automatic rifle based originally on the military M-16. It's black, mechanical, and utilitarian. With its collapsing stock, sights, scopes and accessory rails, it looks a little like a fantasy weapon out of a video game. It is quite good at putting multiple rounds dead on target without punishing your shoulder. They are known as ""black guns."" Buyers don't want a beautiful $3,000 custom-made Beretta shotgun with hand-carved scrollwork and a polished walnut stock. They want military-ugly.

The AR-15 feeds the fantasy that in a national emergency The Boys from Vermont could pull out their guns and save the nation. Or the true patriots could resist an American government that's gone astray and become the oppressor. Never mind that what most oppresses people is not a soldier at the door, it's a tax bill.

Think what's happening to so many Americans. Pay is shrinking, if you have a job at all. Kids are on drugs, cellphones, videogames or all three. Taxes are rising but the street department doesn't have enough money to fill the pothole in front of your house. People are being nibbled to death by medical insurance paperwork, the price of cable television and the phone bill. They are losing their homes. They can't save for retirement and think Social Security won't be there. Millions of Americans feel like there is nothing they can do about any of it.

An AR-15 puts power in your hands and tells you that in some dire situations you could do something about it. In a post-apocalyptic breakdown, that unemployed man grabs his Bushmaster, defends the home and forages for food. He becomes the man again, strong and providing. The power to do it is right there in the bedroom closet.

Assault weapons are a problem, but they are also a symptom of frustration and powerlessness out there in America. When ""because I can"" is the primary reason for having a gun, you're in for a fight if you try to take it away. Simply owning a powerful gun convinces millions of Americans they are free."

“I understand that you’re standing up for the NRA … but you just told this group of people that you’re standing up for them,” he said. “You are not standing up for them until you say, ‘I want less weapons.’”

The sheriff’s words were met with cheers and a standing ovation.

Loesch was roundly lambasted at the town hall and on social media for various comments she made about gun control, many of which were misleading.

She repeatedly said that 19-year-old school shooter Nikolas Cruz, who legally purchased an AR-15-style assault rifle and other weapons, should not have been able to buy the firearm because he was an “insane monster” and “nuts.”

“People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” Loesch said, echoing a common misconception that mental health issues are a primary cause of gun violence. Her remark also ignores the fact that the NRA has also vocally advocated against gun bans on people with mental illness.

Netizens took to Twitter to challenge her remarks.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) in November, is calling out Blunt for not supporting tighter background checks on gun sales ― and in a way that only someone with Kander’s military background could do.

In an ad released Wednesday titled “Background Checks,” Kander, who is currently Missouri’s secretary of state, stands at a table assembling an AR-15 rifle while talking about his time in the U.S. Army. Oh, and he’s blindfolded.

“Senator Blunt has been attacking me on guns,” Kander says, jamming together gun parts he can’t see. “In Afghanistan, I volunteered to be an extra gun in a convoy of unarmored SUVs. And in the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights. I also believe in background checks so that terrorists can’t get their hands on one of these.”

Then, in dramatic fashion, he peels off the blindfold, looks into the camera and holds up the now-assembled rifle.

“I approve this message,” Kander says, “because I’d like to see Senator Blunt do this.”

Watch the ad here:

Blunt has voted at least twice against strengthening the background check system by closing the so-called gun show loophole and extending checks to all internet gun sales. About 90 percent of Americans support these reforms.

Kander’s ad comes after the National Rifle Association ran a spot accusing him of being weak on Second Amendment rights. The NRA endorsed Blunt in April.

The gun group was not impressed with Kander’s response:

You can visit the battlefield today, it's a national monument beautifully kept by the U.S. Park Service, located a half-hour's drive from the office of Maura Healey, who happens to be the current Massachusetts Attorney General, a.k.a., the AG.

Maura started her own little revolution last week by issuing a regulation that basically banned the purchase of AR-15 assault rifles throughout the Bay State. Current AR-15 owners (like me) can keep their guns, they can also transfer them to anyone else who can own firearms in Massachusetts, but in terms of the civilian arsenal being increased through the addition of more AR rifles, to all intents and purposes Massachusetts is now AR-rein.

Two things happened within 24 hours after the ban was announced: (1). Every, single AR in the inventory of every single gun shop in Massachusetts was sold; and, (2). The Gun-mob Nation noise machine started going full blast. The NRA got right into the act by calling the AR order ""obviously incorrect;"" the National Review said that her action meant that Healey could make the state gun law ""mean what she wanted it to mean;"" and a Republican state legislator in Massachusetts, who is known for his outspoken reverence for anything having to do with the 2nd Amendment, filed a bill to strip the AG from having any ability to alter rules and regulations over gun sales.

Now the fact that gun sales are legal commerce, the fact that someone who purchases a gun in a gun shop is, ipso facto, a consumer, the fact that the AG's office runs a very active operation known as the Department of Consumer Protection, the fact that this means the AG has the authority to promulgate and enforce rules on items that are sold to consumers in Massachusetts, none of these facts mean anything to State Senator Don Humason or his Gun-mob Nation supporters at all. Because the truth is that Gun-mob Nation doesn't want gun sales or gun ownership to be regulated because any type of gun regulations are, you know the rest of this sentence, a violation of 2nd-Amendment 'rights.' Now it just so happens that such rules are not a violation of anything within the Constitution or without. But just tell that to Senator Humason and his Gun-mob Nation friends.

In particular his Gun-mob Nation friends, who began peppering various media venues like Facebook with some of the worst, most offensive comments about Maura that have ever been seen. Calling her a 'fascist,' a ''bitch,' a 'c**t,' the language made a Donald Trump speech sound like something out of Mary Poppins. According to the Boston Globe newspaper, one big-mouth tweeted that he wanted to hire a homeless person to rape and disembowel the AG.

Now don't get me wrong. Gun issues provoke strong emotions on both sides of the fence. And while I thought that the AG was absolutely correct in calling attention to the fact that removing a few, cosmetic doo-dads from an AR-15 doesn't in any way diminish the lethality of the gun. Nevertheless, gun owners have every right to voice their anger, and even State Senator Humason has the right to do a little grandstanding by filing his stupid bill.

Let me break the news to my friends in Gun-mob Nation. There's a pretty good chance that a certain person will be president next year and I don't mean Donald Trump. And there's a good chance that she will send a gun bill to Congress, but being committed to the usual process, she'll invite input from both sides. So Gun-mob Nation will have a choice -- either get a seat at the table or stand around outside. And I guarantee you that if they use the language that Massachusetts Gun-mob Nation is using against Maura Healey, they'll be standing outside."

Police in Bardstown, Kentucky, say Adam Tingle’s wife told him she saw a clown outside, and he yelled at the person in question, The Kentucky Standard reported Saturday. When the person didn’t react, he allegedly fired one shot into the air to scare them off, and his wife called 911.

Apparently, the “clown” was actually a woman walking her dog. Tingle was charged with second-degree wanton endangerment.

Of course, this raises the question of why someone’s reaction to seeing a clown would be shooting at them. Cops say Tingle told them he was scared because of recent criminal activity involving clowns.

Tingle was referring to a bizarre series of so-called “creepy clown” incidents that have been reported throughout the United States over the past few weeks, beginning with a little boy in Greenville, South Carolina, who told his mother that two clowns were trying to lure him into the woods.

Since then, reports of clown incidents — from simply spotting creepy-looking clowns to reports of physical violence — have exploded across the United States. Many of the reports have turned up no physical evidence, and some have proven to be outright hoaxes — like when an Ohio teenager was late for work and allegedly made up a story about a clown attacking her as an excuse.

The media-fueled frenzy has led to increased fear of anyone who may appear to be dressed as a clown. In Tingle’s state of Kentucky, a man was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge after allegedly dressing in a clown costume and walking in a wooded area near some apartments in the middle of the night. And in New Haven, Connecticut, public schools have banned clown costumes for Halloween under the premise that the outfits would be “threatening” given the nation’s current coulrophobic vibe."

On Feb. 13, 2015, ATF proposed treating certain types of 5.56-by-45-millimeter ammunition as banned armor-piercing handgun ammunition and withdrawing an exemption previously granted to the M855 5.56-by-45-millimeter cartridge because it fell within the ""sporting purposes"" exemption to the ban. In the proposal, ATF explains:

Specifically, 5.56mm projectiles loaded into the SS109 and M855 cartridges are commonly used in both ""AR-type"" rifles and 'AR-type' handguns. The AR platform is the semi-automatic version of the M16 machinegun originally designed for and used by the military. The AR-based handguns and rifles utilize the same magazines and share identical receivers. These AR-type handguns were not commercially available when the armor piercing ammunition exemption was granted in 1986. To ensure consistency, upon final implementation of the sporting purpose framework outlined above, ATF must withdraw the exemptions for 5.56 mm 'green tip' ammunition, including both the SS109 and M855 cartridges.

The National Rifle Assocation (NRA) and the Newtown-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) moved quickly to label the ATF proposal a backdoor effort to ban AR-15 assault rifles (ignoring the fact that the specific ammunition in question is just one type of round compatible with the weapon). The NRA, labeling President Obama a ""dictator"" in an alert sent to its members, warned that the proposal was ""a move clearly intended by the Obama Administration to suppress the acquisition, ownership and use of AR-15s and other .223 caliber general purpose rifles....""





This is despite the fact that ATF is only doing what the NRA and other members of the gun lobby consistently argue should be done: enforcing the gun laws already on the books. Opponents also allege that no law-enforcement officer has been shot with one of the cartridges fired from a handgun. Testing the veracity of that assertion is challenging, but the whole point of the ban on ""armor-piercing"" ammunition is to prevent law enforcement and first responders who rely on body armor from ever having to face assailants wielding handguns loaded with armor-piercing rounds.

Yet left unstated is the fact that ATF's proposal, as detailed in a new report from my organization, the Violence Policy Center, is the direct result of the gun industry's own actions.

Facing a continuing decline in household gun ownership, the gun industry is constantly engaged in efforts to create new product lines to sell to a shrinking consumer base. In recent years the industry has aggressively marketed AR-15 assault pistols that use common rifle ammunition, such as the 5.56-by-45-millimeter round used in AR-type assault rifles.

As a 2011 article published in Handguns magazine, titled ""AR Pistols: The Hugely Popular Rifle Platform Makes a Pretty Cool Handgun as Well,"" noted, ""There's no doubt in the last few years that AR pistols have become extremely popular.""

These pistols have emerged as part of a new and growing trend. They combine the firepower of a rifle, able to accept high-capacity ammunition magazines designed for assault rifles, with the increased concealability of a handgun. As a result, these weapons raise the question as to what degree they pose a special threat to law enforcement and the bullet-resistant vests that they rely upon as well as public safety in general.

A recent survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) found that more than 92 percent of officers reported that they are required to wear body armor, either ""at all times when on duty"" (57 percent) or ""at most times when on duty"" (35 percent). These percentages reflect the understanding of law-enforcement agencies that body armor is an essential element in protecting the lives of police officers. As a result, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data, since 1987 only one law-enforcement officer has been killed by handgun ammunition that penetrated body armor. At the same time, PERF points out that ""large majorities of officers -- between 89 and 99 percent -- understand that body armor ... generally cannot be relied upon to stop rifle bullets....""

In response to the ATF proposal, NSSF urged ""all industry employees, target shooters and gun owners"" to ""contact your Member of Congress AND the ATF to oppose this unnecessary ban...."" On its site NSSF acknowledges the industry's marketing efforts around AR-15 assault pistols, noting ""the increasing prevalence of handgun versions of rifle platforms...,"" yet takes no responsibility for the armor-piercing threat this new generation of pistols represents. Instead, like the NRA, the gun group portrays it as a plot by ATF to ""now ban the widely used M855 and SS109 ammunition."" Yet if the industry had not begun marketing these pistols, creating a new and lethal threat to law enforcement, the federal law regarding armor-piercing ammunition used in handguns would not have been applicable.

The gun industry knew that this new breed of assault pistol could trigger restrictions on specific types of ammunition that are considered armor-piercing when used in a handgun, but it moved ahead anyway, continually driven by the need to create new, militarized market categories in the face of declining household gun ownership. Now the gun industry and the National Rifle Association are attempting to rewrite history. Contrary to their assertions, the ATF proposal is not a backdoor attempt to limit the ammunition available for AR-15 rifles but the necessary response to a new threat created by the industry itself."

Aerosols of biological agents are invisible, silent, odorless, tasteless, relatively easily dispersed, and they are 600 to 2000 times cheaper than other weapons of mass destruction. It has been estimated that the cost of a biological weapon is about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per square kilometer. Production is comparatively easy, using common technology available for the production of some antibiotics, vaccines, foods, and beverages, and delivery systems such as spray devices from an airplane, boat, or car are commonly available.

Another appeal of biological agents for terrorists is the natural lead time provided by the organism's incubation period (3 to 7 days for most potential organisms), which allows terrorists to escape before an investigation by law enforcement or intelligence agencies could even begin. Apart from the use of an endemic infectious agent likely causing initial confusion because of the inability to differentiate a biological warfare attack from a natural epidemic, for some agents, the potential exists for secondary or tertiary transmission by person-to-person transmission or natural vectors. For these reasons, biological weapons have become a new weapon of choice for virtual terrorists, who seek to acquire toxic pathogens or their ingredients online.

Scientists are concerned that a technique called Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) is now so cheap and widely available that amateurs will start experimenting at home or in school labs. The technique works like genetic scissors to cut away DNA code and replace it with new genes. It has been hailed as one the most significant scientific breakthroughs in recent years, but there are fears that in the wrong hands, the procedure could unleash dangerous strains of bacteria or other organisms. Kits to make E.coli resistant to antibiotics are already for sale on the Internet.

The comparatively low cost and ease of use of the CRISPR system (which is a naturally-occurring defence mechanism used by bacteria) has made it feasible for a greater range of users beyond those who would ordinarily make use of the techniques of molecular biology. Prior to CRISPR, editing DNA required sophisticated labs, years of experience, a PhD degree, and many thousands of dollars. Today the simple do-it-yourself CRISPR kits could enable virtual terrorists targeting the food supply chain to alter the avian influenza genome and engineer a large bird flu epidemic, similar to the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Asia that affected not only poultry, but also other mammals, including human beings.

In 2002 CNN ran an exposé on Al-Qaeda’s (AQ’s) experiments with crude toxins and poisons, testing the lethality of cyanide creams, ricin, mustard, sarin, and botulinum. AQ associates infiltrated Turkey, Britain, Spain, Italy, France, Sweden, Germany, and other countries to begin coordinating and planning ricin and cyanide attacks via a loose association of cells. US government knowledge of the extent of the network grew from a handful of terrorists in one country to dozens of extremists in 30 countries. The Islamic State may also have access to weapons containing sarin nerve gas that remained in Syria, as well as mustard agents and nerve agent rockets from Iraq, and chemical materials leftover from Libya programs. While It is unclear how effective these agents would be after years of storage, they could still be usable.

In 2015, the Blue-Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense issued a National Blueprint for Biodefense, calling for leadership and major reform to optimize efforts to combat the threat of bioterrorism. As if to emphasize the urgency of the threat, that same year, the annual report of the Federal Select Agent Program described 233 potential occupational exposures or releases of select biological agents and toxins outside of the primary barriers of biocontainment in the US. Since 2001, the US government allocated $6 billion to research the threats, which pales in comparison to the amount spent on cybersecurity, airport screening, or border security. Of 46 items the Blueprint recommended for action in the first year following release of the report, partial progress had been made toward only 17 of them, and only 2 had been completed as of 2016.

A verification system could diminish the risk of terrorist acquisition of biological agents, given the ever-present possibility of deliberate acts of sabotage or terrorism. A lone actor terrorist or a disgruntled employee with knowledge of the operations of chemical plants or laboratories -- having become acquainted with safety and security procedures -- could exploit existing vulnerabilities in order to smuggle deadly pathogens out of the facility. It has been estimated that up to 95 percent of incidents related to security-related breaches were the result of insiders who were already employed and/or had a security clearance.

The ability to acquire key ingredients via the Internet, and to ‘hire’ individuals with the scientific knowledge to make biological weapons, means that bioterrorism is, and will remain, an omnipresent risk. With the stakes as high as they are, common sense dictates that businesses and governments must combine their resources to find more effective ways to battle the scourge of Virtual Terrorism. Fully implementing the Blueprint would be an excellent place to start."
huffpo31,huffpo,"['Michael Mcauliff', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",2017-02-18 10:24:11-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-mild-mannered-woman-from-washington-is-the-democrats-deadliest-weapon_us_58a77653e4b037d17d27d494,"WASHINGTON ― A few weeks after the 2013 government shutdown, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) compared the Republicans in the House to the preschoolers she once taught. To deal with a bunch of fractious, obstreperous 4-year-olds, she said, you need a plan.

When Murray made her comparison, she was about to sit down with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in what turned out to be the only significant successful bipartisan budget negotiation Congress has managed since the shutdown.

Four years later, the House is still roiled by a crowd of sharp-elbowed and feuding Republican lawmakers who can’t agree even on how to do the one thing they all say they want ― repeal Obamacare. But now, there’s a new alpha boy atop their playground monkey bars.

President Donald Trump outdid them all, belittling, bullying and insulting his way to the Oval Office.

Murray is familiar with the personality type.

“There is a bully in every classroom,” Murray said this week. “And the best way to teach other children in your preschool class that it’s not OK is to make it not OK.”

That is precisely what Murray and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are trying to do. Since there are only 48 senators on their side of the ledger, they lack the votes to beat back Trump and a raft of nominees that Democrats see as historically awful. What they can do is show the country and their Republican colleagues that it’s not OK. Murray is turning out to be Schumer’s deadliest weapon in that fight.

Still, there have been some notable successes from the Democrats’ perspective, particularly with nominees going through the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on which Murray serves as the top Democrat.

Chief among them is the withdrawal of labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, a fast-food maven who was fond of employing scantily clad women to peddle his Carl’s Jr. burgers, and whose restaurants have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for labor and safety violations.

The salacious ads and history of labor law infractions probably were not the daggers that did in the labor nominee, however.

Ironically, his troubles started with a video created by a woman who Trump floated as a potential presidential running mate on the Reform Party ticket in 1988 ― Oprah Winfrey, via her TV show. A video from “The Oprah Winfrey Show” featured Puzder’s ex-wife dressed in disguise in 1990 to allege domestic abuse.

That she had gone on the program had been known since shortly after Puzder’s nomination, but Winfrey’s producers stonewalled media attempts to obtain the episode. The Oprah Winfrey Network’s lawyers did temporarily provide a videotape to the HELP Committee that they refused to leave behind. Murray and her staff worked with committee Chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) to make sure other senators saw it ― or at least had a chance to. Although Puzder’s former wife, Lisa Fierstein, later recanted the allegations, it had an impact. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that she had seen the tape and wanted to make it public.

Murray has made a habit of maintaining bipartisan relationships and working across the aisle, passing things like the rewrite of the No Child Left Behind Act. A firm member of the Pantsuit Nation, and a politician who launched her Senate career as a “mom in tennis shoes,” she politely and privately wielded a stiletto against Puzder, offering trenchant insights into Puzder’s attitudes in private conversations with Republicans in hallways and on the Senate floor. One thing Puzder said in an interview was particularly disturbing to the handful of Republicans who were prepared to oppose him.

“Someone asked him why he wanted to be secretary of labor, and he said that it would be the best job he could have ‘with his clothes on,’” Murray said. “I presented that to one Republican senator who said to me, quote, he doesn’t get it, does he?”

Whether it was specifically the video that felled Puzder can be debated. Revelations that he employed an undocumented immigrant as part of his household help for years hurt him with a number of conservative Republicans, as did Puzder’s advocacy for immigration reform.

For Murray, he was a walking highlight reel of all that is wrong with Trump.

“This is a president who got elected after a video came out of him on the bus with ‘Access Hollywood.’ When that happened, that was such a defining moment for many people,” Murray said. “But the people who voted for him said that’s OK, he won’t do this going forward. And yet to me his nominee shared many of those same sexist, horrible attitudes towards women.”

“That’s what I felt really took him down, and should have taken him down,” she said.

Murray and the Democrats also scored a near miss with an especially focused strategy to question then-Education Department nominee Betsy DeVos.

The billionaire charter school advocate botched numerous questions that Murray and other Democrats on the HELP committee had prepared in advance, and then followed up on. Especially glaring was DeVos’ lack of understanding of federal disability laws, exposed when Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) asked how her own disabled child would be able to get an education in one of the publicly funded charter schools that DeVos favors. DeVos did not understand that providers of public education are supposed to provide it to all of the public. Public schools spend significant resources to ensure disabled children get an education, and while charter schools are required to as well, they often fight the requirement.

Other questions showed that she was unfamiliar with basic debates in the education community. She was also caught in a possible lie when she said she had nothing to do with her family’s foundation giving $5 million to the anti-gay religious group Focus on the Family. Devos insisted it was all her mother’s doing. Murray came back with a tax filing from the foundation that listed DeVos as a vice president. DeVos claimed it was a clerical error, but records showed she was listed in the position for 17 years.

DeVos’ terrible showing cost her two Republican votes, and for the first time in history, a vice president had to break a 50 to 50 tie in the Senate to confirm her.

None of that work to bring down those nominees was an accident, Murray said.

“I felt from the beginning, this administration ― who I think expected to win ― was putting together a cabinet without doing the critical work that one should do at the cabinet in vetting people, in knowing what issues they might have,” Murray said. “So I directed my staff to do that with Betsy DeVos, with [Health and Human Services Secretary Tom] Price. And with Puzder.”

Aides familiar with the strategy said that Murray vowed to do that vetting herself when she came back to Capitol Hill after the election. She reassigned a slew of policy staff and turned them into temporary investigators, churning out detailed memos that were then shared with other senators and their staff. No other committee appears to have done as thorough a dive into the backgrounds of the nominees coming before them.

Heading into the DeVos hearing, Murray made sure to coordinate Democratic questions, to avoid overlap and make sure effective follow ups were delivered. When, for instance, Hassan asked DeVos about her role in the Prince Foundation, and DeVos demurred, Hassan was able to pull out tax documents with her name on them.

As each new embarrassment and unflattering detail emerged, Schumer would often highlight them in his morning Senate floor speeches that the Democratic leaders then spread further in news conferences.

Since Democrats themselves changed the rules around nominations in 2013 to allow confirmations to pass on simple majority votes, there’s little they can do beyond slowing down the process and trying to give the public enough time to see exactly who is ascending to power in the reign of Trump.

And Murray said she intends to keep showing why it’s not OK.

“As I have had constituents tell me since the day of the election, Senate Democrats are the only barrier we have to fight back against things that aren’t right coming from a Republican administration, Senate and House,” Murray said. “So, we’re it. We started working from day one to be the people who take that role on.”

Rape became politicized during the recent election. Extreme conservatives favored the modifiers ""legitimate"" or ""forcible"" while feminists countered with the slogan, ""Rape is rape."" When a woman is raped during an armed conflict, rape takes on a different character. Rape becomes a weapon of war -− a cheap weapon of war.

Under any circumstance, rape is a brutal, dehumanizing attack. Rapes of civilian women during war take on the most horrendous aspects of this crime. Women are often raped in front of their husbands and children by multiple men using their bodies and, at times, gun barrels or other objects to penetrate women.

Like any rape, these acts may to lead to pregnancy and transmission of STDs and infection. The psychological toll can be devastating. Victims may be stigmatized by their communities and even subject to honor killing by their families. Typically, justice is not available because civil police organizations are disbanded or ineffective during wartime.

It is important to recognize that conflict rapes are much more than opportunistic pillaging. In modern warfare, rape has become a strategic weapon used to humiliate, demoralize and dehumanize the enemy. The use of rape as a tactic may, in fact, be ordered by those in command of combatants. In ethnic conflicts, rape is seen as a tool of genetic ""cleansing."" Even when a conflict has ended with a truce or ceasefire, rape continues to be used as a weapon against the vanquished civilian population. Rape violates the Geneva Convention and is viewed as a ""crime against humanity"" by the International Criminal Court.

Recent history provides horrific examples of the use of rape as a weapon of war:

Approximately up to 500,000 women were raped during the Rwandan genocide

Approximately up to 64,000 women were raped in Sierra Leone

Over 40,000 women were raped in Bosnia-Herzegovina

Hundreds of women are raped every day in Syria, Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo

The reality of rape during conflict is brought home by a crowd-sourced map of Syria that reports the location and details of sexual assaults occurring during the current conflict. This resource is maintained by the Women under Siege Project of the Women's Media Center.

The days between Nov. 25 and Dec. 10 have been designated by the Center for Women's Global Leadership and the Nobel Women's Initiative as the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign. In 2012, this campaign focuses on gender violence in conflict, use of small arms in domestic violence and state actors perpetrating violence against women, such as commanders sexually assaulting military women with impunity.

“We are still going through the search warrant … but [he had] in excess of 10 rifles,” Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters at a Monday morning press conference.

According to Lombardo, Paddock opened fire at about 10 p.m., as an estimated 22,000 people attended the final day of a three-day Harvest music festival, headlined by country music star Jason Aldean. Mandalay Bay Resort is adjacent to the concert venue.

The 50 deaths and at least 400 injuries make the attack the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, surpassing the 2016 massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The gunman in that case committed suicide after killing 49 people dead and wounding 58.

The Las Vegas gunman, Paddock, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound when police breached his 32nd floor hotel room, authorities said. Paddock, 64, lived in Mesquite and had been staying at the hotel since Sept. 28, according to police.

Witnesses reported hearing what they’ve described as automatic gunfire for more than five minutes. It’s not yet clear how many rounds of ammunition were fired, sending frantic concertgoers scrambling for cover.

The gunfire “just kept coming,” Robyn Webb told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “It was relentless.”

Authorities have not specifically identified the weapons used by the gunman.

Assault rifles, manufactured by several gunmakers, are available for purchase by anyone who can pass a background screening. They are typically sold as semi-automatic, meaning they fire one bullet for each squeeze of the trigger.

An automatic weapon, sometimes known as a machine gun, can fire continuously when the trigger is held. Federal gun laws allow possession of pre-1986 models, which can be purchased in most states by law-abiding citizens who pass a background screening, pay a tax of $200, and register the gun with the federal government.

It’s unclear if the weapons used in Sunday’s shooting were legally owned and purchased by the shooter.

The massacre will likely reignite the debate on gun control, particularly in Nevada, which has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the United States. Firearm owners there are not required to have a license, and do not have to register their weapons. The state does not prohibit the sale of assault rifles, and places no limits on the number of firearms an individual can possess and the capacity of ammunition magazines.

Authorities are likely to release details on the weapons used in the shooting once they finish examining items seized.

The gunman’s motive was unclear.

We have “no investigative information or background with this individual that is derogatory,” Lombardo said.

In a sign of mounting nuclear anxiety around the globe, the conference timeline is extremely condensed by U.N. standards. As early as July, Conference President Elayne Whyte Gómez of Costa Rica hopes to unveil a draft text — a “rapid pace,” she explained, “reflecting the urgency Member States attach to the need to realize progress in nuclear disarmament.”

The treaty text is expected to be a historic document, a landmark in collective security and international law. As a tool to force the nuclear genie back into the bottle, it is also expected to be roughly as effective as a plate of egg salad sandwiches.

Everyone in the U.N. conference hall knows this, of course. The treaty is not a naive attempt to compel the immediate disarmament of the nuclear powers. As with other U.N. disarmament efforts, this treaty is about strengthening norms, nudging progress, and keeping the flame lit on the idea that humanity can overcome its historical cycle of mass bloodshed. The limited expectations surrounding the treaty are reflected in the language of even its most ardent supporters. Daryl G. Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association, released a statement that sounded like a lukewarm book blurb. A new treaty, he said, “could be a useful and timely contribution... It is a worthy goal.”

As much as anything, the treaty talks can be seen as a collective diplomatic howl from the nuclear bleachers, over which hangs a Doomsday Clock reading two and a half minutes to midnight. Nuclear dread is cresting at levels not seen since the early 1980s, when senior figures in President Ronald Reagan’s Pentagon spoke in earnest about “winnable” nuclear war that everyone would be able to survive so long as there were “enough shovels to go around.” In an echo of that era, the new U.S. president does not understand the nuclear taboo and shares a patron with a biochemist and sheep rancher who seems to believe gamma rays are essentially a form of Vitamin D.

As in previous eras of high atomic anxiety, the U.S. and Russia are center stage. This time, however, the nuclear superpowers are grappling cliff-side without the guardrails that provided relative stability for much of the Cold War. Long gone is the cornerstone Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that banned defensive systems and brought a measure of reassurance to both sides. The U.S. is now building an open-ended, layered missile defense system near Russian borders. The system is part of a dangerous and destabilizing quest for nuclear “primacy” — that is, the ability to knock out other nuclear powers with a first strike. Whether U.S. officials describe the system as such is irrelevant. This steady drive toward primacy, combined with NATO expansion, has deepened suspicions and accelerated countermeasures by Moscow, including new missile development and violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

This mutually reinforcing dynamic is now accelerating. It is feeding insecurity leading to reductions in the size of “decision windows” that were already terrifyingly small. Leaders now have less confidence and less time to respond to data that suggests incoming missiles, which can involve anything from Norwegian weather balloons to sunlit clouds to misplaced software.

Some combination of machine error and human panic has always been the leading candidate for triggering planetary nuclear holocaust, and that threat has never been greater. Russia currently has no satellite early warning system, relying on short-notice ground radars to provide notice of a surprise attack. The U.S. knows this, yet continues to pursue policies that only stoke Russian fears of just such an attack. That the nuclear controls are now in the hands of a man whose mental health is routinely questioned in public, and whose hot temper is taken for granted, can only heighten the paranoia of adversaries. This, in turn, heightens the odds of a globe-melting overreaction.

Our own command and control system, meanwhile, is a fraying mess of analog tech run by inexperienced and possibly coked-up airmen. At the top of the chain is a White House full of Rapture-ready hawks and spite-driven nihilists, led by a man who has wondered aloud “why do we make” nuclear weapons if we’re not going to use them.

Against this backdrop, the U.N. conference is, if nothing else, a welcome statement of resolve. It’s also an overdue return to an institutional promise made long ago. In its very first sessions, U.N. member states discussed how best to bring nuclear weapons under international control. Those efforts failed; arsenals ballooned; the nuclear club expanded. In 1970, most nuclear powers recommitted to disarmament with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Fifty years after the NPT, the U.N. is once again taking up the threat it was tasked with solving in the year of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Just as newsreels of the first bombs haunted the U.N. debate of the 1940s, the 2017 conference opens under the digitally remastered shadow of thermonuclear test footage.

The films, released by the government this month, are the stuff of a million slow-motion Cold War nightmares: multi-megaton, city-swallowing suns that make Little Boy and Fat Man look like backyard bang snaps. Our nuclear complex is not studying these old test tapes to rekindle the transatlantic disarmament movement. The project is part of a $300 billion nuclear maintenance and modernization program.

“We need to be able to validate our codes and trust that the answers that are being calculated are correct,” explained Greg Spriggs, the physicist at California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory overseeing the film project. “The legacy that I’d like to leave behind is a set of benchmark data that can be used by future weapon physicists.”

The Livermore release closes with Spriggs stating his preference that “we would never have to use a nuclear weapon ever again.” But as Albert Einstein quipped the last time the U.N. debated a bomb ban, you cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.

Preparing for war isn’t all that Spriggs and his Livermore colleagues are doing. It’s more accurate to say they’re preparing for war in ways that make war more likely. The current issue of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists features a jaw-dropping report by several leading nuclear analysts that details how the U.S. Energy Department’s Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program has provided cover for enhancing warheads with “super-fuze” detonation technology in a way consistent with building a first-strike capability. The new warheads are most alarming from Moscow’s view, and thus most destabilizing, when fitted onto submarine-based missiles within range of Russia’s land-based silos.

“This increase in capability is astonishing,” write the authors of the Bulletin report. “It creates exactly what one would expect to see, if a nuclear-armed state were planning to have the capacity to fight and win a nuclear war by disarming enemies with a surprise first strike.”

Former Secretary of Defense William Perry, one of several recent high-profile defectors from the official nuclear consensus, has described current U.S. policy as “sleepwalking into [a] new nuclear arms race... We and the Russians and others don’t understand what we are doing.”

That may have been true in the 1940s. But in the seven decades since the first U.N. debate on nuclear weapons, we’ve had time to figure some things out. The evidence now suggests a darker conclusion: We know exactly what we’re doing. Or at least some of us do."

Washington, the South's military protector, applied substantial pressure to kill the program.

Today it looks like Park might have been right.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea continues its relentless quest for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Its Special Forces and unconventional tactics -- such as tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone -- threaten to disrupt allied operations. While most of its conventional weapons are decrepit, Pyongyang still could wreak havoc in Seoul with artillery and Scud missiles.

The South is attempting to find an effective response. It closed Kaesong industrial complex, which provided the North with nearly $100 million in hard currency annually. Seoul also is talking with the U.S about installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system. Nevertheless, neither of these steps is likely to much affect Pyongyang's behavior.

Although the DPRK is unlikely to attack since it would lose a full-scale war, the Republic of Korea remains uncomfortably dependent on America. And Washington's commitment to the much more populous and prosperous ROK likely will decline as America's finances worsen and challenges elsewhere multiply. Seoul could find itself ill-prepared to deter the North.

In response, talk of reviving the South's nuclear option is growing. Won Yoo-cheol, parliamentary floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, told the National Assembly: ""We cannot borrow an umbrella from a neighbor every time it rains. We need to have a raincoat and wear it ourselves.""

Won is not alone in this view. Chung Moon-jong -- member of the National Assembly, presidential candidate, and Asan Institute founder -- made a similar plea two years ago. He told an American audience ""If North Korea still refuses to surrender its nuclear weapons then we have to make the ultimate choice."" That is, ""if North Korea keeps insisting on staying nuclear then it must know that we will have no choice but to go nuclear."" He suggested that the South withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and ""match North Korea's nuclear progress step-by step while committing to stop if North Korea stops.""

The public seems inclined to follow such advice. Koreans' confidence in America's willingness to use nuclear weapons in defense of the ROK has declined, while support for a South Korean nuclear program is on the upswing, hitting 66 percent in 2013. Nearly a third of people ""strongly support"" such an option.

While President Park Geun-hye's government remains formally committed to the NPT, Seoul has conducted nuclear experiments and resisted oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Like Japan, the ROK could develop a weapon quickly if it chose to do so, perhaps in a matter of months.

Of course, the idea triggers a horrified reaction in Washington and among those committed to nonproliferation.

Unfortunately, in Northeast Asia today nonproliferation operates a little like gun control in the U.S.: only the bad guys end up armed. China, Russia, and North Korea all have nuclear weapons. America's allies, Japan and South Korea, do not, and expect Washington to defend them. To do so the U.S. would have to risk Los Angeles to protect Seoul and Tokyo -- and maybe Taipei and Canberra as well, depending on how far Washington extends the ""nuclear umbrella.""

While America's overwhelming nuclear arsenal should deter anyone else from using nukes, conflicts do not always evolve rationally. If Washington's nuclear commitment is triggered, even inadvertently, the U.S. would find itself wandering down a completely unexpected and dangerous path. South Korea and Japan are important international partners, but their protection is not worth creating an unnecessary existential threat to the American homeland. Indeed, the potential price of initiating nuclear war actually reduces the credibility of Washington's commitment and thus its deterrent value.

Better to create a balance of power in which the U.S. is not a target if nukes start falling. And that would be achieved by independent South Korean and Japanese nuclear deterrents. Such a prospect would antagonize, perhaps even convulse, China. But then, such an arsenal would deter the People's Republic of China as well as DPRK. Which also would serve American interests.

Moreover, the mere threat of spreading nuclear weapons might end up solving the problem. That is, when faced with the prospect of Japanese and South Korean nuclear weapons, China might come to see the wisdom of applying greater pressure on the North -- most importantly, cutting off energy and food shipments. The U.S.-ROK discussions over THAAD appeared to touch a nerve in Beijing, and Xi Jinping's government indicated its willingness support a UN resolution imposing more pain on the North for its latest nuclear launch. That declaration might end up being mostly for show, but maybe not. And the prospect of having two more nuclear neighbors would concentrate minds in Zhongnanhai.

Abandoning nonproliferation is not a decision to take lightly. No one wants a nuclear arms race. More nuclear powers mean more possibilities of misuse or mistake. Moreover, China might retaliate by accelerating its own nuclear development

But the PRC already is improving its nuclear forces to diminish Washington's edge. And allowing North Korea to enjoy a unilateral advantage creates a different, and even greater, set of dangers. The right trade-off isn't obvious.

Which is why policymakers should consider the possibility of a nuclear South Korea. The NPT does not necessarily triumph over other security concerns. Keeping America entangled in the Korean imbroglio as Pyongyang develops nuclear weapons is a bad option which could turn catastrophic. Blessing allied development of nuclear weapons might prove to be a better alternative.

Park Chung-hee was a brute, determined to stifle political freedom while focusing on economic development. But his desire for an ROK nuclear weapon looks prescient. Maybe it's time for the good guys in Northeast Asia to be armed as well.

Knocking on a stranger's door and asking them to register to vote is a strange experience. In a diverse city like Miami where one can find someone from any nationality or political background behind that door, it can be both a rewarding experience and a challenging one. It can be frustrating to hear a person say that they feel so disenfranchised by the system that they don't feel the urgency to vote. On the other hand, I'm exhilarated as an elections canvasser when we talk and they change their minds.

I've worked in several voter registration campaigns in the past, and what is unique about this 2016 presidential race is that the apathy often at play is not a factor when I talk with potential voters. Latinos are feeling the urgency to cast a ballot like never before and it is because they oppose Donald Trump's bid for the White House in record numbers.

I've met the folks who will prevent a Donald Trump presidency. They are a powerful coalition composed of people from all walks of life with vastly different cultures and nationalities. I've worked with my fellow immigrants day after day as a community organizer in a massive voter registration campaign working to turn out voters. Regardless of their native country, these Americans are eager to become registered voters so they can make a difference in their communities.

These prospective voters, about 2.8 million Latinos, have been emboldened by one of the most bizarre elections ever seen in American history. Republican nominee Donald Trump has risen to the top of the party on a scorched earth campaign in which he has called for a ban on Muslims coming into the country and the forced deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country. Faced with this intense anti-immigrant rhetoric, people who have never considered voting before are now eager to do so.

I worked with the community outreach group New Florida Majority from February to April in a campaign to register 5,000 new voters in nine weeks. We went to Hispanic and Haitian neighborhoods in Miami with traditionally low voter turnout rates in an effort to connect with people and inform them about the issues affecting their communities. We knocked on doors, stood outside shopping centers, joined in popular events such as the iconic Calle 8 Festival in Little Havana and visited Hispanic and Creole restaurants.

It was a very strange experience helping to empower people so they can have a voice through the ballot when I'm excluded from that privilege.

I came to this country on a tourist visa with my parents and overstayed it, effectively rendering me without legal status for 11 years. I felt pride in helping people exercise their right to vote, but at times I also felt a mix of jealousy and frustration.

I know the power of voting and am eager to cast my first vote, but I never imagined that at age 25, I would still not have done so. It was difficult and frustrating to live here as an undocumented resident, but it also taught me the necessity for strong civic engagement and our individual responsibility to stand up for our communities. Growing up, I always lived with fear that a wrong choice would land me in police custody and possible deportation. I was paranoid that sharing my undocumented status with the wrong person could lead to being reported to ICE, and possible deported and ripped away from my family and friends. I watched my parents drive to work every day with the fear that a simple traffic stop could lead to their arrest for driving without a license.

As I registered new voters, I found that I was not alone. I was inspired talking to community members who were eager to demand the dignity and respect that has been denied to them despite their years of hard work. Natalia Jaramillo comes to mind, a Latina from Colombia who had previously been unable to become a citizen because it was so expensive and who now is eligible to vote for the first time. She told me that she was not wasting the opportunity to vote on behalf of those in her community who could not and who, like her, were disgusted by the politicians that disrespected the contributions of Latinos in this country.

I remember speaking to Johanna Shemesh from Brazil, who told me that as a woman she had a responsibility to stand up for her community against the racism and hatred of Donald Trump, whose anti-women policies would hurt her reproductive rights.

Trump's rhetoric last June was another hateful notch in what has been a long history of discrimination and xenophobia against immigrants in this country. Although I acquired residency through marriage in 2011, my parents are still living in the U.S. undocumented and seeing this racist xenophobe in my television screen refer to Mexican immigrants in this country as killers and rapists filled me with indignation. The hateful rhetoric currently at the forefront of the Republican party drove me to do as much as I possibly could to stop this man from ever becoming president.

Florida has voted for Democratic President Obama in the past two elections and it appears that the Republican party has not learned that disregarding the Hispanic vote is a losing strategy that will guarantee defeat in this crucial swing state where 23 percent of the population is Hispanic. We hit our target goal of 5,000 new registered voters at the end of the nine weeks, and we will continue to hit the streets to turn out voters until the Florida registration deadline 29 days before the November 8th election.

As an immigrant youth (and I know that there are thousands who feel as I do), I will never forget the way my family was treated during these difficult years. A couple of weeks ago, I applied for my citizenship after spending five years as a permanent resident, making it highly likely that I will get to cast my first vote ever in this election. Myself and others who experienced the hatred and xenophobia directed at our hard working community will always remember who our friends were and who weren't. We'll vote accordingly.

Has a weapon ever been invented, no matter how terrible, and not used? The crossbow, the dreadnought, poison gas, the tank, the landmine, chemical weapons, napalm, the B-29, the drone: all had their day and for some that day remains now. Even the most terrible weapon of all, the atomic bomb, that city-buster, that potential civilization-destroyer, was used as soon as it was available. Depending on your historical interpretation, it was either responsible for ending World War II in the Pacific or rushed into action before that war could end. In either case, it launched the atomic age.

During the Cold War, the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, relied on a strategy that used to be termed, without irony, ""mutual assured destruction"" or MAD. Its intent was simple enough: to hold off a planetary holocaust by threatening to commit one. With their massive nuclear arsenals, those two imperial states held each other and everyone else on the planet hostage. Each safely secured more than enough nukes to be able to absorb a ""first strike"" that would devastate its territory, leaving possibly tens of millions of its citizens dead or wounded, and still return the (dis)favor.

After the Soviet Union disappeared in 1991, nuclear weapons did, too -- without going away. The American and Russian arsenals, and the nuclear geography that underlay them, remained in place, just largely unremarked upon. In the meantime, the weaponry itself spread. In those years, the last superpower, which seldom discussed its own arsenal, selectively focused its energies on containing the spread of nuclear weaponry in three nations: the first was Pakistan some part of whose ever-growing nuclear arsenal it feared might fall into the hands of extreme Islamic fundamentalists in a land Washington was in the process of destabilizing via a war in neighboring Afghanistan and a CIA drone campaign in its tribal borderlands; the second was North Korea, a country encouraged in its quest for nuclear weapons by watching the U.S. take down two autocrats, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qaddafi, who gave up their nuclear programs prior to U.S. interventions; and the third was Iran, which had a nuclear program (started by the U.S. in an era when the country was considered our bulwark in the Persian Gulf), but as far as anyone knows no plans to weaponize it.

In the meantime, Washington (and so the American media) simply ignored the very existence of Israel's massive nuclear arsenal and actually aided the further development of the Indian nuclear program. In these years, it also threatened or, in the case of Iraq, a country that no longer had a nuclear program, actually launched what Jonathan Schell has called ""disarmament wars.""

That the spread of nuclear weapons, whatever the country, is a danger to us all is obvious. Who exactly will use such weapons next and where remains unknown. But there is no reason to believe that, sooner or later, nuclear weapons -- which have now spread to nine countries -- and are likely to spread further, will not be used again.

Recently, a Texas-based nonprofit got a lot of publicity by announcing that it had fired the first handgun ever made almost totally by a 3-D printer. This act, modest enough in itself, nonetheless highlights a trend of our time. Weaponry that once only a large state, mobilizing scientists, industrial power, and resources could produce can now be made by ever-smaller states -- say North Korea with limited resources and a malnourished populace. Similarly, weapons once made by large companies can now be assembled by individuals. Or put another way, ever more powerful weaponry is increasingly available to ever less powerful states and even non-state actors. It was, for instance, the Aum Shinrikyo cult that, in 1995, produced sarin nerve gas -- ""the poor man's atomic bomb"" -- in its own laboratory and used it in the Tokyo subways, killing 13, just as in the U.S. anthrax began arriving in the mail a week after 9/11, killing five people.

We don't know where or why a nuclear weapon will be used. We don't know whether it will be a North Korean, South Korean, Indian, Pakistani, Lebanese, Iranian, Israeli, or even American city that will be hit. All we should assume is that, as long as such weapons are developed, amassed, and stored for use, one day they will be used with consequences that, as Nick Turse, author of the bestselling Kill Anything That Moves, reports in ""Nuclear Terror in the Middle East,"" are -- even for those who have studied the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- beyond imagining."

Pyongyang has ramped up work on its nuclear program and claims it is capable of launching a nuclear-armed missile that would reach the continental U.S.

The reclusive nation carried out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test early Sunday morning, which North Korean state television swiftly described as a “perfect success.”

The regime claims it detonated a hydrogen bomb, and although analysts have expressed skepticism about that, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said Tokyo could not yet dismiss the possibility that it was indeed an H-bomb ― a device much more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.

Pyongyang successfully conducted its first two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July ― a feat U.S. President Donald Trump had called an impossibility shortly before his inauguration in January. The launches triggered international alarm and condemnation, and sparked a battle of escalating threats between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime.

Former President Barack Obama had warned Trump that a nuclear North Korea would likely be the most pressing issue faced by the new administration.

Despite assurances from Trump that a North Korea that can hit the U.S. with nuclear weapons “won’t happen,” some experts believe such a capability may be within Kim’s grasp. Here are the components of North Korea’s developing nuclear program, and the West’s efforts to stop it.

KCNA KCNA/Reuters An undated photo released by North Korea's Central News Agency gives a view of the test-fire of Pukguksong-2.

Nuclear Weapons

North Korea has been working to acquire a functional, deliverable nuclear weapon for decades. Those aspirations began during the rule of former Supreme Leader Kim Il Sung at the close of World War II and began to take shape under the reign of his son, Kim Jong Il, who first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006.

As New York Times reporter David Sanger explained in an interview with NPR’s Dave Davies in late March:

“Kim Il Sung remembers that General [Douglas] MacArthur, during the Korean War, wanted to use nuclear weapons against North Korea and China. He was stopped from doing this. But it made a very big impression on Mr. Kim, and he knew that North Korea, to survive and deter attack, needed to have this capability itself. And he’s the one, the grandfather of the current North Korean leader, who started down this path.”

The North was able to purchase much of its initial nuclear technology from one of the founders of Pakistan’s nuclear program and bought centrifuges to enrich uranium from Libya.

The North is in possession of up to 20 nuclear warheads, according to an annual report released this week by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

KCNA KCNA/Reuters An undated photo released by the official news agency shows North Korea's annual central report meeting.

Nuclear Tests

North Korea has so far conducted six nuclear weapons tests, all at an underground test site in the country’s northeast called Punggye-ri. Those blasts, which began in 2006, have only gotten stronger over the past decade as the North hones its weapons program.

As The New York Times noted, the first such test, conducted by current leader’s father, Kim Jong Il, had a yield of less than 1 kiloton, or the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT. The second, conducted three years later, clocked in at 2.35 kilotons. The North’s most recent test was the strongest ever. It caused a shallow magnitude 6.3 earthquake, and was estimated to be at least “five to six times” stronger than the previous test last September.

The explosive power of Sunday’s purported H-bomb is adjustable from tens of kilotons to hundreds of kilotons, according to a North Korean report cited by The Times.

Comparatively, “the Little Boy” bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima held 15 kilotons of energy. The College of Arts and Letters at the Stevens Institute of Technology released a series of maps in 2015 that show just how damaging such weapons would be to cities around the world.

South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said Wednesday that in light of the North’s recent ICBM launch, he believes there is “a high chance” Pyongyang will soon conduct a sixth nuclear test.

The Missiles

Alongside nuclear development, North Korea has undertaken an active and at times successful campaign to launch ballistic missiles, with an ultimate goal of crafting an ICBM capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to U.S. soil. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 3,400 miles.

Shortly after the first ICBM launch, North Korean state TV claimed the long-range missile was capable of reaching “anywhere in the world” and could carry “a large, heavy nuclear warhead.” This has not been verified.

The North has displayed two types of ICBMs at military parades since 2012, the BBC pointed out, but both remain untested.

The Musudan, another North Korean ballistic missile, is thought to be capable of reaching the U.S. territory of Guam. It was tested eight times in 2016, only partly succeeding once.

In May of 2016, U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials announced the North has the ability to attach a small nuclear warhead on top of missiles capable of reaching much of South Korea and Japan. Experts have varied greatly in the past couple of months about North Korea’s ability to strike the U.S.

Missile Tests

Kim has personally overseen the test launches of several ballistic missiles. While the tests are meant to fine-tune the North Korean arsenal, they also serve a political purpose.

Several of the recent tests have been timed to coincide with important strategic moments for the region.

The one in February coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Another one, in April, was timed ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to the U.S. Yet another launch in March was conducted in retaliation for joint U.S.-South Korean military drills. The July 3rd missile test ― Pyongyang’s 11th this year ― was launched on the eve of U.S. Independence Day, and days before the G-20 summit in Europe. Kim dubbed it “a gift for the American bastards.” Three weeks later, the July 28 test came a day after the North Korean holiday “Day of Victory,” which marks the 1953 ceasefire in the Korean War.

The North also launched three short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast on Aug. 25, intensifying the harsh rhetoric between the regime and Trump. And on Aug. 28, it fired an intermediate range missile over northern Japan.

Pyongyang is flexing muscles that experts say are getting bigger.

What North Korea Wants

North Korea’s nuclear aspirations, experts say, hinge on Kim’s desire to retain control of the isolated nation.

“Above all else, North Korea’s nuclear program is about security,” John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, told the BBC last September. “It is, by their estimation, the only reliable guarantee of the country’s basic sovereignty, of the Communist regime’s control, and of the rule of Kim Jong-un.”

Sanger, the Times reporter, echoed that view on “Fresh Air”:

“If you consider your objectives to be to assure regime survival, to make sure that North Korea remains the Kim family’s personal fiefdom, then they’ve pursued a pretty rational strategy, one in which loyalty is above all, in which even members of the family who challenge the leadership end up getting executed. And under that structure, the North Koreans, for an unstable, irrational regime have played a pretty good game since 1953.”

International Response

Kim has continued weapons tests despite increasingly strict condemnations from the international community. In January, the United Nations imposed its “toughest ever” sanctions on the country in an attempt to stifle the program. It issued its latest round of sanctions restricting foreign trade and exports of certain goods on Aug. 5, after the second ICBM test.

But such actions have failed in the past.

Last September, former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the North’s actions in recent years had led to an unprecedented state of turmoil in the region.

“Never in the past have I ever seen such kind of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula,” Ban said.

In light of Sunday’s test, South Korea has called for the “strongest possible” response from the international community, including new sanctions to “completely isolate” Pyongyang.

Trump tweeted Sunday morning that the hermit kingdom’s “words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.” He also continued his criticism of China’s role in the defusing the situation, tweeting Beijing is “trying to help but with little success.”

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters U.S. President Barack Obama held a joint news conference with South Korea's then-President Park Geun-hye at the White House in Washington Oct. 16, 2015.

Obama’s Response

Under Obama, the United States tread carefully and refrained from any direct action against Kim’s regime. As a member of the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. helped increase sanctions against North Korea following its September 2016 nuclear test.

“The United States is realistic about what this resolution will achieve. No resolution in New York will likely, tomorrow, persuade Pyongyang to cease its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons,” former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said at the time. She added that such sanctions impose “unprecedented costs on the [North Korean] regime for defying this council’s demands.”

The U.S. also reportedly was engaged in more covert operations. Sanger and his colleague William Broad reported last March that the Obama administration had been working to sabotage North Korea’s missile program for years with cyber operations. Such initiatives, the pair wrote, may have derailed components inside the missiles either before or shortly after they were launched.

While evidence is circumstantial, Sanger said that in the course of his reporting the Times noticed some missiles, including the intermediate-range Musudan, had a failure rate of 88 percent.

“This for a country that hired a lot of former Soviet scientists after the Berlin Wall fell and after the Soviet Union dissolved, brought them to Pyongyang, bought a lot of their technology and in their early days had a very high success rates with the North Korean missile program because they were basing it on experiences that the Soviets and later Russia had had. And suddenly, their failure rate soared.”

Trump’s Conundrum

Despite condemnation from the U.N. and the West, Kim has shown no willingness to halt his country’s weapons program. Trump promised on the campaign trail to rein in the hermit nation, but faces few good options to do so.

Observers looked at the first meeting between Trump and Xi in early April for possible signs of the administration’s North Korea strategy.

China could play a significant role in motivating Pyongyang to reverse course. The country has continued to trade with North Korea, and Chinese companies provide up to 40 percent of the foreign currency the North uses to trade internationally.

The Trump administration had ramped up its rhetoric ahead of the meeting, with Trump even threatening direct intervention.

“If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will,” Trump told the Financial Times in April. “That is all that I am telling you.”

In a series of tweets in July, the president expressed his frustration at China’s apparently insufficient efforts to exert its influence over the North.

“Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!” he wrote, later adding: “Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us ― but we had to give it a try!”

In a statement soon after, chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana White announced that the U.S. remained “prepared to defend ourselves and our allies and to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against the growing threat from North Korea.”

“The United States seeks only the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Our commitment to the defense of our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad,” she added.

Her statement marked a significant escalation of the U.S. response. Shortly after the North’s missile test in March, Tillerson had a simple reaction: “The policy of strategic patience is over.”

Uhhhh what does this mean pic.twitter.com/PzRpi6xjVt — Jessica Schulberg (@jessicaschulb) April 4, 2017

Pyongyang’s ICBM launches and claims that it has the ability to strike the continental U.S. sparked a heated war of words between Kim and Trump, with the threatening in August “fire and fury” for North Korea.

Direct action presents major difficulties as the South Korean capital, Seoul, lies just 35 miles from the North’s border and within easy striking distance of the country’s non-nuclear artillery. Were Trump to act, Kim could set his sights on a city of 12 million people that has long been a friend to the West.

It’s also unclear whether strikes could effectively target the North’s program, as infrastructure is spread across the country and in some cases lies underground.

The purpose of the event was to think through the various aspects of the future of AI, from its economic impacts, to its technological abilities, to its legal implications. I was asked to present on autonomous weapons systems and what those systems portend for the future. The thinking was that an autonomous weapon is, after all, one run on some AI software platform, and if autonomous weapons systems continue to proceed on their current trajectory, we will see more complex software architectures and stronger AIs. Thus the capabilities created in AI will directly affect the capabilities of autonomous weapons and vice versa. While I was there to inform this impressive gathering about autonomous warfare, these bright minds left me with more questions about the future of AI and weapons.

First, autonomous weapons are those that are capable of targeting and firing without intervention by a human operator. Presently there are no autonomous weapons systems fielded. However, there are a fair amount of semi-autonomous weapons systems currently deployed, and this workshop on AI got me to thinking more about the line between ""full"" and ""semi."" The reality, at least the way that I see it, is that we have been using the terms ""fully autonomous"" and ""semi-autonomous"" to describe the extent to which the different operational functions on a weapons system are all operating ""autonomously"" or if only some of them are. Allow me to explain.

We have roughly four functions on a weapons system: trigger, targeting, navigation, and mobility. We might think of these functions like a menu that we can order from. Semi-autonomous weapons have at least one, if not three, of these functions. For instance, we might say that the Samsung SGR-1 has an ""autonomous"" targeting function (through heat and motion detectors), but is incapable of navigation, mobility or triggering, as it is a sentry-bot mounted on a defensive perimeter. Likewise, we would say that precision guided munitions are also semi-autonomous, for they have autonomous mobility, triggering, and in some cases navigation, while the targeting is done through a preselected set of coordinates or through ""painting"" a target through laser guidance.



Where we seem to get into deeper waters, though, are in the cases of ""fire and forget"" weapons, like the Israeli Harpy, the Raytheon Maverick heavy tank missile, or the Israeli Elbit Opher. While these systems are capable of autonomous navigation, mobility, trigger and to some extent targeting, they are still considered ""semi-autonomous"" because the target (i.e. a hostile radar emitter or the infra-red image of a particular tank) was at some point pre-selected by a human. The software that guides these systems is relatively ""stupid"" from an AI perspective, as it is merely using sensor input and doing a representation and search on the targets it identifies. Indeed, even Lockheed Martin's L-RASM (long-range anti-ship missile), appears to be in this ballpark, though it is more sophisticated because it can select its own target amongst a group of potentially valid targets (ships). The question has been raised whether this particular weapon slides from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous, for it is unclear how (or by whom) the decision is made.

The rub in the debate over autonomous weapons systems, and from what I gather, some of the fear in the AI community, is the targeting software. How sophisticated that software needs to be to target accurately, and, what is more, to target objects that are not immediately apparent as military in nature. Hostile radar emitters present little moral qualms, and when the image recognition software used to select a target is relying on infra-red images of tank tracks or ship's hulls, then the presumption is that these are ""OK"" targets from the beginning. I have two worries here. First, is that from the ""stupid"" autonomous weapons side of things, military objects are not always permissible targets. Only by an object's purpose, location, use, and effective contribution can one begin to consider it a permissible target. If the target passes this hurdle, one must still determine whether attacking it provides a direct military advantage. Nothing in the current systems seems to take this requirement into account, and as I have argued elsewhere, future autonomous weapons systems would need to do so.

Second, from the perspective of the near term ""not-so-stupid"" weapons, at what point would targeting human combatants come into the picture? We have AI presently capable of facial recognition with almost near accuracy (just upload an image to Facebook to find out). But more than this, current leading AI companies are showing that artificial intelligence is capable of learning at an impressively rapid rate. If this is so, then it is not far off to think that militaries will want some variant of this capacity on its weapons.

What then might the next generation of ""semi"" autonomous weapons look like, and how might those weapons change the focus of the debate? If I were a betting person, I'd say they will be capable of learning while deployed, use a combination of facial recognition and image recognition software, as well as infra-red and various radar sensors, and they will have autonomous navigation and mobility. They will not be confined to the air domain, but will populate maritime environments and potentially ground environments as well. The question then becomes one not solely of the targeting software, as it would be dynamic and intelligent, but on the triggering algorithm. When could the autonomous weapon fire? If targeting and firing were time dependent, without the ability to ""check-in"" with a human, or let's say, that there were just too many of these systems deployed that ""checking-in"" were operationally infeasible due to band-width, security, and sheer man-power overload, how accurate would the systems have to be to be permitted to fire? 80%? 50%? 99%? How would one verify that the actions taken by the system were in fact in accordance with its ""programming,"" assuming of course that the learning system doesn't learn that its programming is hamstringing it to carry out its mission objectives better?

These pressing questions notwithstanding, would we still consider a system such as this ""semi-autonomous?"" In other words, the systems we have now are permitted to engage targets -- that is target and trigger -- autonomously based on some preselected criteria. Would these systems that utilize a ""training data set"" to learn from likewise be considered ""semi-autonomous"" because a human preselected the training data? Common sense would say ""no,"" but so far militaries may say ""yes."" The US Department of Defense, for example, states that a ""semi-autonomous"" weapon system is one that ""once activated, is intended only to engage individual targets or specific target groups that have been selected by a human operator"" (DoD, 2012). Yet, at what point would we say that ""targets"" are not selected by a human operator? Who is the operator? The software programmer with the training data set can be an ""operator,"" and the lowly Airman likewise can be an ""operator"" if she is the one ordered to push a button, so too can the Commander who orders her to push it (though, the current DoD Directive makes a distinction between ""commander"" and ""operator"" which problematizes the notion of command responsibility even further). The only policy we have on autonomy does not define, much to my dismay, ""operator."" This leaves us in the uncomfortable position that distinction between autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons is one without difference, and taken to the extreme would mean that militaries would now only need to claim their weapons system is ""semi-autonomous,"" much to the chagrin of common sense.

huffpo40,huffpo,"['Nina Golgowski', 'General Assignment Reporter']",2017-09-06 11:18:44-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiger-shot-killed-georgia_us_59afe974e4b0dfaafcf42e3b,"Authorities are investigating the origins of a tiger seen running around a Georgia neighborhood before attacking a dog, leading to its shooting death by police.

The big cat was spotted around 6 a.m. Wednesday near I-75 outside of Stockbridge, roughly 20 miles southeast of Atlanta, before it was fatally shot, the Henry County Police Department said.

“The tiger began to run toward the Meadow Brook community off of Jodeco Road, to the back of a residence and began to attack a dog,” police said in a release that noted animal professionals were contacted.

Fearing for the public’s safety, officers fatally shot the animal, with police telling CBS 46 that they didn’t have time to retrieve a tranquilizer gun.

Brittney Speck, who moved to the area two months ago, said it was her little dachshund named Journey that was attacked while in her backyard.

“The tiger jumped on top of my dog and the officers just started firing rounds and took it down and then gave my dog back,” Speck told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

AJC This small dog named Journey was seen wagging her tail after reportedly surviving an attack by a tiger in Georgia.

“She’s great, she’s OK,” she said of her brave dog, seen wagging her tail, though a bit timid of approaching reporters and their cameras.

“She’s a little shaken up. I’m sure she’s had better mornings,” Speck said. She expressed relief that it wasn’t her three children ― ages 3, 4, and 7 ― who were outside at the time.

“It was massive, it was huge,” she emphasized.

Where the tiger came from remained unknown as of Wednesday morning.

Noah’s Ark Animal Sanctuary in Locust Grove, Georgia, about 17 miles south of where the cat was killed, said that all of their tigers are accounted for. However, when police contacted them, they headed to the scene hoping to assist.

“We responded immediately and were on the way to the scene with hopes of chemically immobilizing the tiger and bringing it to Noah’s Ark. Unfortunately, human life became at risk and the tiger was shot by the authorities,” the wildlife sanctuary said in a statement. “Thank you to the officers for trying their best to bring this animal to safety.”

Gerri Yoder, Henry County’s animal control director, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that tigers are not legal to own without proper permitting. Because of that, the animal could have been “a victim of the exotic pet trade” and “born and bred for the purpose of resale.”"
huffpo41,huffpo,"['Nina Golgowski', 'General Assignment Reporter']",2017-09-18 13:34:14-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scout-schultz-georgia-tech-police_us_59bfc1b2e4b02da0e1436594,"Family members of Georgia Tech student Scout Schultz say they plan to file a civil rights lawsuit after the 21-year-old was fatally shot by campus police on Saturday night.

Schultz, whose gender identity was non-binary and who wished to be referred to by the pronoun “they,” was an engineering student and president of Georgia Tech’s Pride Alliance. Police say the student approached officers with a knife around 11 p.m. on Saturday.

Schultz appears emotionally distraught in bystander footage of the shooting. Officers can be heard repeatedly telling Schultz to “drop the knife,” but Schultz tells officers to shoot. At one point, someone says, “No one wants to hurt you, man.”

In the graphic video below, Schultz can be seen continuing to approach the officers before a single gunshot rings out, followed by screams.

Schultz’s mother, Lynne Schultz, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that her child had several medical issues, including depression, and had attempted suicide two years ago. But she said she doesn’t believe that Schultz was attempting “suicide by cop,” or provoking police into killing them.

During a press conference alongside civil rights attorney L. Chris Stewart on Monday, Schultz’s family members questioned why officers didn’t use a Taser or mace and whether police had received training for interacting with people who are mentally disturbed.

“Why did you have to shoot? Why did you kill my son?” Schultz’s father asked.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it is now investigating the shooting.

“Officers provided multiple verbal commands and attempted to speak with Schultz, who was not cooperative and would not comply with the officers’ commands,” the agency said in a statement on Sunday. “Schultz continued to advance on the officers with the knife. Subsequently, one officer fired striking Schultz.”

Facebook Schultz, 21, was president of Georgia Tech's Pride Alliance and studied engineering.

Rates of depression and suicide are particularly high among members of the LGBTQ community, various studies have found.

According to a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey Report that surveyed 27,715 transgender people across the U.S., 40 percent of respondents reported having attempted suicide in their lifetime. That percentage is nearly nine times the overall attempted suicide rate in the U.S., which was 4.6 percent.

“Respondents also encountered high levels of mistreatment when seeking health care,” the study found. “In the year prior to completing the survey, one-third (33%) of those who saw a health care provider had at least one negative experience related to being transgender, such as being verbally harassed or refused treatment because of their gender identity.”"

On Tuesday, newly released dashcam video of the traffic stop by St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez showed a quickly escalating situation after Castile was pulled over in the St. Paul suburb for having a broken taillight. Castile, in the car with his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter, at first calmly informed the officer he had a firearm and is told by Yanez not to “pull it out.” He tells the officer he is not and is then shot several times. In audio from the footage, Castile can be heard saying “I wasn’t reaching” as the gunfire ends.

Throughout the trial, Yanez maintained that Castile was reaching for the weapon, but his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, said he was reaching for his wallet. Reynolds’ live-streamed video following the shooting went viral and prompted massive protests in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

Now a transcript of an interview between investigators and Yanez reveals the officer’s shocking interaction with Castile, including the quick escalation. Five passages from the transcript are below, with emphasis added. The mistakes in the transcript are from the original.

Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension via Reuters A still photo taken from a dashcam video shows the July 2016 police shooting of Philando Castile. Officer Jeronimo Yanez can be seen pointing a gun into the vehicle.

1. Castile clearly stated he had a gun, and the situation escalated in a “split second.”

Investigator: “From the time he mentioned to you that he had a firearm, weapon, um, what was the timeline? Did he immediately announce that at start ...?”

Yanez: “I can’t remember if he immediate announced it but it caught my attention right away and it seemed like it was split-second from the time he told me to the time he was reaching down, to the time I gave him direction, to the time he had the his hand wrapped around it and then I gave him more direction and shots were fired.”

2. Castile made a “C-shape” with his hands, and it was dark inside the vehicle.

Yanez: “He dropped his hand down and, can’t remember what I was telling him but I was telling something as his hand went down I think. And, he put his hand around something. And his hand made like a C shape type, um, type shape and it appeared to me that he was wrapping something around his fingers and almost like if I were to put my uh hand around my gun like putting my hand up to the butt of the gun.

“And then I lost view of it. Cuz he kept canting his shoulder and then I believe told him again I can’t remember don’t do it. And then he still kept moving his hand and at this point I looked and saw something in his hand. It was dark inside the vehicle, I was trying to fumble my way through under stress to look and see what it was to make sure uh what I was seeing. But I wasn’t given enough time and like I said he had no regard for what I was saying. Didn’t follow my direction. And, uh he started reaching out and then pulling uh away from his uh his right thigh. I don’t know if it was in his pocket or in between the seats or the center console. But I, I know he had an object and it was dark. And he was pulling it out with his right hand. And as he was pulling it out, a million things started going through my head. And I thought I was gonna die.”

3. Yanez said the car smelled like “burnt marijuana,” and he wasn’t sure if Castile’s gun was for protection “from a drug dealer.”

Yanez: “As I get up to the car I’m hit with an odor of burning marijuana .... And I know it’s already been smoked and I’ve been around uh through my training I’ve been around burnt marijuana and uh as a police officer I’ve been around burnt marijuana and uh fresh marijuana. So I know the distinct smells between both.

“I can’t remember if I asked for his ID or not but, I know I asked for his ID or his driver’s license. And then he goes I have a gun. And as I’m telling him or as he’s telling me that he’s reaching down between his right leg, his right thigh area and the center console. And he’s reaching down and I believe I’m telling him something along the lines of don’t reach for it, don’t do it. Referring to the, uh the firearm. Yep. Because usually people that carry firearms carry ’em on their waistband. Um and or in between the seats and being that the vehicle smelled the inside of the vehicle smelled like marijuana um I didn’t know if he was keeping it on him for protection, for, from a, a drug dealer or anything like that or any other people trying to rip him. Rip him meaning steal from him.”

4. Yanez said Castile fit the description of a robbery suspect and had a similar “wide-set nose.”

Investigator: “Do you remember what you pulled ’em over for?”

Yanez: “I was keeping my eye on 2424 Larpenteur which is a convenience store on Larpenteur at the intersection of Larpenteur and Eustice. It’s on the southwest comer of the intersection. Um, I wanted to pay attention to that because we had a strong armed robbery last week uh which involved two African American males um, one having a firearm and pointing it at the clerk and then the other uh the victim to!d me that he also had a firearm but I wasn’t ab!e to see it when the video was reviewed. Um, so I was sitting at a intersection and I see a white vehicle. I can’t remember what kind of vehicle it was. Um but I see two occupants. What I believed was two occupants inside the car. And I couldn’t make out the passenger. But I knew the passenger had a hat on. And I couldn’t make out if it was a guy or girl I just knew that they were both African American and the driver uh appeared to me that he appeared to match the uh physical description of the one of our suspects from the strong arm robbery, gunpoint.”

Investigator: “What is that description?”

Yanez: “Um it was a (sigh) I can’t remember the height, weight but I remember that it was, the male had dreadlocks around shoulder length. Or longer hair around shoulder length. And, um it wasn’t specified if it was corn rows or dreadlocks or straight hair. Um and then just kind of distinct facial features with like, a kind of like a wide set nose and uh I saw that in the driver of the vehicle.”

5. A 4-year-old girl in the car, the daughter of Castile’s girlfriend, was in the line of fire.

Investigator: “Where is the little girl seated?”

Yanez: “She was seated behind, directly behind the front seat passenger. But diagonal, uh, from where I was standing. Um, so basically behind the driver. And then, so...”

Investigator: “Behind the driver or the passenger?”

Yanez: “So if I’m facing the driver she was, she was diagonal from him. Behind the backseat or front seat passenger. So she was in my line of fire. Um, but I made sure that I directed my firearm down and as best as I could and let off rounds and as the rounds were going off I thought he was still moving for his gun and (sigh) I it just seemed like he was pulling out the gun and the barrel just kept coming. It seemed like something was just coming out and I thought it was a gun ..."

“Inoculate yourself with the word of God,” urged Gloria Copeland, who with her husband co-founded the Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Texas.

Both serve on Trump’s evangelical advisory board.

While health officials continue to urge people to get flu shots during a season that has been marked by widespread illness, Copeland told followers that faith in Christ is all that’s really needed.

“Well, listen, partners, we don’t have a flu season,” Copeland said in a video clip posted online by Right Wing Watch. “And don’t receive it when somebody threatens you with, ‘Everybody’s getting the flu.’ We’ve already had our shot: He bore our sicknesses and carried our diseases. That’s what we stand on.”

She said the faithful who don’t have the flu can ward off the infection by repeatedly saying, “I’ll never have the flu. I’ll never have the flu.”

For those who are ― somehow ― sick anyway, she offered a prayer.

“Flu, I bind you off of the people in the name of Jesus,” she said, “Jesus himself gave us the flu shot. He redeemed us from the curse of flu, and we receive it and we take it, and we are healed by his stripes, amen.”

Last week, the CDC said flu hospitalizations have reached their highest point in nearly a decade, and that 48 states are experiencing widespread illnesses due to the virus.

The agency also urged people who have not yet been vaccinated to get the flu shot."

The officer reportedly fired at the pajama-clad victim from inside a police cruiser while she addressed his partner through the driver’s window.

Justine Ruszczyk, 40, was killed after she called 911 to report what she thought was a possible assault on her street, her fiancé confirmed Monday.

It appears she most frequently went by the name Justine Damond, even though she was not yet legally married to fiancé Don Damond, 50. The couple had planned to get married in August, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

Shown below are Justine Damond, Don Damond and Don’s son Zach Damond.

Don Damond mourned the loss of his fiancée in a statement Monday afternoon and criticized the police for not being more forthcoming with information surrounding her death.

“Our hearts are broken and we’re utterly devastated by the loss of Justine,” he said, describing his fiancee as “a teacher to so many in living a life of openness, love and kindness.”

“She was so kind and so darned funny,” Damond said while holding back tears. “We’re desperate for information. Piecing together Justine’s last moments before the homicide would be a small comfort.”

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner announced Monday that Justine Damond died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen and described her death as a homicide.

Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it would provide consular assistance to the victim’s family, and released a brief statement on behalf of relatives.

“This is a very difficult time for our family,” the statement says. “We are trying to come to terms with this tragedy and to understand why this has happened.”

Justine Damond’s father, John Ruszczyk, addressed her death in a statement to Australian media on Tuesday.

“We thought yesterday was our worst nightmare, but we awoke to the ugly truth and it hurt even more,” he said. “Justine was a beacon to all of us, we only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death.”

Zach Damond, 22, who identified himself as the slain woman’s future stepson, said in a video posted to Facebook that she was killed after calling 911 to report a sound in the alley behind her home.

Justine Damond went outside in her pajamas to talk to the officers when they arrived to investigate about 11:30 p.m. She was reportedly speaking to police from outside the driver’s door when the officer in the passenger seat pulled his gun and shot through the driver’s side door, striking Damond, sources familiar with the incident told the Star Tribune. No weapon was found at the scene.

The officer who fired has been identified as Mohammed Noor, the first Somali-American officer to join the Minneapolis Police Department’s 5th Precinct team, according to local CBS affiliate WCCO.

City records show Noor had three complaints on file, according to local ABC affiliate KSTP. One complaint against him was dismissed with no disciplinary action, though two remain open.

“Officer Noor extends his condolences to the family and anyone else who has been touched by this event,” Tom Plunkett, Noor’s attorney, said in a statement Monday. “He came to the United States at a young age and is thankful to have had so many opportunities. He takes these events very seriously because, for him, being a police officer is a calling.”

“The current environment for police is difficult, but Officer Noor accepts this as part of his calling,” the statement continued.

Zach Damond reacted to the incident in a video posted to the Facebook page for Women’s March Minnesota.

“Basically my mom’s dead because a police officer shot her for reasons I don’t know,” he says in the video. “I demand answers. If anybody can help, just call police and demand answers. I’m so done with all this violence.”

Minneapolis police faced intense pressure after authorities admitted there was no video footage from the officers’ body cameras.

The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which was leading the investigation, said body cameras worn by the officers were “not turned on at the time and the squad camera did not capture the incident.” The agency said it was seeking any other video that may have been taken.

Since 2016, Minneapolis has required all officers to wear and activate body cameras “at all times when they could reasonably anticipate that they may become involved in a situation for which activation is appropriate.”

The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension “will provide additional details of the incident once initial interviews with the officers are complete,” the agency said in a statement Monday. “Those interviews have been requested by BCA agents. The officers are working with their attorneys to schedule them.”

Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges said she had “questions about why the bodycams weren’t on” and was “heartsick and deeply disturbed by what occurred.”

“There are still many questions about what took place, and while the investigation is still in its early stages, I am asking the BCA to release as much information, as quickly as they are able to,” Hodges said in a statement.

Both officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave, the Star Tribune reported.

Personal Website Justine Damon was a motivational speaker and meditation teacher, according to her personal website.

Justine Damond, who had lived in Minneapolis for roughly three years, was a trained yoga teacher and worked as a motivational speaker and life coach, according to her personal website.

She grew up in Sydney, and completed a degree in veterinary science at the University of Sydney in 2002 before moving to the U.S., according to her LinkedIn profile.

Jo Grabyn, a friend and fellow Australian, told HuffPost on Monday that she was “in shock and totally confused” about the circumstances surrounding her friend’s death.

“She was such a shining light in so many ways,” Grabyn, 42, said. “She leaves a gaping hole in so many lives. [She] deserved three lifetimes, not less than half of one.”

The Lake Harriet Spiritual Community Center, where Justine Damond gave weekly talks on meditation, said in a statement to HuffPost that she preached and practiced “love and peace and non-violence.”

“She inspired us with example of how she chose to live her life,” the center said. “While this is a tragic event, Justine would want us to use this opportunity to develop greater love and compassion for each other, and look to find solutions by thinking differently.”

A neighbor reportedly told reporters the victim was critical of lenient American gun laws, compared with those in Australia.

Following a shooting rampage that left 35 people dead in 1996, Australia passed anti-gun violence measures that introduced lengthy background checks and required all firearms to be registered to a licensed owner and stored under strict conditions, separate from ammunition.

Australia, like countries such as Germany and New Zealand, has encouraged citizens traveling to the U.S. to be aware of high levels of gun violence. The country’s foreign affairs department website warns travelers to “be vigilant about possibility of gun crime in all parts” of the U.S.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was rocked by another police shooting last year, when a St. Anthony officer fatally shot Philando Castile in a St. Paul suburb just miles from the scene of Saturday night’s killing. An officer was charged in the death of Castile, who was black, but was acquitted last month. He has since left the St. Anthony police force.

What can you tell me about the flu shots made for seniors? I got sick last winter after getting a standard flu shot, and am wandering if the flu vaccine for older adults would provide me better protection this year.

—Almost 70

Dear Almost,

There are actually two different flu shots – the Fluzone High Dose and FLUAD – that are designed specifically for people age 65 and older (you only need to get one of them).

These FDA approved vaccines are designed to offer extra protection beyond what a standard flu shot provides, which is important for older adults who have weaker immune defenses and have a great risk of developing dangerous flu complications.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the flu puts more than 200,000 people in the hospital each year and kills, on average, about 24,000 – 80 percent of whom are seniors.

You also need to be aware that these senior-specific flu shots cannot guarantee that you won’t get the flu this season, but they will lower your risk. And if you do happen to get sick, you probably won’t get as sick as you would without it. Here’s more information on the two vaccines:

Fluzone High-Dose: Approved for U.S. use in 2009, the Fluzone High-Dose is a high-potency vaccine that contains four times the amount of antigen as a regular flu shot does, which creates a stronger immune response for better protection. This vaccine, according to a 2013 clinical trial, was 24 percent more effective than the regular-dose shot at preventing flu in seniors.

FLUAD: Available in the U.S. since last year, the FLUAD vaccine contains an added ingredient called adjuvant MF59 that also helps create a stronger immune response. In a 2012 Canadian observational study, FLUAD was 63 percent more effective than a regular flu shot.

The CDC, however, does not recommend one vaccination over the other, and to date, there have been no studies comparing the two vaccines.

You should also know that both the Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD can cause more of the mild side effects that can occur with a standard-dose flu shot, like pain or tenderness where you got the shot, muscle aches, headache or fatigue. And neither vaccine is recommended for seniors who are allergic to chicken eggs, or those who have had a severe reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.

Both vaccines are also covered 100 percent by Medicare Part B, as long as your doctor, health clinic or pharmacy agrees not to charge you more than Medicare pays.

Pneumonia Vaccines

Two other important vaccinations the CDC recommends to seniors, especially this time of year, are the pneumococcal vaccines for pneumonia. Around 1 million Americans are hospitalized with pneumonia each year, and about 50,000 people die from it.

The CDC is now recommending that all seniors, 65 or older, get two vaccinations –Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23. Both vaccines, which are administered just once at different times, work in different ways to provide maximum protection.

If you haven’t yet received any pneumococcal vaccine you should get the Prevnar 13 first, followed by Pneumovax 23 six to 12 months later. But if you’ve already been vaccinated with Pneumovax 23, wait at least one year before getting the Prevnar 13.

Medicare Part B covers both shots, if they are taken at least one year apart.

Witnesses said the animal was shot two or three times before it collapsed.

“It was a very big tiger,” a witness told Le Parisien. “We heard two or three shots and saw police going down towards the tracks” of a nearby tramway. The tramway had been shut down “because of the presence of a tiger” on the tracks the Paris transit agency said.

The 450-pound, two-year-old tiger was shot before French firefighters arrived on the scene, L’Express reported. Authorities took the tiger’s owner into custody for questioning, according to French media. He appeared to be “in shock,” said L’Express. He was being held on suspicion of putting people’s lives at risk, according to Le Parisien.

The tiger had escaped from the Bormann Moreno circus, which recently set up in the city for shows slated to begin in about a week.

The animal had been free “for some time,” according to officials. The Paris police department announced later Friday the danger to the public was over after the animal had been “neutralized.”

No one was injured by the tiger or the shooter.

Captive animals that have escaped are sometimes killed because tranquilizer darts can take too long to take effect, and the animals may put people’s lives at risk.

Some area residents, conservationists and animal right activists were outraged that the tiger had been killed and posted gruesome photos of the tiger’s body on social media, calling for an end to the use of animals in circuses and for boycotts of events that exploit animals."

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ deliberation is expected to take a full year and is in response to the large number of mumps outbreaks in the U.S. in recent years ― most notably in 2016, when there were more than 5,000 cases, This trend appears to be continuing into 2017, and it’s occurring not in communities with pockets of low-vaccination rates, but instead in areas where vaccine coverage is robust.

ACIP liaison member Patsy Stinchfield, who represents the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, said the workgroup of experts would dive deeper into the mumps situation, “given we have had significant cases of mumps in 2006, 2010 and now again in 2016.”

These virus outbreaks could be a sign that the current two-shot schedule, which is given in combination with vaccines for measles and rubella between the ages of 12 and 15 months and then when children are between 4-6 years old, may not be strong enough to prevent an infection. Two doses of the MMR shot protects against mumps 88 percent of the time, while one shot is 78 percent effective. In contrast, two doses of the vaccine protects against measles 97 percent of the time, and just one shot is 97 percent effective against rubella.

“At present, mumps does not come as a single antigen vaccine and is available only as combined MMR vaccine so deliberating a third dose would also need to consider extra doses of measles and rubella,” said Stinchfield, who is Senior Director of Infection Prevention at Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.

Some of the questions the advisory group will consider include why the outbreaks only seem to be occurring among teens and young adults, but not older adults, Stinchfield said.

In general, receiving extra doses of MMR vaccine is not ideal but poses little to no medical problems. ACIP and National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioner representative Patsy Stinchfield

The committee will examine the context of the most recent outbreaks, which for the most part have taken place on college campuses, but not on military bases, which also house similarly aged people in close quarters. The committee will also consider if vaccine storage and handling techniques, or a shift in the mumps genotype compared to the vaccine, could explain the outbreaks.

And because the mumps dose is part of a combination vaccine, the committee will examine any potential adverse effects that may come with getting a third MMR shot ― although due to poor record keeping or a person’s uncertainty about their history, Stinchfield said she has often seen patients who have received more than two MMR shots.

“In general, receiving extra doses of MMR vaccine is not ideal but poses little to no medical problems,” she said.

“Multiple doses and adverse events will also be analyzed by the workgroup.”

Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has some guidelines in place for local public health agencies considering offering a third MMR shot to people in the face of a large-scale mumps outbreak, but these are not official recommendations because scientists need more evidence of its effectiveness.

In short, local health officials should consider a campaign for a third MMR shot if the outbreak is happening among people with a 90 percent or higher two-dose MMR coverage rate and if there are signs that transmission has gone on for more than two weeks. And an attack rate of more than five cases per 1,000 people could help local health leaders decide to encourage a third shot.

In January alone, there were 495 reported mumps infections. Last year there were 5,311 cases. In 2006, the last year there was a large spike in reports, there were more than 5,700 cases, many of which were among fully vaccinated college students.

CDC There have been several large mumps outbreaks in recent years in the U.S., prompting officials to consider recommending a third vaccine to prevent the disease.

*Cases as of Dec. 31, 2016; **Cases as of Jan. 28, 2017. Case counts are preliminary and subject to change.

“Remember, mumps is not just a cute chipmunk face associated with an upper respiratory illness,” Stinchfield said. “We vaccinate against it because mumps can cause encephalitis, meningitis, deafness, oophoritis (ovary swelling) and orchitis (testicular swelling).”

People with mumps can also experience fever, headache, fatigue and inflammation of the salivary glands, causing patients’ necks to swell, or even mastitis, inflammation of the breast tissue.

Once you’re exposed to the virus, it can take an average of 16 to 18 days for symptoms to set in, although some infections can cause very mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.

It is passed along through saliva and mucus, so kissing or sharing eating and drinking utensils with infected people puts you at risk. Simply living in close quarters with infected people could also put you in harm’s way, which explains why many of the most recent outbreaks in the U.S. have taken place at universities. In response, some of these universities held large-scale vaccination campaigns to give students a third shot of the vaccine. In 2014, there were also mumps outbreaks among several National Hockey League teams.

In one recent outbreak that spanned from 2015 to 2016, people at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign started getting mumps despite the fact that most of them had received two recommended mumps vaccines. In response, the university health center recommended that all students and staff born in 1957 and afterward receive a third MMR vaccine, and about 11,500 complied.

In total, 317 became infected with the mumps at that campus, even though 73 percent of them had received the usual two doses. In fact, another 45 of those who got the mumps had gotten three vaccines, with the third shot being administered during the outbreak, although experts suspect that they had gotten infected before the vaccine had a chance to kick in.

Lest you think this is evidence that the MMR vaccine isn’t worth the hassle, consider this: Before the mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967, the virus used to be considered a universal disease of childhood, according to the CDC. Most children got the virus by the time they were 14 years old. Outbreaks were also common in the military, especially at the most inconvenient of times — such as mobilization.

But once the vaccine became a national recommendation, the disease rates plunged. In 1968, one year after the shot was introduced, there were 152,209 reported cases. By the early 2000s, those reported cases had dropped 99 percent to an average of less than 270 annually.

And The Washington Post noted in its report this week that even though recent outbreaks spread among a population that was mostly vaccinated against mumps, the vaccine appeared to mitigate the severity of the disease. In Arkansas, where about 2,800 people have gotten mumps since 2016, only 17 people experienced inflammation of the testicles. Without vaccines, that number could have been as high as 700 or 800."

Nobody seems to know ― or if they do, they aren’t saying.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 1 shooting, President Donald Trump and Las Vegas police praised Campos for his actions, as he initially was reported to have taken a bullet to the leg before helping authorities locate the shooter, Stephen Paddock. But the story got murkier last week, when law enforcement adjusted the timeline of events. They first suggested Campos had actually been shot outside Paddock’s hotel suite minutes before Paddock began his attack on the thousands of concertgoers gathered 32 stories below. Then, police revised the sequence of events again, saying Paddock was shooting “at the same time, or within 40 seconds after” Campos had reported being shot.

Questions of Campos’ whereabouts first began to swirl last Thursday, when he abruptly canceled on a slate of interviews with major news networks in which he had been scheduled to publicly give his account of the night’s events for the first time. The next day, Campos’ union representative, David Hickey of the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America, told reporters he’d learned that Campos had been taken to a local clinic.

“We had a meeting with MGM officials, and after that meeting was over, we talked about the interviews, we went to a private area, and when we came out, Mr. Campos was gone,” Hickey said, according to Fox 5 Las Vegas. “Right now I’m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It’s highly unusual. I’m hoping everything is OK with him and I’m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something.”

Hickey has had “no contact” with Campos since, he told the Los Angeles Times on Monday. He maintained that “somebody knows where he is.”

MGM Resorts, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Tuesday that there was nothing unusual about Campos’ disappearance.

“Jesus Campos wants to tell his story at a time and place of his choosing,” they wrote. “He’s asked that everyone respect his request for privacy. We could not be more proud of Jesus.”

Hickey did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

With 58 killed and hundreds more injured, the Las Vegas mass shooting is the deadliest in modern U.S. history. It has sparked a storm of media coverage, and Hickey had been in Las Vegas helping Campos manage the spotlight. The two men were photographed together last week, as Campos received an “SPFPA Hero Award.”

But it seems unlikely that all of the attention directed at Campos is welcome. The massacre has also set off a wave of conspiracy theories, and in the rush to turn up evidence of a supposed “false flag” operation, some people online have begun turning their sights on Campos, Snopes reports. Last week, an armed security contractor was seen parked outside Campos’ Las Vegas home."

Lt. Aaron Allan, a 38-year-old with the Southport Police Department, responded to reports of an overturned car in front of a house on Thursday afternoon. As Allan approached, he was fatally shot by a man hanging upside down from the vehicle.

Police identified the suspect Friday as 28-year-old Jason Brown.

“The Southport Police Department is mourning the tragic loss of Lieutenant Aaron Allan who was killed in the line of duty after he was shot while trying to help,” the department said in a statement.

While police haven’t released a potential motive for the incident, Traci Wagner, a longtime friend of Brown’s, said the shooting was “out of character” for him.

Instagram Jason Brown, 28, is accused of killing Allan.

“There’s no winner in this situation,” Wagner told Fox59. “There’s no winner. There just isn’t. So many lives were ruined last night, yesterday by all of this.”

Allan was with the Southport Police Department for six years and had more than 20 years of law enforcement experience. In 2015, he was recognized as officer of the year after he saved a man’s life at the Indiana State Fairground by performing chest compressions on the man for 10 minutes until help could arrive.

“I’m very surprised,” he told The Southport Times after being recognized for his heroics. “It’s part of the job. I’m overwhelmed.”"

Police suspect Cruz was armed with at least one AR-15-style rifle and “countless magazines” in the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

This adds to a disturbing trend. In many of the most deadly mass shootings in the last several years, including the Las Vegas massacre on Oct. 1 and the shooting at a Texas church on Nov. 5, the lone gunmen were armed with assault-style rifles like the one reportedly used at the Florida school.

There’s plenty of debate over what constitutes a mass shooting — as well as what drives those who commit them. But it’s increasingly clear that individuals who want to inflict mass casualties are taking advantage of the widespread availability of weapons of war.

These weapons are meant for use on the battlefield.

Renowned firearms engineer Eugene Stoner developed the first AR-15, or ArmaLite Rifle (hence the “AR”), in the late 1950s, using advances in technology and materials to revolutionize battlefield weaponry. Stoner’s rifle was marketed to national militaries interested in a lightweight firearm with precision accuracy and high lethality at long range. Colt Manufacturing Co. eventually purchased ArmaLite and convinced the U.S. military to replace the M-14 with its M-16, which employed many of the advances in the AR-15.

Many modern AR-style rifles are modeled off of these rifles and their successors, which have been the standard issue for the U.S. military since the Vietnam War. But there is one key difference: Battle-ready assault rifles have a selector switch that allows automatic fire (a continuous spray of bullets with a single pull of the trigger), or semi-automatic (one shot with each trigger pull). Civilian versions are semi-automatic only.

The AR-15′s influence is apparent on the .223 SIG Sauer MCX rifle reportedly used in the 2016 Pulse nighclub massacre in Orlando, according to Mother Jones.

SIG SAUER The SIG Sauer MCX is the assault-style rifle used in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in 2016.

Here’s how one reviewer described the SIG Sauer MCX:

SIG SAUER developed the MCX rifle for America’s special forces. Their goal: a firearm that’s as quiet as an MP5, as deadly as an AK-47, and more modular than anything ever designed.

The manufacturer touts the same qualities, saying the rifle is designed to be “silenced, light and short.”

These rifles are designed to kill as efficiently as possible.

These weapons are designed to fire off bullets very, very quickly. Some manufacturers boast that an experienced shooter could fire as many as 45 rounds in one minute. Magazines containing fresh ammunition can be swapped out in a matter of seconds.

The specifications of assault-style rifles vary depending on ammunition, but many tests put the muzzle velocity of a standard round from an AR-15 at 3,200 feet per second, making it accurate up to 500 yards ― more than a quarter-mile.

This makes rounds from an AR-15 or other assault-style weapons far more devastating than those fired from small-caliber handguns.

Here’s a video of a 5.56mm caliber round ― the kind used in many assault-style rifles ― being fired into ballistic gel meant to mimic human flesh. You can see how a single shot inflicts massive trauma, regardless of where it hits the target.

And that’s just one round. A standard AR-15 magazine holds 30 rounds. But in most states, the rifles can be legally outfitted with high-capacity magazines that can hold 60 or even 100 rounds. A gunman in Texas recently managed to fire off 212 rounds from an AR-15 during a standoff with police, though it’s unclear if he used high-capacity magazines. Six people were shot during this exchange, none fatally. If the shooter had chosen a more densely populated target, the outcome could have been much different.

AR-15 and similar weapons also are highly customizable, allowing for the addition of aftermarket sights, grips, suppressors and other accessories that make them more effective and easier to wield in combat situations.

Assault-style rifles are relatively cheap and easy to buy.

The average price of an assault-style rifle fluctuates somewhat with supply and demand. Online distributors currently offer versions for under $200, though the average price appears to be around $1,000. A SIG Sauer MCX like that used by the Orlando gunman retails for about $1,700.

In most states, anyone legally allowed to possess a handgun can also purchase an AR-15 or other assault-style rifle, with no further requirements. In Florida, for example, there is no waiting period for would-be buyers of rifles or other long guns.

Not even people on the terrorist watch list are barred from purchasing assault-style rifles. An attempt to close that loophole was voted down by Senate Republicans in 2015, and was blocked again shortly after the Orlando shooting the folllowing year.

These guns are already everywhere.

There are estimated to be millions of assault-style rifles already in civilian hands, according to recent manufacturer reports, with dozens of companies offering versions. Most of these weapons will never be used in crimes. But the threat is nonetheless present.

A suspect arrested in 2016 in Los Angeles had three of AR-15 rifles in his car, along with bags of ammo and explosive materials. He reportedly told police he was on his way to the city’s gay pride parade.

And it’s not just a matter of AR-15s and their higher-tech variants. Hundreds of thousands of new assault-style rifles flood the market each year. This includes high-powered weaponry like the AK-style rifles used in 2015 by the Planned Parenthood shooter in Colorado Springs, or the gunman who attacked a military recruitment center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Some states ban assault weapons, but manufacturers have found ways around the restrictions.

A number of states, including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, have laws limiting or banning the sale of assault weapons. California, for example, has banned AR-15s and other rifles with detachable magazines, which allow shooters to quickly reload. However a recent feature called a “bullet button” allows magazines to be quickly replaced, while still technically remaining fixed, rendering this law largely ineffective. State lawmakers attempted to close this loophole by introducing legislation prohibiting future sales of rifles with bullet buttons, but gun owners have found ways around the ban.

Gun manufacturers have also managed to easily circumvent other state laws by making small modifications to the weapons, such as replacing the grip or other components.

Federal attempts at banning assault weapons have been largely unsuccessful.

In 1994, then-President Bill Clinton signed a federal ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. The law specifically banned certain semi-automatic weapons, including the AR-15, as well as rifles that could accept detachable magazines. That ban lapsed in 2004, when Congress did not reauthorize it.

There’s been debate about how well the ban actually worked. It didn’t apply to guns manufactured prior to 1994. According to NBC News, more than 1 million assault-style rifles and 25 million guns with high-capacity magazines were grandfathered in. A 2004 study by the University of Pennsylvania found that while the ban did result in a measurable reduction in crimes involving assault weapons, crimes involving non-banned guns remained steady or increased.

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence,” concluded the study. “There has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury.”

Pro-gun activists say this shows a new assault weapons ban wouldn’t affect gun violence. But if the ban hadn’t expired, it’s difficult to imagine these guns proliferating to the point of becoming the weapon of choice of mass shooters.

After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut, some members of Congress sought to renew the assault weapon ban. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2013, but was excluded from a vote by the full Senate due to Republican opposition. An attempt to re-attach the measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), one of the ban’s most ardent supporters, was voted down 40 to 60.

House Democrats again pushed for renewal in late 2015, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and Feinstein reintroduced it in 2017 following the Las Vegas and Texas shootings. There’s been no action on it since.

An attempt to ban bump stocks, a device used by the Las Vegas shooter that effectively turns semi-automatic rifles into automatic ones, also failed to gain traction in Congress. (Massachusetts, however, became the first state to ban the add-on stocks earlier this month.)

Connecticut State Police via Getty Images The Bushmaster AR-style rifle used to carry out the 2012 rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

Every time a gunman carries out a massacre with an assault-style rifle, sales go up.

Gun sales, particularly those of assault weapons, tend to spike after each mass shooting, fueled in part by fears that lawmakers will crack down. Already immensely popular, AR-15s and similar rifles flew off the shelves after Sandy Hook. Gun shop owners saw a similar spike after San Bernardino.

This trend is so pronounced that gun industry executives have admitted mass shootings are good for business.

Families of gun violence victims are fighting back against this profit windfall. The parents of nine Sandy Hook victims and one person who survived the massacre are suing Remington, the manufacturer of the rifle used in that shooting. The suit accuses Remington of negligence in selling a military-grade weapon for civilian use, arguing that the guns were purposefully marketed to young men as personal weapons of war.

“Remington took a weapon that was made to the specs of the U.S. military for the purpose of killing enemy soldiers in combat ― and that weapon in the military is cared for with tremendous amount of diligence, in terms of training, storage, who gets the weapon, and who can use it,” the families’ attorney, Joshua Koskoff, told CNN in February of 2016. “They took that same weapon and started peddling it to the civilian market for the purposes of making a lot of money.”

Handguns are common in single-victim gun violence, but military-style rifles are becoming the weapon of choice for mass shooters.

Tens of thousands of people die in gun violence every year, and the overwhelming majority involve handguns, not assault-style rifles or other long guns. At least 64 percent of the gun-related homicides in 2016 were committed with pistols, according to FBI data.

When shooters do turn to heavy weaponry, however, the results can be catastrophic.

Weapons of war have been used in some of the deadliest shootings over the last several years. In addition to Las Vegas, AR-15 style rifles were used during mass shootings in California, Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Texas and Colorado.

The gun industry is trying to convince you these weapons are just for fun.

Gun advocates insist assault-style rifles are ideal for hunting and target shooting. A fact sheet published by the National Shooting Sports Foundation in 2013 condemned the “assault weapon” label, claiming the term was “conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie.” The group has repeatedly argued that the guns are useful for marksmanship competitions and hunting large game. The NRA champions the AR-15 as ”America’s rifle.”

The industry has coined the term ”modern sporting rifles″ to describe assault weapons, and the term is used by major gun retailers like Cabela’s, and manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Remington.

That message may resonate with gun enthusiasts. The weapons are versatile and efficient, and if you like the idea of shooting things for sport, the appeal is obvious. Assault-style weapons look cool. Shooting one might even make you feel like a badass.

But the very same traits that have made them the preferred weapon for military personnel and sport shooters are what make them a natural choice for those who want to inflict senseless violence with maximum casualties.

It now seems the toll of mass killers is limited only by their choice of weapon, their training and their target. The political response to that terrifying reality has been to hope that people will choose not to kill. That plan clearly isn’t working."

During a confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday, Dr. Dean Winslow broke with his boss’ line on guns, telling the panel how nonsensical it is for people to be able to purchase semi-automatic rifles like the one used by the shooter at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

“I may get in trouble with other members of the committee,” Winslow said,” [But I’d also like to say] how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15.”

Shortly after he made the statement, an unidentified senator cut him off before he could elaborate, interjecting, “I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise.”

Dr. Winslow is a former U.S. Air Force colonel who served two tours in Afghanistan and four tours in Iraq after 9/11. He went on to serve as the vice chair of medicine at Stanford University.

Law enforcement officials say the shooter in Texas used a Ruger AR-556, a variant of the AR-15. Similar semi-automatic rifles were also used to carry out mass shootings at a country music event in Las Vegas last month, an Orlando nightclub last year, and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.

Winslow offered the line in response to a question about whether the Sutherland Springs shooter should have been dishonorably discharged from the military, instead of merely receiving a “bad conduct discharge” after he was convicted of domestic violence.

The former U.S. Air Force colonel didn’t offer a direct response, instead choosing to highlight the Air Force’s failure to properly record the shooter’s domestic violence conviction in a federal database, one that would have otherwise prevented him from buying the gun."

Brian Mast (R-Fla.), a combat veteran and gun-carrying National Rifle Association member, is supporting a ban on “assault-style weapons” in the wake of a deadly mass shooting earlier this month.

“Our Second Amendment is an unimpeachable, God-given right to defend ourselves ― one of the most basic rights,” Mast said Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day.” “But we recognize that there is balance between what is the level of lethality, what is that level of firepower, and does that fall in line.”

Mast has recently flipped his stance on certain gun laws, distancing himself from other Republican legislators. He first publicly announced his endorsement of an assault weapons ban ― something the NRA opposes ― on Friday in an op-ed for The New York Times.

GOP Rep. Brian Mast, who is calling for an assault weapons ban, says ""our Second Amendment is an unimpeachable, God-given right ... but we recognize there is a line somewhere that we say, here is the Second Amendment and here is public safety"" https://t.co/416HcbNs1F — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 27, 2018

He said Tuesday that people shouldn’t be allowed to buy weapons like the AR-15-style rifle used earlier this month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“Let’s pause, let’s assess, let’s see what’s going on in the system,” he said. “Do a ban on purchases of these assault-style weapons ... so that we can assess the whole situation and get back to the American people in a responsible way.”

The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, the NRA’s political action committee, contributed $4,950 to Mast’s 2016 congressional campaign ― more than any other Florida member of the House during that election cycle.

In his op-ed, the Republican lawmaker called for several legislative steps to be taken, including defining and prohibiting the purchase of “an assault or tactical firearm” and improving the federal background check system. He also favored banning firearm accessories like “bump stocks,” the device that enabled Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire hundreds of rounds into a crowd at a country music festival in October.

“No firearm is evil,” Mast wrote. “Guns are tools that fulfill the intent of their users, good or bad. But we’ve seen that the rifle of choice for many mass shooters is the AR-15. ... I cannot support the primary weapon I used to defend our people being used to kill children I swore to defend.”

President Donald Trump announced his support for banning bump stocks and expanding background checks, but has not embraced an assault weapons ban. Instead, he has suggested raising the minimum age to purchase such weapons from 18 to 21.

Mast has argued that that’s not enough."

Five years later we are still awash in Sandy Hook grief. And the killings continue. My home paper The New Haven Register had front-page stories this year:

Fourteen-year-old Tyriek Keyes passed away from a fatal gunshot wound last Thursday, four days after being shot near Bassett and Newhall Streets…. Two days after Keyes’ death, a 13-year-old boy was found shot near Bassett Street…

Tuesday’s front-page headline was a welcome change:

Surrendered guns turned into gardening tools in latest New Haven gun buy-back

Reporter Jessica Lerner writes that this year’s buy-back will be different. New Haven Police Officer David Hartman explains that the donated (no questions asked) firearms will be given to local metal sculptor, Gar Waterman, who will turn over the smashed pieces to the Department of Correction where volunteer inmates will forge the pieces into gardening tools under the tutelage of RAWTools, a nonprofit Colorado group that forges hand tools from weapons.

Steven Yanovsky, from the Newtown Foundation, says,

“It allows us to take this method of destruction, this murder machine, and turn it into something which is the polar opposite… you’re taking a weapon of death and turning it into the complete opposite, which is life. So you go from a rifle or a handgun to carrots.”

Yanovsky continues, “Yes, this is a baby step, but this is where it starts, and hopefully, it will spread throughout the country.”

Are we finally getting the words of Isaiah --

“…and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.”

“How many deaths will it take till we know…?” Thanks to Bob Dylan for keeping the question alive.

To the parents of those children who today would be sixth-graders, heartfelt gratitude.

Think about that number: 147. That's three busloads, two completely-full Amtrak passenger cars. The New York Times, in a nearly unprecedented front-page editorial, calls it a ""moral outrage and national disgrace."" The purpose of this column is to explain why we agree and why the editorial board's call for a ban on civilian ownership of assault weapons deserves to be supported in the strongest possible terms.

The gun industry has been promoting assault rifles by advancing a big, fat lie; namely, that assault rifles are just another type of 'sporting' weapon, no more dangerous than the old Remington or Winchester that Grandpa and then Dad used to lug out to the woods. Most sporting rifles load ammunition by the manual use of a bolt or lever, which considerably slows the speed at which the gun can fire multiple rounds. Semi-automatic sporting rifles like the Remington 742 increase the speed at which the gun can shoot more than one round, but the standard semi-auto hunting rifle still only holds 4 or 5 rounds.

What makes the AR so different, so lethal, and so non-sporting is not the fact that it looks like a military gun (which it is); not the fact that it might be fitted with a laser which makes it extremely accurate, particularly in indoor, low light; not the fact that the stock can be folded so that the gun can be easily carried or even concealed; not even the fact that the front barrel lug can also be fitted with a bayonet, just in case a little extra oomph is needed to finish the job.

What makes the AR an assault rifle and not a sporting rifle is one thing and one thing only, namely, that it fires ammunition specifically designed to kill or maim military combatants (who happen to be humans, by the way) and can easily fire 50 or 60 high-powered rounds in 30 seconds or less. This is not to say that mass shootings involving scores of victims can only be accomplished with an AR; Seung-Hui Cho killed and wounded 56 people at Virginia Tech in 2007 using a Glock 19. But Cho's attacks were spread over more than three hours; Adam Lanza killed 26 with an AR in five minutes or less. Better coordination and communication might have saved many lives at Virginia Tech; in San Bernardino the carnage was over almost as soon as it began.

What the Times calls a moral outrage and national disgrace is more than that; the ability of private citizens to get their hands on these highly-lethal weapons fitted out with high-capacity magazines is a risk to the nation's health. When two cases of Ebola occurred in the same hospital where a patient stricken with the virus had previously died, it wouldn't have taken more than one or two more confirmed cases and the city of Dallas would have ceased to exist. But the risk was recognized by the CDC and the threat was quickly brought to an end.

We are suggesting that the same situation now exists as regards the ownership and use of AR-15s. How many more senseless slaughters are we going to endure while politicians dither around and pretend they are truly concerned about Constitutional rights? And if anyone wants to believe that banning assault rifles would be an infringement on the sacred 2nd Amendment, the recent decision by the 2nd Circuit upholding Connecticut's assault rifle ban lays that NRA-concocted nonsense to rest.

The Constitution wisely gives government the right to institute comprehensive public health measures when the community's health is at risk. If 147 dead and injured human beings in just three assaults with AR rifles doesn't constitute a risk, then it's time to save the taxpayers some money and close down the CDC."

During a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers on gun control Wednesday, Trump suggested guns should be taken away “immediately from people that you can judge easily are mentally ill,” alluding to the Florida shooter, who had undergone a psychiatric evaluation in 2016 but was ultimately not hospitalized.

“The police saw that he was a problem, they didn’t take any guns away,” Trump said. “Now that could have been policing, but they should have taken them away anyway, whether they had the right or not.”

He doubled down on the claim later in the meeting after Vice President Mike Pence spoke about due process and giving local law enforcement more leeway to obtain a court order to collect firearms from potentially dangerous people.

“Mike, take the firearms first and then go to court, because that’s another system,” Trump said. “A lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early.”

Trump often seemed to be more in agreement with Democrats than Republicans during the meeting, as was clear by Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-Calif.) delighted expression during much of the event.

Trump shot down Rep. Steve Scalise’s (R-La.) suggestion to add concealed carry reciprocity to a background check bill, telling him, “You’ll never get it passed.” He also chided Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) for being “afraid” of the National Rifle Association.

He was, however, on board with Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s (D-Minn.) request to provide domestic violence victims with more protections against gun violence, and Feinstein’s suggestion to add an assault weapons ban to legislation.

Trump also repeatedly questioned former President Barack Obama’s efforts on gun control on Wednesday. He kicked off the meeting by listing mass shootings that had taken place under other presidents, and called out Obama by name while discussing the Manchin-Toomey bill.

Trump didn’t appear knowledgeable about that bill, which failed in the Senate in 2013 despite widespread public support and has been debated regularly ever since.

He asked Toomey, who introduced the bill with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), if the bill had bipartisan support and suggested it “didn’t have a lot of presidential backing.” He also argued Obama “was not proactive” in trying to pass a bill to strengthen background checks, despite Obama’s push for gun control reform after the Sandy Hook massacre in 2013.

Politicization, according to the DCCC official, included talking about gun violence prevention policy.

“You and your candidate will be understandably outraged and upset, as will your community. However, DO NOT POLITICIZE IT TODAY,” DCCC regional press secretary Evan Lukaske wrote to candidates in the Northeast. “There will be time for politics and policy discussion, but any message today should be on offering thoughts/prayers for victims and their families, and thanking 1st responders who saved lives.”

The email, seen in its entirety below, reflects the careful balance that Democrats have tried to strike as they strive to advance modest gun safety regulations and shield candidates in swing districts from the political price that could accompany comments about guns.

HuffPost

But the cautious approach in Lukaske’s email is increasingly out of touch with what many party members, as well as gun violence prevention activists, would like to see from politicians ― especially in the wake of the recent deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Many of the surviving Parkland students waited almost no time before beginning to agitate for different gun policies, sparking a movement that has captivated the country.

Gun violence prevention activists said they were disappointed the DCCC was advising candidates not to aggressively talk about policy solutions as often as possible. Ladd Everitt, director of the gun violence prevention group One Pulse for America, described the DCCC email as “pathetic.” Mark Glaze, senior adviser to the group Guns Down, said it was “straight out of the NRA’s talking points.”

“If the DCCC is willing to give up a key issue and offend virtually every Democrat so as not to bother eight Independents in rural Missouri, they’re even more incompetent than we thought, and Democrats should be very worried about the midterms,” Glaze said.

Several Democratic lawmakers have taken to mocking the traditional practice of sending gun violence victims “thoughts and prayers” without any follow-up of policy solutions.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who became a leading advocate of greater gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, wasted no time after the Las Vegas massacre calling for greater action to prevent gun violence.

“To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,” he tweeted a few hours after Lukaske’s email went out.

Asked about the email on Tuesday, Murphy emphasized that it was a message from “one staffer.”

Still, he added, “No Democrat should be worried about talking about policy changes in the wake of these mass shootings.”

Former Democratic Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, retired Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, “led by example” the day after the Las Vegas shooting by demanding congressional action on the steps of the U.S. Capitol the day after it occurred, noted Katie Peters, of the former congresswoman’s group Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. (Giffords became a more aggressive gun regulation advocate after being gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting.)

“Following the tragedy in Parkland, we’ve seen the students show incredible leadership in demanding more than thoughts and prayers from their elected officials,” Peters said.

Meredith Kelly, the DCCC’s communications director, emphasized that Lukaske’s message was intended to discourage hasty responses before all information about the shooting was known, rather than silence opinions about gun policy. It was also general advice that candidates were free to ignore.

“A communications staffer who fails to provide immediate and thoughtful guidance after a national tragedy, based on the best available information at the time, is not doing his job,” Kelly said.

The DCCC would not say whether it sent candidates similar guidance after the Parkland shooting. However, Kelly said the group, which is responsible for getting Democrats elected to the House, continues to caution candidates to consider their words carefully in the immediate aftermath of major national tragedies.

The revelation that the DCCC advised candidates to avoid “politicizing” the Las Vegas shooting occurs as the House campaign arm struggles to fend off progressive criticism of its electoral strategy, particularly through its involvement in primary elections.

Waleed Shahid is a spokesman for the left-leaning Justice Democrats, which backs a variety of candidates, including some the DCCC opposes. He called Lukaske’s email “a slap in the face to the movement” against gun violence.

“Politics is exactly how people come together to make change and hold those in power accountable,” he said."
huffpo60,huffpo,"['Erin Schumaker', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-03-01 05:47:06-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-gun-violence-hipaa_us_5a95a39be4b0bef79e3086ab,"A person at risk for committing gun violence has a clear profile, but when doctors identify a patient who meets the criteria, there is often little they can do about it.

The U.S. has decided that doctors should play a role in assessing risk, but we’re not giving them the tools to act on that risk, and so these efforts are mostly futile. That’s in part because of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, which prevents doctors from reporting a patient as dangerous unless the specific threat they pose is both “serious” and “imminent.”

HIPAA is important ― it protects the privacy and security of Americans’ health information and prevents employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of their medical histories. It also provides the trust, in an ideal doctor-patient relationship, to share extensive personal information ― including family, medical, psychological and drug use histories, disease and gun ownership statuses.

But that same sensitive knowledge that allows for high-quality treatment can also put doctors in a difficult ethical situation.

One of the biggest tip-offs that a person will commit a violent act is if they make a violent threat, and it isn’t uncommon for such threats to happen in a medical setting.

“Sometimes the only person who is aware that there’s a serious and imminent threat is a physician,” said David Rosmarin, the director of forensic psychiatry at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital. “And that clinician is barred under HIPAA from disclosing that threat if it’s below serious and imminent.”

We’re there to treat people. Putting us in the position of being the gun snitches is a difficult position to be in. David Rosmarin, Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital

HIPAA constraints become even more complicated in cases when the risk of violence isn’t overt or immediate. A clinician can assess that the patient has two major risk factors for the potential to commit gun violence, but can’t predict the future.

The doctor is forced to make a quick judgment call: Is the threat the patient presents both serious and imminent enough to report him to the police? If the patient doesn’t meet both of those risk standards, the doctor could be violating patient privacy and breaking the law by speaking up.

As Dr. Christopher Barsotti, an emergency medicine doctor in Bennington, Vermont, puts it, there are many examples of violence with a gun that could be classified as “near misses” and go uncounted.

Barsotti listed a series of de-identified examples from a single Vermont emergency room, which he published on VTDigger, a Vermont-based nonprofit journalism website, in 2015:

...the abused woman whose husband put a handgun on the kitchen table “for effect” when he beat her; the out-of-control kid who grabbed an unsecured gun and faced down his parents when he was mad; the mentally unstable man who scared the hell out of his neighbors with an impressive array of high-capacity firearms; the woman who tried to shoot herself with a long gun, but jerked the stock when she pulled the trigger, missed and blew a hole through her apartment wall; the heroin addict who dropped a handgun out of his pocket before passing out on the gurney; the kid who could have been a school shooter, but someone got worried and brought him in for treatment; the woman who overdosed on pills after witnessing the shooting death of a loved one.

Generalized worry that someone is capable of committing gun violence doesn’t reach the threshold ― and neither do several other scenarios. What if the patient has Alzheimer’s and can’t remember how to lock his front door, much less his gun safe? If the threat’s not serious and imminent, there’s nothing a doctor can do without breaking the law.

Doctors also have to think carefully about whether reporting an at-risk person will ultimately do more harm than good to that patient and his family.

If, for example, a pediatrician calls child protective services because a parent reveals that there are unlocked guns in the home, it’s likely that the pediatrician would not see that child in her practice again ― and worse, the parent may take the child out of the health care system entirely.

The likelihood that a parent would reveal to a doctor he doesn’t store his gun safely is higher than you might imagine, according to research published in the journal Pediatrics earlier this month: Nearly 70 percent of gun-owning parents with children in the home reported that they did not properly store their weapon, even when they had a child in the home had been diagnosed with a mental illness that would put him at risk for suicide, such as major depression.

Doctors’ first responsibility is to their patients ― not the public.

Beyond doctor discomfort, there’s the potential that predicting future violence could infringe on patient civil liberties and unnecessarily insert law enforcement into situations in which an individual hasn’t committed any crime.

“We’re there to treat people,” Rosmarin said. “Putting us in the position of being the gun snitches is a difficult position to be in.”

Arthur Caplan, the founding director of New York University’s Division of Medical Ethics, said he wasn’t worried about degrading civil liberties by reporting at-risk patients. The bigger problem, he argued, is that there’s no system of interventions in place if doctors do decide to report patients.

“We don’t force people into treatment for threats,” he said. Caplan recalled posing a hypothetical question to a Philadelphia police officer. Caplan asked what the officer would do if he called 911 and reported a neighbor who regularly frequented the area with a gun.

“When he shoots somebody ― call,” the officer replied.

John Moore via Getty Images Demonstrators promote New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's NY SAFE Act during a rally against gun violence on March 21, 2013 in New York City.

Angry men with guns are harder to disarm than people with mental illness.

Politicians and other public figures have frequently used mental health as a scapegoat for gun violence, simultaneously stigmatizing mental illness and damaging mental health care.

While mental health providers tend to agree that the mental health system is dysfunctional, identifying mental illness as the root of gun violence draws doctors and mental health experts into the conversation for the wrong reasons. The notion that we can prevent mass shootings by “fixing” mental health is an inaccurate representation of mental illness and a wildly ineffective gun violence prevention strategy.

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, New York State passed the NY SAFE Act to “stop criminals and the dangerously mentally ill from buying a gun,” according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).

In practice, the law requires medical doctors, registered nurses and mental health professional to report patients who have a mental health diagnosis and own a gun, and who are “likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others.” Some mental advocates have complained that the NY Safe Act violates HIPAA, while others believe it puts undue blame and stigma on those with mental illness, who are more likely be the victims of violent crime than to perpetuate it themselves.

“It was passed with some haste, in my opinion, without adequate input by the mental health community and specifically the New York State Office of Mental Health,” said Dr. James Knoll IV, director of forensic psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York."

“Ned’s Roach Away” has an innovative way to eliminate roaches: Arm the good roaches with teeny AR-15s to take out the bad ones.

“The only way to stop a bad roach is a good roach with a gun,” Barkley explains in the sketch. That’s the constant refrain from NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, heard most recently at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month: “To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.”

A horde of really bad roaches might require good bugs toting AR-15s with bumpstocks, notes Barkley’s Ned, who wears a cowboy hat.

Don’t worry, the armed roaches in “Ned’s Roach Away” are all “good character,” God-fearing bugs who regularly attend their tiny church. “And none of my roaches are gay,” says “Ned.”

Fans reactions were mixed on Twitter. Some found the sketch hilarious, while others thought it was insensitive so soon after the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.

The shooting, which took place around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, led to a frantic lockdown at Dalton High School. One student suffered a minor ankle injury while running down the halls, police said at a press conference.

Dalton police spokesman Bruce Frazier said the teacher, identified as social studies teacher Jesse Randal Davidson, 53, locked himself inside of the room and refused to allow students inside. “When the principal put a key in the door to try to unlock the classroom, Mr. Davidson apparently fired a shot from a handgun through an exterior window of the classroom. It does not appear that it was aimed at anybody,” Frazier said at a press conference.

UPDATE: The teacher is in custody. — Dalton Police (@DaltonPD) February 28, 2018

“Obviously at that point, [the principal] locked down the school, he called all the police in, the school resources in,” Frazier said.

Davidson faces charges of aggravated assault, carrying a weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of a gun during the commission of a crime, and disrupting public school, police tweeted.

School principal Steve Bartoo expressed surprise over Davidson’s behavior, describing him as an “excellent teacher” who loves his students.

“He said, ‘Don’t come in here. I have a gun,’” Bartoo recalled at an afternoon press conference. “It’s scary, real scary. It took me a moment to collect my thoughts after I heard the gunshot.”

Whitfield County Sheriffs Office Jesse Randal Davidson, 53, is facing a number of charges after accused of firing a gun inside of a high school classroom.

Bartoo said it took just a few minutes for law enforcement officers to arrive.

A school resource officer, who police initially said was on campus at the time of the shooting, was visiting the district’s junior high school and had to be called over. Bartoo said that officer, who police said is typically always at the high school during school hours, helped negotiate Davidson’s surrender.

“We’re very, very proud of this officer and everything that he did,” Bartoo said.

Police said they are still investigating a motive for the shooting.

“As far as I know, he was fit to be at work and I’m not aware of any depression,” Bartoo said when asked about Davidson’s mental health. Davidson has been employed by the school since 2004.

Dalton Assistant Police Chief Cliff Cason said his department had not had contact with Davidson prior to Wednesday’s event. Authorities said they are not aware of anything related to his personal life.

Jonathan Ernst / Reuters President Donald Trump last week met with survivors of this month's school shooting in Florida and suggested arming teachers and other faculty members to prevent such tragedies from happening again.

The frightening incident came the same day that classes resumed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a lone gunman killed 17 people two weeks ago.

It also followed heated debates on gun control across the country.

President Donald Trump, who met with survivors of the Parkland shooting last week, has suggested arming teachers and other faculty members to help prevent school shootings. As an incentive, he suggested giving faculty members extra pay if they agree to be trained to use firearms.

Trump repeated this idea during a meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday. He suggested hardening schools by “allowing people with a certified training, very talented people, to carry firearms.”

Florida’s House and Senate have also gotten behind the idea, with the state’s legislature advancing bills this week that would train teachers to carry guns in classrooms.

The idea of arming teachers and other faculty members to prevent school shootings led to renewed ridicule on social media following news of an armed teacher creating the kind of scare that the nation is trying to avoid.

They should arm the students to protect themselves from teachers. — Jawidi (@jawidi) February 28, 2018

@nra my favorite teacher at Dalton high school just blockaded his door and proceeded to shoot. We had to run out The back of the school in the rain. Students were being trampled and screaming. I dare you to tell me arming teachers will make us safe. — Chondi🌙 (@_omg_chondi_) February 28, 2018

Before the Revolutionary War, colonial Virginia passed a law barring black people from owning firearms — an exercise in gun control as racial control. In 1857, in his notorious Dred Scott decision, Chief Justice Roger Taney summoned the specter of black people freely enjoying the right to “keep and carry arms wherever they went.” Surely, he argued, the founders were not “so forgetful or regardless of their own safety” to permit such a thing. When black people armed themselves against white supremacist attacks following the Civil War, Southern state governments passed “black codes” barring them from owning guns. After the Black Panthers open carried to signal to California police officers that they would defend themselves against racial attacks in the late ’60s, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan signed a state ban on open carry into law.

In 2016, legal gun owner Philando Castile was shot after informing a Minnesota police officer that he was armed. Two years prior, Tamir Rice was killed by Cleveland police while holding a toy gun. John Crawford suffered the same fate in a Beavercreek, Ohio, Walmart.

So what does black gun ownership mean in a country so determined to keep its black populace unarmed? Since the 2016 election, interest in firearms has supposedly ticked upward in the black community. Gun shops and clubs link the interest to a desire for self-protection against the white supremacists emboldened by President Donald Trump’s election.

HuffPost spoke to 11 black gun owners about their reasons for owning a firearm. Trump was a non-factor. Instead, they talked about wanting to protect themselves out of fear that no one else would. They talked about their anxieties during interactions with the police and their complex views on gun regulation. Where gun advocates often adduce the imaginary heroics of a hypothetical active-shooter scenario to their arguments, the black gun owners we talked to referred to specific incidents, specific provocations — as if redlined, too, out of the fantasyland of American gun culture. And most of them returned to a sentiment as old as the nation itself: that owning firearms is a rebellion against a system bent on keeping them out of the hands of black folks.

The interviews have been condensed and edited for length and clarity.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost RJ Young, 30, poses with his handgun.

“I can’t view myself as just a gun owner. I have to view myself as a black gun owner.”

RJ Young, 30, Tulsa, Oklahoma

Young, a Ph.D. student at Oklahoma State, is writing a book called Let It Bang about his experiences as a black gun owner. He owns a Glock 17 9 mm and a Glock 26, which is his concealed carry weapon.

The first gun I ever touched was placed in my hand by my ex-father-in-law as a gesture of goodwill and good faith. He’s an old white man, and I was, at the time, dating his daughter. When he handed me this thing ― which I would come to find out was a Taurus judge, or a revolver you can cross-load with shotgun shells ― I was very scared to touch and hold it. It looked enormous, kind of like a Flaming Scimitar.

He was smiling about it. I thought that this was really weird at the time, like a scary “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.” And I found out later from my girlfriend, who’d eventually become my wife, that this was him saying: “Hi, I’m Charles. I’m a nice guy.”

He had guns around the house, and it wasn’t a big deal. There was another shotgun leaned up against the door. I asked him about the gun in his little fanny pack he carried around, and he went on for about an hour about this pistol. And I figured that was my in. So over a few years I got to know him through guns, and I got pretty good with them. I got a concealed carry license, and I ended up trying to figure out what it meant for me to have a gun as a black man. I slowly learned that we weren’t always allowed to have firearms. They were kept from us for a number of different reasons, but not the least of which is white folks feared violence from black people ― in particular black men. And I had this question in my head about whether or not I was safer if I had a gun knowing what had happened to Trayvon Martin and Walter Scott.

In the course of becoming an expert with a pistol, so much so the NRA certified me as a pistol instructor, I’ve come to find out that I’m not safer. In fact, I’m probably more likely to have harm done to me if I have a firearm on me because a cop stopping me is not the same as a cop stopping a white person. And I have a duty to inform any officer who stops me that I am carrying and that I have a permit for it. But how they react to that, I can’t say. And that scares me. So I would rather not have a firearm on me and give someone a reason, even in their minds, to shoot.

I believe in the right to carry a gun, so I own them, and they stay locked up. The ammunition stays in one room, and the firearm stays in the other. I go shoot from time to time to keep my skills and to keep my credentials, but I don’t carry one in public. For them to be for protection, they would have to be loaded. Even if I wanted to go get them from a closet, I don’t keep them loaded. I keep the slide lock open and a key lock through them. They’re paperweights in my house. If somebody broke into my place, either I’m going to let them do what they need to do and leave or I’m going to try to handle it with my hands.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost ""I believe in the right to carry a gun, so I own them, and they stay locked up. The ammunition stays in one room, and the firearm stays in the other,"" said RJ.

But the chances of someone breaking into my house are small. And if they broke in there, I want to believe that they believe they need something from me that would make them somehow feel whole or make them somehow get to a better place.

But if they shoot me or I shoot them, then nothing gets resolved. I’m just a cowboy who shot an outlaw. If that person is subdued or if I knock that person unconscious with one of the candle holders I keep around, and then that person is handcuffed and we go through this system of justice that we put into place; I feel much better about that. I don’t believe breaking into my house means that you need to die.

If I looked like Thor, I’d probably feel better about carrying a gun because the stigma is — I mean, I’m not just a black man. I’m a fit black man with, you know, 15 tattoos, sponge-brush hair and beard, and Malcolm X glasses, and I wear Jordans all the time.

If I could walk around Oklahoma and not count how many black folks were in the room, I’d probably feel better about firearms as a black man. I’d probably feel safer walking around with one. But the fact is, most people have a narrow view of who I am. I don’t get to wave my credentials in front of me and say, “Hey, master’s degree! Hey, Ph.D. student!” People have to take me as what they see, and they will immediately form an opinion about me. And most people who are white will have a bad opinion of me. That’s how I think this fits into my blackness. I can’t view myself as just a gun owner. I have to view myself as a black gun owner.

Ali Lapetina for HuffPost Courtney Cable was about 21 years old when she purchased her first gun.

“When you live in certain environments, you’re preconditioned to paranoia.”

Courtney Cable, 39, Detroit, Michigan

Cable works as a insurance sales agent. She owns a Smith & Wesson 9 mm.

I’ve lived in the inner city for years, and I’ve been a gun owner for over five years now. I don’t see anything wrong with it, to be honest. I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Sometimes I think we have post-traumatic stress. But we don’t know about these conditions that we live in. We just think this is the norm, and the norm is, you have to protect yourself before anyone else tries to harm you or rob you. You have that preconceived notion. You may not see it, but you’re living there. You know what goes on. You just have to protect yourself, pretty much, because everyone else probably has a gun.

My father was a gun collector, so he had Smith & Wessons. I was about 7 years old, and I had a stepfather who always had a gun in the home. And we knew not to touch it growing up. I got a little bit older, and my older brother had guns for protection because he was living not such a good life. Eventually, he ended up getting murdered in an act of gun violence. He was shot over 17 times.

If I’m going out any day or at night, I always carry it. If I’m coming in my house, I always have it out ready to walk into my home. You know, it’s just day to day.

I feel as though I’m more vulnerable than others. I’m an easy target. I feel like a lot of things do happen to females. I live alone so it’s just ― yeah, I’m an easy target, really. People watch you come and go, you know what I mean? And even though I’m 5’11”, that doesn’t mean anything. If people wanna target you, they’re going to watch your activities, who’s coming in and out of your home. Anybody could follow you. When you live in certain environments, you’re preconditioned to paranoia. It’s behaviors you don’t even know really exist. Even if I’m in a good neighborhood, I still have some of the same worries, though I’m probably not as alert as I am in other areas. For the most part, I’m watching my surroundings all the time.

I do feel safer with a firearm even though I’m still nervous, I’m scared, I’m afraid. When I am protected, and my gun is unlocked and loaded, I feel as though I have a chance. It’s either gonna be me or you ― and I can’t be afraid of whatever happens at that point.

Even though I’m a gun holder and I’m licensed to carry, being stopped by the police still worries me. It’s gotten to the point where I kind of don’t want to carry because it makes me more uneasy to drive while having my gun in my vehicle. For a while, I didn’t even carry it while driving ― whether I was out at a nightclub or whether I had a date. I didn’t even bother. I’d just take the chance because I was that afraid of the police.

Dustin Chambers for HuffPost Many of the gun owners spoke of their anxieties during interactions with the police and their complex views on gun regulation.

“I’m a guy who likes to do things by the book, and I want to be able to protect myself against people who don’t.”

Kendall Marr, 29, Topeka, Kansas

Marr works as a government spokesperson. He owns a SCCY 9 mm pistol and an AR-15 that he built himself.

I grew up in Texas. Guns are a part of life down there ― whether it be hunting or just going to the shooting range. It’s an everyday thing. I have guns because I enjoy shooting, and I also enjoy hunting. I’ve got family in Texas with a ranch, so I’m used to going out there and doing quite a bit of hunting.

My earliest experience with guns was growing up as a kid on a military base. You’d see people marching around the base with their M-16s, with the little orange or red plastic card in the tips. Both of my parents are in the military, so I saw weapons at home as well. My mom had a pink pistol as her side arm. Growing up with friends who wanted to hunt, we’d go out every now and then and do some shooting at the range or in the woods.

I was around 16 when I first shot a gun. I was at my buddy’s house and we’d gone out to his family’s ranch. They had shooting traps set up at 100 yards, 200 yards, 300 yards, and we’d put out pumpkins and watermelons and shoot them. This is how I found out that I like to shoot.

There are people who don’t have the right mindset to have handguns, people who aren’t responsible with guns. Those people shouldn’t have them. But, yes, I feel safer with a firearm. And changing the laws of what firearms you can carry isn’t going to change the mind of someone who wants to do something illegal. I’m a guy who likes to do things by the book, and I want to be able to protect myself against people who don’t.

I open carry but I don’t do it often. Being pulled over by the police is always a sticky situation in general. So when you’ve got a weapon with you, you’ve got to be prepared and extremely careful. You’re certainly more nervous. I haven’t been pulled over while I was carrying, but if I was, I would be extremely attentive. I’d have my hands on the wheel. I’d tell the officer I am carrying.

Caroline Yang for HuffPost Toria Boldware of Minneapolis, poses with ""Shelby,"" her Smith and Wesson .40-caliber Shield gun at her apartment in Minneapolis.

“Honestly, no, I know I’m not any safer.”

Toria C. Boldware, 39, Minneapolis, Minnesota

Boldware, a program assistant, owns a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson M&P Shield.

My grandfather was my first experience with guns. I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, and I grew up seeing him with rifles. They were just a part of life. They weren’t anything abnormal to me. I remember being in the country ― you can’t do this in the city limits ― and on New Year’s Eve, he would go out at midnight and shoot the gun off. And that was the highlight of New Year’s for me, seeing him go out and shoot his gun. I was in elementary school, and it was so cool. It stuck with me so much. And I never got that misconstrued. I didn’t think that guns were “so cool,” but this one act was just neat for me. It’s a regional, Southern, old way of life — I mean, I hope people still don’t shoot into the air on New Year’s. Looking back on it, that was dumb.

I purchased my first firearm in North Carolina, around 2005. I was about 26 or 27. It was a small .25 handgun that could fit in my purse. That .25 ended up being stolen, and I didn’t get another one for a while after that. But I would still go to the range every Friday. Friday was like date night at the range. The initial plan was for me to have a concealed carry permit, so I wanted something that was small that I could stick in my purse or keep in my glove compartment. Something that was easily accessible in the event that I needed it.

I moved shortly after the Philando Castile incident. Do I feel safer? It’s a mental thing. In my head I feel like I’m safer. But honestly, no, I know I’m not any safer. I keep my gun locked up. Getting to it is not going to be as easy as one would think. It’s not on my hip. This isn’t the movies. I don’t have it just ready to go. As far as driving around with it, I keep it locked up in my trunk. And the key is not usually with me.

I’m not as fearful as some of the recent shootings and incidents should make me feel. I’m not too terrified, and if I got pulled over, I wouldn’t even let them know I had a firearm since the gun would likely be in my trunk. I wouldn’t have access to it like I would if it were in the car beside me.

I am a Southern liberal. I’m not anti-gun, but I’m not regulation for all. I believe in responsible gun ownership. Because I’m a Southern liberal, I’m like, don’t take my gun. But don’t let people who don’t need to have guns have guns. I know the Second Amendment was created when we were shooting muskets and trying to keep redcoats from coming to take America. But things were different then. And I don’t cling to that as a crutch for having a gun. I know how I grew up. I know that I grew up with guns in my life. And I know that having them safely and the right people having them are OK.

Michael Starghill for HuffPost Thomas Moore poses for a portrait in his home with his LWRC .223/.556 MS Rifle with EOTech sights in Houston, Texas.

“I’ve rarely seen a situation where a firearm made it better.”

Thomas Moore, 35, Houston, Texas

Moore is a control systems engineer. He owns an American Derringer M1 .357 Magnum, a Derringer .38 Special, a .40-caliber Springfield XD, a Taurus Judge revolver, a Smith & Wesson Bodyguard .380 pistol and a LWRC .223/.556 M6 rifle with EOTech sights.

When I first moved down to Houston, I was 23 years old, and I would go in the house and not lock my door. And a guy came in my house in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. He was standing in my doorway looking at me, and I had nothing around me to defend myself with. After that, I went a bought a shotgun.

I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, and I had a bunch of buddies who banged and lived that kind of life. So my first experience with guns was from being around them. I’d never touch them, but I’d be around while they were shooting at the ground and acting stupid. I’ve been mugged before. I had a guy steal my bike with a pistol.

I also had a gentleman offer me an Uzi machine gun when I was 16. Me and my buddies were outside, just hanging on the corner. And this one guy comes up and he’s like, “You wanna buy a gun?” I’m curious, so I say, “What you got?” He pulls out an Uzi ― in the box and everything ― and says, “I’ll give it to you for $125 bucks.” I’m 16. I don’t have $125 to spare.

I don’t feel safer with a gun. I used to, but over the years my thought process on guns has changed. If someone comes and pulls a gun on you, you’re not gonna pull your gun out. I have a concealed carry license, but they teach you to remove yourself from situations before you have to use your weapon. Things happen in the blink of an eye. I’ve been in situations where my gun probably could have helped me, but I never even thought about grabbing it. I’ve also been in situations where me having a gun could have escalated the situation.

Michael Starghill for HuffPost Moore, shown here with his gun collection, says he doesn't feel any safer with a gun.

One time I was out with a friend at an after-hours club, and we got into an argument. This gentleman decided he wanted to step in. So I’m telling him, “Look, I don’t know you, and you don’t know me.” I guess he took that the wrong way, and he starts reaching for his hip, saying, “You don’t know me either.” It’s clear he had a firearm. If I reach in my pocket for my firearm, that’s where it could have gone wrong. I just walked away and left it alone.

I’ve been pulled over a few times, and it’s never been a problem for me. When you get pulled over, you have to hand them both of your licenses, and you have to tell them that you have a firearm and where it’s at. But with all the recent shootings, I am a little bit more leery now about police.

The older I get, the more my stance changes on firearms. I do believe that people should have one in their homes. But I’ve rarely seen a situation where a firearm made it better.

Down here in Texas, we can open carry. I did it one time, but I felt like the biggest jackass on Earth. It makes people uncomfortable, and it really doesn’t serve a purpose to let someone know you have a gun. And with all the recent shootings, that could have gone bad for me, too ― like the guy who got killed in Walmart for having a toy rifle. Or Tamir Rice. It’s things like that that make me feel like the laws aren’t really equal. I’ve not personally had a problem, but that doesn’t mean that that problem doesn’t exist.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Carlton LeFlore poses with an Armalite AR-10 rifle at his home in Orlando, Florida.

“I have a hammer for my home improvement. I have my gun for self-protection. They’re just tools to me.”

Carlton LeFlore, 30, Winter Garden, Florida

LeFlore works as an armed security guard, most recently for an abortion clinic. He owns a total of 18 guns, including four assault weapons. His assortment of tactical weapons includes a number of different brands ― mostly Glocks, Smith & Wessons and Springfields. LeFlore also has a variety of gun types, including semi-automatic and bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, revolvers and several semi-automatic handguns.

I grew up in one of the toughest neighborhoods in Miami: Liberty City. Violence and stuff like that was part of our everyday lives.

I always had a love affair with guns. I wanted to be a police officer. I always wanted to be a cop when playing cops and robbers with my friends. I bought water guns and toy guns. But I was always told that guns were bad. You shouldn’t have a gun, you shouldn’t own a gun ― especially for a young black male, you shouldn’t own a gun because you’ll be looked at as a thug, a criminal or a gangster. And, at first, I didn’t really want to own a gun. I thought that you should own a gun for self-protection, and at that time I didn’t feel like I was in any danger, even growing up in a bad neighborhood. As I got older, I started trying to understand the gun world. I’m a security officer now. I’ve had to incorporate guns into my work life.

In 2009, I bought my first gun. It was a shotgun. I started to see on the news that there were a number of home invasions happening around our city. That motivated me enough to get a gun at least for home protection. I started doing my research to see what was the best shotgun, the laws of the state, the laws of the city and what my Second Amendment rights were in regards to self-defense.

I’ve done armed security work, most recently for an abortion clinic. Every day, the clinic would get protesters ― religious fanatics or people who are just strictly against abortion ― so they needed security in order to protect the patients who visited the clinic. I was like the Secret Service for the doctor. He was the main priority. The clinic was located in a very conservative part of town. The clinic had gotten threats before ― people calling up threatening to blow up the clinic, to kill the doctors and stuff like that. I’ve even had protesters who were armed themselves show me their gun. They didn’t threaten me, but they were like, “I keep this for my protection.”

I always tell people who are thinking about getting into gun ownership that a gun is not an end-all, be-all. There’s a 50-50 chance that you can still die or perish at the hands of somebody else with a gun or a knife or a car or any other weapon. But it’s that 50 percent chance that I will take over a 100 percent chance of not being able to defend myself. I think what people don’t understand about guns is that if you practice responsible gun ownership, meaning that you follow the rules of gun safety ― keep your finger off the trigger, always treat your gun like it’s loaded, keep it pointed downrange at the shooting range and don’t point your gun at anything you’re not willing to destroy ― you won’t have accidents.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost LeFlore, who works as an unarmed security guard, is an avid gun collector.

I feel a lot safer than I did when I wasn’t a gun owner. When I wasn’t a gun owner, I used to fear leaving my house at night. I was living in a bad neighborhood, and you never know what people might do to you. I would wear jewelry or some expensive shoes and fear that somebody might rob me. I don’t want to have to shoot anyone. I would never want to use my gun on someone. It’s really a precaution, a way of being prepared in case someone wants to harm me. We live in a world where it’s becoming less and less safe.

I conceal carry. I’ve been stopped by police on three separate occasions ― two last year and once in 2015. When I was pulled over, it was a similar to the Philando Castile situation. I was with my cousin, but my gun was in the glove compartment. I was sitting in the passenger seat, and they stopped us because the headlight was out. They asked her for her license and registration. Now her registration was in the glove compartment with the gun. I told the officer that there’s a gun in the car ― which you don’t have to do in Florida. I just volunteered the information because I wanted to keep everyone safe. I told him the gun was in the glove compartment. He told me not to reach for it, and I complied. He ran my name, he asked me about the gun and if I had a concealed weapons license. I told him yeah. In Florida, if you’re traveling with a gun, it either has to be in a holster on you or in a locked box or in a glove compartment. Once he ran our names and everything came back good, he just sent us on our way.

I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with police, regarding me having a gun. Now being black, I am conscious of how I could get one of those police officers we’ve been hearing about on the news who treat this as a hostile situation. But I try to take extra precaution with the police to make it out the situation alive. I’m not saying every police officer is good and is going to treat me like those three separate occasions where I was pulled over ― now and then you will get one that is a little overzealous and doesn’t know the law. If they can’t see your hands, and they know you got a gun, then they probably will be a little bit uncomfortable.

Guns should be used only as a self-defense tool. I have a hammer for my home improvement. I have my gun for self-protection. They’re just tools to me. I don’t give them any power other than that. And I feel like most people give the gun so much power, but the gun can’t pull the trigger itself.

“I don’t give a fuck who they meant the Second Amendment for. It’s mine now.”

Maj Toure, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Toure, who declined to give his age, is an activist and entrepreneur who founded Black Guns Matter. He never discusses what firearms he owns.

My introduction was from a well-balanced perspective. Guys in my neighborhood would get drunk and shoot their guns into the air on New Year’s Eve. Bullets come down though, number one. Number two, you’re wasting ammo. And number three, that’s just not responsible. I had uncles who were in Desert Storm, I got uncles who were in Vietnam. And seeing their understanding of firearms and how they carried themselves, I immediately had what to do and what not to do.

Firearms are just as normal as your cell phone. You don’t drop your cell phone in water. You have a lock on your phone. It’s very private. It’s yours. You know how to operate it. It’s like a car. When you first start driving, you don’t know what the hell you’re doing. Then you start paying attention, being observant, looking around and being a responsible driver. Get drunk and shooting your gun is the same as getting drunk and driving. The difference is one is a right. A human right. One is a privilege.

I’m very careful in certain places now because you can’t carry. Black Guns Matter is doing trainings in different cities. And there are different rules for different states. So in some places I may not be able to lawfully carry, and I have to be mindful of that. That’s part of the responsibility.

We give classes free to all on firearm safety, on knowing the law, on how to apply state laws and for different permits, how to get a license to carry in your particular town, who are some trainers that you can work with. We work with trainers locally for whatever city, lawyers that know firearm laws, the Sanskrit, the basics, conflict resolution, de-escalation tactics. We give lessons on basics, so in essence it’s a class on the Second Amendment, on human rights, on civics, firearm safety and the cultural differences between communities.



And that’s to put people on the path to good citizenship. When you start paying attention to the Second Amendment, you start having more of a value for all of the other amendments. That creates good citizens: people who are politically active, who are going to their school board meetings, who are seeing what’s up with budgets, talking to their city councils, talking to their state representatives. We’re getting them involved politically on most angles.



America would not have even been created without firearms. Some people say it’s a contradiction for me as an African-American man to have a position: “When they wrote the Second Amendment, they didn’t mean it for you.” I don’t give a fuck who they meant it for. It’s mine now.

Dustin Chambers for HuffPost David White poses for a photo with his handgun in his home in Atlanta. He is a recent first-time gun owner.

“I am not worried about my interactions with the police.”

David White, 29, Atlanta, Georgia

White, a sales executive, only owns one gun ― a Glock 9 mm ― but has plans to buy more firearms in the future.

I remember like it was yesterday. I was with my best friend ― who’s now been my best friend for 23 years. His stepdad was drunk. We had just come in from playing basketball and his gun was on the kitchen table. We were just staring at it. And my best friend said, “That’s my stepdad’s gun. Don’t touch it.”

His stepdad came around the corner, stumbling, and just started hollering at us. He wasn’t upset or angry, but just realizing that he left the gun on the table and that he probably shouldn’t have. But he took it as an opportunity to talk shit to us, tell us about his background in the military and how experienced he was with guns. He asked us if we wanted to know a little bit more about the gun. And we said hell yeah. We were, what, 13- or 14-year-old black males in Atlanta. So he took us through what this part was, what that part was and how to load and unload it. He took the bullets out and let us practice ourselves.



I’m a new gun owner. I purchased my first firearm in late September. I wasn’t really looking to purchase a gun until I became a homeowner. And I started feeling more strongly as the months went by that I needed to be able to protect my home if I had to.



Having a firearm in the house is definitely an adjustment. I mean, it’s a weird type of feeling and experience. I don’t have any kids yet, but I’m constantly thinking about ― when we do have kids or when minors are in our house visiting ― where am I keeping the gun, how is it locked and safely put away. I feel a little bit more comfortable now knowing that if I hear something outside at night or if I hear gunshots at not a too far distance, I’m not going to feel vulnerable or completely at the whim or mercy of someone potentially running inside my home and having their way with my family. It’s a little bit easier to sleep at night.

Dustin Chambers for HuffPost White says he intends to openly carry his handgun.

I intend to open carry, because it’s a right. It’s an American right. Even though I don’t feel like the right is applied equally, I know it’s an American right. And I feel like I should be able to do it. ― not only to protect myself but also to protect, potentially, the lives of others in the rare situation that I could find myself positioned to do so. It’s not even just thinking about me, because I know I’m a healthy and physically able person. If I’m ever in a position where I can help or protect someone else, I’d want to be able to do that and not feel helpless.

I am not worried about my interactions with the police ― and I know that’s probably startling to hear given some of the recent events in our country. I’ve had some rough experiences with the police, but I feel like I know how to disarm a situation verbally, and I’m willing to do whatever is necessary to ease that situation. And I’m very keen on reading people.

Now, you flip that and talk about me potentially running into an officer while I have a weapon on me? That’s something that I haven’t really wrapped my mind around yet ― and I probably do need to do some thinking and talking out with my wife as to how to approach that situation.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost Increased interest in firearms within the black community has been attributed to a desire for self-protection against emboldened white supremacists.

“I worry about the repercussions of the wrong approach.”

David Cain, 33, Tampa, Florida

Cain, who works in the tech industry, owns an AR-15, a shotgun, a Glock, a Smith & Wesson and a Taurus Judge.

Previously, I was an active-duty Marine. I deployed in 2006, and that is how I got into firearms in general. I grew up with no firearms, but being in the military, you get accustomed to being around them. And I shoot purely for fun. I go to the range and I shoot a few different weapons.

I don’t have any childhood experiences with guns. My parents were pretty anti-gun to the point where we couldn’t even have toy guns. So I didn’t have any gun of any type growing up. When my grandfather passed away, I think I was 19 and my mom gave me his shotgun. I don’t really know how that transition happened. I think she didn’t know what else to do with it, so she gave it to me.



I grew up in the country in Michigan. So I took my grandfather’s gun to a friend’s house, and we shot in the backyard. And it actually jammed the second time I shot it, and I never got it fixed. I don’t think it had been oiled for however long it had been sitting in my grandfather’s closet. I ended up selling it because I couldn’t figure out how to fix it. I was young. I didn’t have the money to pay for a gunsmith at the time.

I carry almost everywhere I go, and when I’m carrying, I feel safer with it because I know what my training is. I feel confident enough that if I needed to, I could use it. Of course I would hope that never happens. But I do feel safer having the ability to defend myself and my kids. I don’t carry when I go to pick up my kids from school or things like that, because obviously you can’t have guns in school zones. There are some limitations to what I can do, but if I’m able to carry in that location, then I carry.

I have been fortunate enough to not have any interactions with the police but I worry about it daily. I almost bought a dash camera just to make sure that any action I take is recorded. I mean, I have friends who are police officers. I just try my best to make sure everyone’s at ease. But it hasn’t happened to me yet. I haven’t been pulled over while carrying. I just worry that, when you tell someone you have a weapon, you’re bringing their alert level higher. And my understanding of Florida law is that you don’t have to declare that you have a weapon on you. But I don’t know why you wouldn’t. I worry about if I didn’t tell them and they saw it or if I told them and then they felt more threatened. I mean, what’s the right approach? And I worry about the repercussions of the wrong approach.

My wife isn’t comfortable with guns. I have a safe, and I have to keep everything in the safe. And that’s just how it is. She’s nervous because we have small children. I have a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old, so you just want to make sure that the guns are always secured and unloaded. And I believe that children should know that they exist so that curiosity isn’t there. I’ve explained to the oldest one that they shouldn’t touch them. The youngest one is aware of them, but they’re in a safe. She can’t get to them. When she’s about 5, I’ll probably talk to her about them, too, and I plan on having my kids shoot when they’re about 10 or 11 just so they understand how a gun operates. Maybe it’ll scare them into not liking them or maybe it will take their interest. But either way, I want to make sure that I know their level of interest, that I can gauge that and see how to handle it.

That’s an important conversation that every gun owner has to have with their children. We try to be vigilant, but, unfortunately, access can happen. You forget to close the safe all the way or a kid can hit it with a hammer and it bumps open ― anything can happen. Who knows? But it’s better to have the conversation.

Allison V Smith for HuffPost Rodney Jackson holds one of his guns at his home in Plano, Texas.

“Anyone who wasn’t white and who had a weapon was considered a thug.”

Rodney Jackson, 46, Plano, Texas

Jackson works in IT security. He owns several handguns. He has two Springfields: the classic 1911 .45-caliber and a 9 millimeter. He also owns a Sig Sauer 9 mm and a Kimber 1911. He bought his wife a Sig Sauer P238 .380-caliber firearm.

I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, in the inner city. And during that time there was a lot of violence. I never was part of it. I was always a school boy. And then I attended college with a bunch of my friends who were like me, about 50 miles north. And that was our first interaction with another race, with white folks. I started learning that a lot of them believed in carrying guns, and I thought it was, at the time, just a gang activity. But I learned that a lot of folks go out and hunt, and they collect guns for a variety of reasons.

After I left college, I moved to Texas, and here, everybody has a gun. Everybody has a concealed carry handgun license. But I noticed that not many people who look like me had a concealed carry license. So at that point, I said, “How about if I get a gun and start using it, practicing, going to a range and so forth, and then look into getting a concealed carry license?” And I did that.

I just wanted to exercise my right. It was almost like I was witnessing people ― when I say people, I mean white Americans ― exercise theirs, but they didn’t want us to carry. Anyone who wasn’t white and who had a weapon was considered a thug. I wasn’t a thug. So I was gonna get one, and I was going to go through the proper classes and safely learn how to use it.

When I first visited a gun show I saw that it really wasn’t that many black people there at all. So I felt good about my decision, and I wanted to try to encourage more people to do it, too. And that’s how come I still, to this day, collect weapons and continue to motivate people to get their carry license.



I pitch potential black gun owners on the safety aspect and that it is actually our right to be able to carry a weapon because of the Second Amendment. I think we should practice all of our rights. They would prefer if you don’t have one for that reason alone. It’s almost like a rebellious type of front that I come at them from. Why wouldn’t you want to carry one?



When I first got the weapon, I was really into it. I was going to the range several times a week, and I really wanted to be a proficient shooter. And what I noticed is that I started feeling uncomfortable because it was all whites there, and they had all sorts of weapons ― like weapons that you just wouldn’t hunt with, but military-style weapons that they would practice with.



One day at the range, I decided I was going to change out a sight on one of my weapons. I went to the gunsmith, and while I was waiting, these white guys came up. One guy said to Joe the gunsmith: “Joe, I want you to meet my friend Mark. Mark, Joe is the best gunsmith in Texas. When Armageddon comes, I got a compound in East Texas. I’m getting Joe, and we gonna live on our compound and we gonna defend ourselves because Armageddon is coming and we’re going to take this place back.”

He said it right there in front of me, and that just made me feel like they’re gearing up for something, whether it’s going to come to fruition or not. And it made me want to always protect myself, always carry, always have something on me.



But I don’t feel safer with a gun. Here’s why: It’s almost like a fight. If you don’t pull yours first, you almost stand no chance. If you get hit first, you really stand no chance after that. Somewhat I feel safer. But, you know, if I’m at a gas station and someone is determined to rob me, I don’t really stand a chance against them. However, if I’m somewhere where there are a lot of people, and something breaks out, and it’s is not directed at me, I stand a better chance with a weapon of getting out of there.



There’ve been a couple times I’ve been pulled over, and, in carry class, they teach you how to handle a traffic stop. I always have my hands outside the car ― and I was taught that at a very young age. So when the officer comes up, I have my driver’s license and insurance card in my hand. Although I know now they don’t really need the insurance card ― they can look it up ― I still have it ready because I don’t want to reach in my glove box even though the weapon is not there. It’s normally on my person.

Allison V Smith for HuffPost ""I don’t feel safer with a gun. Here’s why: It’s almost like a fight. If you don’t pull yours first, you almost stand no chance,"" said Jackson.

When I have my hands out, when he sees the carry license, the first thing he asks is, “Are you carrying?” I hate that question. Because I don’t see what the purpose of the question is. If I say no, is that going to take you off guard? If I say yes, is that going to make you more on guard? So I’d prefer you don’t ask the question. If I gave you the carry permit, just assume I have it. If I have a carry permit, that means I went through all the background checks.



But I did have a friend ― a white friend ― and we were at QuikTrip. He was carrying. We were in line and there was a police officer in line as well. As we’re leaving, my friend, the officer stopped my friend and said, “You have a permit for that?” Now I don’t know how the officer saw it, because my friend had a shirt covering it. But I guess the gun was bulging out.

My friend said yes, and the cop said, “That’s what I thought,” walked away and let him go. I just found that to be interesting. I don’t think the officer would have assumed I had a permit. I don’t think he would have let me go just by saying I had a permit. And sometimes, I want to test it. I know I’m putting my life in jeopardy if I do it, but sometimes when I see police inside QuikTrip, I say, “I should carry in here just to see.”



This is what I really believe: If more of us actually got carry permits, I think they’d change the law. I really do. I think that would be the fastest way of getting more gun control. I joined the NRA when I first got my weapon. And I will never rejoin because the NRA doesn’t protect African-Americans who actually have their carry permit and did it the legal way.

“Police shootings are a factor and they have to be.”

James, 42, Western Pennsylvania

James, who asked to use a pseudonym for privacy reasons, is an educator. He owns a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun and a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson M&P compact handgun.

I’ve been around them all my life. The first firearm that I purchased was at the age of 22, 23. Up until then, I had always borrowed a firearm to go out and hunt. I hunted as a kid, and that’s how I got involved with firearms. Around 30, I got a handgun. But other than that, it’s been a shotgun or a rifle for sport.

As a teenager, I took a hunter’s safety course. That was the start. I didn’t get into yearly hunting until I started working a full-time job.

I wanted to carry for protection, obviously. Once I moved out on my own and was living in different areas, that was a form of home defense. Once I had a family, that was something we kept in the house until the boys were old enough that I didn’t want that around them. My oldest boy is 12. I haven’t hunted in years. We choose not to keep the rifle in the house. We keep it in another location.

He’s 12 now. He’s of age to where he wants to shoot but it’s going to be a process of taking him out to do that. I hate to use other events to shape how we parent, but he will learn the safety of it, he will get involved with it, but it isn’t the time to do that. We’re going to wait until he’s a little bit older before he takes the hunter’s safety course. But he will be taught the proper way to handle a gun.

He has two brothers who are a little bit younger than him. And it doesn’t take much. He’s seen what goes on and that’s why I no longer even think about applying for the concealed carry permit. Here in Pennsylvania, it used to be you’d go to the sheriff’s office, they’d take care of it, and that was it. But I will not carry a weapon on me even with a permit. That’s a safety issue. I know people who do, but that will not be me ― especially being African-American.

I hate to say that, but police shootings are a factor and they have to be. It’s not unheard of for kids to be outside with their NERF guns or paintball guns. However, we have specific rules. If you’re going to play with these, you have to be in the back of the house. We have to have that talk. You’re not walking around. You’re not going off the property or from our area with that. Someone may mistake the toy gun for something else, and something bad can happen. I hate for it to be that way, but that’s the nature of it.

When my boys have a home of their own, if they choose to own a gun and use it for sport, that will be fine. I have no issue with that whatsoever. But in no way do I want them to have their carry permit. That is not something I would like them to do at all.

Being in an area where it’s predominantly white, and going to some of these different places to shoot my shotgun, it gets uncomfortable at times. And some of my co-workers say they’re going out to shoot clay pigeons or whatever ― and that’s fine. But you gotta tell me about this area you’re taking me into. They’ve been great friends of mine. So they wouldn’t be involved in an area where my race would be an issue. But it’s always there when you talk about guns.

I haven’t been in any of those situations, but people from outside of my circle would look at me a little bit different. If you’re outside of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia can be anywhere down South. You go into one of these gun shops, or anywhere to shoot, and you’re likely to see Confederate flags. It’s pretty common.

I don’t feel safer with a firearm. A lot of people carry it for their own personal protection, but that’s not me any longer. I don’t feel that that’s going to save me one way or the other. There are other ways for me to get out of a situation. I think a gun might be more of an issue."
huffpo67,huffpo,"['Jonathan Cohn', 'Senior National Correspondent']",2018-02-24 08:01:13-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-control-policy_us_5a8f728fe4b03b55731a60af,"A serious debate over gun policy is underway in the aftermath of last week’s massacre in Florida, and one focus is the federal background check system ― a system that has existed for 20 years but which, by almost all accounts, isn’t doing enough to deter would-be killers from buying firearms.

In theory, almost everybody in Washington wants to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, as it’s known. That includes top Republicans, even though they have historically resisted or opposed efforts to control or limit gun access. It even includes President Donald Trump, who on Thursday tweeted support for improving background checks and on Friday said the same thing while answering press questions at the White House.

These vows may be meaningless. Recent history is littered with instances of Republicans dropping support for gun legislation as soon as public interest wanes. As for Trump, his own budget proposal, released earlier this month, proposed cutting funds for the background check system. It’s anybody’s guess whether Trump even understands the promise he has been making over the past few days, let alone whether he intends to keep it.

But if the student-led movement for stronger gun policies doesn’t let up, Trump and his allies may not be able to let go of this idea so easily. They might even decide that the political consequences of inaction are too serious to risk, that some kind of legislation on background checks is necessary.

The question, then, would be what kind of legislation.

On Capitol Hill, the current debate over background checks is focused on two very different proposals. One is an anodyne bill to shore up the existing system by feeding it information in a more timely and consistent fashion. The other is a more sweeping proposal to expand the reach of background checks so they include all sales, not just those that take place through officially licensed dealers.

But there’s another, even more ambitious idea out there ― one that Congress isn’t seriously considering now but that, according to many advocates and experts, could have a bigger impact. It’s a call for requiring would-be gun purchasers to first obtain licenses, which the government would grant only for people who go through a protracted process.

The process could entail any number of steps, but in the most ambitious versions it would include completing a gun safety course, paying registration fees, providing character references, and applying in person to local law enforcement. The goal is to reduce all kinds of firearm violence, including the everyday acts of homicide and suicide that account for the vast majority of this country’s gun deaths.

It might sound like a crazy idea wildly out of step with current practice. It’s not.

A dozen states plus the District of Columbia already have some kind of licensing program in place. There’s good reason to think these systems are having at least a mild impact in those places, and that they’d do a lot more if they existed nationwide. That’s especially true if licensing were part of a broader strategy that included bans on assault-style weapons, temporary restraining orders against gun ownership for people who pose likely threats, and other restrictions.

The Debate Taking Place Is About Background Checks

The existing background check system falls well short of such a licensing requirement. It is simply a mechanism for making sure prospective gun purchasers don’t have past convictions for serious criminal charges or domestic violence, prior judicial findings that the buyer was mentally unfit, or a handful of other conditions that, by law, would make somebody ineligible to own a gun.

But the system is only as good as the information it gets from states and other government agencies ― a weakness that became apparent after last year’s mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Years earlier, an Air Force court martial had convicted the killer, Devin Patrick Kelley, on a domestic assault charge. The Air Force failed to forward that information to NICS. If it had, Kelley would not have been able to obtain the guns he used in the massacre ― at least, not without violating the law.

A new bill would seek to fix that problem, by holding federal agencies to higher standards for supplying information and providing states with financial incentives to improve their reporting. The version in the Senate has as its chief sponsors John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). The idea generally enjoys bipartisan support, although Democrats are unlikely to go along with concessions on gun policy (like undermining state concealed carry laws) that House Republicans are demanding.

Whatever the bill’s ultimate legislative fate, Murphy himself has made clear that it is not enough. To really reduce gun violence, he says, Congress has to go a lot further ― at the very least, extending background checks to cover those private transactions, many of which take place at gun shows. (That’s why it’s come to be known as the “gun show loophole.”)

To put it plain terms, somebody with a domestic violence conviction, though legally prohibited from owning a firearm, can today get one by going through a private seller online or in person. Exactly how many sales take place through private channels is the subject of some debate. Research suggests it’s anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of the total, which, very roughly, means that at least 6 million sales a year ― and probably quite a few more ― involve buyers who haven’t passed a background check.

Closing the gun show loophole was a major focus of the legislative effort President Barack Obama led in 2013 following the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. That effort failed when a bill from Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) fell six votes short of the 60 it needed to pass that chamber. Murphy has a new bill calling for universal background checks and the idea seems, if anything, more popular than ever. Ninety-seven percent of Americans support it, according to one recent poll. It remains to be seen whether it will get a serious hearing in the Senate, to say nothing of the House.

The Debate Not Taking Place Is About Licensing

Critics of universal background checks note that the system fails to stop many killers, including confessed Florida shooter Nikolas Cruz, who obtained his firearms legally through a licensed dealer near his house. Advocates and experts acknowledge as much. But they say that’s an argument for imposing a licensing system that would subject prospective buyers to a longer, more thorough vetting process ― in a sense, demanding of gun owners something like what the government already demands of automobile owners.

Twelve states plus the District of Columbia have some kind of gun licensing in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The details differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, particularly when it comes to the kinds of gun purchases that require licenses, but they mostly include a few common elements: requiring the licensees to take a gun safety course, pay a fee, and wait for some period to get the license. Some states go beyond that. They require prospective buyers to obtain licenses in person, either from police or local officials, or supply fingerprints.

Typically licensing involves a more rigorous background check than the one federal law requires. The most aggressive states, like Massachusetts, require applicants to state their reasons for wanting guns, and give law enforcement officials discretion to deny a license if they believe an applicant poses a threat to public safety, even if nothing in the applicant’s history violates a specific prohibition. Applicants always have the right to appeal such denials and, ultimately, the vast majority of people applying for licenses get them.

Does licensing make a difference? Studies of several states by Daniel Webster, a widely cited professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, concluded that taking away licensing (as Missouri did) increases gun violence, while adding licensing (as Connecticut and Maryland did) reduces it. Webster told HuffPost he thinks “you could have much lower death rates” if licensing existed in every state alongside bans on high-capacity magazines and other firearm regulations. And he is by no means alone. In a survey of experts The New York Times conducted a year ago, licensing requirements were among the options they felt most likely to reduce firearm deaths.

The research on licensing has both its limits and its skeptics. (Conservative writer Robert VerBruggen, for example, has criticized Webster's Connecticut study.) When looking at the U.S., scholars must extrapolate from a relatively small set of states that have modified their laws in the last few years. The data is limited, and funding for more labor-intensive work, like sifting through police records on paper, is usually hard to find.

Still, anecdotal evidence, like interviews with criminals who say guns have become harder to get, supports the conclusion that licensing ultimately reduces violence. And then there’s all the research comparing the U.S. and other countries, showing pretty conclusively, as Vox’s German Lopez has argued, that by restricting access to guns, those countries have reduced gun violence and gun deaths."
huffpo68,huffpo,"['Chelsea Kiene', 'Senior Media Coordinator', 'Center For American Progress']",2013-01-25 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/25/firearms-freedom-act_n_2552385.html,"As the federal government begins its dive into the gun debate, GOP lawmakers across the country are introducing preemptive measures that seek to make those hypothetical future federal firearms restrictions unenforceable in their states.

Republican lawmakers in Arizona, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington state have all sponsored legislation this month prohibiting the enforcement of federal laws and regulations on firearms, ammunition and firearms accessories produced and sold within their state.

In Michigan, 13 GOP state senators have introduced the Michigan Firearms Freedom Act to protect Michigan gun and ammunition manufacturers from federal regulation. The bill passed the state Senate Judiciary Committee in a 3-1 party-line vote Wednesday, which means it will now receive a full vote on the Senate floor.

Sen. Steve Bieda (D-Warren), the only “no” vote on the committee, is concerned that the bill acts too soon and poses serious constitutional issues.

""The [new] federal regulations or laws aren't even out there yet,"" Bieda told the Detroit News. ""I feel like we're buying a lawsuit without even knowing what the lawsuit is for.""

Yet since 2009, legislators in at least 21 states have introduced their own version of the Firearms Freedom Act, arguing that the Ninth and 10th Amendments allow the states to treat the sale of firearms, ammunition and accessories as intrastate commerce, thus freeing those sales from federal oversight.

""The regulation of intrastate commerce is vested in the states,"" the Michigan bill reads. ""Congress has not expressly preempted state regulation of intrastate commerce pertaining to the manufacture on an intrastate basis of firearms, firearms accessories, and ammunition.""

Some states have taken their legislation a step further, threatening either monetary fines or imprisonment for any federal official who enforces federal gun laws within the states’ boundaries.

Arizona had already passed a measure to ward off federal gun restrictions on firearms sold and kept in the state in 2010, Now, a new bill proposed this month threatens to classify federal officials who enforce federal gun laws as Arizona Class 6 felons. Although this is the state's least severe felony classification, it can still lead to jail time for those convicted.

Similarly, Washington state's proposed Firearms Freedom Act could impose a penalty of five years' imprisonment or a $10,000 fine on federal employees enforcing federal gun laws and regulations.

One local government has also joined the fight against federal gun restrictions. The Franklin County Commission in southeastern Indiana unanimously passed an ordinance Tuesday excluding the county from any past, present or future federal laws pertaining to gun control.

""I think it's time to express our feelings,"" Franklin County Commissioner Tom Wilson said in an interview with the Connersville News-Examiner. ""It has to do with our Second Amendment, guns, gun control and infringement on our right to keep and bear arms.""

Although the latest bills may or may not gain enough traction to become law, eight states -- Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming -- have already passed versions of the Firearms Freedom Act. Unlike the current proposed measures, these laws were passed in 2009 and 2010, before the new gun control efforts inspired by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence made the constitutional argument against the Firearms Freedom Act -- and its interstate/intrastate distinction -- in a May 2010 court filing over the Montana version of the law. The center wrote, ""The Commerce Clause grants the federal government authority to regulate firearms because such weapons are easily and frequently sold and traded across state lines and used in crimes that affect commerce.""

The case of Montana Shooting Sports Foundation v. Holder is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit."
huffpo69,huffpo,"['Melissa Jeltsen', 'Senior Reporter']",2017-09-18 17:01:15-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/domestic-abusers-guns_us_59bfeba2e4b0edff971df198,"State laws that require people subject to domestic violence restraining orders to hand over their guns could save lives, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday.

Under federal law, individuals who are subject to permanent domestic violence restraining orders are banned from owning guns, and more than two dozen states have similar laws. But in many cases, such laws don’t explicitly require these people to surrender guns they already own. In practice, that means many abusers hold onto their firearms.

It’s a loophole that has been dubbed the “relinquishment gap.” According to Everytown for Gun Safety, only 16 states require people under final domestic violence restraining orders to turn in their firearms once they are prohibited from owning them.

Shannon Watts, Founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said the reason so few states require domestic abusers to relinquish their guns is because the gun lobby opposes it.

""As the body of research demonstrating the life-saving impact of these laws grows, I'm hopeful the list of states that have these laws will keep getting longer,"" she said.

Investigators from the Boston University School of Public Health examined 25 years of intimate partner homicides in all 50 states to examine the effect of firearm “relinquishment” laws, which specifically mandate that people subject to certain orders surrender their firearms to authorities. The researchers found that intimate partner homicide rates were almost 10 percent lower in states with these laws, compared with states without them, and that firearm-related intimate partner homicides were 14 percent lower.

“We really wanted to know does enforcement make a difference? As it turns out, it does,” said Michael Siegel, professor of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health, and the study’s senior author. “It’s logical that a law that relies upon the offender to voluntarily go to law enforcement and hand over their guns may not be that effective. But it was surprising to see the stark difference in the actual death rates.”

Guns and domestic violence are known to be a lethal mix. According to the study, more than 1,800 people are killed by their intimate partners in the U.S. each year. About half of those homicides are committed with firearms. The majority of victims are women.

If all 50 states had relinquishment laws in 2015, there would have been 120 fewer intimate partner homicides, the report says.

“Women who obtain restraining orders are at particularly high risk for partner violence, given that fear of violence (often created by threatened or actual violence) typically motivates the desire for a protective order,” the report concludes. “These findings seem to demonstrate the value of identifying high-risk situations based on known episodes of past violence and removing firearms from such situations to prevent future violence.”

Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said the findings align with what advocates have long seen on the ground.

“When domestic abusers are legally barred from owning guns, but aren’t actually required by the law or the courts to relinquish them, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that some of those guns are used to murder their victims,” Gandy said. “The lack of this basic protection for victims violates common sense and common decency.”

huffpo70,huffpo,"['Josh Butler', 'Editor', 'Huffpost Australia']",2018-02-22 22:49:27-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-gun-laws-weakening_us_5a8cfd99e4b00a30a2509c3f,"In the wake of several mass shootings in the United States, including last week’s massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, gun control advocates often point to Australia as an example of how a country can implement strong firearm laws to try to stop such carnage.

But while Australia has virtually eliminated mass shootings since the landmark 1996 firearms laws were enacted days after the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania ― in which 35 people were killed by a gunman wielding AR-15 and L1A1 rifles in what remains the worst single mass attack in modern Australian history ― gun control advocates say politicians and the general public have become “complacent,” allowing the gun lobby to push for a weakening of several important planks of protection as compliance with the laws has slipped across the nation.

“While Australians strongly support gun laws, many are of the view that everything was set in stone in 1996, but it wasn’t. Firearms laws are a political hot potato, and the Australian public isn’t aware gun laws are in trouble,” Sam Lee, head of Gun Control Australia, told HuffPost.

Following the Port Arthur massacre, the federal government swiftly passed new laws and state governments signed up to a new National Firearms Agreement, which all but banned semiautomatic weapons and pump-action shotguns.

Other parts of the legislation instituted far stricter rules governing storage of weapons and obligated people applying for guns licenses to demonstrate a “genuine need” to own a firearm ― self-defense was not permitted as a reason ― and to undertake a safety course. Also instituted was a new 28-day waiting period for licenses and new weapons, restrictions on the amount of ammunition that could be purchased and new conditions around “a mental or physical condition which would render the applicant unsuitable for owning, possessing or using a firearm.”

The gunman in the Port Arthur massacre was mentally impaired.

David Gray / Reuters Guns handed in during the 1996 buyback program in Sydney. More than 700,000 firearms were handed over in the government program.

The government also instituted a buyback system in which those who possessed the newly-banned weapons would be compensated for handing them in to be destroyed. More than 640,000 firearms were bought back from owners by the government from October 1996 to September 1997, while many tens of thousands of still legal weapons, such as handguns, were voluntarily surrendered, for a total of more than 700,000 firearms handed over to authorities.

In the 12 years before the new laws, Australia experienced at least 12 mass shootings in which at least five people died. In the 22 years since, only three incidents could be classified as mass shootings: an incident at Monash University in 2002, known as the only shooting at an Australian education facility, in which two people were killed and five were wounded; a siege at Hectorville in 2011, in which three people were killed and three wounded; and a domestic-related incident at a farm in Lockhart in 2014, when a man shot dead his wife and three children before turning the gun on himself.

After the 1996 laws, homicide and suicide by firearm decreased, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. From the 1995-96 fiscal year to 2013-14, firearm-related homicides dropped from 67 to 32 annually, the crime institute reported. Since 2003-04, no year has had more than 40 firearm-related homicides. In the U.S. in 2014, more than 11,000 firearm-related homicides were reported, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Images A memorial service is held May 19, 1996, at the Port Arthur historic site in Tasmania for the 35 victims of a mass shooting.

However, Gun Control Australia estimated in 2016 there were “as many guns in private hands in Australia as there was at the time of the Port Arthur massacre,” and in 2017, authorities estimated there were up to 260,000 illegal or unregistered firearms in the country. There are currently 730,000 licensed gun owners in Australia and 2.75 million registered firearms. Another gun amnesty, the first since Port Arthur, saw 26,000 firearms handed in last year.

A 2017 review of the National Firearms Agreement found no state had actually complied with all parts of the agreement and that most states had significantly loosened and weakened their gun laws in the two decades since Port Arthur.

“Every jurisdiction has slipped backwards by varying degrees. [New South Wales] is the most obvious example of compliance ‘slippage,’” wrote the report’s author, University of Sydney adjunct associate professor Philip Alpers.

New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, has recently permitted gun silencers, extended the availability of semiautomatic weapons and eased restrictions on licensing, the report said. Also of concern is that “every State and Territory allows minors to possess and use firearms,” with licensing ages ranging from 10 to 16 years, while some jurisdictions allow people to be trained in firearm use without first obtaining a license. Some states have relaxed restrictions on purchasing multiple firearms and ammunition, wound back licensing regulations, or relaxed rules on safe storage and background checks.

“Non-compliance from day one, and two decades of political pressure, have steadily reduced restrictions and undermined the NFA’s original intent,” the report said.

Gun control experts concur.

“Our gun laws are in a bit of trouble here. We can’t be complacent,” Gun Control Australia’s Sam Lee told HuffPost.

She said that, although background checks for an initial firearm license or purchase remained stringent, there were no further checks when someone wanted to purchase a second weapon, meaning that criminal offenses committed after the purchase of a first weapon might not be picked up. She said a national firearm registry, one of the recommendations of the National Firearms Agreement, was never implemented.

“We don’t know what happened in that time [between purchases]. People are falling through the gaps. We don’t have a national system to track the movement of firearms and licence holders, which is a problem with any criminal activity,” she said.

Lee Rhiannon is a senator for New South Wales and a member of the Greens party, the third-largest in the federal Parliament. Ond one of her portfolio responsibilities is gun control. Rhiannon told HuffPost she was trying to combat the complacency around firearms laws.

“The National Firearms Agreement hasn’t kept up with the modernization of guns,” she said, citing how dealers are attempting to import new rapid-fire weapons into the country, such as the Pardus shotgun (below), and technology that allows 3-D printing of weapons.

“I’ve been following the horror in the United States, and I’ve been impressed with the young people taking a stand and that they’re looking to Australia for laws. Hopefully they start having the conversation and moving toward gun control, and there are fine lessons to learn from Australia, but our system isn’t perfect. It can be tighter.”

On a political level, Rhiannon cited the rising power of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party in the New South Wales state parliament (it holds the balance of power in the upper house). The party supports gun rights and land access, and it has been working to slowly relax gun laws.

For example, in 2013, the Shooters Party negotiated exemptions to hunt feral animals in NSW national parks in exchange for its support for government plans to privatize the state’s electricity system.

Rhiannon said she was also concerned about the rising influence of gun lobbyists, along with moves to overturn a ban on the Adler 110 lever-action shotgun.

Former Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the 1996 laws, warned against voting for the Shooters Party at a recent NSW state election.

“The Shooters Party is standing and hoping to win seats in state elections, and they’re becoming important for major parties as the government will depend on them to get their legislation through. They’re making it easier for people to use a gun, which goes against the whole tenor of the NFA,” she said.

“The public hasn’t gone easy on guns. When there is a shooting, the public are deeply uneasy about the incidents, but when it drops out of the news and people aren’t paying attention, the major parties and shooters parties and gun industry are doing deals. At a federal level, the responsible minister has none of the gun control groups at the negotiating table, only the gun lobby.”"
huffpo71,huffpo,[],2013-04-30 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/florida-guns-mentally-ill_n_3187474.html,"The Florida House and Senate have unanimously passed a gun control measure, possibly the only one before the legislative session ends on Friday, that has the approval of the National Rifle Association.



The bill expands current gun-buying restrictions to include anyone who has voluntarily committed himself or herself for treatment.

Existing state law only prohibits those involuntary committed under Florida's Baker Act from buying a gun.

The new legislation closes a huge loophole, according to bill sponsors.

Only 1 percent of mentally ill patients are actually committed against their will, according to the Palm Beach Post, leaving 99 percent of those with a history of treatment to purchase guns.

“People with mental illnesses who are determined to be a danger to self or others are scamming the system. Many of them have been Baker Acted five, 10, 20 times. They never get into the system to prevent them from purchasing a firearm,” NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer said.

The 1 percent has amounted to 90,000 records in Florida's Mental Competency (MECOM) database, according to Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as court clerks are required to report when individuals are involuntary committed or ""adjudicated.""

If Gov. Rick Scott signs the bill into law, people who commit themselves for treatment will also be submitted to Florida's MECOM as well as to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which tracks mental illness on the federal level.

Yet Florida has been criticized for lagging behind other states in reporting mental health records to NICS, according to a report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

And even if the state's mental health records were comprehensive, there's another giant loophole in firearm sales: There is no federal or state law requiring background checks at gun shows or private sales -- just in retail stores.

Local governments like Miami-Dade County do require criminal and mental illness checks for all gun purchases -- including those at gun shows -- but the law often goes unenforced.

Meanwhile the NRA's focus on improving the U.S.'s mental health system has been called a ""smokescreen"" by critics.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called the belief that a mental-health system could pick out mass murderers before they strike a ""policy illusion."""
huffpo72,huffpo,['Brian Brueggemann'],2014-01-01 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/01/new-illinois-gun-laws-in-2014_n_4524967.html,"A new Illinois law requires private sellers of guns to verify that the buyers' gun permits are valid, but a State Police website for the verification process was not yet working as of New Year's Eve.

The law, in effect on New Year's Day, requires that all private firearm transactions in Illinois must be approved by State Police. Any non-federally licensed firearm dealer who sells or transfers a gun is required to contact ISP and provide the buyer's Firearm Owner's Identification Card number. The State Police will then determine the validity of the FOID card and issue a sale-approval number, which is valid for 30 days.

The seller is allowed to transfer the gun to the buyer after obtaining the approval number and waiting 24 hours for a rifle or shotgun or 72 hours for a handgun.

A sale-approval number can be requested around-the-clock through a page on the ISP website, at http://www.isp.state.il.us/foid/foidp2p.cfm, or during normal business hours by calling 217-524-3847.

State Police said the website and phone number were to be active when the law took effect. But as of New Year's Eve, the web page had a notice that said: ""FOID card status inquiry for private firearm transfer coming soon."" A recording on the phone line advised callers to call back because ""we are experiencing a high call volume.""

Sellers already were required in Illinois to keep records of private gun sales and to check if buyers had FOID cards. But if a buyer's card had been revoked, there was no way for a seller to know that. The new verification system is designed to provide up-to-date information to sellers on the status of buyers' FOID cards.

The overall goal of the law is to reduce crime. But the law's critics, such as Breese gun shop owner Jim Hummert, say criminals aren't too concerned about following laws.

""I think we need to enforce the current laws on the books regarding felons possessing firearms before we try another tax-and-spend idea from Springfield,"" said Hummert, a retired sheriff's detective and police chief.

It's unclear what the penalty will be for failing to check a buyer's FOID status. The law states that failing to do so ""shall not be punishable as a crime or petty offense.""

The law also requires gun owners to notify local police of any lost or stolen guns. The law requires an owner to report the loss within 72 hours of learning that a gun has been lost or stolen. Failure to report a lost or stolen gun is a petty offense for the first violation, and a misdemeanor for subsequent violations.

The dust is only beginning to settle in the wake of oral arguments heard before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 18 in the historic case of Heller v. District of Columbia. The day featured several lively exchanges, as both the justices and the attorneys for the two sides in the case sought to divine the historical context and present-day implications of the Second Amendment.

At issue in the Heller case are the District's tough gun laws, which effectively ban handguns and require those who own long guns (i.e., shotguns and rifles) to keep them unloaded and either trigger-locked or disassembled in the home. The lead Plaintiff in the case, D.C. resident Dick Anthony Heller, has argued that these restrictions preclude his right to self-defense in the home and violate individual rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. In the view of Heller and his attorneys, a firearm that must be kept unloaded and trigger locked is ""non-functional"" and of no use in a home invasion scenario.

Surprisingly, during Tuesday's oral arguments, several of the justices seemed to not only openly side with Heller's argument, but to stake out a stance on the storage of firearms in the home more laissez-faire than that advocated by the standard bearer for the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA).

One fascinating exchange occurred between Walter E. Dellinger III, the attorney arguing the case for the District, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia. Dellinger clarified that long guns in District can be kept either disassembled or trigger locked when stored in the home, and noted that releasing a trigger lock is a simple procedure. Justice Roberts pressed -- exactly how long does it take to disable such a lock? Dellinger, who had tested a lock on a gun he owned, answered ""three seconds.""

That apparently didn't satisfy Justice Scalia, who had envisioned a hypothetical home invasion scenario of ""somebody crawling in your bedroom window."" Addressing Dellinger, Justice Scalia sarcastically stated, ""You turn on the lamp next to your bed so you can -- you can turn the knob at 3-22-95."" Chief Justice Roberts followed with his own quip, which elicited laughter from the crowd: ""you turn on the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses..."" The two justices seemed to be implying that trigger locks eliminate the possibility of a firearm being used for self-defense. More disturbingly, they seemed to suggest that keeping firearms loaded and unsecured in the home was the most prudent storage practice. Also embracing this view was Justice Samuel Alito, who stated that D.C.'s firearm storage provisions could not survive ""under any standard of review.""

A quick look at the NRA""s Gun Safety Rules webpage reveals just how far out of the mainstream these justices are. One of the NRA's ""fundamental"" rules for safe gun handling is ""ALWAYS keep the gun unloaded until ready to use."" The NRA also tells gun owners to always ""store guns so they are not accessible to unauthorized persons,"" noting that ""dozens of gun storage devices, as well as locking devices that attach directly to the gun, are available."" In a ""Parents Guide to Gun Safety,"" the NRA also points out the potential dangers to children, stating ""a parent must, in every case, assess the exposure of the firearm and absolutely ensure that it is inaccessible to a child.""

Dellinger is undoubtedly aware of these dangers. His two grandchildren likely spend more time in his home than armed criminals. It is mystifying that Chief Justice Roberts, who has two young children, is not equally aware of why kids and guns are a bad mix.

The fact is that guns in the home are a far greater threat to one's family and intimates than to any imagined criminals. Living in a home where there are guns increases the risk of homicide by 40 to 170% and the risk of suicide by 90 to 460%. With its handgun ban and proactive safety and storage laws, the District of Columbia, in comparison with the 50 states, enjoys the 17th lowest accidental gun death rate and the second lowest suicide rate. Meanwhile, according to the FBI, firearms were used by private citizens in only 147 justifiable homicides in the U.S. in 2005. The total number of gun homicides that year? 12,352.

D.C.'s gun laws could live or die depending on what the Supreme Court defines as a ""reasonable restriction."" Given the firearm safety recommendations of the gun lobby, and the level of evidence pointing to the risks of having unsecured firearms in the home, it is disingenuous to argue that the city's trigger lock provision is unreasonable.

I would point to the words of Justice Stephen Breyer, who stated during the oral arguments that ""we give...leeway to the city and States to work out what's reasonable in light of their problems."" Or as he later summarized concerning the controversy over trigger locks: ""Do you want thousands of judges all over the United States to be deciding that kind of question rather than the city councils and the legislatures that have decided it in the context of passing laws?""

That question can be answered faster than the few seconds it takes to remove a trigger lock."
huffpo74,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter', 'Jessica Carro', 'Producer', 'The Huffington Post']",2017-03-13 19:02:24-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-silencers-hearing-protection-act_us_58c6b59fe4b0ed71826e1be0,"Gun silencers have been one of the most tightly regulated firearms products in the United States since 1934. Now Congress may eliminate those restrictions, which everybody agrees could mean millions more silencers in the hands of American gun owners.

The debate is whether the benefits of more silencers would outweigh the costs.

Silencers, also called suppressors, are restricted under the National Firearms Act, alongside weaponry like machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. Federal regulations impose a high barrier to purchase: Buyers must pay a $200 transfer fee, submit to fingerprinting and pass a federal background check, a process that can take up to nine months to complete.

Lawmakers say their push to end those requirements and thereby make silencers more easily available is about protecting the hearing of gun owners exposed to high-volume blasts while hunting or target shooting. They are calling their bill the Hearing Protection Act, and it is currently awaiting committee hearings in the House and Senate.

“This legislation is about safety ― plain and simple,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), one of the bill’s sponsors, in a January statement. “I’m very active in sport shooting and hunting, and I can’t tell you how better off the shooting sports enthusiasts would be if we had easier access to suppressors to help protect our hearing.”

A similar bill failed to make it out of committee in 2015, but now that Republicans are in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the measure has a much better chance of passing. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, has put his support behind the effort, saying in an interview with the CEO of manufacturer SilencerCo last fall that the current regulations were “just another rule the government wants to put in place for no reason.”

Advocates for gun violence prevention say the bill is a gift to the firearms industry, because it would massively expand the market for silencers, and to criminals, because it would make it easier to fire a gun undetected.

Silencers are “used to conceal the fact that you are firing a weapon,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “There will be more crimes committed, more people killed” if the current bill passes.

Illustration: HuffPost/Photos: Getty Images “This legislation is about safety -- plain and simple,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan, a sponsor of the Hearing Protection Act.

American engineer Hiram Percy Maxim patented the first silencer in the early 1900s, using technology that he would later apply in developing an automobile muffler. That basic concept hasn’t changed much since. The cylindrical device screws on to the barrel of a gun. Chambers within the silencer allow gases to dissipate and cool after escaping from the muzzle, which damps sound emissions.

Initial suppressor models were reportedly unpopular and controversial. Fearing they could encourage crime, states began cracking down on their use. The federal government placed them on a list of regulated devices under the National Firearms Act during the Great Depression, amid concerns that people might use them to avoid detection while illegally hunting for food.

Suppressor technology made substantial leaps in the Vietnam War era, thanks to a former CIA dark-ops contractor named Mitch WerBell. His silencers were more compact and effective than their predecessors. They attracted the attention of U.S. military and intelligence agencies, which reportedly began using them to carry out targeted killings. WerBell became known in some gun enthusiast circles as the “Wizard of Whispering Death.”

Most people today probably envision silencers based on their Hollywood depiction: An assassin fits the attachment to the end of his weapon, which he then fires with a muffled “pew” instead of a bang.

Silencer manufacturers emphasize this is an inaccurate representation. Depending on the weapon, unsuppressed gunfire typically ranges between 140 and 160 decibels ― volumes that can rupture eardrums and cause permanent hearing loss. Silencers make shooting quieter, but they don’t make it quiet, said Jason Schauble, chief revenue officer at Utah-based SilencerCo.

“Suppressors are really about taking shooting noise below 140 decibels, which is the OSHA hearing-safe level,” Schauble said. “Many suppressors end up around 130 or 120 decibels, so around the volume of a car door slamming.”

At the level, more hunters would likely choose to shoot without ear protection, making it easier for them to hear animals or have conversations with companions. Lowering the sound of gunfire would also reduce hearing hazards related to sport shooting and lessen noise pollution around shooting ranges.

Here’s a demonstration from SilencerCo:

Not everyone is convinced that shooting-related hearing loss is a problem that needs another solution.

“You already have the answer,” said Kris Brown, chief strategy officer at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “There are things available on the market to protect hearing.”

The people who want to make silencers more easily available point to a range of other tactical benefits. Silencers decrease a weapon’s recoil and improve its accuracy, the American Suppressor Association says on its website. This lets shooters fire in rapid succession without losing track of the target, as silencer manufacturers note. Suppressors also reduce muzzle flash, allowing shooters to better disguise their location in low-light settings.

Although supporters of silencers tout these latter advantages in terms of sport shooting, the same characteristics might also appeal to a mass shooter or other criminal.

“There could be some instance where somebody uses it for nefarious purposes,” said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police. “They don’t want a loud report or a muzzle flash or a blast ― say a sniper or someone trying to shoot at police officers or other people from a distance ― and they want to suppress that noise.”

The National Association of Chiefs of Police has not taken an official position on the bill.

Not Popular With Criminals ― Yet

About 1.3 million silencers are currently registered in the U.S., the Justice Department said in February, which is nearly 400,000 more than in 2015. Buyers have to go through the federal registration process to purchase them in the 42 states where they are legal.

Some data suggest that silencers are rarely used in crimes. Over the past decade, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has referred very few silencer-related cases for prosecution, according to a white paper proposal written by the ATF’s second highest-ranking official in January.

“Silencers are very rarely used in criminal shootings,” states the paper, which The Washington Post obtained last month. “Given the lack of criminality associated with silencers, it is reasonable to conclude that they should not be viewed as a threat to public safety.”

Rinchich noted that in his four decades in law enforcement, he doesn’t recall ever finding a gun used in a crime with a silencer.

Gun control advocates argue those statistics are proof of the effectiveness of existing regulations, not a reason to undo them. They point to a handful of known crimes committed with silencers to show there is at least some risk of criminal behavior.

Jim Urquhart/Reuters SilencerCo CEO Joshua Waldron fires a rifle with a suppressor in West Valley City, Utah, on Feb. 23, 2016.

But gun lobbyists argue that suppressors will never be a natural choice for criminals.

“The majority of firearms used in crimes are small, concealable handguns,” said Knox Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association. “Folks want to be able to put something in a pocket or hide it in a waistband. When you add a suppressor to that, you’re generally adding 6 to 8 inches to the length of a gun.”

On top of being unwieldy, silencers are also expensive, ranging from a few hundred to more than a thousand dollars depending on the category of firearm and type of suppressor.

“People don’t buy a thousand-dollar thing to add to another thousand-dollar thing so they have a really nice gun-and-silencer combination to commit crime,” Schauble said.

If silencers become more easily available, however, supporters admit that the current low levels of related criminal activity could rise.

“There are always going to be a couple people who misuse any tool contrary to its intended use, whether it be sound suppressors, whether it be firearms, whether it be motor vehicles,” Schauble said. “It’s an emotional issue, and like most issues that are emotional, it’s emotional because no one really knows what will happen.”

Silencers could also prove problematic for gunshot detectors, which use decibel levels to identify the sound of firearms. And that troubles some law enforcement officials.

“Cities all over the country have invested a lot of money in gunshot detectors because people shooting firearms in a community is a problem, and it allows the police to know that’s taken place and to respond even if nobody’s called,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.

Dreaming Of A Business Boom

With an estimated 300 million firearms in civilian hands in the U.S., silencer manufacturers see huge potential for their product. Even under the current restrictions, suppressors have grown more popular over the last several years.

SilencerCo’s business has increased 600 percent since 2014, with more than 100,000 sales last year, almost all to civilians, according to Schauble. He believes that with deregulation, the market could expand as much as tenfold, leading to the sale of more than a million silencers each year. After all, some 299 million guns don’t have silencers yet.

Lawmakers who oppose the bill say that is the real push behind the legislation. “The gun industry is faced with a declining number of Americans that are buying guns, so they have to target more weapons and more expensive weapons to that smaller number of Americans,” said Murphy.

That would fit a longstanding pattern of the gun lobby dismissing potential public safety consequences in its campaign to loosen gun laws, critics contend. Last month, congressional Republicans voted to repeal a measure that had blocked some Social Security disability insurance recipients from purchasing firearms. GOP lawmakers called it an undue infringement upon the rights of Americans with disabilities, but supporters said the rule was necessary to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill individuals. In recent years, state and federal lawmakers have also offered a number of proposals to roll back permitting and training requirements for those who want carry guns.

“It’s a continual process of making guns ubiquitous in America,” said Stephens."

That's right, tennis balls are deemed too dangerous to be allowed into the 1.7-mile event space surrounding the RNC. Not only that, but you have to leave your air rifles, water guns, umbrella, shovels, glass bottles, light bulbs and hammers at home. But if you want to bring your fully loaded AR-15 assault rifle, please, feel free.

Welcome to Ohio, where like in the majority of states, it is legal for an individual to openly carry a loaded firearm in a public place without a permit (2). Welcome to Cleveland, home of the RNC, where the head the city's largest police union is concerned to a point where he asked Ohio Governor John Kasich to temporarily tighten the state's gun laws via executive action. Kasich claimed that he did not have the power to ""arbitrarily suspend state or federal constitutional rights or state laws"" (3).

Hard to believe that a Governor can't temporarily issue an order to protect the public, especially when it would prohibit military-style weapons being carried into large public events attended by Presidential candidates. But that is not the primary problem. The issue is that no prohibition exists in the first place. The issue is that a state refuses to act and prevent open carry making it difficult for law enforcement officers, whose job it is to protect their community. It undermines the ability for an officer to do their job, because how are they supposed to determine who is a ""good person with a gun,"" and who is a criminal or terrorist with a gun? And as we know all too well, fear drives impulse decisions, and more guns result in more fear and more gun violence. This is abundantly clear when compared to states with common-sense gun violence prevention laws that restrict open and concealed firearm carry, that all have relatively low firearm fatality rates.

It is also legal to openly carry a firearm in Texas and Louisiana, where both states have recently seen tragedies affect their law enforcement officers. Texas law allows for open carry of rifles, but the display of a firearm in a public place in a ""manner calculated to alarm"" is prohibited (4). Objectively, a gun in a manner calculated to alarm seemingly means it is about to be used, and at that point hope of peaceful resolution is effectively lost. By this virtue, the open carry law represents inherent danger and subsequent violence, not protection.

The recent tragedies in Dallas and Baton Rouge highlight the misguided belief that open carry laws create a safer environment. At the Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas, police officers were out-armed not only by a sniper with the intent to kill police, but also by protestors who came equipped with AR-15's and bulletproof vests (5). As the initial shots began, law enforcement wrongfully, but blamelessly, suspected them to be the perpetrators of the violence (5). In the end, credit is due to the Dallas Police department that there were not more casualties due to the confusion created by the public openly carrying firearms.

In Louisiana, the murder of three police officers magnifies the scope of trepidation caused by heightened racial tensions. Access to military style assault rifles and the ability to openly carry one, augments that scope and adds deadly consequences. Gavin Long, the gunman, bypassed civilians as he hunted down law enforcement officers in a targeted attack (6). Were police officers supposed to know beforehand that this was a bad guy with a gun whose sole intent was to kill them? Was the gunman holding his weapon in ""a manner calculated to alarm""? Even still, this subjective measure of ""prohibition"" could be disregarded because it is not included in the Louisiana open carry law (7).

This brings us back to the divisive rhetoric surrounding the Republican National Convention and the consequent lowered sense of security and public safety. It is a scene where organizations like Citizens for Trump and Black Lives Matter have been marching and protesting simultaneously (3). A number of groups have explicitly announced their plans to exploit Cleveland's lenient gun laws and come armed with military-style assault rifles, because it is their right to do so in Ohio (8).

Dallas and Louisiana show the perils of this senseless law, now Cleveland and America are on edge because of it.

It is time to abolish the notion that the ability to openly carry a firearm makes our nation safer.

The recording star, whose legal name is Artis Leon Ivey, 53, could be sentenced to as much as three years in state prison if convicted, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement.

Prosecutors said it was illegal for the performer to carry a gun because of two prior felony convictions - in 2001 for carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle and in 2009 for possession of cocaine base.

Kai Pfaffenbach / Reuters Coolio, whose legal name is Artis Leon Ivey, could be sentenced to as much as three years in state prison if convicted on weapons charges.

The rap artist was scheduled to appear in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday for an arraignment, but the hearing was postponed until Oct. 26 after his lawyer told the judge that Coolio was out of state performing, district attorney spokesman Ricardo Santiago said.

Santiago said a warrant for Coolio’s arrest would be issued if he failed to appear for the later court date.

The rapper’s lawyer, Michael Aisen, declined to comment on the case.

Coolio, a Los Angeles-area native, is perhaps best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit “Gangsta’s Paradise,” the No. 1 U.S. chart-topper that year and one of the best-selling singles of all time.

According to Los Angeles police who arrested Coolio at the airport, a stolen, loaded pistol was discovered in the rapper’s backpack on the X-ray screening belt as his entourage was going through security to board a flight en route to a concert.

Another member of the entourage initially claimed ownership of the bag, but evidence in the backpack directed police to Coolio, who by then had boarded the plane, and police removed him from the aircraft, police spokesman Rob Pedregon said.

Pedregon said Coolio acknowledged under questioning that the bag and the gun were his, but said little else after he was taken into custody."

“Why am I giving away an AR-15 rifle? It’s just one way to thank you for defeating Obama’s anti-gun agenda this year,” said an email from Stockman's campaign arm. “But the battle for the right to keep and bear arms is heating up again. President Obama and Sen. Harry Reid [D-Nev.] are not happy that they didn’t pass any gun control yet, so they’re coming back for more.”

In order to draw pro-gun supporters to his campaign, Stockman will give away the free rifle on July 4, according to The Daily Caller.

“I hope you realize that the only reason Obama has not been able to ban semi-autos, magazines and gun shows is because of your activism,” the email continues. The message also refers to the Bushmaster as ""the firearm that Obama most wants to ban,"" and includes a video of an intern shooting the rifle, which can be seen above. The firearm has emerged as particularly controversial in the wake of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. last year, in which the shooter used a Bushmaster to gun down 26 people.

Stockman employed a similar tactic last month by advertising an AR-15 giveaway on Twitter, inviting readers to ""grab this gun before Obama does!""

An outspoken Second Amendment supporter, Stockman is also known for promoting a bumper sticker that read, “If babies had guns they wouldn’t be aborted”. He wrote an open letter earlier this year inviting all gun owners to move to Texas, so their ""rights will not be infringed upon."""

Authorities say the man originally entered the Kroger unarmed before returning to his car, getting the weapon, and re-entering the store, according to WVIR. The man was reportedly only in the store with the AR-15 ""briefly"" before making his exit.

After witnesses and store employees called 911, police arrived and questioned the man, the station reports.

But because the man legally owned the rifle and it was in plain view, he didn't actually break any laws, Charlottesville Police Lt. Ronnie Roberts said, according to The Daily Progress.

As to why the man brought a loaded assault rifle into a grocery store?

""It was most likely a demonstration of his Second Amendment rights,"" Roberts told The Daily Progress.

Virginia law allows gun owners to openly carry their weapons, but a permit must be obtained to carry a concealed gun, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

The AR-15 semi-automatic rifle is a lightweight, military-style weapon that can hold magazines of up to 100 bullets. It can fire more than 120 rounds a minute, depending on how fast its user pulls the trigger. More than three million Americans own an AR-15, according to CBS News.

The AR-15 has been used in several recent mass shootings in the United States, perhaps most notably by Adam Lanza, who killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14.

James Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 at a Colorado movie theater on July 20, also allegedly used an AR-15.

In an obviously staged video posted on Tuesday, the dancers, known professionally as Mary Jane Watson and Miss Pepper Pots, offer a potential “customer” couch dances for $15 or an AR-15 rifle for $1,100.

The young man, standing in front of the table the two women set up outside the club where they perform, asks if the gun sale is even legal.

Watson explains that, yes, yes it is.

“We can do a private firearms transfer,” she says.

Pots adds that they don’t need to see I.D. or do a background check on the man.

“You just give us $1,100 in cash and we give you the gun,” she says.

The customer acts shocked at how easy it is to get the gun ― the same type of weapon used in the Feb. 14 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 students and staff members ― and Watson agrees.

“That’s just how loose the privatized gun transfer law is in Tennessee,” she said. (State law does prohibit a person from “knowingly” selling a gun to someone “prohibited by state or federal law from owning, possessing or purchasing” a firearm.)

The man then asks about the couch dance option, and Watson and Pots detail the legal hoops they have to jump through to become exotic dancers.

“First of all, we have to get a background check,” Watson says.

“Then we have to go get our fingerprints done,” Pots adds.

Dancers in Tennessee are also required to supply two recent passport photos to the State’s Sexually Oriented Business Licensing Board. along with other paperwork, and then wait through a two-week background check period.

“And only then are we deemed safe to give you a [fully clothed] couch dance,” Watson says.

Watson and Pots don’t actually sell the AR-15 in the video, which was made to protest what they and their employer, Deja Vu Showgirls, deem to be excessive regulation of their business.

The video has been viewed on Facebook by less than 900 people as of Wednesday afternoon, but one of those was Joe Carr, a former Republican member of the Tennessee House who’s now running for the state Senate.

He’s not happy.

“All stunts are meant to generate publicity, and I think this is kind of tragic with what happened in Florida in the school down there and what has happened in a number of schools over the past few years,” Carr told local station WSMV-TV. “It should not be minimized by sensational antics by a handful of women in front of a gentleman’s club.”

Watson said she hopes the video gets people thinking.

“We could sell [the gun] to someone who uses it for God knows what, and yet we have to go through all of this just to give someone a dance? It’s a little insane,” Watson told WSMV."

Andy Holt (R) said he plans to give away two AR-15 rifles -- the same kind of weapon used in the massacre -- as a ""door prize"" at an upcoming political fundraiser.

Holt, a self-described conservative Christian, had announced last week that he would give away one AR-15 at ""Hogfest,"" a barbeque fundraiser on his farm that has a petting zoo and hay rides. But when reporters asked him after the Orlando, Florida, shooting on Sunday whether he still planned to give away the assault weapon, he told reporters that he now wants to give away two instead of one.

""I'm furious that I get phone calls from the media asking me if I'm still going to give away an AR-15 at our HogFest, rather than asking me how many extra firearms I'll be handing out to ensure people can protect themselves,"" Holt wrote in a Facebook post on Monday. ""After all, it was a bullet that stopped the terrorist. Amazing how so many seem to miss that fact.""

Holt went on to write that people ""should not focus on the gun itself"" but instead on ""the depravity of the heart of the person who's pulling the trigger."" He encouraged people to buy more guns to protect themselves.

""I want you to arm yourselves and learn to shoot with deadly accuracy should the need arise,"" he wrote. ""Protect your family. Protect yourselves. Protect your friends. Our government has made it quite clear that it is incapable of doing so. At the end of the day, it's your responsibility anyways.""

Early Sunday morning, a shooter armed with a 9mm handgun and a .223 caliber AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle stormed into Pulse, a popular gay nightclub in Orlando. He began firing, killing 49 people and injuring 53. The gunman, Omar Mateen, passed a full background check and purchased the firearms legally the week of the shooting, despite the fact that he had a history of domestic violence and was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2013 for possible ties to terrorism.

While an armed security guard was present at the nightclub and traded fire with Mateen, the guard was not able to stop the massacre before police arrived.

The massacre has already reignited a debate about guns in Washington. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton renewed her call to limit the purchases of certain assault weapons.

“Some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism,” Clinton told a crowd in Cleveland Monday. “In Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons, the AR-15, and they used it to kill Americans. That was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in Sandy Hook. We have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war, and that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack. But it will stop some and it will save lives.”

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, echoed Holt's sentiment and called for more ""guns on the other side"" in a CNN interview Monday morning."
huffpo85,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-03-01 20:32:07-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/assault-rifle-deaths-ar-15_us_5a96de5ae4b0e6a52304248a,"The school shooting last month in Parkland, Florida, has sparked another passionate debate about the dangers of assault-style rifles, such as the AR-15 used to kill 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The conversation has understandably run high on emotions, but it has also lacked a concrete answer to a question at the core of this issue: How frequently are these weapons actually used in fatal shootings around the U.S.?

Supporters of gun reform believe it’s far too easy to get these semiautomatic rifles, which can be equipped with magazines that hold 30 rounds or more and have been used to quickly inflict mass casualties in numerous horrific shootings over the past few years. They argue that these worst-case scenarios are reason enough to restrict access to this sort of weaponry.

But defenders of assault-style rifles note that these firearms appear only rarely in the more than 11,000 firearm homicides around the U.S. each year. The overwhelming majority involve handguns, according to federal data and other counts, including one done by this reporter in 2016. Because of that fact, gun enthusiasts argue that banning assault-style weapons would do very little to drive down overall levels of gun violence while unfairly targeting the millions of people who use them legally.

That may be a fair argument considering the available evidence. But a closer look at the most commonly cited data reveals serious deficiencies that make it impossible to determine exactly how many people are killed each year with assault-style rifles ― or with any kind of firearm, for that matter. By relying on this system, we’re almost certainly undercounting these types of deaths, though by how much is unclear.

Right now, our best idea of total slayings by assault-style rifles comes from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, which compiles general crime statistics from police departments across the country. Individual law enforcement agencies typically report their UCR data to state authorities, who pass them to the feds. Many departments also provide supplementary homicide reports, which offer additional information about the crimes, including the type of firearm used.

But reporting to UCR is voluntary, as are the supplementary homicide reports. Although the FBI says 18,000 law enforcement agencies participate in the UCR program, many agencies do not. Some departments contribute to UCR but don’t provide the additional homicide data.

The process is imperfect even among agencies that do provide this supplementary data. For one, police can’t give details on homicide cases until they have officially declared them to be homicides. That process can take take months or longer, which can lead to a lag in the data. Some agencies may also provide supplementary homicide reports only to have the FBI exclude them because they don’t meet federal guidelines.

As a result of these gaps, the FBI’s baseline numbers on overall gun homicides often end up being inaccurate. The FBI recorded 9,778 murders by firearm in 2015, compared with the 12,979 ultimately tallied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 2016, the FBI recorded 11,004 gun homicides. Cases from Florida and Alabama were not included, according to annual supplementary homicide data provided to HuffPost, omissions an FBI spokesperson attributed to state reporting practices and data that didn’t meet federal guidelines. The CDC hasn’t released its final count for 2016, but if previous years are any indicator, its number may end up being substantially higher.

Matters only get more complicated when trying to determine the nature of each gun death in this limited set. According to FBI data, there were 7,105 homicides by handgun in 2016, about 65 percent of the total, alongside 374 homicides by rifle, just over 3 percent of the total. Although there are plenty of rifles that aren’t assault-style, AR-15s and other similar weapons have become the most popular firearms in this category, according to the gun industry.

But even here, there are glaring holes in the data.

The type of weapon is not specified in 3,077 of the FBI’s 11,004 gun homicide cases, about 28 percent of the total. There are likely a few reasons for this ambiguity. Many of these cases haven’t been solved when police fill out supplementary homicide reports, meaning they may not know what kind of gun was used. Some departments may also document cases generally as gun homicides, without providing additional details on the type of firearm.

There’s not necessarily any reason to believe there are a huge number of rifle homicides hiding in this category, but if the breakdown is similar to those cases in which the weapon has been identified, it would account for about 100 additional homicides by rifle. We’ll probably never get a definitive answer as to the nature of these cases, because police departments don’t typically go back and adjust supplementary homicide reports when more information comes to light.

The FBI’s data on rifle homicides also come up short in other ways. By excluding reports from Florida, its 2016 figure doesn’t include the 49 people killed in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, for example. The gunman in that incident used an assault-style rifle modeled off the AR-15.

Nor does it include any of the 848 gun homicides that Florida agencies reported to the state’s Department of Law Enforcement in 2016. Among those were 405 cases that involved handguns and 443 homicides that involved “other firearms,” a broad category that includes rifles, shotguns and other firearms that weren’t specifically identified. A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for more detailed data.

MICHELE EVE SANDBERG/AFP via Getty Images Two days after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a vendor sets up his display of AR-15 assault-style rifles for the South Florida Gun Show in Miami.

There were an additional 396 homicides in Alabama in 2016, none of which are included in the FBI’s data. Although handguns were used in 64 percent of those cases, 4 percent involved rifles, shotguns or “other firearms,” according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Again, this imprecise itemization offers little insight into exactly how many of these cases involved rifles, let alone assault-style rifles.

After all of this, what we’re left with is only a vague understanding of the problem we’re hoping to solve. It’s safe to say that handguns, not rifles, are used in the vast majority of fatal shootings ― a reminder that any comprehensive gun violence prevention policy must not focus exclusively on assault-style weapons. And regardless of how frequently AR-15s and other similar firearms are used in routine gun violence, it’s also increasingly clear that just one of these weapons can cause immense harm in the wrong hands.

But with no solid accounting of how many gun deaths these assault-style rifles are currently responsible for, we can’t establish a benchmark to determine the true scope of the problem and see if it’s becoming more or less pronounced over time."

During orientation of our Summer Immersion Program, I sat across from six brave students as we discussed issues of injustice in America and a young woman asked me what I would do if Trump won; and I didn't really answer her question. My honest thought was that I would buy a gun because I need to protect my wife and child from whatever violence this ignorant windbag catalyzes with his hate-laden speeches masquerading as a legitimate political platform.

Now what does my reaction say about me? It says I believe at some level that I actually can protect ""us"" from ""them"". That somehow the powerlessness that I feel will be alleviated by a barrel, ammunition and my willingness to pull the trigger. And that's simply not true.

A gun won't save me from feeling like a target. Instead it takes the dehumanization I feel every day and twists it into empowerment that isn't real.

So where does that leave me?

How did love your enemy turn into shoot them if they threaten you? How did bless those who persecute you turn into God bless me and no one else? How can the same Jesus who went to the Cross be used as fuel to execute gross injustice against those in power? I have internalized my fear and now turn my intimidation outward towards those who would dare come against me. How ignorant and misguided I have allowed myself to become.

Somehow instead of leaning into Him I want to get an AR-15. That if I don't take up arms against Trump, I've somehow let my wife and daughter down. Love my neighbor turned into shoot them if I have to because gunshots will dispel the potential hatred coming toward us. Somehow my new conceal and carry permit turns me into a person made into image of God and that police officer, stranger or neighbor needing a cup of sugar just might not be.

I lay in bed with my pregnant wife beside me trying be like Jesus, without thinking I am the Messiah. And that is profoundly difficult because this world desperately needs a savior. Praise God that He already sent one and His name is not me. So I can go to sleep knowing He holds everything together, He is Our Sword and Shield and I am no coward for putting my trust in His love.

FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave also told reporters that Alexis only had the shotgun -- not an assault rifle, as many news outlets reported -- when he walked into Building 197 at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday morning. But it may not be the only gun he used.

""We have no information that he had an AR-15 assault rifle in his possession,"" she said at a press conference. ""He may have gained access to a handgun ... after he began shooting.""

An initial investigation indicates that Alexis bought a Remington 870 shotgun at a Lorton, Va., gun shop last week, according to the Wall Street Journal. State law in Virginia allows for an individual to buy rifles or shotguns even if that person is not a state resident.

The Glock handgun found on his person after Monday's shooting rampage was likely picked up from a victim, authorities told the Washington Times.

There's still plenty of room for debate about whether Alexis should have been prohibited from making a legal gun purchase, given his criminal history. In May 2004, he was arrested in Seattle for firing three shots into two rear tires of a Honda. At the time, Alexis claimed he had an ""anger-fueled blackout"" and could not remember the shooting. Still, he did not commit any felonies that would bar him from making a gun purchase.

In 2010, Alexis was charged with a misdemeanor in connection to a shooting at his apartment complex in Fort Worth, Texas. A resident reported that Alexis, who lived below her, shot at her through the floor.

The WSJ also notes his mental health history. Although Alexis recently sought mental health treatment through the Veteran's Administration, a court must decide whether someone is ""mentally unfit"" to own a gun under federal law.

The ballistics investigation at Building 197 is still fluid, so it remains unclear how many or which guns Alexis used in the shooting."

Seeing the video and images of dead or helpless Syrian civilians struggling for life reminds me of another terrible weapon of war -- depleted uranium.

It is no secret that the U.S., with the assistance of other governments, used depleted uranium in the Gulf and Iraq War. A simple Google search of this topic can produce dozens and dozens of credible reports or stories to confirm these war crimes. For example, an important report on Harvard University's website discusses the fallout of depleted uranium contamination in Iraq. Dr. Souad N. Al-Azzawi, who authored the report after the Gulf War, wrote that:

""Depleted Uranium (DU) weaponry has been used against Iraq for the first time in the history of recent wars. The magnitude of the complications and damage related to the use of such radioactive and toxic weapons on the environment and the human population mostly results from the intended concealment, denial and misleading information released by the Pentagon about the quantities, characteristics and the area's in Iraq, in which these weapons have been used.""

Similarly, as Democracy Now! reported in an interview with Al Jazeera reporter Dahr Jamail, ""the U.S. invasion of Iraq has left behind a legacy of cancer and birth defects suspected of being caused by the U.S. military's extensive use of depleted uranium and white phosphorus."" Democracy Now! wrote:

""Noting the birth defects in the Iraqi city of Fallujah, Jamail says: 'They're extremely hard to bear witness to. But it's something that we all need to pay attention to ... What this has generated is, from 2004 up to this day, we are seeing a rate of congenital malformations in the city of Fallujah that has surpassed even that in the wake of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that nuclear bombs were d' pped on at the end of World War II.'""

Moreover, Robert Koehler, a HuffPost blogger, has written extensively about the U.S. government's use of depleted uranium in Iraq. The following passage from Koehler's blog ""The Suffering of Fallujah"" gives us an idea of the immense impact that depleted uranium has had on Iraqi civilians:

""Thus last November, a group of British and Iraqi doctors petitioned the U.N. to investigate the alarming rise in birth defects at Fallujah's hospitals. 'Young women in Fallujah,' they wrote ... are terrified of having children because of the increasing number of babies born grotesquely deformed, with no heads, two heads, a single eye in their foreheads, scaly bodies or missing limbs. In addition, young children in Fallujah are now experiencing hideous cancers and leukemias.'""

Koehler continues:

""The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health has just published an epidemiological study, ""Cancer, Infant Mortality and Birth Sex-Ratio in Fallujah, Iraq 2005-2009,"" which has found, among much else, that Fallujah is experiencing higher rates of cancer, leukemia and infant mortality than Hiroshima and Nagasaki did in 1945.""

Although Iraqi civilians have born the brunt of this awful weapon, American soldiers that served in the Gulf and Iraq War are also suffering from the fallout of depleted uranium. This issue is discussed in-depth by the Campaign Against Depleted Uranium, which campaigns to ""ban on the use of uranium in all conventional weapons and weapon systems and for monitoring, health care, compensation and environmental remediation for communities affected by their use.""

Countries around the world have called for the ban of depleted uranium, but unfortunately this demand has fallen on deaf ears. When asked in 2003 about Iraq's complaints about depleted uranium shells, Colonel James Naughton of U.S. Army Material Command stated in a Pentagon briefing that ""They want it to go away because we kicked the crap out of the them.""

Last week, UK foreign secretary William Hague, said that the use of chemical weapons in Syria is ""not something that a humane or civilized world can ignore."" Ironically, Western countries such as the UK and their allies have appeared to ignore the use of weapons that are equally vicious.

When ""non-Westerners"" make use of weapons of mass destruction, there is outrage and calls for military intervention from ""the West,"" but when ""Westerners"" themselves use them, it is totally permissible, and the world can hardly react."

How does a weapon go from one of the most feared to being banned? And what happens once the weapon is finally banned?

With tensions increasing between various nuclear-armed countries, and with the potential for a new arms race of lethal autonomous weapons, these questions seem more timely than ever. For answers, I turned to security and disarmament experts Miriam Struyk, programs director at PAX, and Richard Moyes, managing director of Article 36, both of whom have participated in efforts to ban landmines, cluster munitions, nuclear weapons and autonomous weapons.

The following interview has been heavily edited for brevity, but you can listen to it in its entirety here.

The United Nations is about to complete negotiations that are expected to result in an international ban on nuclear weapons as early as July 7. Why is this ban important, even if nuclear weapons states don’t sign?

Moyes: The use of a single nuclear weapon would potentially kill hundreds of thousands of people. The use of multiple nuclear weapons could have devastating impacts for society and the environment as a whole. These weapons should be illegal because their effects cannot be contained or managed in a way that avoids massive suffering. By changing that legal background, we’re potentially in position to put much more pressure on [the nuclear] states to move towards disarmament as a long-term agenda.

Struyk: For too long nuclear weapons were mythical, symbolic weapons, but we never spoke about what these weapons actually do and whether we think that’s illegal. This treaty brings back the notion of what do these weapons do and do we want that? It also brings democratization of security policy. This process was brought about by several states, by NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] and other actors. It’s so important that it’s actually citizens speaking about nukes and whether we think they’re acceptable or not.

What is an autonomous weapon system and why are you worried about them?

Moyes: Autonomous weapons are really an issue of the challenges that new and emerging technologies present to society, particularly when they’re emerging in the military sphere — a sphere which is essentially about how we’re allowed to kill each other or how we’re allowed to use technologies to kill each other. Autonomous weapons are a movement in technology to a point where we will see computers and machines making decisions about where to apply force, about what objects to destroy, or about who to kill.

One of the ways we’ve sought to orientate to this is by thinking about the concept of meaningful human control. What are the human elements that we feel are important to retain? We are going to see more and more autonomy within military operations. But in certain critical functions around how targets are identified and how force is applied and over what period of time — those are areas where we will potentially see an erosion of a level of human, essentially moral, engagement that is fundamentally important to retain.

Struyk: It depends a lot on your definition of course. I’m still, in a way, a bit of an optimist by saying that perhaps we can prevent the emergence of lethal autonomous weapon systems. But I also see some similarities between lethal autonomous weapons systems and what we had with nuclear weapons a few decades ago — this can lead to an arms race, to more global insecurity, and also to warfare.

An argument in favor of autonomous weapons is that they can ideally make decisions better than humans and potentially reduce civilian casualties. How do you address that argument?

Struyk: We’ve had that debate with other weapon systems, as well, where the technological possibilities were not what they were promised to be as soon as they were used.

It’s an unfair debate because it’s mainly from states with developed industries who are most likely the ones using some form of lethal autonomous weapons systems first. Flip the question and say, ‘what if these systems will be used against your soldiers or in your country?’ Suddenly you enter a whole different debate. I’m highly skeptical of people who say it could actually be beneficial.

Moyes: I feel like there are assertions of “goodies” and “baddies” and our ability to label one from the other. To categorize people and things in society in such an accurate way is somewhat illusory and something of a misunderstanding of the reality of conflict.

Any claims that we can somehow perfect violence in a way where it can be distributed by machinery to those who deserve to receive it and that there’s no tension or moral hazard in that — that is extremely dangerous as an underpinning concept because, in the end, we’re talking about embedding categorizations of people and things within a micro-bureaucracy of algorithms and labels.

Violence in society is a human problem, and it needs to continue to be messy to some extent if we’re going to recognize it as a problem.

Violence in society is a human problem, and it needs to continue to be messy to some extent if we’re going to recognize it as a problem. Richard Moyes

What is the process right now for getting lethal autonomous weapons systems banned?

Struyk: We started the international Campaign to Stop Killer Robots in 2013 — it immediately gave a push to the international discussion, including the one on the Human Rights Council and within the [Convention on] Conventional Weapons (CCW) in Geneva. We saw a lot of debates there in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the last one was in April.

Unfortunately, we’re in a bit of a silence mode right now. But that doesn’t mean there’s no progress. We have 19 states who called for a ban, and more than 70 states within the CCW framework discussing this issue. We know from other treaties that you need these kind of building blocks.

Handing more and more violence over to such processes does not augur well for our societal development. Richard Moyes

What is most important for people to understand about nuclear and autonomous weapon systems?

Struyk: Both systems go way beyond the discussion about weapons systems: it’s about what kind of world and society do we want to live in. None of these — not killer robots, not nuclear weapons — are an answer to any of the threats that we face right now, be it climate change, be it terrorism. It’s not an answer. It’s only adding more fuel to an already dangerous world.

Moyes: Nuclear weapons — they’ve somehow become a very abstract, rather distant issue. Simple recognition of the scale of humanitarian harm from a nuclear weapon is the most substantial thing — hundreds of thousands killed and injured. [Leaders of nuclear states are] essentially talking about incinerating hundreds of thousands of normal people — probably in a foreign country — but recognizable, normal people. The idea that that can be approached in some ways glibly or confidently at all is I think very disturbing. And expecting that at no point will something go wrong — I think it’s a complete illusion."

It is also about prestige, and it is also about respect, both of which Iran believes it is entitled to, and neither of which it feels it sufficiently has.

Remember that Iranians are the inheritors of the great Persian civilization, of cultural treasures such as famed Persian poetry and paintings, jaw-dropping architectural feats and, today, thirteen UNESCO World Heritage sites. From the dynasties of Achaemenid (550 BC) to Safayid (1722 AD), Persian empires once stretched from the Indus River to the Mediterranean Sea.

Fast forward nearly a millennium, and the descendents of this once mighty empire find their nation listed on the ""Axis of Evil"" by the world's most powerful country, which then proceeds to invade and occupy a neighboring country, also on that Axis. Remember also that this same invading country, not half a century before, had overthrown Iranians' democratically elected leader and replaced him with an unpopular monarch whose repressive regime sowed the seeds for the eventual takeover of power by an oligarchy of different, yet arguably no less ruthless, despots.

To develop a nuclear weapon requires a country's smartest scientists and a chunk of its wealth. The five Permanent Members of the Security Council have them, in droves. What greater demonstration of a country's resources, both human and capital, than the development of a nuclear weapon? If the world won't give Iran the respect its Persian forbears merit, then they will solicit the respect by other means, seemingly, necessary.

Nuclear weapon-yielding countries have tried -- and continue to try -- to persuade Iran to relinquish its nuclear capabilities by promising that they would enrich uranium for them. This solution, of course, is premised on the acceptance of Iran's dubious claim that it seeks nuclear power only. It is also premised on Iran's faith in promises made by countries that have overthrown their regime in the past, and which are possibly plotting similarly, if less overtly, today.

It does not help, of course, for Iran's president to find it domestically useful to lambast against the West's staunchest ally in the region and calling for its destruction, however vaguely veiled the rhetoric, or its translation, may be. It is certain, no matter how shocking or unbelievable this may seem to war-weary Israelis, that the Israel element is not a driving motivator in Iran's nuclear weapon program. It's just a handy distraction.

Quasi-red herrings such as the Iranian nuclear energy program, or Israel's nuclear weapons capability, prevent us from finding a solution to this impasse, since they obfuscate the core objectives of Iran's program: respect and prestige, from which influence and prosperity flow.

It is a dastardly shame, a mark of our collective embarrassment that, over 60 years since the destruction of Hiroshima, and nearly 40 years since countries agreed, by law, to eliminate them, nuclear weapons are still perceived as the best guarantor of respect, prestige and influence. This is the fault of the only five legal nuclear weapon possessors, whose membership in the closed nuclear club is the only consistent commonality behind their shared, coveted permanent seats on the Security Council.

With full, cognizant recognition that nuclear weapons are genocidal, ecocidal and, to a high degree, suicidal, it is time that world leaders heed the desperate calls from their populaces and find another, more modern and useful source of national prestige and respect.

It is possible that such 21st century leadership will not emanate from the same corners of the world that led the 20th century down such a horrifically self-destructive course. The countries that lead the way in renewable energy systems, in innovative education and technology, will express the insights, priorities and values that will earn it the respect of peoples the world over.

Nearly ten years of political posturing, both within Iran and without, over the Iranian nuclear weapon issue, have layered the issue with a multitude of complicating factors. For Iran to give up its program now would result in the exact opposite of its primary goal; Iran's ""capitulation"" to the West would amount to losing face, not garnering respect.

The onus is perhaps on the peace-loving, forward-looking, globalized youth, whose own values and behaviors are free, in ways unprecedented from past generations, from provincial dictates and norms, enabled by, of course, the much-heralded new arsenal of social media tools. The Twitter revolutionaries of Egypt and Tunisia found global respect and admiration, not from their wielding 1950s technology or their savvy use of force. Until the leaders of all countries learn that respect and power no longer stem from the antiquated vectors of yesteryear, we may continue to ignore the true impetus of Iran's nuclear program, at our collective peril."

New Hampshire already permitted open carry, but local law enforcement long had discretion to deny individuals a license to carry a concealed weapon. The system, in place for 94 years, let police prevent people who they knew had a violent history from getting license.

On Wednesday, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) signed a law that simply allows residents to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Similar legislation had been twice vetoed by former Gov. Maggie Hassan (D).

“SB12 ensures New Hampshire citizens are guaranteed the fundamental right to carry a firearm in defense of themselves and their families, as prescribed by Article 2a of our state constitution,” Sununu said in a statement. “This common sense legislation aligns our concealed carry laws with that of our neighboring states of Vermont and Maine and states across the country. This is about safety. This is about making sure that the laws on our books are keeping people safe while remaining true to the Live Free or Die spirit that makes New Hampshire the great state that it is. This is a commitment I made to the people of New Hampshire and I am proud today to fulfill that commitment, signing SB12 into law.”

Law enforcement groups across the Granite State had spoken out against the measure. Pat Sullivan, executive director of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, told The Huffington Post last month that the law already in place once allowed him to deny a concealed carry license to a man who came to his station in a tinfoil hat. Under the new law, that man won’t need to get a license to carry a concealed weapon.

“There are many people that carry concealed weapons that are doing good, that aren’t doing bad things. However, there is an element that we deal with as law enforcement, in terms of a regular basis, that are no good,” Sullivan said. “They are committing crimes, violent crimes, and we don’t know whether or not they do or do not have a weapon on them. With the permits, you at least have an idea as to whether or not they have a legal weapon on them. You encounter someone roadside, you don’t know what you have. It kind of just gives that little bit of added security and safety.”

Deidre Reynolds, a volunteer with the New Hampshire chapter of the gun safety group Moms Demand Action, said the measure would make the state less safe.

“Shame on you, Governor Sununu. By signing SB 12 into law, you have made Granite Staters less safe. You and the state lawmakers who rushed this through are compromising public safety standards and making it easier for dangerous people to carry hidden, loaded weapons in public. In doing so, you have put politics over public safety, kowtowing to the extreme agenda of the national gun lobby,” she said in a statement. “Local law enforcement agencies now no longer have the ability to deny permits to potentially dangerous people.”

New Hampshire becomes the 12th state where it’s legal to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Similar legislation to roll back licensing requirements is pending in Texas, Kentucky, Utah and North Dakota."

Nor do they realize that one of the economy’s best secret weapons is facing its greatest crisis since James Madison and Thomas Jefferson created it in 1790.

But then again, most people haven’t built a $4.5 billion fortune based on Census data, the way Jack and Laura Dangermond have.

The Dangermonds, sweethearts since high school, had an epiphany about data while they were graduate students at Harvard in 1967, a time when the university was awash in protests and political strife. They were both working in a lab developing the nascent field of computerized mapping, now better known as geographic information systems.

Their revelation was that good data, clearly presented ― in their case, with maps ― could help people better understand the world and make decisions without all the ruckus roiling their campus and nation.

“We didn’t want to be political. We didn’t want to go to the right or to the left,” Jack Dangermond recently told HuffPost. “We wanted to go forward with science and try to make all these institutions who are our customers better by driving with quantitative methods and science.”

He didn’t realize at the time how valuable their idea would be. But these days, the vast majority of the country’s 1,000 largest businesses use the software that the Dangermonds’ company, Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), creates. Numerous state, local and federal government agencies also use the software, and the company reaps revenues north of $1 billion a year.

Businesses use Esri’s programs to figure out where their customers are and what they want. If Starbucks, Walmart or Target opens a new store, it’s because the data and maps have suggested where it has the best chance to succeed. Governments use the maps for everything from improving policing and disaster response to planning new schools, roads and untold numbers of other services.

“I like to call my work the science of ‘where,’” Dangermond said.

Much of the data his approximately 100,000 U.S. customers use comes from the Census Bureau ― the largest, most important source of the raw information that businesses and governments need to function.

“The world today is all about analytics, and the Census Bureau provides systematic and science-based information about the demographic profile of Americans,” Dangermond said. “Census data is in many ways the lifeblood of these kinds of organizations.”

That’s not an exaggeration ― and it’s why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spends a lot of time trying to persuade Congress and the White House to keep the bureau and its data production well-funded.

Matthew Busch/Bloomberg via Getty Images Jack Dangermond, president and founder of Esri Inc., speaks during a panel discussion at the ETS17 conference in Austin, Texas, March 28, 2017.

“Policymakers need the information arising from these federal activities to formulate sound policy,” said J.D. Foster, the Chamber’s chief economist. “Many Chamber members use this information more directly in their own business planning as they attempt to identify trends in consumer behavior and preferences, resulting in better business decisions and ultimately a stronger overall economy.”

Indeed, the businesses that use this government data generate up to $220 billion a year in economic activity, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce study.

But Congress and the White House don’t seem to share the same high estimation of the Census Bureau, judging by the money they are willing to spend as it gears up for two of the most challenging statistical counts on the planet ― the constitutionally mandated 2020 enumeration of every person in America, and the 2017 Economic Census. The Economic Census surveys the nation’s businesses every five years, and underpins all the government’s reports on things like unemployment and the gross domestic product.

Historically, when the bureau is preparing for the decennial census and starting the Economic Census, it gets a dramatic funding boost to address the enormous tasks. From 2007 to 2008, Congress increased the agency’s budget by nearly $500 million to cover prep work that year alone.

Nothing of that sort is happening this year, and the agency’s funding was already lower than its estimated need. The outgoing Obama administration had recommended a 2017 allocation of $1.63 billion. But Congress never got around to passing a regular budget for this year, instead pushing through a string of stopgap bills that gave the Census Bureau $1.47 billion ― a shortfall of about $160 million. The Trump administration’s proposed 2018 budget would only barely boost it, to $1.5 billion.

The stakes for the Census are especially high this time around. Counting every person in a country with a population of more than 300 million is difficult and expensive; the 2010 count cost about $12.3 billion over several years, or about $92 per housing unit. That was about 30 percent more than it cost in 2000. Part of the escalating cost is simple arithmetic ― the population had grown by 27 million people over that period.

But another factor is the declining percentage of Americans who respond to the Census by mail, forcing the bureau to open offices around the country and hire tens of thousands of people to go out and get that data by going door to door. According to the Government Accountability Office, that follow-up to non-responses is the agency’s largest, most costly field operation.

A failed attempt at using new, hand-held devices to automate more of the work also complicated the 2010 Census. When the costly machines didn’t function properly during tests, the bureau had to abandon them.

Based on a population that is now over 325 million ― and seems to be even more distrustful of the government ― doing the 2020 Census the same way it was done in 2010 would cost about $17 billion, according to the GAO. But Congress, angered by the failures of last time, mandated that the bureau figure out ways to save enough money to carry out the 2020 Census for the same $12.3 billion it cost a decade ago.

The bureau crafted a plan that it estimates will save $5 billion through new counting methods that include using smartphones, gathering internet and phone responses, and mining existing government records to fill out its tabulations. Every one of those new methods, though, is supposed to be developed through scientific consultation and thorough, peer-reviewed testing. That requires more spending from Congress on the front end, not less.

That process is not going well.

The GAO had already labeled the 2020 Census as “high risk,” noting that the bureau was treading into a lot of new territory that it was not especially well-equipped to handle, especially on the technological front. At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, Census Bureau Director John Thompson admitted he was already facing cost overruns of about $400 million in building the new Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing system, known as CEDCaP. He also acknowledged that the bureau has canceled or delayed various test runs of new methods because it doesn’t have the money to do them. It has likewise abandoned planned advertising efforts that were supposed to support comprehensive dry runs of the new methods next year.

Thompson tried to put a brave face on it, and even praised President Donald Trump’s historically skimpy budget request. “We’re glad we’re a priority in the president’s budget,” Thompson told an appropriations subcommittee. “We’re very, very happy about that.”

In a sign that he was not actually very happy, however, Thompson followed up his testimony by abruptly handing in his resignation just five days later. He said he did so in order to give the Trump administration plenty of time to find a replacement, although he had been expected to stay on for the rest of the year to oversee the critical planning stages of the Census.

As of June 30, the bureau will have no director. There isn’t a deputy director in line to replace Thompson, because that person left in January. There isn’t even a political appointee in place who is directly responsible for overseeing the bureau at its parent agency, the Department of Commerce.

Even before the sudden leadership vacuum, Dave Powner, the GAO’s head of IT management oversight, saw trouble looming.

“Historically, if you look at the previous decennials, there’s been a lot of money thrown at this late to bail out late starts and mismanagement and other things,” Powner said at the same hearing where Thompson spoke. “And I think you’re potentially heading down that path again.”

At a June 8 Senate hearing on the Commerce Department’s budget, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross ― a billionaire who was once a Census enumerator ― fielded complaints about the cost overrun, and said the department and Trump’s Office of Management and Budget were undertaking a “crash review of what has been going on.” None of the senators asked about the flatlined budget.

An inadequate Census is a good friend of alternative facts. Jared Bernstein

There are historical examples of what happens when the Census Bureau collects bad or incomplete data. In 1930, after the stock market crash, the estimates of unemployed Americans were so far off that Congress had to order a second unemployment count the following year. The recount finally revealed how severely the Great Depression was biting into America, and allowed policymakers to stop guessing about the effects and actually deal with them.

When both the outgoing George W. Bush administration and the incoming administration of Barack Obama were trying to assess the severity of the Great Recession in 2008, they faced a similar data failure. Employment data was vastly better than in the ’30s, but there was a lack of statistics on key parts of the economy, especially the service sectors.

As Obama’s transition team met in Chicago to start the job of putting together policy responses, the plummeting stock market and escalating job losses had them plenty frightened.

But the gross domestic product ― the big economic indicator that says whether the country’s economy is growing or contracting ― proved to be way off, telling them the recession was not nearly as deep as it turned out to be.

The most recent data available, when economists Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein began working on a rescue package, suggested the economy had shrunk by about 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008. Initial estimates for the fourth quarter found the recession accelerating, with a 3.8 percent drop at the end of the year.

Later accounts of those frantic days revealed that Romer ― based on those numbers ― thought it would take a $1.8 trillion stimulus package to make up the shortfall in the economy. She, Bernstein, and the rest of the Obama transition team didn’t think Congress would be willing to pass such a large package, however. The plan they settled on was for less than half that amount, and Congress ultimately passed a package for $787 billion.

When the economic data was finally fully tallied, the economy had actually shrunk 3.7 percent in the third quarter of 2008 ― not the 0.5 percent the Bureau of Economic Analysis initially estimated. And the final data for the fourth quarter showed one of the worst quarterly collapses in U.S. history ― down 8.9 percent.

NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images Jared Bernstein, chief economist and economic policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, speaks at the daily White House briefing on June 8, 2009.

There’s debate about why such economic estimates were so wrong, but one acknowledged problem is that follow-up surveys were not done frequently enough. There were no quarterly updates measuring the sectors hit hardest by the housing collapse in 2007 and 2008 ― the finance and insurance sectors ― leaving the bureau to extrapolate from private data sources that are simply not as good. And the reason there were no quarterly updates for those sectors is because Congress had not funded them, despite repeated requests from multiple administrations.

Scott Hoyt, a senior director with Moody’s Analytics, said the government still collects data as if manufacturing were as important as it was 40 years ago, rather than putting the emphasis on services.

“We need much better understanding of the service side of the economy, and we’re only just getting there,” he said.

That flaw in the data left Congress and two White House teams blind to the full extent of the financial crisis. In retrospect, Bernstein says the Obama economic team probably couldn’t have pushed for more stimulus, even if they’d had a more accurate picture, because Congress would not have agreed to it regardless of what the data said. “It’s a little bit of a heavy lift to say if only these foresightful legislators had better data, they’d have made better choices,” he said.

At the very least, though, with better information, his team would not have predicted ― as they did on Jan. 9, 2009 ― that passing the stimulus package would keep unemployment under 8 percent. (It eventually hit 10 percent.)

“If we had known things were going to be as bad as they were, of course we wouldn’t have made rosy predictions,” Bernstein told HuffPost.

Perhaps a more important effect of the inaccurate data, he added, was that it convinced policymakers to ease off on the stimulus too soon. By late 2009, when some Democrats on Capitol Hill were pushing for more stimulus spending, the White House criticized such efforts and shifted its focus to austerity plans and ways to trim mounting debt.

“Where I think we ran into trouble was in seeing green shoots that weren’t really there,” Bernstein said. “But that’s an example of confirmation bias and wanting ― there were people in the administration who really wanted to pivot to deficit reduction, and that’s what happened.”

Congress did eventually come up with $8 million to fund the more robust collection of data that could have helped economists understand the recession sooner, although Congress did not fund analysis and publication of that data until Obama’s second term.

The underfunded stimulus isn’t just of interest to economists and historians. It’s a cautionary tale as Congress and the White House are on course to underfund the Census Bureau as it launches its two most important undertakings.

“The problem is that if you cut funding, if the data gets worse, then you’re going to have more of those types of situations, or they could be worse,” said Hoyt. “Our understanding of the economy could be further from what we later recognize to be the truth.”

Of course, the decennial Census covers much broader ground than the economy. It is the basis for creating political districts to make sure Americans are represented evenly; it is the foundation for demographic research in America, and for dozens of other government surveys; and it is key to distributing up to $700 billion from the federal government, according to new estimates from George Washington University’s Institute of Public Policy.

The pervasive impact of Census data explains why the bureau spends years trying to develop and test new counting methods ― and why it’s so troubling to observers that funding is not flowing to meet the demands.

“It’s not looking great. I think it’s all correctable, but the money should be coming at a much higher rate than it is,” said Andrew Reamer, a research professor at GWU. “They’re really doing the biggest reinvention of the Census in decades, and they’re being nickel-and-dimed on the process.”

Jack and Laura Dangermond hoped to transcend politics with facts when they launched Esri nearly 50 years ago. If their business’ dominance is any indication, they were successful.

But in 2017, facts have become political. Trump regularly denigrates basic, verifiable facts, such as unemployment statistics, as phony ― unless he happens to like them. He invents crowd sizes. One of his top advisers infamously defended that invention as an “alternative fact.”

Therein lies yet another danger of a poorly done Census. If people are already prone to disbelieve data based on their politics, what happens when the actual data is not all that accurate?

“An inadequate Census is a good friend of alternative facts,” said Bernstein, who now works with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities."

While Facebook is getting a lot of the credit for making last weekend’s Women’s March happen, a somewhat obscure tech platform called the Action Network was critical to organizers’ efforts. And in the wake of that worldwide protest, the platform is already helping to push the movement forward.

A nonprofit created by progressives who hoped to build a political movement with staying power, the Action Network offers tools for sending emails, organizing marches and events, fundraising, creating petitions, conducting surveys and connecting with other organizers. Activists who use the tools can keep all the email lists and other data they gather ― a feature that Facebook and most other platforms don’t offer.

More than 650 women’s marches in more than 50 countries were organized using the site’s tools last Saturday, according to the network’s own data.

“This was the largest mobilization we’ve ever seen,” Brian Young, the Action Network’s co-founder, told The Huffington Post. Millions of people around the world turned out to march, according to multiple estimates.

Many of the Women’s March organizers used the Action Network’s tools to create embeddable sign-up widgets and maps, like the ones below, that helped spread the word about the events.

Now they’re using the site’s tools to get marchers to sign on for the next things:

The Action Network

As organizers plan new events over the next 100 days, tools like these may help keep the momentum going in a way that Facebook cannot.

Facebook was crucial in mobilizing women after Trump’s election, to be sure. But it can only take activists so far. Theoretically, it’s possible for the pages of one-off events to turn into organizing tools going forward. But it’s much harder for one-off events to connect with each other, as happened in the Saturday marches ― and to stay connected. Plus, Facebook’s algorithms might keep news about future events or marches off your feed.

The Action Network, by relying on email, gives activists a more consistent way to reach local organizers. If you can reach organizers, you can reach the marchers, and you can bring them back to the streets ― or the ballot box.

“The marches that happened all over the world and in the U.S. are a great example of where grassroots organizing and technology combined can mobilize many,” Ceci Hall, who worked to organize sister marches this past weekend, told HuffPost in an email.

“As each march formed, we had the tools and support for them to take ownership of their march on the website,” Hall said. “This was way more effective and powerful [than] would have been possible even 5 years ago.”

Organizers like Hall also made use of Eventbrite, the chat tool Slack and an app called Rally, which helped people organize transportation.

Brian Young, who’d worked on digital campaigns for John Kerry and Howard Dean, co-founded the Action Network in 2012. At the time, progressives were frustrated with how Occupy Wall Street had waned as a movement after the protesters packed up. The idea was to create something that would give activists an infrastructure that could help build lasting movements.

For those tracking progressive politics closely, it may not be surprising that the Action Network became the platform of choice. (It can also be used by journalists: One of the authors of this article uses the Action Network to send his newsletter to subscribers, which is how we noticed the platform’s ubiquity during the Women’s Marches.) It was used to organize rallies against the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, and to arrange the 2012 Black Friday protests against Walmarts around the country, which stunned observers with their breadth.

“But all of those were just road testing the tools for the moment we’re in now,” Young said.

While the pipeline and wage battles advanced under President Barack Obama, the Trump administration is now vowing to reverse that progress. Whether the infrastructure built during the initial protests is able to withstand this renewed pressure will to some extent determine how far Trump is able to push.

Following the outpouring of support, Women’s March organizers are brimming with confidence, though it remains to be seen where the movement goes from here.

Sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, a leading expert on the relationship between social media and political movements, has found the former to be both a blessing and a curse for the latter.

While Facebook and Twitter enabled protest movements to scale up rapidly in places like Tahrir Square in Egypt, the Maidan in Ukraine and Gezi Park in Tufekci’s native Turkey, she has found that such easily organized networks tend to prove fragile ― that they can be broken by a combination of government pressure and bitter internecine fights among allies within Facebook threads.

In the days before social media, nascent movements took much longer to grow to serious scale. But once they did, their bonds were stronger than much of what exists today."

After the United States had its first successful nuclear test in 1945, the nuclear club was soon expanded to include tests by the Soviet Union (1949), the United Kingdom (1952), France (1960), China (1964), India (1974), Pakistan (1998), and North Korea (2006).

As of today, there are nine countries generally recognized to own nuclear weapons, with Iran actively seeking to join this group. In order of the estimated size of the nuclear arsenal, from largest to smallest, are: Russia, the United States, France, China, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. Notably, the five members of the Security Council (Russia, the United States, France, China and the United Kingdom) were the first developers of nuclear weapons and currently have the five largest nuclear stockpiles in the world.

While these nine countries are generally recognized as owning nuclear weapons, that doesn't mean that they are the only countries that possess nuclear weapons. Countries that are not officially recognized as being part of the nuclear club, such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the Netherlands, deploy and store American nuclear weapons as part of NATO agreements. Other non-nuclear countries such as South Korea, Canada and Greece previously had similar arrangements with the United States.

For those tracking the volume of nuclear weapons, the American nuclear stockpile peaked in volume in 1966 and has been dramatically reduced since then. A total of around 67,500 nuclear weapons had been developed by the United States but currently there are only about 8,500 due to dismantling programs. The Russian arsenal is also currently about one-third of the level of its all-time peak volume.

Thank you so much. Thank you for this wonderful welcome. Thank you to the people of Prague. Thank you to the people of the Czech Republic. (Applause.) Today, I'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city, in the center of Europe. (Applause.) And, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, I am also proud to be the man who brought Michelle Obama to Prague. (Applause.)

To Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality. And to the people of the Czech Republic, thank you for your friendship to the United States. (Applause.)

I've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the Czech people in my hometown of Chicago. (Applause.) Behind me is a statue of a hero of the Czech people -- Tomas Masaryk. (Applause.) In 1918, after America had pledged its support for Czech independence, Masaryk spoke to a crowd in Chicago that was estimated to be over 100,000. I don't think I can match his record -- (laughter) -- but I am honored to follow his footsteps from Chicago to Prague. (Applause.)

For over a thousand years, Prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place. You've known war and peace. You've seen empires rise and fall. You've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politics and in poetry. Through it all, the people of Prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and defining their own destiny. And this city -- this Golden City which is both ancient and youthful -- stands as a living monument to your unconquerable spirit.

When I was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances. Few people would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the President of the United States. (Applause.) Few people would have predicted that an American President would one day be permitted to speak to an audience like this in Prague. (Applause.) Few would have imagined that the Czech Republic would become a free nation, a member of NATO, a leader of a united Europe. Those ideas would have been dismissed as dreams.

We are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could not change.

We're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a right for all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like.

We are here today because of the Prague Spring -- because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty and opportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people.

We are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of a new day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long. Sametová Revoluce -- (applause) -- the Velvet Revolution taught us many things. It showed us that peaceful protest could shake the foundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology. It showed us that small countries can play a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts. (Applause.) And it proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.

That's why I'm speaking to you in the center of a Europe that is peaceful, united and free -- because ordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not. They believed that walls could come down; that peace could prevail.

We are here today because Americans and Czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible. (Applause.)

Now, we share this common history. But now this generation -- our generation -- cannot stand still. We, too, have a choice to make. As the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected. And we've seen events move faster than our ability to control them -- a global economy in crisis, a changing climate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons.

None of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily. But all of them demand that we listen to one another and work together; that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences; and that we reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart. That is the work that we must carry on. That is the work that I have come to Europe to begin. (Applause.)

To renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders. That means investments to create new jobs. That means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth. That means a change in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis. (Applause.)

And we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to those emerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have had very little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the International Monetary Fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance. (Applause.)

Now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy. (Applause.) Together, we must confront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of new sources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part. And I pledge to you that in this global effort, the United States is now ready to lead. (Applause.)

To provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance. NATO was founded 60 years ago, after Communism took over Czechoslovakia. That was when the free world learned too late that it could not afford division. So we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known. And we should -- stood shoulder to shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an Iron Curtain was lifted, and freedom spread like flowing water.

This marks the 10th year of NATO membership for the Czech Republic. And I know that many times in the 20th century, decisions were made without you at the table. Great powers let you down, or determined your destiny without your voice being heard. I am here to say that the United States will never turn its back on the people of this nation. (Applause.) We are bound by shared values, shared history -- (applause.) We are bound by shared values and shared history and the enduring promise of our alliance. NATO's Article V states it clearly: An attack on one is an attack on all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time.

The people of the Czech Republic kept that promise after America was attacked; thousands were killed on our soil, and NATO responded. NATO's mission in Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people on both sides of the Atlantic. We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have struck from New York to London, and helping the Afghan people take responsibility for their future. We are demonstrating that free nations can make common cause on behalf of our common security. And I want you to know that we honor the sacrifices of the Czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost.

But no alliance can afford to stand still. We must work together as NATO members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from. We must strengthen our cooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangers that recognize no borders. And we must pursue constructive relations with Russia on issues of common concern.

Now, one of those issues that I'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to the peace of the world -- that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century.

The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclear war was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.

Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up. More nations have acquired these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.

Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city -- be it New York or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be -- for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.

Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction. Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.

Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. (Applause.) And as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it.

So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. (Applause.) I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, ""Yes, we can."" (Applause.)

Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including the Czech Republic. But we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.

To reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians this year. (Applause.) President Medvedev and I began this process in London, and will seek a new agreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold. And this will set the stage for further cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor.

To achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. (Applause.) After more than five decades of talks, it is time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.

And to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the United States will seek a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons. If we are serious about stopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons-grade materials that create them. That's the first step.

Second, together we will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation.

The basic bargain is sound: Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. To strengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles. We need more resources and authority to strengthen international inspections. We need real and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause.

And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation. That must be the right of every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially developing countries embarking on peaceful programs. And no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules. We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and to advance peace opportunity for all people.

But we go forward with no illusions. Some countries will break the rules. That's why we need a structure in place that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences.

Just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to address this threat. North Korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long range missiles. This provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.

Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons. Now is the time for a strong international response -- (applause) -- now is the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through threats and illegal weapons. All nations must come together to build a stronger, global regime. And that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the North Koreans to change course.

Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon. My administration will seek engagement with Iran based on mutual interests and mutual respect. We believe in dialogue. (Applause.) But in that dialogue we will present a clear choice. We want Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically. We will support Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections. That's a path that the Islamic Republic can take. Or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nuclear arms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all.

So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven. (Applause.) If the Iranian threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in Europe will be removed. (Applause.)

So, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the most immediate and extreme threat to global security. One terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction. Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of purpose without delay.

So today I am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years. We will set new standards, expand our cooperation with Russia, pursue new partnerships to lock down these sensitive materials.

We must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade. Because this threat will be lasting, we should come together to turn efforts such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism into durable international institutions. And we should start by having a Global Summit on Nuclear Security that the United States will host within the next year. (Applause.)

Now, I know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda. There are those who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences among nations. And there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worth setting a goal that seems impossible to achieve.

But make no mistake: We know where that road leads. When nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where human progress ends.

There is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted. We must confront it not by splitting apart but by standing together as free nations, as free people. (Applause.) I know that a call to arms can stir the souls of men and women more than a call to lay them down. But that is why the voices for peace and progress must be raised together. (Applause.)

Those are the voices that still echo through the streets of Prague. Those are the ghosts of 1968. Those were the joyful sounds of the Velvet Revolution. Those were the Czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire without firing a shot.

Human destiny will be what we make of it. And here in Prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a better future. Let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world more prosperous and more peaceful than we found it. (Applause.) Together we can do it.

Thank you very much. Thank you, Prague. (Applause.)"
huffpo97,huffpo,"['John A. Tures', 'Political Science Professor', 'Lagrange College In Georgia']",2016-04-20 13:39:19-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-a-tures/did-the-assault-weapons-b_b_9740352.html,"On the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, it's worth asking whether the assault weapons ban, which was in effect during the time, actually worked. Analysis of 108 shootings with five or more deaths showed that the ban was more successful than in years where there wasn't a ban, and such mass shootings have dramatically increased since the ban expired.

The Columbine shooting by a pair of students which killed 13 at the Colorado school, has been held up by assault weapons ban opponents as a reason why the ban didn't work, listing each case of a shooting (whether they involved assault weapons or not). But focusing on cases from a decade doesn't tell us much about all of the shootings over years before and after the ban, to see if the ban actually reduced such mass killings.

To analyze the issue, I look at all rampage killings, school shootings, workplace shootings, family massacres and mass killings over religion, race and politics, from 1973 to the present. Each case analyzed had five or more deaths, with many wounded.

In this study of 108 mass shootings, 92 of them occurred before the assault weapons ban, and after it as well, with only 16 mass shootings in the ten years in which we had an assault weapons ban. If you divide those by the number of years (34 for non-ban years and 10 for ban years), you find that we had 2.71 shootings per year in non-ban years, and 1.6 shootings per ban year. That means we had 1.69 times as many mass shootings in non-ban years.

Let's break it down by the timing of the shooting. Before the assault weapons ban, there were 2.04 mass shootings per year (1973-1994). So the ban did reduce the number of mass shootings.

What's even more frightening is what happened in the 11 years after the assault weapons ban was allowed by the GOP Congress to expire. We had 46 mass shootings per year from 2005 to 2015, or 4.18 mass shootings per year. That's more than 2.61 times as many mass shootings as when we had the assault weapons ban.

Critics are likely to claim that other means of killings were frequently employed during the years of the assault weapons ban. That isn't supported either by the evidence. There were four cases of vehicular killings with three or more dead and 10 or more injured between 1973 and the present. None happened during the assault weapons ban. The same can be said of causing deadly fires and plane crashes (four cases, none during the ban). There was the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building by a domestic terrorist, of course.

Those who support gun control have hyped each shooting. But it hasn't translated into support for restricting firearms. Instead, it's had the opposite effect, making people more willing to support gun rights, or go out and buy a firearm. Gun control advocates need to show how laws like assault weapons ban worked, in America, Europe, Australia, etc.

Yes, there were tragedies during the ban, like Columbine. Perhaps more draconian punishments and civil suits against those who helped provide the weapons for the killers might deter future straw purchases. But even with the horrible event of 1999, the data shows that the assault weapons ban reduced mass shootings in America, and letting the ban expire dramatically increased the number of mass shootings in the United States.

On Thursday, December 28, police responded to a report of gunfire on Adrian Street, just south of G Street. They arrived at 7:30 p.m. and found a vehicle on fire. After the fire was put out, officers found a woman unconscious and suffering from gunshot wounds in the trunk. Police said, by the time D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services arrived, they found “no signs consistent with life.”

Neighbors said they heard multiple gunshots in the alley behind the 800 block of Adrian Street, SE, and moments later they saw a raging fire. Kerrice Lewis was reportedly heard screaming as she tried to escape from the trunk.

Lewis was orphaned at the age of 11 and raised by her grandparents.

Her grandfather, William Sharp, told Fox 5 DC he feels as though his heart has been ripped out. He said “her mother died of a brain aneurysm and her father was tragically murdered up in the D.C. area.” Lewis struggled deeply with the loss of her parents. She recently served time in jail. Her grandfather said she was striving to turn her life around — Lewis worked on construction sites and Sharp said she “was very excited because she had just finished taking some classes and was looking forward to taking some more.” He said she was a “free spirit” and “full of life” and that “she would light up a room, just talking and laughing.”

WJLA Lewis’ best friend and exgirlfriend, Mercedes Rouhlac

Mercedes Rouhlac, the victim’s best friend and ex girlfriend, told WJLA she “talked to her everyday.” Rouhlac said she “just kept calling her” and wondering why Lewis wasn’t answering her phone.

Heartbroken friends of the victim are disappointed by the lack of media coverage. When lesbians are murdered the distinct media bias keeps the general population in the dark. This bias is multiplied where “butch” lesbians are concerned, and compounded if you’re a woman of color. Lesbian relationships are typically downplayed, sexuality is often omitted, and there’s a resulting lack of focus (with both investigations and media) on potential hate crimes — even where the murder is exceptionally horrific (as in this case).

In Washington DC a 20 lesbian women was tied up in her trunk after being kidnapped. Shot then burned alive in her car. My friend who knew her is broken atm. — Bob’s Pancussy (@LilaBoBina) January 2, 2018

However, flu vaccination rates have plateaued. Last season, only 43.3 percent of adults got the vaccine and only 59 percent of children. Among health care workers, only 78.6 percent got shots, similar to the 2015 to 2016 season’s 79 percent rate.

Public health officials at the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases’ annual flu news conference were at a loss to explain the stagnant rate.

But Patsy Stinchfield, senior director of infection prevention and control at Children’s Minnesota, had an idea: Nobody likes shots.

“People don’t like needles,” she said at Thursday’s conference. “And health care professionals actually have needle phobia just like the general population does.”

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Flu vaccine rates have plateaued in recent years.

It’s safe to guess that most people don’t enjoy getting jabbed. But for a small minority of the population, it can grow into trypanophobia, or fear of needles, when the aversion to injections is so severe it produces a physical response, even fainting. Researchers estimate it affects 3 percent to 10 percent of the population.

Sometimes the phobia is so intense that it prevents a person from getting much-needed medical care. In an article for the British Journal of Anaesthesia, clinical psychologist Kate Jenkins writes of three patients she worked with to overcome needle phobia: a 24-year-old man whose fear was so extreme he refused to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a pregnant woman who refused blood tests and a woman who had avoided medical care for so long she ended up with a 9-pound breast tumor.

Addressing needle fear is the driving force behind efforts to research other methods of delivering vaccines, including patches and sprays. But until a reliable alternative for flu vaccine hits the market, people are going to have to rely on psychological coping strategies to get through their doctor’s visit.

Jenkins writes that breathing exercises, relaxation strategies and controlled exposure to the thing they fear most are good ways to help people with milder needle phobias. But those who usually faint may need a more intense course of therapy.

Stinchfield’s advice? Breathe through the mouth, let your arm hang limp like a “spaghetti noodle” and then “imagine your favorite place in the whole wide world.”

Because needle phobia is so common, and because there are so many ways to approach the problem, we asked HuffPost readers what helped them get over their fear of needles. Here are four tips from readers that mirror doctors’ suggestions to dull pain, practice mindfulness or engage in immersive therapy.

1. Numb your skin with ice

After having to receive and give myself a shot every day for 34 weeks and twice a day for four weeks, I’ve learned that if you take a deep breath and count to three, I can handle it. Numbing the skin with an ice cube helps too. Can’t even feel it. ― Morgan A. Flannery

2. Listen to your favorite music

I have them lay me down, I don’t look, I relax because tensing makes it worse, and I usually have my favorite music in my headphones. I have had a lot of needles in the last two years (chemo, iron infusions, high risk pregnancy, etc.), and that combination has helped me a lot. Lastly I’m a hard stick and letting the staff know ahead of time is beneficial! Don’t let anyone dig around for a vein ― have them find a phlebotomist who is good at sticking!!! ― Julie Conant Wallace

3. Eat a snack before and after

I’m a fainter. I’ve started eating something, at least a granola bar, before AND after shots. I have to make a conscious effort to breathe in and out and to not hold my breath during the injection. I’ve also started telling the people drawing my blood or giving me shots that I’m a bleeder and I faint. It makes them be extra careful with me even if it’s been over a year since my last fainting spell. 💁🏼 ― Taylor Stoner

4. Face your fear head-on

Got over my fear of them in College when my friends made me type my blood for biology class, donate blood at the Red Cross, get my ears pierced and get my vaccinations all updated (had not been done since I was in grade school). This was all accomplished in the space of 4 hours! I used to break out in hives and get hysterical if the doctor even mentioned using a needle on me. Now I could care less. ― Nancy Foulke

Of course, there’s also the question of why some children grow up to develop extreme aversions to needles in the first place. A few studies suggest there are some risk factors, and they include parents’ anxiety about needles, painful past experiences with injections and a high number of same-day injections from ages 4 to 6.

It’s worth it to get over the phobia to get that flu shot each year, though. It’s especially important for people with chronic conditions including diabetes, lung disease and heart disease; those who are more susceptible to the illness; and people who are in frequent contact with others who are too young or medically compromised to be vaccinated.

And despite the myths, the vaccine doesn’t cause the flu, but it can come with some mild side effects, including fever, nausea and soreness at the injection site."

New Carlisle News photographer Andy Grimm was rushed to a local hospital after he was shot in his side, according to the publication, which also reports that Grimm underwent surgery and is “expected to recover.”

”I’m sorry, brother”: No warning before Ohio deputy shot news photographer. He mistook camera for a weapon. Story: https://t.co/nXBPbHtVa1 pic.twitter.com/NdIUtQHj2J — AP Eastern U.S. (@APEastRegion) September 7, 2017

Grimm had reportedly left the newspaper’s office at around 10 p.m. to take photographs of lightning.

In a 10:16 p.m. post to a New Carlisle Facebook group, Grimm reached out to locals for suggestions for a “good spot to watch the storms.”

Facebook

Grimm was driving along the town’s Main Street when he noticed a traffic stop ahead, according to New Carlisle News. He said he pulled into a nearby parking lot “in full view” of the police officer on duty, intending to take photographs there.

Grimm said he was shot without warning when he emerged from his vehicle and began setting up his tripod and camera.

New Carlisle News identified the officer who shot Grimm as Deputy Jake Shaw.

In body cam video of the incident obtained by The Associated Press, Grimm can be heard wailing in pain as Shaw rushed to his aid.

“Andy, I’m sorry, brother,” Shaw said in the clip. “Oh please let him be alright. I thought it was a gun.”

Following the shooting, Grimm told the New Carlisle News that he didn’t want the deputy to “lose his job” over the shooting.

“I know Jake. I like Jake. I don’t want him to lose his job over this,” Grimm said.

Shaw was later placed on administrative leave following the shooting, reported AP.

Posts on the New Carlisle Facebook group — the one Grimm had commented on before the shooting — indicate that the town is home to a tight-knit community. Following Grimm’s shooting, residents referred to the photographer and the officer by name. Many offered their well wishes to Grimm, and several defended Shaw’s actions.

“I’m sure Shaw didn’t shoot Andy on purpose,” wrote one resident.

“Andy ... [we] are up praying for you right now. Shaw ― your a good person and a good cop. Your job is not easy ... Your both in my prayers tonight,” wrote another.

Some locals, however, called for Shaw to face punishment over the shooting.

“Cops need to wake up!” wrote one commenter. “I call for Shaw’s Badge,” said another. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is looking into the incident, according to the Dayton Daily News.

A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help cover Grimm’s medical expenses."

Shemel Mercurius, 16, was watching over her 3-year-old cousin in a Brooklyn apartment on May 31, 2016, when Taariq Stephens, now 25, allegedly barged in and shot her after a brief argument, according to authorities.

Former New York Police Officer Kyle Thomas Daly, who was among those responding to the shooting, gave an account of what Mercurius told police in testimony at Stephens’ murder trial on Monday.

“I put on gloves, laid her down and began rendering aid,” Daly said, according to The New York Daily News. “She regained consciousness and gave me her name and date of birth.”

Daly, who now works for a Long Island police department, said that the teen told a detective that Stephens wanted to date her but she wasn’t interested. She said she had met and exchanged numbers with Stephens at a child care center a week earlier, according to Daly.

He told the court that Mercurius, bloodied next to her crying cousin, drifted in and out of consciousness while an ambulance took 20 minutes to arrive. She later died at a local hospital.

Video footage presented at the trial shows Stephens forcing his way inside of the apartment, according to People.

Lona Junien, Mercurius’ friend who was at the scene, testified about what she observed between the two.

“The person pushed her. The person said ‘Don’t ever lie to me.’ She was screaming, he took out the gun and shot her,” Junien testified, according to the Daily News."
huffpo104,huffpo,['Reuters Huffpost'],2017-03-23 09:24:17-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-lawmaker-shot-dead-kiev_us_58d3cb34e4b0b22b0d1a4c1b,"KIEV, March 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine accused Russia of “state terrorism” after a former Russian lawmaker and key witness in a treason case against former leader Viktor Yanukovich was shot dead in broad daylight outside a hotel in central Kiev on Thursday.

Russia called the allegation “absurd.”

Former MP Denis Voronenkov was killed by an assailant who was armed with a pistol. The assailant was wounded by Voronenkov’s bodyguard and later died in hospital, police said.

Voronenkov fled to Ukraine last year and was helping the Ukrainian authorities build a treason case against Yanukovich, Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin former president.

Voronenkov had also spoken out against Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, although he voted for the move at the time.

President Petro Poroshenko said the killing “is an act of state terrorism on the part of Russia, which (Voronenkov) was forced to leave for political reasons.”

“Voronenkov was one of the main witnesses of Russian aggression against Ukraine and, in particular, the role of Yanukovich regarding the deployment of Russian troops to Ukraine.”

Relations between Kiev and Moscow are at an all-time low after Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of separatist fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people.

Poroshenko said it was “no accident” that Voronenkov was shot on the same day as a warehouse storing tank ammunition was blown up at a Ukrainian military base.

Moscow denied any involvement Voronenkov’s murder .

“We believe that all the falsehoods that can already be heard about much-hyped Russian involvement are absurd,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying about the killing.

Voronenkov, 45, had been placed on a Russian federal wanted-list in connection with an alleged $5 million property fraud. He came to Ukraine with his wife, opera singer Maria Maksakova, who was also an MP.

Voronenkov was gunned down on his way to meet another former Russian parliamentarian, Ilya Ponomarev, who was the only member of the Duma who voted against the annexation of Crimea.

“There’s an obvious theory - I’ve said that Voronenkov wasn’t a crook, but a deadly dangerous investigator for Russian officials,” Ponomarev wrote on Facebook.

Television footage showed Ponomarev and Maksakova leaving the scene in a car together with Ukraine’s General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.

Lutsenko called the shooting a “cynical murder.”

“He had provided investigators of the military prosecutor’s office with highly important (witness) testimony for the case. This was a typical show execution of a witness by the Kremlin,” Lutsenko said.

Yanukovich fled Ukraine during the 2013-2014 Maidan street protests, which he said were tantamount to a “coup” organized by armed nationalist radicals. The former leader has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving his life by helping him escape from Ukraine."

Suspects shot at the police officers after the car was stopped with spike strips and the off-duty officer, an 11-year department veteran who lives nearby, came out with his firearm to offer assistance, according to the statement.

The on-duty officers had asked the 38-year-old to get on the ground and he complied, but then they recognized him and told him to stand up and walk toward him.

“At this time, a responding officer (36-year old white male with over 8 years of service) just arriving in the area observed this and fearing for his safety and apparently not recognizing the off-duty officer, discharged a shot, striking the off-duty officer in the arm,” the statement says.

The victim was treated in hospital but has since been released, police confirmed. His lawyer, Rufus J. Tate Jr., told local news outlets that he considers the incident more severe than an accident. The police department has given no description of a threat, he said.

“This is the first time that we are aware, that a black professional, in law enforcement, himself being shot and treated as an ordinary black guy on the street,” Tate told Fox News. “This is a real problem.”

Police have launched an investigation into the incident during which one of the three suspects in the car theft was also shot in the ankle.

The officer who fired his gun has been placed on administrative leave, along with six other officers, according to the police statement.

Neither the victim nor his fellow officer have been publicly identified. St. Louis Police Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The news comes after authorities released dash cam footage on Tuesday of Philando Castile’s shooting by St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez in Minnesota. Footage showed that Castile, a black man, also complied with the officer’s orders before being shot and killed.

Yanez was found “not guilty” of manslaughter by a jury but has been fired from his police department. The Castile case has highlighted a fear that there may be no justice for black Americans killed in police shootings, advocates say.

“It’s just like, a punch in my stomach, it’s a punch in the gut,” Castile’s friend, John Thompson, told HuffPost Tuesday. “Look what happened to Philando for doing all the right things. It hurts. Every time I talk about it, it hurts.”"

In an interview with InStyle editor-in-chief Laura Brown three weeks before her powerful Golden Globes speech earlier this month, the 63-year-old entertainment icon said she had met with someone who offered to help with a political campaign, but she shut them down. InStyle published the interview on Thursday.

“I’ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not,” Oprah said during the interview. “And so it’s not something that interests me. I don’t have the DNA for it. ... That’s not for me.”

While there has been an outpouring of support for a President Oprah, the media mogul suggested during the InStyle interview that it wouldn’t be a good move for her personally.

“Gayle ― who knows me as well as I know myself practically ― has been calling me regularly and texting me things, like a woman in the airport saying, ‘When’s Oprah going to run?’” Oprah told Brown. “So Gayle sends me these things, and then she’ll go, ‘I know, I know, I know!

The man credited with firing the shots that chased off the gunman who killed 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday is speaking out.

And Stephen Willeford wants people to remain focused on the victims.

“All I want to stress today is the people in that church, they’re friends of mine, they’re family,” Willeford told 40/29 News, an ABC-affiliated station in Arkansas.

He said:

“And every time I heard a shot I knew that that probably represented a life. I was scared to death. I was. I was scared for me. I was scared for everyone of them, and I was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away.”

Willeford said he grabbed his rifle from a safe and ran barefoot to the church when his daughter told him about the shooting. Once there, he confronted 26-year-old gunman Devin Patrick Kelley and the two traded gunfire.

“I know I hit him,” Willeford said.

When Kelley fled the scene, Willeford flagged down a pickup truck belonging to local resident Johnnie Langendorff.

“The gentleman with the rifle came to my truck as the shooter took off, and he briefed me quickly on what had just happened, and said that we had to get him and so that’s what I did,” Langendorff told KSAT.

Langendorff said the chase eventually reached speeds of 95 mph. En route, the pair of good Samaritans contacted 911 to update authorities on the direction the gunman was heading.

During the pursuit, Kelley reportedly made his own call.

“The suspect used his cellphone, notified his father that he had been shot and didn’t think he was going to make it,” Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told NBC News.

The chase ended when Kelley’s vehicle flipped into a ditch.

“It’s like he just gave up,” Langendorff told KSAT. “He just kind of went off in the ditch, hit a hay bale from what I could see and then he just never moved after that.”

Police said Kelley was found dead with three gunshot wounds: two likely from Willeford and a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Despite the gunfight and pursuit, Willeford insisted that he was not a hero.

“I’m no hero. I am not,” he told 40/29 News. “I think my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done and I just wish I could’ve gotten there faster.”"

Dionisio Garza III, 26, fatally shot his first victim, 56-year-old Eugene Linscomb, with a pistol, before picking up an AR-15 assault-style rifle and spraying bullets into responding police cruisers and a Houston Police Department helicopter, officials said at a press conference.

By the time the mayhem ended, Garza had shot and injured six people, including two officers. All six are expected to survive.

Amazing no officer was seriously hurt or killed. Just look at this HPD vehicle. Thankful 4 our officers #khou11 pic.twitter.com/x9izldUAt1 — Marcelino Benito (@MarcelinoKHOU) May 29, 2016

The tragedy was among the more than 150 mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people -- not including the shooter -- are shot and/or killed in a single event, at the same general time and location. Other media outlets use a stricter definition of mass shooting, only counting higher profile, less common episodes in which three or more victims are fatally shot in a public space.

Regardless of how we characterize this outburst of gun violence, the incident again highlights problems in our mental health care system and easy access to the military-style firearms used in a number of recent deadly massacres.

It's still unclear what led Garza to travel from his home in California to Texas, but authorities say he arrived in Houston on Saturday with plans to meet friends. Police believe he may have camped out overnight at Memorial Auto and Tire before ambushing Linscomb shortly after he arrived at the shop.

Houston Police Lt. John McGalin said at a press conference Tuesday that he thought Garza had chosen his specific location because it offered a tactical advantage to shoot at responding officers.

""He had access to three corners. He was backed up against a fence, so he didn't have to worry about anyone getting behind him,"" said McGalin.

Garza opened fire on the first responding officer, forcing him to retreat and call for backup.

""Our primary responding officer is lucky to be alive and ... unhurt,"" the Houston Police Department wrote in a Facebook post.

In the nearly hour-long firefight that ensued, Garza shot two constables, hitting one's bulletproof vest and the other in the hand. Another bullet struck a gas pump at a nearby station, starting a fire.

A civilian later identified as John Wilson, 30, also reportedly attempted to stop the shooter with his own firearm, but, like police, appeared to be overpowered by Garza.

“What he did was very brave, but officers are trained in these active shooter situations, and obviously he wasn’t able to engage,” said acting Houston Police Chief Martha Montalvo. “He was outgunned and probably outmaneuvered, and as far as his tactical training, wasn’t at the same speed as our suspect. Just call the police and let us do what we have to do, and [do] not put yourself in a situation where you become a victim.”

Wilson was shot in the leg but survived.

A SWAT sniper was able to get a clear shot at Garza after a local resident let officers enter a house that overlooked the location.

Citizens in the area allowed one of our SWAT officers access to their house that enabled the officer to stop the threat #HouNews — Houston Police (@houstonpolice) May 31, 2016

Garza's family members believe he suffered from PTSD after returning from active duty in 2013, and say that something in him ""snapped"" in the weeks before the shooting.

""He did two tours in Afghanistan. I think he was proud to be in the military, but I know he went through a lot,"" Garza's stepmother told ABC 7. ""I think he was always haunted by everything that happened, what he saw.""

When Garza returned from duty, he began posting anti-Islamic comments on social media, his cousin, Ahmad Alkuteifani, told ABC 13. In recent months, Garza had tweeted comments condemning Muslims, touted conspiracy theories about the end of the world and expressed support for presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Alkuteifani also suggested his cousin may have chosen to carry out his attack in Texas because of its loose gun laws, which allow people to openly carry firearms like the AR-15 he used.

Authorities have not yet said how Garza obtained his guns. But semi-automatic weapons like the ones used by mass shooters in San Bernardino, California, Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado, are widely available across the U.S., except in a few states that have passed legislation restricting certain types of assault weapons.

AR-15s are modeled off the standard-issue U.S. military rifle that's been in use since the Vietnam War. Their magazines typically hold 30 rounds, but can be legally outfitted with high-capacity magazines in most states. They're accurate at a range of hundreds of yards, making them a preferred firearm for sport shooters and hunters. In fact, they're the ""most popular rifle"" in the U.S., according to the National Rifle Association.

With millions of AR-15s in civilian hands and hundreds of thousands of new military-style rifles flooding the market each year, according to recent manufacturer reports, the overwhelming majority of these weapons will never be used in a crime. But when they are, it's clear that their firepower can make the results especially devastating."

As you would expect -- there are those on the right calling for teachers to now be armed, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) believes that ""the mass slaughter would have gone differently if Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung had been armed."" Then there are those on the left who advocate the polar opposite; Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) ""said Sunday that she plans to introduce an assault weapons ban bill on the first day of the new Congress."" Some also cite mental illness and the lack of access to good mental health care as the main factor in the Sandy Hook killings. Respecting the collective and individual rights of the second amendment should also recognize proportionate and rational means in exercising the right to bear arms. Debates centering on whether (or not) assault rifles have a place within a civilian context should not be presupposed by partisan dogma. This is not the time for compartmentalized political arguments (a la fiscal cliff) but a very real opportunity, created by a tragic set of circumstances, to reflect on the relationship that assault weapons have with American society.

As a British veteran of twenty years and with over ten operational tours of duty spanning Northern Ireland, Macedonia, Bosnia, and three tours in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo -- the assault rifle has provided me with personal protection and security for over two decades. On operations, the assault rifle is your protective blanket, it is your most important possession and it does not leave your sight. You train, fight, eat and sleep with this weapon. It is the soldier's holy grail -- it is not the business of day-to-day citizens let alone a mother bringing up children in a family environment.

Security landscapes that justify assault rifles reside within power vacuums; countries where civil law and order is broken, where police and security forces are dysfunctional or cease to exist for the protection of society; where asymmetric and irregular warfare is being prosecuted by militias and terrorists on a daily basis and where we, as the occupying forces, frequently find ourselves in the crosshairs of an insurgents rifle. These semi-automatic weapons are designed to enable soldiers and law enforcement personnel to deliver a magazine of ammunition (around thirty bullets) onto a target with precision and lethal effect. This is not America or other parts of the Western civilized world -- these are conflicts and contexts that I would wish upon no decent human being. A man was arrested yesterday in Indiana for owning 47 guns and ammunition and demonstrating threatening behavior towards an elementary school. Why does a member of society in a civilized country require such an armory of weapons?

Pulling the trigger on an assault rifle is but the last action of a long chain of events and regulation for a soldier. Health and sanity checks are completed on new recruits well before they are permitted anywhere near a weapon -- loaded or not. That is not to say later down the road some may fall victim to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or become psychologically damaged due to combat experience. We rely on the esprit de corps and close relationships developed within military units to identify behavior that maybe impair future judgment amongst our brothers in arms -- not fail safe -- but amelioration to some extent. Many hours are spent training on 'dry' weapons involving no ammunition; dismantling the weapon hundreds of times and rebuilding it; cleaning and learning the function of all its components; being professionally educated in the rules of engagement and conflict; understanding ballistic theory and the devastating lethal effects that a high velocity round has on flesh and bone -- then maintaining this level of expertise throughout your service life. Then there is the firing range, and many hours spent honing marksmanship, learning the 'combat pause', dealing with malfunctions and stoppages and refining safety procedures. All it takes is for one negligent discharge to be pointing in the wrong direction and the consequences are deadly -- no one wants to be the perpetrator of a blue-on-blue. Such intense training and education, paralleled with close relationships only brought about by battle and mission experience, should not be expected of civil society, but then owning and operating assault rifles outside of high threat environments, law enforcement agencies and the military, shouldn't be expected either.

And once the training has ensured the necessary preparedness, the assault rifles and unexpended ammunition are carefully accounted for and returned to the armory, a secure building that is usually manned twenty four hours a day by experienced individuals, monitored by close circuit television and encompassing at least two layers of safety procedure required to access weapons. If such security requirements to keep semi-automatic weapons are deemed necessary by the military and law enforcement agencies, why have the same standards not been applied to civil society?

The right to bear arms should not be forgotten at this juncture. The second amendment stating: ""a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"" was adopted on December 15, 1791. America has armed herself successfully to ensure its security as a free state and in the twenty first century, boasts the most ""well regulated militia"" in the world, with an exemplary record in protecting its citizens and homeland. Collectively, assault rifles are an appropriate and necessary weapon for the military and law enforcement agencies to exercise and uphold the second amendment with conviction and effect. The right to bear arms as a general matter is part of the fabric of American culture. In addition, it would be impossible to completely disarm and demobilize those individuals seeking to exercise that right. Collective versus individual rights remain the focal debate and both should be acknowledged and respected but at the same time, proportionality should be applied. Individuals in the US do not exist in a security vacuum; it is therefore unreasonable and disproportionate to argue that a semi-automatic weapon is required for domestic self-defense.

I have a brother who suffers from severe learning disability or what used to be labeled 'mentally handicapped.' He is a very vulnerable boy but would not know what a semi-assault rifle is, let alone what to do with one. There is still a stigma in Western society, even today, about confronting those that do not fit into the norms associated with accepted behavior. We all have our part to play in affording these vulnerable individuals a little of our time and support - especially when they are at a young and influential age. Those with aggressive or potentially threatening tendencies should be nurtured and cared for by society. More importantly, the families that best understand and identify the changes of behavior, like soldiers that form closely developed relationships with their brothers in arms, need to have access to education and medication as preventative notion, not a cure. Mental health is not just an issue for the government; we are all responsible for increasing our own awareness and compassion for those vulnerable members of our society less fortunate than ourselves. The answer does not reside in arming our teachers with semi-automatic rifles and training them to be lethal marksman. It would, however, be sensible to increase the restrictions on access to assault rifles with immediate effect, whilst a plan to remove these weapons from civil society was hatched.

There is an unfortunate requirement to operate assault rifles as a measure of personal security in certain locations around the globe. High threat landscapes that house enemies with ideologies that do not respect human or civil rights qualify for such extreme measures -- schools, cinemas or other public facilities in civilized countries do not. Assault rifles demand highly tuned and experienced operators educated in all facets of semi-automatic weapons. Soldiers and law enforcement personnel qualify -- mothers, fathers, hunters and every member of domestic civil society do not. Moreover, access to existing semi-automatic weapons should encompass stringent measures with layered security procedures to ensure breeches in public safety are minimized. Revisiting aspects of gun ownership should not be divisive or politically charged. Continued debate should exist when massacres are still occurring and children cannot learn in schools without fear of being gunned down. From experience, disarming and demobilizing a population or militia is complex and requires time, significant resource and careful policing. Arming public servants with semi-automatic weapons is not the answer, and the aspiration to improve support for those vulnerable members of our society should be disconnected from debates on gun law. In the short term, significantly improved security regulation constraining easy access to assault rifles that already exist amongst American society should be implemented. In the long term -- I hope that common sense will prevail and individuals that exercise the right to bear arms can do so without resorting to the use of semi-automatic weapons."

From the founding of the organization in 1871 to the early 1970s, they were heavily regarded as an honorable coalition. By the mid 1970s, they became immersed in turmoil when outside factions revolted against the high ranking officials and took over the organization. Their focus drastically switched from conservation, marksmanship and hunting to political mobilization and protecting second amendment rights.

Former notorious leaders Harlon Carter and Neal Knox formulated a strategy to expand their organization's membership and develop strong allies with numerous representatives within the Republican Party. Knox assiduously worked to undermine the strength of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). They made their legislative breakthrough in 1986 when the Volker-McClure Act was passed by Congress. During this juncture, the NRA's membership increased to 3 million members.

Despite their successes, there was bitter divisiveness between members and the leadership. It became a revolving door for several executives, but in 1991, at their national convention, Wayne LaPierre became their executive vice president. As a former staff lobbyist for the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA), LaPierre was familiar with the inner workings of the government. The Institute for Legislative Action is the lobbying arm for the NRA. By the mid 1990s, the organization had become an influential force with an obscene amount of power in Washington, D.C.

The topic of gun control rose to the forefront of the nation's conscience due to the plethora of deaths from incessant gun violence recently. President Obama and then presidential candidate Governor Mitt Romney refused to take on questions regarding gun reform measures during the 2012 presidential campaign. The Trayvon Martin tragedy among others reintroduced the public to the NRA because of their steadfast defense in favor of the Stand Your Ground laws in various states across the nation. But one incident left the organization eerily quiet.

On December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook Elementary School was the site to one of the most gruesome mass-murders in U.S. history. A deranged gunman killed 20 innocent children and 7 adults including his own mother. One week after the tragedy, NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre finally held an infamous press conference where he blamed everything under the sun except for his own organization's destructive practices. Since that moment, the NRA's outright defiance has been a spectacle for the world to see.

Their asinine solution to the problem of school shootings has been to arm faculty members and tell communities to have a rotating force of armed policemen at individual schools. They refuse to address the realities facing their organization and the nation as it pertains to guns and gun ownership. Their latest missteps have been creating a video game where kids as young as the age of four can shoot guns and crafting a commercial featuring President Obama's daughters referencing how they have armed guards with them at all times.

There have been 61 mass-murders at schools since Columbine High School in 1999. The issues of war weaponry being available for public consumption, high capacity magazine clips, and background checks for gun purchasers have been at the forefront of the national conversation surrounding gun reform. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) as well as President Obama and Vice President Biden have expressed their urgency in compiling comprehensive legislation around gun reform in the nation. Some congressional members have introduced the idea of reenacting the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) that expired under President Bush in 2004.

Retired General Stanley McChrystal during a conversation on the MSNBC morning program Morning Joe stated, ""I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look -- I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want -- but we have to protect our children and our police and we have to protect our population. And I think we have to take a very mature look at that."" This same sentiment is shared by the majority of the nation, but the NRA is sticking to their guns.

President Obama dispatched Vice President Biden to assemble a taskforce to develop gun control proposals. Vice President Biden and his collaborators returned yesterday with a set of proposals to legislate gun control policy. Some are calling it the most sweeping gun control policy in a generation. Now it is on Congress to proceed in the right direction to ensure these measures become the law of the land. At this point, it may be easier said than done.

GOP and Democratic congressmen, congresswomen and senators are quite reluctant to even welcome the notion of gun control because they're worried about losing their seats in Congress. Their inaction could have disastrous ramifications in the present and future if they continue putting our children and adults at risk on a daily basis. Every day that passes, more people are dying in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Oakland among others due to gun violence.

It is time to act now.

There are over four million members in the NRA today. They've been successful in brainwashing some of their members through foolhardy rhetoric and propaganda. As a result, gun sales have exponentially soared throughout the nation.

Memo to the NRA leadership: If you're the civil rights organization that you claim you are, stop defending the indefensible before more innocent lives are taken."

""The damage that would be done by [Clinton's] policies and her Supreme Court picks would destroy individual freedoms, and therefore destroy the America we all love,"" said the group's top lobbyist, Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Affairs. ""We cannot let that happen. We have to unite, and we have to unite right now.""

The endorsement came after a fiery speech by NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, the group's longtime leader. LaPierre railed against Clinton, promising that she would strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights. Trump took the stage after Cox.

The NRA's Trump endorsement came earlier than previous NRA presidential endorsements, which typically take place later in the election cycle. And it wasn't always a sure thing. Unlike most Republican candidates for national office, Trump endorsed a ban on assault weapons earlier in his career.

“I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,” Trump wrote in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve.

But at the gun rights group's 2015 annual meeting, Trump offered a preview of his future platform, telling the crowd, “I love the NRA. I love the Second Amendment.”

Trump took the opportunity of Friday's endorsement to denounce gun-free zones, saying that they contributed to the carnage in the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino and Paris. But Trump himself has a mixed record on this policy too. The Huffington Post called up a few of Trump's properties to see if someone could carry a firearm there.

His private resort at Mar-a-Lago said it was a gun-free club. A receptionist at his hotel in Chicago said the same thing about that property. Officials at Trump's hotels in Miami and Las Vegas did, however, say that you could bring a licensed firearm to their locations under certain security specifications.

The rifle is the same type of weapon used last week in the Florida school shooting that killed 17 people.

The raffle was launched before the shooting, but Levi Patterson, the coach of the team in Neosho for boys 9 and younger, told The Kansas City Star he plans to continue with the fundraiser.

Patterson said he decided to “turn it into a positive thing” after “getting the hate” in the form of angry Facebook posts after the raffle was first reported.

The weapon was donated as a prize by a team father and co-founder of Neosho gun manufacturer Black Rain Ordnance Inc., which is currently pitching a Spec15 AR pistol on its Facebook page.

“Are you all tone deaf?” a Facebook user asked in a since-deleted post on Patterson’s Facebook page. “AR15 kills seventeen so you raffle a gun for child sports? Lord, people wake the hell up.”

There was also some criticism on Twitter:

Patterson said “our hearts break” for the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. But he added that gun raffles “have been going on for years. Evil has and will always exist.”

Patterson said none of the children on his team will be forced to sell raffle tickets for the weapon if they’re uncomfortable doing so.

“I just think they have feelings to this specific type of gun [that are] different than people around here do,” he told the Star.

Patterson said supportive donations have been pouring in as well.

Kansas Republican Tyler Tannahill, who is running for a congressional seat, and Missouri GOP U.S. Senate candidate Austin Peterson have also been criticized for each offering an AR-15 giveaway to draw attention to their campaigns, KMOV-TV reported.

Another gun raffle in Michigan has been cancelled, the Detroit Free Press reported. The raffle, which was to raise money for the football team of South Lyon High School, also featured an AR-15."

To help settle the ongoing debate about assault rifles’ place in civil society, Seth Moultan, a veteran and congressman, tweeted a photo of himself holding one such weapon while wearing his military fatigues.

I know assault rifles. I carried one in Iraq. They have no place on America's streets. #Orlando

Despite Moultan’s sound argument, gun rights advocates are determined to maintain the laws that protect their access to these weapons of war.

Omar Mateen, 29, used a MCX Sig Sauer, which he purchased legally.

Assault rifles are typically the gun of choice of assailants who wage mass shootings.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Bradley Marvin blows a kiss as he leaves flowers at a makeshift memorial for the five friends he lost along with fellow victims in the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub.

Adam Lanza used an AR-15-style Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle to murder 20 children and six adults in 2012 at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik also used assault rifles to carry out the shooting in San Bernardino in December, which left 14 dead.

It makes sense considering the weapon’s capacity.

Initially invented in the 1950s by firearms engineer Eugene Stoner, the ArmaLite Rifle was branded as a lightweight firearm with precision accuracy and high lethality at long range.

They fire off bullets quickly. So quickly that an experienced shooter could fire many as 45 rounds in a minute.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images A Rock River Arms AR-15 rifle is seen on December 18, 2012 in Miami, Florida. The weapon is similar in style to the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle that was used during a massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.

Yet, despite its lethality –- and popularity among mass murderers -- assault rifles remain readily available and nearly immune from policy change.

Two days after the nightclub shooting, it took two HuffPost editors 38 minutes to purchase an AR-15, a gun similar to Mateen's, at a store in Orlando. This, despite the fact that the city was under a state of emergency following the attack.

The salesman told HuffPost that it would typically take five minutes. But because of the surge in sales following the shooting, which is pretty standard, the queue for background checks was longer than usual.

While President Barack Obama has called for bans on such guns, the general public isn’t all that interested in seeing one passed.

According to a December Washington Post/ABC News poll, 45 percent of those surveyed said they want to see assault rifles banned. That’s down from 80 percent in 1994.

And courts continue to side with gun rights advocates on this issue.

In February, for example, a federal appeals court ruled that a ban in Maryland on specific kinds of semi-automatic firearms was unconstitutional.

Outlawing such firearms would “substantially burden this fundamental right” to bear arms, Chief Judge Traxler wrote in his ruling.

Protecting gun rights over actual human lives spurred the Onion, a satirical news outlet, to write a letter of thanks from the perspective of an assault rifle on Tuesday."

The minute-long clip, posted on the NRA’s FB page earlier this month, features Dana Loesch of TheBlaze who begins: “They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.”

The ad continues with Loesch declaring that “their” former president advocated resistance, leading to protests that “bully and terrorize the law-abiding.”

“The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country, and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth,” the spokeswoman concludes. “I’m the National Rifle Association of America and I’m freedom’s safest place.”

Many commenters, including some who say they are gun owners, blasted the ad for being “incendiary” and “divisive” while “encouraging violence.”

A 50-year-old former Republican from the Midwest replied to the video on Facebook, calling it “Orwellian nonsense designed to make you cheer and fist pump for your ‘freedom’ like dogs drooling when the bell gets rung.”

The commenter, who asked not to be named because he feared for his safety, said he owns firearms for his own protection and for occasional target practice. He told HuffPost that despite the negative reaction to the video in some corners, he suspects it won’t damage the NRA.

“I don’t think much of anything can actually backfire on them, to be honest,” he said. “Much of their core membership seems impervious to logic and reason, sadly.”

The NRA did not immediately return a request for comment on the criticism."

Massachusetts-based company Bullet Blocker told HuffPost on Wednesday that sales of its Kevlar-enforced book bags have increased about 30 percent since a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Guard Dog Security, based in Sanford, Florida, also told HuffPost there was a “significant increase” in sales of its bulletproof backpacks ― something both companies say they now expect after a mass-casualty attack.

“The last time we had an upswing like this one was after Sandy Hook and the truck attack in France,” Joe Curran, founder of Bullet Blocker, told the Boston Herald, referencing the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and a 2016 attack in the south of France.

“Any violent occurrence gets people thinking in survival mode,” he said.

Bullet Blocker This backpack by Bullet Blocker is designed to shield people from handgun bullets.

Guard Dog Security’s president, Yasir Sheikh, declined to specify the exact number of backpacks it had recently sold, but described a roughly 150 percent increase in sales to Tampa-based station WFTS. As of Wednesday, all the company’s bulletproof backpacks were sold out.

“People want their bags faster than we can provide them,” he told HuffPost.

Both companies’ products offer Level IIIA ballistic protection, as rated by the National Institute of Justice. In an email to HuffPost, Bullet Blocker’s Amanda Curran described that rating as the highest level of soft body armor available.

Bullet Blocker Soft body armor panels, manufactured by Bullet Blocker, are capable of blocking bullets from a handgun.

That means it’s capable of stopping a bullet from a handgun, but not from a rifle like an AR-15 ― a semi-automatic civilian version of the military’s M16 that has become the recent gun of choice for mass shooters.

Authorities suspect that weapon was used in last week’s mass shooting in Florida, as well as in the November church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which left 26 people dead. It was also one of several guns a shooter used in October to kill 58 people and injure hundreds more at a music festival in Las Vegas. The gunman who killed 49 people and injured more than 50 others at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, used a similar semi-automatic rifle, a Sig Sauer MCX, in June 2016.

UltraONEs via Getty Images Semi-automatic rifles, like the AR-15, have been the most common firearm of choice during recent mass shootings.

The mass shooter who killed 20 elementary school students and six teachers in Newtown, Connecticut also used an AR-15. Shortly before that, a shooter used an AR-15 to kill 12 people and injure 58 others at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.

When tested against these bulletproof backpacks, the AR-15 blows clean through them.

“That’s a whole other level of ballistic protection,” Joe Curran told the Boston Herald of the rifle’s firepower.

It would take a Level III shield or greater to protect someone against an AR-15, which Bullet Blocker and Guard Dog Security don’t sell, Amanda Curran said.

WFTS Bullet holes from an AR-15 rifle appear in the back of Guard Dog Security's bulletproof backpack.

Sheikh said he isn’t aware of anything on the market that would protect against an AR-15, though his company is working to find a solution.

“We’re exploring all options to see what we could do,” he told HuffPost.

Jeffrey Kimball, a former police officer and firearms instructor at Arms Room in League City, Texas, told Houston-based station KTRK that rifle-proof shields are currently only used by the military or SWAT officers. Equipping a backpack with one would mean outfitting the bag with metal plates that would dramatically weigh it down, he said.

Though the bags can’t shield their owners from a rifle, Kimball expressed support for the products, reasoning that some protection is better than none."

Unfortunately, a narrative that should be shocking is starting to sound more like a tired trope. Before the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter was identified, we could have guessed who he'd be.

In the wake of the heartbreaking Newtown shooting, as we collectively mourn the loss of 20 young children and 7 adults, a lot of very necessary conversations have begun -- about gun control legislation and about greater federal funding for and access to mental health care. In addition to these indisputably important topics, we need to talk about this country's twisted vision of masculinity.

Of the 62 mass shootings that have occurred in the United States since 1982, 61 have been committed by men. The average age of these men was 35, and 44 of the 61 male shooters were white, according to Mother Jones. I don't believe that men are necessarily genetically predisposed to violence or that men are ""worse"" people than women. (In fact, recent numbers on violent crime indicate that women are slowly beginning to close the gender gap for violent crime arrests.) I do think, however, that the statistics on men who massacre say something upsetting about the way we equate masculinity with physical power. That sentiment has never been so clear as in an advertisement for the .223-calibre semiautomatic Bushmaster rifle -- the gun that 20-year-old Adam Lanza used to murder 27 people, and the civilian version of the assault rifle our troops have used in Afghanistan and Iraq. This morning author and activist Jessica Valenti tweeted an image of the ad:

The tagline reads ""Consider Your Man Card Reissued."" In a press release for the marketing campaign, distributed in 2010, Bushmaster Firearms explained how one becomes a ""card-carrying man"":

...visitors of bushmaster.com will have to prove they're a man by answering a series of manhood questions. Upon successful completion, they will be issued a temporary Man Card to proudly display to friends and family. The Man Card is valid for one year. Visitors can also call into question or even revoke the Man Card of friends they feel have betrayed their manhood. The man in question will then have to defend himself, and their Man Card, by answering a series of questions geared towards proving indeed, they are worthy of retaining their card.

The fact that a company is selling deadly weapons based on the premise that it will up the purchaser's ""man cred"" is disturbing in itself. The message that it sends about what it means to be a man in America is even more so -- especially because, as Gawker reported, this campaign has been running for more than two years. Guns may not kill people (on their own), but disaffected men with easy access to guns and little understanding of how to safely and sanely express their frustrations with the world certainly do. These same men grew up in a country that glorifies male violence as entertainment. We need to start asking ourselves why we've let 30 years of mass shootings overwhelmingly committed by men occur without bothering to really question the pattern that emerges.

Of course, I'm far from the first person to point out this connection. AlterNet's Chauncey DeVega asked two days ago why we're so reluctant to ""delve deeper into the relationship(s) between whiteness, masculinity, and gun violence."" And in a press release for his 2008 book on the subject of hypermasculinity and violence, UCLA professor of education Douglas Kellner said: ""The school shooters and domestic terrorists examined in this book all exhibit male rage, attempt to resolve a crisis of masculinity through violent behavior, demonstrate a fetish for guns or weapons, and represent, in general, a situation of guys and guns amok.""

As we struggle to make sense of Friday's massacre, we need to begin bringing masculinity into our conversations. And we need to teach boys that being a ""real man"" means using your words instead of your fists ... or your knives ... or your semiautomatic rifles.

The demonstration was organized by Teens For Gun Reform, an organization created by students in the Washington, D.C., area in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Protesters participated in what they said would be a three-minute lie-in, which began around 12:30 p.m. on Presidents Day. They lay down in front of the White House “in representation of the victims of school shootings,” according to a post on the group’s Facebook page.

“By doing this, we will make a statement on the atrocities which have been committed due to the lack of gun control, and send a powerful message to our government that they must take action now,” the group wrote on Facebook.

Following the lie-in, protesters continued to hold signs in support of stricter guns laws and shouted phrases including “Shame on you” and “Disarm hate” toward the White House. The group also chanted “No more deaths,” “Am I next?” and “Hey, hey, NRA, how many kids have you killed today?”

Zach Gibson/Getty Images Protesters hold signs during the demonstration against gun violence.

Last week’s massacre at the South Florida high school, in which a 19-year-old former student opened fire using an assault-style rifle, sparked protests and calls to action from students nationwide.

A group of students who survived the Parkland shooting have been outspoken in their criticism of Trump and lawmakers who receive financial contributions from gun lobbying groups such as the National Rifle Association.

On Sunday, the students announced plans for a march on Washington to demand congressional action on gun violence. The event, dubbed “March For Our Lives,” is scheduled for March 24.

Whitney Bowen and Eleanor Nuechterlein, both 16-year-old high school students from the D.C. area, started Teens For Gun Reform just two days after the Parkland shooting.

We might be 16 now and we might not be able to vote, but we can protest and we can use social media and we will make our voices heard. Whitney Bowen, co-founder of Teens For Gun Reform

“You never wake up thinking it’s going to be your school or it’s going to be your friends or family,” Bowen told HuffPost. “The Parkland kids didn’t either. ... They woke up and went to school for the last time because there’s not enough gun control.”

Monday’s protest at the White House was planned on Presidents Day for symbolic reasons, Nuechterlein said. It’s not enough for President Donald Trump and other politicians to say “sorry” after school shootings, she said, they also need to start taking real legislative action to prevent them from happening.

Both Bowen and Nuechterlein said they plan to attend next month’s march on Washington.

“We might be 16 now and we might not be able to vote, but we can protest and we can use social media and we will make our voices heard,” Bowen said. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t come down to politics. It comes down to kids dying in classrooms.”

Elodie Camus, a 15-year-old student at the British International School of Washington, D.C., participated in the White House protest Monday with her mother.

U.S. gun laws “have put so many people in danger over the years in this country and there needs to be reform,” Camus told HuffPost, adding that she no longer feels “safe at all” at school.

“Something needs to be changed so not as many people are harmed,” she said.

Felicia Garber, whose two daughters survived the Parkland shooting, was in D.C. with her family when she heard about Monday’s protest and decided to attend the demonstration.

“We felt it was important to be present and thank the people who felt it was worth coming out here on this cold, dreary, rainy holiday to help let whoever is in this beautiful White House know that we will not take this any longer,” Garber told HuffPost.

“These legislators need to step up for our children and not just for these lobbyists,” she continued. ”[Parkland] kids are smart, educated, savvy ... and they are outraged. These are young adults who are ready and unforgiving, and I can only hope this is the beginning of the change they can create for our country.”

Several other student-led protests against gun violence erupted across Florida on Monday. Students staged a walk out at Olympic Heights Community High School in West Boca Raton, while parents joined their kids in front of American Heritage School in Plantation just 30 miles to the south.

It also reignited fierce debates on gun control across the country.

Lawmakers, often split along party lines, have debated whether strengthening restrictions on guns would curb America’s all-too-common mass shootings, or whether it would be more effective to increase the number of guns in schools and other soft targets. At the federal level, President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he’d ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take steps to ban bump stocks, a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire as quickly as a machine gun.

State lawmakers on Tuesday refused to debate a gun control measure that would have banned any “selective-fire firearm capable of fully automatic, semiautomatic or burst fire,” including the AR-15 rifle, the type used in the Parkland shooting. State Rep. Kionne McGhee (D) pushed to bring the bill out of committee and to the floor, but the proposal was rejected in a 36-71 procedural vote. A Florida Senate committee, however, endorsed a proposal to put law enforcement officers in every school in the state.

Hawaii

Lawmakers in Hawaii are considering a bill that would make it a felony to own or sell multi-burst triggers on firearms and other trigger modifications. H.B. 1908, introduced in January, has passed out of the state House Judiciary Committee, and a second hearing took place on Wednesday before the House Committee on Consumer Protection and Commerce. The bill would amend existing state law such that anyone who manufactures, imports into Hawaii, sells, or owns a bump stock could be charged with a felony.

Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania lawmakers have introduced 11 bills meant to curb gun violence in the week since the Parkland shooting. The measures covered by the bills range from making it harder for citizens to get access to assault-style weapons, like the one used in Parkland, to requiring background checks for all gun sales. State Rep. Warren Kampf (R) introduced seven of the 11 bills, including one to ban bump stocks. Several of the bills would make it possible for individuals to petition a court to remove someone’s guns if they show signs of violence.

Illinois

Illinois state Rep. Marty Moylan (D) introduced a bill two days after the Florida shooting to ban the manufacture, sale, purchase, and possession of “rate of fire enhancements,” a category of devices and accessories that includes bump stocks. Moylan and state Sen. Julie Morrison (D) have also doubled down on their calls to move forward gun control bills introduced before the Parkland shooting, including one to ban assault weapons and one to ban unregistered, often home-manufactured weapons known as “ghost guns.”

Wisconsin

Republican lawmakers on Tuesday blocked Democrats’ attempt to vote on a bill that would implement universal background checks for gun purchases in Wisconsin. Democratic lawmakers had attempted to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, but Republicans used a procedural tactic to avoid the vote and replace the measure with one to fund school grants to provide firearms to safety officers and curb illegal firearm purchases. Lawmakers approved that measure by a 71-24 vote.

Arizona

Republican state lawmakers on Tuesday blocked their Democratic colleagues’ attempt to push for a vote on a bill to ban bump stocks and other rate-of-fire modifications. Nearly a dozen other gun-related measures have stalled in the state legislature recently, only one of which has received a hearing. That bill, which passed out of a state House committee on the same day as the Parkland shooting, would end gun safety requirements previously imposed on foster parents; in other words, it represents an attempt to erode gun restrictions, not strengthen them.

South Carolina

Republicans and Democrats in South Carolina debated measures to curb gun violence in the wake of the Florida shooting. House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford (D) said he planned to introduce a bill to ban the sale of AR-15 rifles to anyone under the age of 20 ― a measure that Republican lawmakers in the state largely oppose. Instead, Republicans have pushed measures to arm teachers and allow concealed-weapon permit holders to carry their firearms in more locations.

Ohio

State Sens. Michael Skindell (D) and Charleta Tavares (D) this week proposed a ban on “assault weapons,” defined in the bill as any automatic or semiautomatic firearm with the capacity to accept 10 or more cartridges. The measure would require owners of assault-style weapons to dispose of the firearms, and would make it a felony to own such a gun.

Oregon

Gov. Kate Brown (D) spoke before the state Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, throwing her support behind a proposal to expand an existing ban on the purchase or possession of firearms or ammunition by people convicted of stalking or domestic violence or who have a restraining order against them. The state House approved the legislation on Feb. 15, a day after the Florida shooting. It is now being considered by the state Senate.

New Jersey

Gov. Phil Murphy (D) signaled his support on Tuesday for a number of bills currently moving through the state legislature, including measures to reduce the permitted size of ammunition magazines, require background checks for private gun sales, and ban certain types of firearms and ammunition.

Illegal firearms are indeed a piece of America’s gun violence epidemic. But new research suggests that many legal gun owners aren’t as responsible as they claim.

The new study, published in the journal Pediatrics last month, found that as many as 44 percent of homes with children also had firearms. In those homes with guns, only 35 percent of parents or caretakers stored the weapons according to American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations that they be unloaded and locked in a safe. The gun storage responses were similar, regardless of whether a child in the home had a mental illness, such as depression, which is a risk factor for suicide.

“Parents may really misjudge or discount their child’s underlying risk,” said Dr. Matthew Miller, study author and professor at Northeastern University, as well as an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “They have too much confidence in the instructions they’ve given their kids or how they’ve hidden their gun.”

It’s not a negligible risk. Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for kids ages 10 to 17 in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And firearms are a particularly deadly suicide method, which explains why, for children in this age group, 40 percent of suicides involved guns. The CDC said 633 children died in suicides involving firearms in 2016, and 53 kids were killed in accidental or unintended firearm incidents.

Republican politicians, the National Rifle Association and gun companies push the message that a firearm in the home keeps Americans safe. But scientific research doesn’t support this messaging.

Instead, studies show that that a gun in the home creates more risk than benefit, and drives up occupants’ chances for firearm accidents, suicide and intimate-partner homicide. Moreover, an analysis of 16 gun violence studies found that adolescents are at the greatest risk for suicide.

Though the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, has rightly garnered national attention and public sympathy, firearm suicide is a bigger threat to kids than mass shooting. While about 600 kids die by firearm suicide annually, 176 children and teenagers have been killed in mass shootings since 1966, according to The Washington Post.

“This is a day-in and day-out problem in our country,” Dr. David Wesson said of gun violence.

Wesson, a pediatric surgeon at Texas Children’s Hospital not affiliated with the new study, treats children with gunshot wounds regularly. (Wesson said he’s more likely to treat kids caught in crossfire than suicide cases, in part because many kids who attempt suicide with a gun die before they reach the ER, and because nonfatal gunshot wounds are so common. The CDC recorded 6,473 nonfatal gunshot wounds in children ages 10 to 17 in 2015.)

“Incidents [like Parkland] that involved large number of fatalities are newsworthy, but just a small fraction of people who are harmed and killed every year,” Wesson said."

Young'],2018-02-24 08:01:13-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-young-nra-history_us_5a907fbee4b03b55731c2169,"On Thursday, Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association and unofficial leader of America’s largest cult, took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting in Washington, D.C.

In another universe – or maybe even just in another nation – one might imagine that the leader of the country’s largest gun organization giving an address less than one week after yet another school shooting had left 17 people dead would appear circumspect, contrite, even ashamed.

Railing against the media and the “growing socialist state,” LaPierre vowed that the NRA would not retreat from its defense of gun rights. And as a student-led movement for gun control continued to build in Florida and across the nation, LaPierre depicted the NRA as the best protector of vulnerable children. “Evil walks among us,” LaPierre said, “and God help us if we don’t harden our schools and protect our kids.”

This is the fantasy that the NRA has peddled for decades and that has created our current nightmare. But the NRA’s delusion exposes not only its moral rot, but also its continual turn from its own history. Begun as an organization devoted to education and safety, it’s only in the last 50 years that the NRA has instead dedicated itself to preserving the very circumstances that most endanger Americans’ lives today, especially the nation’s schoolchildren.

In 1871, the NRA was founded by William Church, a lawyer, and George Wingate, a former newspaper reporter. Wingate explained his new organization’s purpose as working to “promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis.”

To that end, the NRA operated mostly as a sporting club and hunting association for its first 100 years. It put a heavy emphasis on gun safety education and training, especially for young people. Church and Wingate had been inspired to create their organization in part from their experience as soldiers during the Civil War, where they had been appalled by the poor marksmanship skills of their fellow fighters. Guns were dangerous, especially in untrained hands, the two men understood. The NRA organized safety clinics and target-shooting competitions to teach young men (and later women) proper gun use and the obligations of responsible firearm ownership.

Talk of rights, freedom, and self-defense ... has given cover for the modern NRA’s real work as the craven lobbyist of gun manufacturers.

Guns were also dangerous in the wrong hands, so the NRA often supported gun control laws in the first half of the 20th Century. It backed the National Firearms Act of 1934 and, four years later, the Federal Firearms Act, plus a host of measures at the state level. These various laws, among other things, required licenses for gun dealers, levied heavy taxes on machine guns, instituted waiting periods for buying handguns and mandated permits for concealed weapons.

All of this work – education, safety training and gun control advocacy – represented the NRA’s sense of the limits of gun ownership and the organization’s obligation to protect Americans from gun violence in all its forms. Occasionally, the NRA also opposed gun control laws it saw as unnecessary or excessive, but it rarely invoked “gun rights” as the basis for doing so. As one scholar has noted, any mention in the NRA’s publications and pronouncements of the Second Amendment “was glaringly absent before the early 1960s.”

All of that changed during the cultural upheaval of the late 1960s and 1970s. Citing rising crime rates and social unrest as their rationale, a band of gun rights hardliners wrested control of the NRA from the old guard safety and sporting advocates.

Amid the era’s “rights revolution,” the NRA’s new leaders put forward a new right of their own, one they claimed had been there since the nation’s founding. (It’s no small point that the NRA promotes itself as “America’s longest-standing civil rights organization.”) The Second Amendment, the NRA now argued, gave individuals an absolute right to gun ownership, one that the federal government couldn’t limit in any way. It was a radical reinterpretation of what had been the common perception of the amendment for nearly two centuries.

With its talk of rights, freedom and self-defense, the NRA has presented itself as the tireless defender of embattled gun owners for nearly half a century. The truth, however, is that such language has given cover for the modern NRA’s real work as the craven lobbyist of gun manufacturers.

Americans buy more firearms when they believe their guns are about to be taken away, a paranoia the NRA has been all too eager to exploit. (In the perverse pattern that now plays out after nearly every mass shooting in the United States, gun sales have increased in the week since the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, for exactly this reason.) While the NRA warns gun owners that the Second Amendment is under attack, it stokes fears that help line the pockets of their gun manufacturing friends.

In return, gun manufacturers generously reward the NRA with vital funds. Those dollars represent a significant departure from the organization’s early years when it routinely touted its independence from corporate interests, but it’s a necessary arrangement now as the NRA experiences decreasing membership. A 2013 report found that gun makers had given the NRA between $20 and $52.6 million in the previous eight years alone. The NRA also regularly makes money from some gun companies that give a portion of their sales to the organization.

When politicians argue that the only solution to mass shootings is arming more Americans, they play directly into the hands of the NRA and gun companies alike. They also reveal how completely the NRA, supported by self-interested gun makers, have limited Americans’ imaginations about what is politically possible when it comes to gun violence.

All of this is a result of the symbiotic relationship that has been highly profitable for both the NRA and for gun makers. But for thousands of Americans, it must be remembered, the cost has been deadly."

He noted how historic measures that were enacted in the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan demonstrated that “stricter gun laws can make a difference in reducing mass shootings.”

Corden also said he felt optimistic that perhaps this time, things will be different. He praised the teen survivors of the Parkland massacre for speaking out about their ordeal and for organizing a march on March 24 in Washington, D.C. to call for gun law reform."

In the wake of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last week that left 17 people dead, the group has put forward a petition that uses the language of the anti-abortion movement to encourage fellow Christians to fight for gun reform.

The signers claim it’s their “Biblical responsibility” to urge America’s lawmakers to pass common-sense gun legislation that will “protect life.” Though the meaning of “common-sense” varies for individuals in the group, they’re generally looking for tighter background checks, ensuring that certain high-risk individuals are prohibited from purchasing firearms, and potentially banning certain high-capacity and semi-automatic weapons.

The petition has the backing of at least 16 evangelical leaders, including Max Lucado, the best-selling Christian author, Lynne Hybels, co-founder of the Illinois megachurch Willow Creek Community Church, and Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition.

Because of his background as a militant anti-abortion activist, Schenck is a controversial figure in progressive circles. Some have questioned his commitment to gun control, given his past statements and lifetime membership in the National Rifle Association ― which Schenck justifies by saying it was a gift from a financial supporter of his ministry and something he uses to “listen and learn” about the ideologies of those involved in popular gun culture.

But he says he’s modified his stance on gun legislation and become an ally in the fight for stricter gun laws. For years, he’s tried to encourage his faith community to break from its longstanding support of gun rights.

It’s a difficult task, but Schenck is optimistic. “I believe there is a change happening among evangelicals,” the preacher told HuffPost. “We will see a tipping point when many evangelicals will begin advocating for sensible gun safety measures.”

The ‘Prayers And Action’ Campaign

Schenck’s petition for gun reform started circulating in the evangelical community after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November. It was released widely on Monday and has gathered over 200 signatures by Friday, according to the campaign’s site. Only a handful of those names are publicly listed on the site. The rest of the signatures are being funneled into a database that will be used to keep signers up to date with future actions, Schenck said.

The pastor told HuffPost that he wants to keep the petition an “evangelical family matter” and is hesitant to expose the signers to criticism from the larger faith community. His first purpose is to “find friends” in the community who care about gun reform.

And he thinks framing gun reform as an effort to “protect life” could help swing the conversation for evangelical Christians.

“Evangelicals believe deeply in the sanctity of every human life. Any public policy that contributes to a disregard for human life is a violation of this tenet,” Schenck told HuffPost. “The lives of children are especially precious to God and should always be for Christians.”

A Deep Loyalty To Guns

The task of rallying evangelical support for stricter gun control legislation is bound to be an uphill battle. As a whole, white American evangelicals are some of the strongest supporters of gun rights. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 41 percent of white evangelicals own guns, more than members of other faith groups.

Pew could not break out black evangelical Protestants in the survey, due to a small sample size. However, the researchers did conclude that only 29 percent of a larger category, black Protestants, own a gun. (An estimated two-thirds of black Protestants identify as evangelicals.)

White evangelicals are more likely than most Americans to say that their right to own guns is essential to their sense of freedom (70 percent vs. 47 percent). Twenty-four percent of black Protestants said the same. White evangelicals also said that they are satisfied with gun laws in this country (44 percent). Sixteen percent of black Protestants agreed.

In addition, a 2013 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute found that many evangelicals don’t see a contradiction in labeling themselves “pro-life” while opposing gun control. In fact, among the white evangelical Protestants who said the term “pro-life” described them very well, a majority (64 percent) also said they opposed stricter gun control laws.

Schenck’s experiences have taught him that for many evangelicals, guns are a “volatile issue.” He believes evangelicals’ loyalty towards guns stems from deep-seated distrust of the government.

“Evangelicals have long felt like a persecuted minority, even though we enjoy some of the largest, most influential, and wealthiest churches and institutions in the country. This misperception makes many in my community fearful of government oppression,” he said.

“There is a deep emotional and psychological bond between people that are fearful and the instruments they feel will protect them, their loved ones, and their way of life,” Schenck told HuffPost.

A Broader ‘Pro-Life’ Movement

At the same time, Schenck senses that a change is brewing in some communities ― people are becoming increasingly concerned and anxious about gun violence, particularly mass shootings.

“More and more voices calling for restrictions on gun access are being heard. We are trying to curate those voices and give them a united platform to speak from,” Schenck told HuffPost about his campaign.

“We’ve been actively reaching out to evangelical leaders, mostly behind the scenes, and are finding many that are distressed by our seemingly unrestrained enthusiasm for easy gun access — and the perception that all evangelicals have a kind of bloodlust for firearms,” he added. “That’s not true, particularly when it comes to under-40 evangelicals and their pastors.”

Kathryn Freeman, director of public policy for the ethics commission of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, is one of the evangelical leaders who publicly signed Schenck’s petition (although she pointed out she is not speaking on behalf of her organization). Freeman says she believes in working to support human flourishing “from the womb to the tomb.” For her, that includes supporting “common-sense gun legislation.”

“I am concerned about gun violence in this country, because I think to do nothing is to devalue human life, to treat that which God deems of ultimate value as of no value at all,” the Baptist leader told HuffPost. “Reducing gun violence is part of what it means to love God’s people and want them to flourish.”

For These Strange Bedfellows, The Ends Justify The Means

Over the years, Schenck has gone through an evolution in his views about gun reform. When he first began speaking up about this issue, he didn’t think the answer to gun violence would be found in more federal laws. In 2015, he claimed it wasn’t an issue about “gun control, but of self-control.”

Today, Schenck says he’s still hesitant about the phrase “gun control,” since it suggests to gun owners that the government is seeking to “control” their personal behavior. He prefers the phrase “gun regulation.”

He’s also hesitant about pushing for more federal controls, preferring that local and state governments take the lead. But he told HuffPost he now realizes that there are important instances when federal laws are needed ― such as when it comes to closing the gun show loophole and making sure all firearm purchases are routed through federal background checks.

“You have to deal with reality and the reality is that in many of these instances, the only remedy is on the federal level. I’ve acquiesced to that,” he said.

Lucy McBath is a faith and outreach leader for the gun control advocacy groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She told HuffPost she’s known and worked with Schenck for about four years. The pair were the subjects of the documentary “Armor of Light,” a 2015 documentary about the evangelical response to gun violence.

McBath identifies as an evangelical Christian herself, but supports women’s right to make their own choices about their reproductive health. Although she and Schenck don’t see eye to eye on abortion, McBath said she supports Schenck’s efforts to rally the evangelical community around gun control. Not everyone in her movement is going to be happy with that stance, she said, but she believes people on opposite ends of the political spectrum are going to need to come together to try to solve the issue of gun violence.

“What I like to say to people is we need everybody,” McBath told HuffPost. “We need gun owners, we need non-gun owners, we need people of faith, people of no faith. We need everybody because gun violence is a nonpartisan issue. We all have to be able to come to some common ground to work together to make sure we’re changing this dangerous gun culture.”

We need everybody because gun violence is a nonpartisan issue. Lucy McBath

Other gun control advocates seem to agree. The Rev. Jim Atwood, a board member of Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and a retired Presbyterian minister, said that he would welcomes the activism of Schenck and other evangelical Christians who want to fight for gun reform.

“I can’t speak for everybody but I would think that’s what we need to do,” Atwood told HuffPost. “We need to cross boundaries, cross lines of different political entities and work together.”

Looking at the list of prominent evangelicals who have publicly signed Schenck’s petition, McBath said she’s excited about the potential in that group. In her years as an activist, she said she’s never seen this level of support from evangelical leaders.

McBath hopes to see more of it.

“We need to see this kind of solidarity across denominational lines,” she said. “Because the end goal is saving lives.”

A Growing Sense Of Urgency

Dr. Jamie Aten, one of the signers of Schenck’s petition, is the executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian institution. In that role, Aten helps churches prepare to respond to disasters in their communities, including mass shootings.

In the past, he said that he tried to avoid controversial topics like this. But now he believes that “silence only divides people further.”

“I think we owe it to the victims and survivors of mass shootings, and to each other, to do what we can to try and prevent this from happening again and prioritizing that in our policies,” Aten said.

After the shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs, congregations around the country grew increasingly worried about security. But unless sensible gun laws are passed, Aten worries that churches’ preparedness efforts will fall short. As it stands, he believes evangelical Christians’ affinity for gun culture “does more to protect our fear than it does the lives of innocent people.”

Rev. Dr. Joel Hunter, a former megachurch pastor from Florida who served as one of President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers, also signed Schenck’s petition. He believes that a “pro-life ethic” is the key ingredient needed to move the needle on evangelicals’ beliefs about gun control. Hunter is optimistic that more members of his faith community will sign on to Schenck’s campaign after witnessing teenage activists protesting against guns since the Florida school shooting.

“I think the connection will be made, the more carnage that is accumulated,” Hunter said. “I think people will begin to see this as a life and death issue.”

Schenck said that as a pastor, he understands the strong emotions that evangelicals associated with gun rights ― particularly the fear they have about any supposed threats to those rights. But in the end, he hopes that his community will be patient and “listen before they judge.”"
huffpo125,huffpo,"['Igor Bobic', 'Politics Reporter']",2018-02-27 17:12:02-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gun-control-immigration_us_5a95c31ce4b09c872bae8e19,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has been all over the place on guns, but he hasn’t yet done the one thing that helps move votes in Congress: publicly support specific legislation to address gun violence.

In the days since the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida, the president has suggested arming teachers, toughening background checks, opening more mental hospitals and increasing the age limit to buy some weapons to 21. Last week, he directed his administration to regulate bump stocks, the gun accessory used to simulate automatic fire in the 2017 Las Vegas attack.

Trump has even urged state governors not to be afraid of the National Rifle Association, the nation’s most powerful gun lobby, as they seek to address school safety ― a remarkable thing for a Republican president to say.

Yuri Gripas/Bloomberg via Getty Images President Trump appears to prefer talking about gun control over passing it.

“Don’t worry about the NRA. They’re on our side,” Trump told a bipartisan gathering of governors on Monday during a White House meeting. “If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That’s OK. They’re doing what they think is right.”

It’s not hard to understand why Trump has tried to move to the middle on guns. Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to its highest level since 1993, according to a recent CNN poll, with 70 percent of Americans now saying they support more gun control. That’s up from the 52 percent who said they supported stricter gun laws in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, where 58 people died. Trump’s approval rating, meanwhile, has slumped again to match the lowest of his presidency.

Yet Republicans in Congress, many of whom are facing competitive primaries ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, seem no more willing to tackle the issue of gun control. Without clear direction from the leader of their party, it’s unlikely they’ll do so in a substantial way this year.

“If President Trump weighs in ― and leans in ― we could see some reasonable changes on things like bump stocks and age restrictions. If not, the status quo will largely remain,” said Doug Heye, a veteran Republican operative and former Republican National Committee communications director.

Trump’s tactics on guns so far have mirrored his handling of the immigration debate. Early in conversations with lawmakers over the legal status of young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, the president expressed a desire to pursue comprehensive immigration reform and even said he’d be willing to “take the heat” from his supporters if Congress decided to act. He also told lawmakers that he would sign any bill they sent him that would institutionalize President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, buoying activists’ hopes that Congress would reach a compromise.

Yet his vague promises and platitudes on immigration were quickly followed by intense lobbying from immigration hawks in the White House and the Department of Homeland Security against a bipartisan measure in the Senate that would have paired $25 billion for border security with a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Neither that bill nor other competing ones received enough votes to advance.

With more Republicans expressing skepticism this week about additional restrictions on guns, Trump seems to be heading toward a similar backtrack. The president, per CNN, appears to be softening his position on raising the age at which people can purchase AR-15 rifles, the weapon used in the Parkland massacre, and similar weapons. But a White House spokesperson insisted Tuesday that the president still supported the idea.

It’s also unclear what kind of bill toughening background checks Trump is willing to endorse. Democrats are calling for universal gun background checks, while Republicans support more modest efforts to beef up the national background check system. Trump is scheduled to meet with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a top gun control advocate, to discuss the matter on Wednesday.

“We expect to have some specific policy proposals later this week,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Tuesday.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) called on the Senate the same day to “immediately” pass a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, which he co-sponsored with Murphy. The measure, called Fix NICS, would require states to produce an implementation plan focused on uploading all gun purchaser information to the federal background check system and penalize federal agencies if they failed to record that information.

Democratic senators support Cornyn’s bill but call it a “tiny” effort to curb gun violence. They would also like the Senate to consider more gun-related initiatives, such as an assault weapons ban, magazine restrictions and stricter background checks ― all ideas opposed by Republicans and the NRA.

“My sense is Republicans aren’t going to move here on serious gun legislation unless the president pre-endorses it, so what he says in the next few days and what he says tomorrow will be important,” Murphy said Tuesday.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) agreed that it would be helpful if Trump said what he preferred Congress to do on the issue of guns."

“Amen,” an off-camera voice answered.

Robertson, who suffered a stroke earlier this month, asked for a ban on “bump stocks,” which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire as rapidly as machine guns. Weapons with bump stocks were used last year by Stephen Paddock during the Las Vegas shooting, which left 58 people dead and hundreds injured.

Robertson also called for more thorough background checks, including a medical check.

“If somebody is seeing a psychiatrist, is on medication, he or she needs to be prohibited from being turned loose on the general population,” he said. “It’s just got to be, y’know, sensible.”

A gun owner and a hunter, Robertson hasn’t exactly been a voice of moderation in the gun control debate. In 2014, he encouraged churches to arm worshippers.

“Blessed are the fully armed,” he said then.

Last year, Robertson linked the mass shooting at a Texas church to antidepressants and urged people not to use the attack to push for gun control.

“I hope and pray they don’t politicize this thing and start talking about gun control and all that because it won’t be necessary,” he said at the time, according to Media Matters.

Now, however, the 87-year-old seems to have altered his stance.

“I think we can ban those things without too much trouble,” Robertson said on Tuesday, referring to automatic weapons. “We can stop that.”

The AR-15-style rifle used in the Florida school shooting, as well as several other mass killings, is a semiautomatic. Since it is not an automatic weapon, it would not be affected by the ban Robertson suggested."

They planned the demonstrations in spite of conservative media critics dismissing the power of organized protests and the idea that U.S. gun laws are failing Americans.

Below are the biggest upcoming protests around the issue. We’ll update this as more are announced.

National School Walkout: March 14

A nationwide walkout organized by the people behind the Women’s March is planned for March 14.

Youth EMPOWER, the Women’s March branch of young activists, is asking students and faculty members to walk off campus at 10 a.m. for 17 minutes ― one minute for each person killed in the Parkland shooting.

Enough is enough!

“We need action,” the group wrote on the official Facebook event page. “Students and allies are organizing the national school walkout to demand Congress pass legislation to keep us safe from gun violence at our schools, on our streets and in our homes and places of worship.”

March For Our Lives: March 24

Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and other schools are planning a march on Washington ― with sister marches around the country ― to demand better gun control legislation on March 24.

“The mission and focus of March For Our Lives is to demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues,” the organizers wrote on the event website. “No special interest group, no political agenda is more critical than timely passage of legislation to effectively address the gun violence issues that are rampant in our country.”

There are dozens of sister marches planned in other U.S. cities, and at least one internationally, in London.

A number of celebrities, including George and Amal Clooney, and Oprah Winfrey, have donated a collective $2 million to the March For Our Lives effort.

Columbine Anniversary School Walkout: April 20

Another “National School Walkout” is planned for April 20, the 19th anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in Colorado.

The walkout is being organized by Connecticut high school student Lane Murdock, largely on Twitter and through a Change.org petition that’s garnered more than 100,000 signatures.

CHICAGO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The FBI performed a record number of instant background checks on would-be firearm buyers in 2011 as Americans went on an apparent gun-buying spree, according to new government data.

The FBI said it fielded nearly 16.5 million queries from firearms sellers last year, checking that customers buying guns did not have criminal records or other red flags that made them ineligible to purchase weapons.

That was up 15 percent from 2010, when the FBI performed 14.4 million screenings using its so-called National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and the highest number of annual screenings performed since 1998, when the checks went into effect.

The FBI cautioned that each background check did not necessarily represent an individual firearm sale, in part because some would-be buyers fail to pass the screening.

But FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer said the background checks are correlated with weapon purchases. So the uptick in screenings last year suggests that an increase in gun sales the agency has been tracking for several years was continuing.

Fischer declined to analyze or comment on the jump in firearms purchases, saying the bureau's responsibility was only ""to operate and maintain the NICS system.""

But Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, said he believed the political uncertainty surrounding next year's general election was prompting would-be gun buyers to accelerate purchases.

Arulanandam said the jump in sales since 2006 largely reflected concern that the Democrats swept into office in recent years, including President Barack Obama, would curb the right to bear arms.

BUYING SURGE SINCE 2006

Purchases of handguns and rifles, which had held steady throughout the early part of the decade, began to surge in 2006 and have nearly doubled since then, FBI data showed.

Kentucky, which ranks 26th nationally in terms of population, topped the state rankings for pre-purchase background checks in 2011, the FBI said.

Gun sellers in the Bluegrass State, which has just 4.3 million residents, generated almost 2.3 million instant background checks in 2011 - accounting for roughly one of every seven the FBI processed during the year.

But Fischer said Kentucky's numbers were distorted because the state runs a fresh background check every month on gun owners with state-issued concealed weapons permits.

Texas, which ranks No. 2 in population according to the Census Bureau, ranked No. 2 in the background checks as well, with 1.15 million screening requests in 2011.

Texas was followed by Utah, which accounted for nearly a quarter of the overall increase in checks and sales in 2011.

Utah is an increasingly popular place for gun owners from all over the country to get a concealed-firearms permit because it is cheap, easy to apply for even if buyers do not live in Utah, and recognized in nearly three dozen other states.

'PACKING HEAT'

The FBI data for 2011 was released close to the Jan. 8 anniversary of the shooting rampage in Tucson, Arizona, that killed 6 people and injured 13, including Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords.

That incident raised serious questions about the background checks after it emerged that Jared Lee Loughner, the accused shooter, had legally purchased the gun he allegedly used in the attack from a sporting goods store - despite having engaged in bizarre, disruptive behavior well before the shooting.

While the FBI data show the number of background checks have risen, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says there has been no progress on legislative efforts to tighten gun control following the Tucson shooting.

Dennis Henigan, the group's acting president, told Reuters the only gun bill that has come for a vote in Congress since Tucson has been the so-called ""Packing Heat On Your Street"" bill, officially known as ""National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011"" (H.R. 822).

That measure, which has passed the House of Representatives but stalled in the Senate, would make it easier for people to carry concealed handguns across state lines.

""Really it is a national disgrace that the only piece of gun-related legislation to come to a vote since Tucson was this legislation that would have enabled dangerous concealed carriers like Jared Loughner to carry their guns across state lines,"" Henigan said.

But the National Rifle Association says H.R. 822 would only require states to recognize one another's concealed carry permits the same way they recognize one another's driver's licenses, eliminating confusion and potential legal problems for traveling gun owners.

Smith, University of Minnesota

Another week in America, another week of sadness and hand-wringing prompted by gun violence.

While the most recent incidents are tinged by race, they also point to a country awash in guns and the too many deaths that result from their use (or abuse). But are these shootings any more likely to lead to some kind of meaningful action to address the problem?

Unfortunately, probably not. As long as the debate continues to be one of constitutionality (the right to bear arms) and control (regulation), little meaningful change is likely to address the 16 million new guns entering the U.S. market each year or the nearly 34,000 annual gun deaths.

A new dialogue is desperately needed among policymakers and the public. And it could begin by shifting our focus away from the regulation of guns toward understanding (and mitigating) the social costs of firearm fatalities.

My research examines ways to assess the social, environmental and health effects of new technologies to inform policymakers and companies. Though my focus at the University of Minnesota is on sustainability, similar analyses may also be useful for the political debate over gun control.

Firearm fatalities

The current congressional debate focuses on the most violent actors (terrorists or those whose background check may not check out) and the most lethal guns (military-style rifles) -- not necessarily the deadliest guns or those creating the greatest risks to society.

Despite the headlines, most guns never kill anyone, and military-style rifles are some of the least frequently used guns in firearm deaths. Each year, fewer than one firearm-related death occurs in the U.S. for every 10,000 guns in circulation, or 33,636 fatalities for an estimated 357 million guns. And about two-thirds of those deaths are suicides.

Gun deaths associated with mass shootings have surged dramatically in recent years, but are still rare compared with other gun violence. In just the first four months of 2016, 70 mass shootings have been reported (more than all of 2015), with 129 victim fatalities, according to Stanford University's Mass Shootings in America. Adding in Orlando and Dallas, mass shooting deaths in the first half of 2016 equal those of 2015 and are four times the annual average in recent years.

While this is alarming, such deaths represent just a fraction of the number of firearm-related homicides, about 1.6 percent. And military-style rifles were used in just 10 of the 136 mass shootings reported since January 2015.

Any policy to reduce the likelihood of these events should, therefore, reflect the very small probability of a military-style rifle being used in a mass shooting that targets the public -- just one in 575,000 (about 50 deaths out of about 29 million rifles).

New regulation would need to be very restrictive. Millions of these guns would have to be removed from circulation to see any measurable effect on public safety, a politically impossible lift.

Price tag of saving a life

A potential reframing of the issue might be to estimate the social cost of gun deaths, establish the burden borne by each weapon and seek policies that reflect it in the market for firearms.

Across many different areas of government, this kind of analysis is applied all the time when examining the benefits and costs of potential policies. When considering food handling or tracking systems, benefits of reducing the risk of illness and premature death are compared with the costs of implementing the policy. Policies to reduce harmful pollution, improve the safety of automobiles or add bicycle lanes to roads are evaluated in similar ways.

To get at a social cost of mortality, measures have been developed to assess how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying. In aggregate, these values are referred to as the ""value of a statistical life"" (VSL).

This is not how much an actual individual life is worth, but it is an estimate of how much, in total, a large group of people would be willing to pay to save one statistical life. For example, if the average response from a sample of 100,000 people indicated a willingness to pay US$100 to reduce their risk of dying by 0.001 percent, than the VSL would be $10,000,000. So, the total economic cost of mortality in a particular year equals the VSL times the number of premature deaths. Similarly, the economic benefit of a mitigating action becomes the same VSL multiplied by the number of lives saved.

That said, different federal agencies use various valuation methods and assumption. The Environmental Protection Agency's adjusted VSL for 2013 is $9.4 million, the Department of Transportation set its 2013 base year value at $9.1 million and the Department of Agriculture provides a midpoint estimate of $8.66 million.

From a purely economic perspective, the social costs of gun deaths likely exceed $300 billion annually. This is a staggering number, more than what the federal government spent on Medicaid in the same year. And that's not including the more than 80,000 nonfatal firearm injuries each year.

A gun's burden

Identifying guns' overall mortality risk burden doesn't exactly help inform legislation targeting certain types of guns used in certain types of homicides.

But, based on the previous analysis of military-style rifles used in mass shootings, these guns (in these situations) are some of the least costly from a VSL perspective. In fact, the social burden of a single military-style rifle is likely to be as little as $15.77 a year (or $455 million for all rifles based on 50 deaths and a $9.1 million VSL).

It is hard to see how this valuation could deter gun sales enough, or support the implementation of a robust screening and background check system, to make a difference. By comparison, handguns - which are implicated in nearly 70 percent of gun-related homicides - bear a disproportionate burden on society of $401 annually per handgun in circulation.

Policies reducing the burden of gun deaths (e.g., by reducing the number of guns or improving their safety) need to be compared against the additional costs of implementing them. These costs could come as regulations, increased taxes/fees or price increases.

In other words, applying a mortality risk valuation to handguns might cost as much every year as the initial cost to the gun owner. In the current climate, any form of tax or fee approaching this valuation would be a political nonstarter.

A way forward

So, if this analysis leads to societal burdens that are both so low (the case of rifles) and so high (the case of handguns) that neither are politically viable, one can easily understand the paralysis in Congress.

The automobile insurance market, where risks are pooled across geographies, types of vehicles and driving behavior, may provide some insights and a way forward.

Similar to guns, nearly 250 million personal vehicles (or their drivers) were associated with 27,507 deaths in 2013. These premature fatalities tally social costs of $250 billion.

For illustrative purposes, if we assume that half of these damages are associated with no-fault third parties, the social burden for non-policy-holder deaths might be about $502 per vehicle, on average.

Unlike with guns, a robust system of vehicle registration and mandatory insurance requirements exists in this market. If we also assume that about half of each auto's liability policy (estimated at $519 in 2013) covers bodily injuries (not property), these insurance premiums represent about half of each vehicle's societal burden.

I'm not suggesting that these premiums are effective deterrents to poor driving or cover all an accident's damages to society. Rather, incorporating the external costs of mortality risks into the cost of ownership alters the number of cars on the road and how they are used.

Applying this relationship to firearms, an annual social price tag of $140 per gun might go a long way toward mitigating the mortality costs of gun-related homicide. This estimate is a weighted average of different types of guns, ranging from $15/year for rifles to $200/year for handguns.

Nobody likes new taxes or additional fees, and the gun lobby will certainly oppose even the hint of a disincentive on gun ownership. But there may be enough Republican and Democrat lawmakers open to the idea of market-based policies that don't directly restrict gun access, progressively impose higher costs to more dangerous guns and generate resources to improve the safety and security associated with guns in America.

Gun reform doesn't have to be gun control

This back-of-the-napkin analysis may be crude, but it does highlight the need and potential for shifting current arguments away from regulating guns to mitigating the social costs of gun-related deaths.

The devil is always in the details, and important debates will be needed around the imposition of new taxes, registration fees or mandatory insurance. It is unclear who should be affected (owners, retailers, manufacturers) or how to include all of the estimated 357 million guns in the U.S., not just the registered ones.

Policymakers should even consider the impact of these types of economic mechanisms on equity of gun ownership -- maybe gun subsidies would be needed for low-income or first-time gun buyers. Most importantly, policymakers should have much-needed arguments about how to reduce gun deaths.

An $140 annual registration fee, applied only to the 23.1 million guns transacted each year, could generate over $3.2 billion in revenues annually. If nothing else, these resources could bolster local police and security budgets, improve access to gun safety training and education, incentivize new technologies that make guns less dangerous and compensate victims' families.

Anything to break the logjam and actually address the real costs of gun violence.

(Reuters Health) - U.S. teens report easy access to firearms, even when they have mental health problems that put them at an increased risk of suicide, according to a new study.

Overall, 41 percent of teens who reported being in a home with a firearm had easy access to it. Among teens with a history of mental illness or suicidal acts, researchers found that percentage was the same.

The American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics advise healthcare providers to talk about firearm safe storage with parents - especially those with at-risk youths at home.

""Our goal of this study was to find out if those recommendations were being implemented effectively in the community,"" said Dr. Joseph Simonetti, the study's lead author from the University of Washington School of Medicine's Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

Simonetti and his colleagues write in JAMA Psychiatry that suicide is the second leading cause of death for U.S. teens. Having a firearm in the home is one risk factor for suicide, they add.

Previous studies have found a lower suicide risk among residents of homes that practice safe storage of firearms.

For the new study, the authors used data collected between 2001 and 2004 from 10,123 U.S. teens between ages 13 and 18 years.

A third of the teens reported living in a home with a firearm. Of those, about 41 percent said they had easy access to that firearm and the ability to shoot it.

Older, male and non-Hispanic teens were more likely to report being able to access firearms. Those living in rural or wealthy households were also more likely to report access.

Among the teens with histories of mental illness or suicidal actions, such as thoughts or attempts, the researchers found they were just as likely as those without such histories to report firearm access.

""There is a disconnect between these generally agreed upon storage methods and what's happening in the community,"" Simonetti said.

He cautioned that the data included in this study is old. ""One of the limitations of this study is we're using data that was collected from 2001 to 2004,"" Simonetti said, adding that he and his colleagues can't say how practices may have changed since then.

""We need better studies on how to promote safe firearms storage especially in households with children and children with mental illness,"" he said.

Simonetti said some effective safe storage methods include using gun locks and gun cabinets and hiding the keys from children.

This is a common refrain heard in the gun debate. Gun control advocates fear -- and gun rights proponents sometimes hope -- the Second Amendment will transform our cities into modern-day versions of Dodge.

Yet this is all based on a widely shared misunderstanding of the Wild West. Frontier towns -- places like Tombstone, Deadwood, and Dodge -- actually had the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation.

In fact, many of those same cities have far less burdensome gun control today then they did back in the 1800s.

Guns were obviously widespread on the frontier. Out in the untamed wilderness, you needed a gun to be safe from bandits, natives, and wildlife. In the cities and towns of the West, however, the law often prohibited people from toting their guns around. A visitor arriving in Wichita, Kansas in 1873, the heart of the Wild West era, would have seen signs declaring, ""Leave Your Revolvers At Police Headquarters, and Get a Check.""

A check? That's right. When you entered a frontier town, you were legally required to leave your guns at the stables on the outskirts of town or drop them off with the sheriff, who would give you a token in exchange. You checked your guns then like you'd check your overcoat today at a Boston restaurant in winter. Visitors were welcome, but their guns were not.

In my new book, Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, there's a photograph taken in Dodge City in 1879. Everything looks exactly as you'd imagine: wide, dusty road; clapboard and brick buildings; horse ties in front of the saloon. Yet right in the middle of the street is something you'd never expect. There's a huge wooden billboard announcing, ""The Carrying of Firearms Strictly Prohibited.""

While people were allowed to have guns at home for self-protection, frontier towns usually barred anyone but law enforcement from carrying guns in public.

When Dodge City residents organized their municipal government, do you know what the very first law they passed was? A gun control law. They declared that ""any person or persons found carrying concealed weapons in the city of Dodge or violating the laws of the State shall be dealt with according to law."" Many frontier towns, including Tombstone, Arizona--the site of the infamous ""Shootout at the OK Corral""--also barred the carrying of guns openly.

Today in Tombstone, you don't even need a permit to carry around a firearm. Gun rights advocates are pushing lawmakers in state after state to do away with nearly all limits on the ability of people to have guns in public.

Like any law regulating things that are small and easy to conceal, the gun control of the Wild West wasn't always perfectly enforced. But statistics show that, next to drunk and disorderly conduct, the most common cause of arrest was illegally carrying a firearm. Sheriffs and marshals took gun control seriously.

Although some in the gun community insist that more guns equals less crime, in the Wild West they discovered that gun control can work. Gun violence in these towns was far more rare than we commonly imagine. Historians who've studied the numbers have determined that frontier towns averaged less than two murders a year. Granted, the population of these towns was small. Nevertheless, these were not places where duels at high noon were commonplace. In fact, they almost never occurred.

Why is our image of the Wild West so wrong? Largely for the same reason these towns adopted gun control laws in the first place: economic development. Residents wanted limits on guns in public because they wanted to attract businesspeople and civilized folk. What prospective storeowner was going to move to Deadwood if he was likely to be robbed when he brought his daily earnings to the bank?

Once the frontier was closed, those same towns glorified a supposedly violent past in order to attract tourists and the businesses to serve them. Gunfights were extremely rare in frontier towns, but these days you can see a reenactment of the one at the OK Corral several times a day. Don't forget to buy a souvenir!

The story of guns in America is far more complex and surprising than we've often been led to believe. We've always had a right to bear arms, but we've also always had gun control. Even in the Wild West, Americans balanced these two and enacted laws restricting guns in order to promote public safety. Why should it be so hard to do the same today?"

Remarkably, lawmakers have done worse than nothing on this issue. Both Democrats and Republicans have gone out of their way to block efforts to prevent so many tragic deaths. Here's how:

We have gutted funding for research on preventing firearms deaths and we have silenced experts who could help prevent accidental gun deaths, suicides and homicidal firearm deaths. Since 1996, appropriations bills have gone out of their way to make sure that, ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.""

As a result the CDC website provides no information on how to prevent firearm violence, despite providing links to info on preventing falls, passenger safety, fireworks, wearing seatbelts and preventing accidental poisonings. Guns are off limits, with no funding for research, no recommendations on how to use them safely or keep them out of dangerous hands.

Shockingly, even the Accountable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) didn't miss an opportunity to specifically prohibit health care providers from preventing gun deaths. An amendment was introduced and co-sponsored by senate majority leader Harry Reid that states

A. ""Wellness and health programs... may not require disclosure or collection of any information"" on gun or ammunition ownership;""

B. ""The Secretary of Health and Human Services (or Medicaid/Medicare programs)... has no authority ""to collect information on ownership or use of firearms and ammunition;""

C. Nor can the Act authorize health providers to maintain records of individual firearm ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition.

As a physician, it's unsettling to be told by politicians what questions are appropriate to ask. Its even more concerning that if we are concerned about our patient's mental health or safety around firearms, there is no reliable way to identify whether the patient has access to firearms. Gun violence is a public health issue. It accounts for more than 30,000 deaths annually. That's slightly fewer than the number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents, which we research extensively. We've saved lives by studying the traffic deaths and mandating airbags, seatbelts and making informed changes to traffic laws. Gun deaths deserve similar attention.

Firearms result in more deaths than the annual number of deaths from Prostate cancer, Leukemia, Pancreatic, Brain or Oral cancer. While we actively support research to save lives of people with cancer, we systematically block any investigation or intervention into ways to slow deaths from firearms. We need to study and be open to public health interventions to limit handgun deaths and violence.

Even staunch N.R.A. gun advocates argue that we should keep guns away from ""evil"" people or people who appear unstable and at risk of homicide or suicide. Doctors have a responsibility to assess our patient's risks for death and disability. This includes inquiring about smoking, seat belt use, bike helmets, and yes, gun ownership. Preventing health providers from asking and recording this information is creating a double standard for guns that is different from anything else in our society. This blind protectionism is both irrational and dangerous. Nurses, doctors and voters should speak out. The National Physicians Alliance has issued a call on behalf of health providers for sensible gun control and a ban on assault rifles.

We need research to guide these decisions. Otherwise how can we judge any plan, even one to place armed guards in schools? We can all start by demanding a plan, but lets also demand some research and thoughtful guidance."

After all, firearm-related injuries remain one of the leading causes of death among U.S. children, with close to 3,500 killed a year. The small and seemingly simple step of securing firearms in a locked cabinet makes a huge difference in protecting young children. By our estimates, approximately 5 percent of preschool age children live in homes in which their parents reported that they owned guns but did not store them in a secure and locked place. To address this problem, many states have implemented Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws. This collection of legislative approaches range from suggestive guidelines for storage behaviors in families with minors to more stringent requirements and harsher penalties for noncompliance, holding gun owners criminally liable regardless of whether someone gets hurt.

Unfortunately, little research exists to test whether these laws are actually associated with family firearm safety behaviors. A primary goal of our study, just published in the American Journal of Public Health, was to understand how gun storage behavior in families with young children varied across states with different CAP laws, controlling for a wide range of parent, family, and state-level factors that are often associated with gun ownership, generally, and gun safety behaviors, specifically. We found that the efficacy of state CAP laws seemed to rely on the general firearm legislative climate in each state. CAP laws were only associated with decreased likelihood of unsafe gun storage behaviors in states that had strong firearm legislation overall. Although we cannot infer causation from these findings, we hypothesize that parents may not be aware of the specific laws in their states but are more generally aware that their state has many laws that regulate gun use, prompting them to be more careful about the purchase and storage of firearms. We also think that having stronger general state laws could potentially affect which families own firearms -- parents who own guns in a state without any regulation may constitute a very different pool of people than those who own firearms in a state in which they have to jump through hoops, such as a background check, to get them.

Overall, these findings highlight that a significant proportion of children in the U.S. are living in homes where they can potentially access firearms, and these estimates are likely conservative due to underreporting arising from not wanting to share private or potentially embarrassing information or from parents' loose interpretation of what constitutes a 'safe' or 'locked' gun. Moreover, even laws that do not directly target the types of behaviors that result in young children accidentally accessing firearms could have potential spillover effects for the safety of children.

This is why comprehensive firearm legislation -- even legislation that doesn't seem to necessarily solve the immediate public health issue that politicians are responding to (such as a school massacre) -- could potentially be important.

Take, for example, proposed federal legislation on background checks that would have closed loopholes in firearm purchases at gun shows. Recent polls show broad bipartisan public support for this type of legislation, and, although it likely won't stop school massacres, it has potential spillover effects that may affect minors' access to firearms. Parents who do not keep their guns safe at home probably will not show up in a database of people with a diagnosed serious mental health illness, but having a mandated background check or waiting several days to return to a store to purchase a gun may create enough friction that could stop some parents who may be less able or inclined to take heed of their pediatrician's recommendations or abide by their state's CAP laws.

huffpo135,huffpo,"['Josh Horwitz', 'Follow Josh Horwitz On Twitter', 'Www.Twitter.Com Csgv', 'Executive Director', 'Coalition To Stop Gun Violence']",2012-02-06 07:20:32-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-horwitz/when-it-comes-to-data-on_b_1256769.html,"Last month, I posted a blog (""The Truth About Gun Sales"") here at Huffington Post that analyzed the gun lobby's favorite pitch to the media. Year after year, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) continue to push stories about ""record-setting"" sales and reporters -- always looking for a sensational lead -- print/air these claims as gospel without actually fact-checking them.

What makes this so remarkable is that the gun lobby blocks both the public and media from gaining access to actual data on gun sales. Instead of sales data, the NRA and NSSF offer reporters data on background checks conducted through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). For a multitude of reasons that I chronicled in my earlier blog, this data does not represent gun sales. As the FBI made clear to Reuters on Saturday, ""An increase in the number of NICS transactions, for a given time period, should not be used to indicate an increase in the number of firearms sold.""

Angered over being exposed as peddlers of bogus data, the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) responded to my blog in a January 13th alert on their website (""Gun Control Activists Fire Squib Loads""). With their NICS ruse foiled, they are now offering yet another separate and distinct body of information as ""hard data"" on gun sales.

For starters, the NRA-ILA seems to now fully acknowledge that NICS checks are not gun sales. ""As Horwitz points out, not all firearm-related NICS checks are for firearm acquisitions, and the number of checks does not reflect the number of firearms acquired in conjunction with the checks,"" they write. ""Among other things, he also points out that some NICS checks are for acquisitions of second-hand firearms."" And yet they can't quite let go of their bogus data, saying that increases in the number of NICS checks from 2007 to 2011 ""almost guarantee[s] that sales of new firearms have been increasing during that time frame.""

Almost guarantees? Or perhaps it's merely an ""exact estimate""? Whatever the case, the NRA was ready to introduce its latest iteration of ""hard data"" on gun sales:

There's a much better indicator of new gun sales that Horwitz ignored: U.S. firearms manufacturers' production data and firearm importation statistics, both reported by the BAFTE [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]. Horwitz accuses NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation of not providing reporters hard data, but reporters can get the BAFTE's data the same way the NRA and the NSSF do -- by visiting the BAFTE's website.

Allow me to interject here for just a moment. The NRA and the NSSF are claiming they wait two years for (embargoed ATF) data on firearms manufacturing and imports? The NSSF is the trade association for the gun industry! Their job is to tell American consumers and investors what's going on in their industry, what's hot and what's not, what's selling and what's sitting in inventory. They're either lying or grossly incompetent. This type of information is routinely reported by other industries up to the current month, as seen in this example. But I digress; let me get back to the NRA-ILA's latest ""hard data"" on gun sales:

The BATFE's data show that the number of firearms made in the U.S.A. and not exported, plus the number of firearms imported, increased from 5.1 million in 2005, to 5.7 million in 2006, 6.5 million in 2007, 6.9 million in 2008, and almost 9 million in 2009. Figures for 2010 and 2011 have not been released, but based on the trend in NICS checks, it's likely that they will follow a similar pattern.

But are firearms manufactured in the U.S. and not exported, plus imported firearms, really ""a much better indicator"" of gun sales? First of all, we don't have any data at all for 2010 and 2011, so (once again) we can't have an adult conversation about these figures. More importantly, firearms are some of the most durable products you will find, with extremely long life spans. How do we know these products aren't simply sitting on the shelves?

That theory is certainly plausible because the ATF data shows a multi-year trend of rising firearm imports. Are these foreign imports a threat to domestic firearm manufacturers? If so, U.S. manufacturers could be increasing production to try to compete. Let's remember that the domestic automobile industry overproduced itself right into bankruptcy.

If that's not enough, the NSSF added even more ""evidence"" of increased gun sales in a recent press release: ""Another indicator pointing to robust gun sales is the federal excise taxes collected on the sale of new firearms and ammunition, which have risen 48.3 percent over the last five years."" Yes, the excise tax receipts have gone up, but since this includes ammunition and a long list of bow-hunting products it offers little insight into how many firearms are being moved off retailers' shelves. Additionally, the federal excise tax is based on the value of the product and is not a set tax per unit. Increased tax collections could reflect many things, including the rise in the price of raw commodities that make firearms more expensive. Purchasers might also be passing on less expensive items in favor of more expensive ones. Finally, it certainly reflects the high cost of ammunition due to wartime shortages as well as general inflation. In conclusion, aggregate excise tax data does not tell us anything about firearm sales.

The NSSF has even stooped so far as to offer reporters social media searches as evidence of what brands of firearms sold the best during the 2011 holiday season. Facebook and Twitter hits? This is literally laughable.

Let's be perfectly clear here. Virtually every other industry in America offers the media actual data on sales. Click here to see industry data on pharmaceuticals, motorcycles, and ever-popular Mac products, for example. So why do the NRA and NSSF continue to block access to this information?

Because the industry has something ugly to hide.... If the NSSF did make sales figures public, it would then be possible to compare gun sales data to aggregate data on crime gun traces and identify with specificity the volume of firearms being diverted to criminals and traffickers in the illegal market. Researchers could also divine which firearm manufacturers are failing to use effective safeguards to stop the illegal diversion of their products.

It's no secret that the gun industry knows that their distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals. Bob Ricker, the former executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council (then the leading gun industry trade association), made that patently clear when he became a whistleblower in 2003. Ricker participated in a series of high-level meetings with NRA and gun industry executives from 1992 to 1997 in which it was acknowledged that ""the diversion of firearms from legal channels of commerce to the black market"" takes place ""principally at the distributor/dealer level."" Ricker proposed strict standards and guidelines to help stem the flow of guns to criminals. But his proposal was rejected by industry attorneys, who concluded that, ""You can't change operating procedures, because if you do, then you're going to be admitting sort of liability.""

And is it simply a coincidence that the same year Ricker came forward with these details, the NRA pushed for amendments to the ATF appropriation bill in Congress that prohibited lawmakers, the media, the public, and researchers from gaining access to crime gun trace data? The pattern couldn't be clearer.

The smoke and mirrors game the gun lobby plays with bogus ""sales data"" allows them to promote the infamous ""More Guns, Less Crime"" mantra of now-discredited ""researcher"" (and current Fox News commentator) John Lott while cloaking a far darker truth. Namely, that -- faced with a stagnant customer base that has declined precipitously over the past 35 years -- the gun industry has purposely and continuously manufactured firearms for one of its most important market segments: traffickers and prohibited purchasers (i.e., children, criminals, the dangerously mentally ill, domestic abusers, etc.). And all in the name of profit.

What's remarkable is that anyone in the media is still willing to play their game with them.

Their ""mock mass shooting"" was met with a much larger counter-protest and derision by many onlookers in the left-leaning city of Austin who saw the group pushing a position that could increase the danger brought by firearms at the university that saw one of the worst mass school shootings in U.S. history.

One of the mock mass shooting organizers, the group Come and Take It Texas, said allowing gun-free zones on campuses eliminated a human right to personal protection.

""Our goal is to instill the importance of everyone to be able to defend themselves in any way they choose,"" the group said in a statement posted on its website.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Gun rights activists Phil Newsome, left, and Jason Mosley, right, carry guns and flags as they march near the University of Texas.

The actual mock shooting was a small-scale event that went mostly unnoticed and culminated with about half a dozen people faking their deaths on a sidewalk in a pool of simulated blood.

Ahead of the event, about 20 pro-gun activists walked near the university, some with military-style weapons over their shoulders.

The group was far outnumbered by media, police and students in the middle of final exams, many wondering what the small group of flag-waving, gun-toting people was doing.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Chalk outline drawings of bodies are washed away at the University of Texas.

""There is always something crazy going on in Texas,"" said student Zena Brown, a junior at the university.

The school threatened to arrest the group with trespassing if they tried to do their mockshooting on campus.

Cindy Samuelsen, who was taking her daughter back to Dallas, said the rally was disrespectful to the students and the university.

""I don't know what is wrong with these people in that they feel the need to show off their big guns,"" she said.

The mock mass shooting comes days after a university panel grudgingly acknowledged that it will have to allow guns in the classrooms under a new law that goes into effect next year, dubbed ""campus carry.""

The law allows people 21 and older with a concealed handgun license to carry handguns in classrooms and buildings throughout the University of Texas system, one of the nation's largest with an enrollment of more than 214,000 students."
huffpo137,huffpo,"['Terry Newell', 'Founder', 'Leadership For A Responsible Society']",2013-01-28 11:01:22-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/terry-newell/guns-and-responsibility_b_2514927.html,"Gun ownership is a Constitutional right, protected by the Second Amendment. It is a freedom that the roughly 20 percent of Americans who own guns cherish, and most other Americans believe it should remain one of our freedoms. No legislative proposal has been made -- or would be tolerated -- that would remove the right to ""keep and bear arms."" Despite some of the hyped rhetoric of recent days, none of the proposals under consideration to address gun violence would abolish or even severely restrict the right to purchase multiple types of firearms.

But, in society, freedom comes with responsibility. Free speech comes with the responsibility not to defame others or yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater. Freedom of religion comes with the responsibility to protect the ""free exercise"" of those who believe in a different deity. Freedom to buy goods and services comes with the responsibility to pay for them. Freedom to drive a car comes with the responsibility to operate it safely. Freedom to make, sell, own or use firearms comes with the responsibility to do so responsibly -- and to help others do so.

The debate we are having in America should not be about gun ownership. That is a protected freedom that (except possibly for future purchases of ""assault rifles"") is not being challenged. The debate should be about how to balance that right with responsibility -- not only for individuals but for the society that authorizes and supports personal ownership of firearms.

Pillorying the NRA should not be part of this debate. They have the Constitutional right to express their views. Many of their programs and services help people of all ages use firearms responsibly. They have not caused the mass murders that horrify us. It is fair to ask if they are acting responsibly in the debate about gun violence (and we will come to that), but irresponsible gun manufacture, sales and use is the core problem, not the NRA.

Since owning guns is a right, what are the corresponding responsibilities that we as individuals who make, sell, buy, or use firearms must accept? Some of these seem clear; there will be debate about others. First, no one should be able to purchase a gun who is neither mentally nor legally fit (due to age, mental condition or previous criminal record) to do so. Since some who are not fit will try to obtain firearms nonetheless, society -- including all those who make and sell guns -- has a responsibility to make sure they do not do so. This has implications for responsible behavior needed from parents to mental health professionals to law enforcement to gun makers and sellers.

Second, those who make and enforce laws respecting firearms must have objective and accurate information with which to do so. Since this requires scientific research, that research should be both permitted and supported. Gathering scientific data does not prevent anyone from owning a gun.

Third, gun owners have a responsibility to store and use their firearms safely, and to ensure that others (especially children and the mentally ill) do not have unauthorized access to the use of them. Those who make guns have a responsibility to help make that possible. The technology exists to do so.

Fourth, law enforcement and other safety personnel have a responsibility to protect the public against gun violence -- and to be protected against heavy weaponry in the performance of their duties. When they are prevented from doing their jobs or faced with overwhelming firepower, they cannot act responsibly and the public safety is threatened. This means that communities have the right and responsibility to take those actions they deem essential -- and that are Constitutional -- to protect children, adults, and public safety personnel from gun violence. Stationing law enforcement personnel in schools is one action they have every right to consider, though they should consider both the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.

Beyond at least these responsibilities, we need as a society to discuss the responsibility that needs to be taken by parents as they raise their children and by the media (whose Constitutional right to make electronic games and movies that show and, in some cases, glorify gun violence) to create an environment healthy for children and the broader society.

There is also a responsibility we all have -- and that applies to the debate itself about gun violence, gun rights, and gun control. We must act responsibly in that debate. When gun rights advocates, including the NRA, charge that banning assault weapons or high capacity magazines will lead down the slippery slope to confiscating all privately held guns in America, that is using fear to stoke hatred and avoid a reasonable conversation about gun responsibility. Sensible laws about guns will no more prevent gun ownership than sensible laws about the use of automobiles prevent driving. On the other side, when gun control advocates act as if the NRA is the enemy of America and that gun control itself will rid the nation of gun-related mass murder, that is also acting irresponsibly in the debate we need to have.

Like so many other questions in American politics today, this issue has become polarized. The way we talk about it -- as either ""gun rights"" or ""gun control"" -- tells us that. Instead of compromise, too many are looking for total victory. Moral courage among politicians, who either wish to climb on one side of the fence or duck the issue entirely, is lacking. That, too, is an evasion of responsibility. We owe ourselves, and especially the children and adults we have lost to gun violence, both reasonable debate and sensible action."

I have known Dave since 2004 or 2005 when he opened a small gun shop in Connecticut just over the Massachusetts line. Dave had previously been in the car business as a broker, he had done quite well, but, being a gun nut, once he had some dough in his pocket he did what we all do, he bought some gun inventory and opened a shop.

One thing led to another and within three or four years Dave had moved to a much larger location and now had a gun shop that was maybe the second largest store in the whole state. And since Connecticut is a fairly small state and Dave’s store was situated right off an exit of Interstate 91 ― “easy on, easy off” ― he got customers from as far away as the Danbury area, one of whom was Nancy Lanza, who showed up some time in 2011 or 2012 with her young son, Adam, and purchased an AR-15.

Two days after the Sandy Hook massacre, as Dave was about to close for the night, a squad of helmeted ATF agents carrying rifles and wearing body armor drove up in two Humvees and charged into the shop. Oh yes, they were immediately followed into Dave’s store by some media folks who had been alerted by the ATF that something connected to the Sandy Hook mess was about to go down.

Let me interject one point here that needs to be understood. I heard about Sandy Hook while I was standing behind the counter of my gun shop; I closed the shop immediately and went home. But later that night after the shooter was identified, I went back to the shop and pored through my records to find out whether or not I was the dealer who had sold the gun. Since it was a rifle, Nancy Lanza could have come into Massachusetts and bought the gun from me. I would have been required to ship the gun to a Connecticut dealer, so I was able to quickly check and I knew that the gun hadn’t come from me. I can guarantee you that every gun dealer in Connecticut and Massachusetts was looking through their books that same night in the hopes that the AR wasn’t sold by them.

The ATF spent the next several weeks examining every gun sale that Dave ever made. They also suspended his license which he never got back. Eventually they found a sale of a hunting rifle which was improperly made, but it was still a violation of 4473 law so they could now build a case. A year later, having absorbed the loss of his entire business, Dave took a misdemeanor plea for the sale of the hunting rifle and also agreed never to go back into the business of selling guns. All the result of a legal sale of an AR-15.

Back in 1995 my good friend in Fairfax, Wayne-o LaPierre, took a lot of flak for calling the ATF a bunch of ‘jack-booted thugs.’ Wayne-o has never been known to be as a master of the understatement, but when I think about how Dave LaGuercia was treated by the ATF, I have to say that Wayne-o was right. And by the way, every, single gun-shop owner throughout the Northeast knows what happened to Dave because every shop is visited on a regular basis by the sales reps for S&W, Ruger and Glock, so news gets around."

A Field & Stream sales associate confirmed to The Huffington Post that AR-15s and so-called modular sniper rifles are available for purchase at the store in Cranberry Township, Pa. The store, the first of two Dick's has said it plans to open in 2013 focusing on hunting and fishing gear, had its grand opening on Friday, according to the Pittsburgh Business Times.

Adam Lanza used his mother's Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to kill 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14. Lanza also killed his mother and himself.

Dick’s Sporting Goods, the largest U.S. sporting goods retailer, issued this statement after the killings:

Out of respect for the victims and their families, during this time of national mourning we have removed all guns from sale and from display in our store nearest to Newtown and suspended the sale of modern sporting rifles in all of our stores chainwide.

Modern sporting rifle is the firearm industry term for military-style rifles that fire a single shot with each pull of the trigger.

The news that Field & Stream is selling AR-15s and sniper rifles suggests that the company's period of mourning is over. A salesman at Dick's in Homestead, Pa., said neither that store nor any Dick's sells AR-15s. Dick’s did not respond to questions from HuffPost on why it's selling semi-automatic weapons at the spinoff store and whether it will resume selling them at Dick's locations.

Assault-style weapons like the AR-15 are extremely profitable for retailers. The Sandy Hook shootings appear to have boosted gun sales and industry profits, as enthusiasts rushed to purchase guns before federal legislative action, which fizzled. The New York Times points out that before the Newtown killings, AR-15 rifles sold for about $1,100. But by February, some retailers were charging as much as double.

Update -- 12:15 p.m.: Shares of Dick's fell Tuesday morning as the company reported lower-than-expected earnings. A Reuters report blamed the weak sales on the summer's cool and wet weather, as well as higher payroll taxes and the job market.

Erik Lowry, owner of Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms in McKeesport, Pa., claims his store's Facebook page was shut down following an AR-15 giveaway launched earlier this year, according to ABC's WTAE Pittsburgh. On Friday, he received a message from Facebook informing him the page was deactivated, but he received no further explanation.

Back in February, Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms made headlines when the store gave away hundreds of rounds of ammunition, dozens of high-capacity magazine clips and an AR-15 assault weapon. Prospective contestants had to ""like"" the Facebook page and share with friends to be entered in the contest.

Lowry explained to radio station NewsRadio 1020 KDKA that an AR-15 could come in handy for customers to ""defend themselves from a tyrannical government,"" a right provided by the Second Amendment.

It began as a Christmas contest, but many later construed it to be a protest of President Barack Obama's push for gun control following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on Dec. 14, Lowry previously told The Huffington Post.

The owner, who claims his business is losing thousands of dollars each day because of the alleged blockade, thinks misinformation regarding the giveaway is to blame for Facebook shutting down his page.

“People were thinking if you won, I was just going to send a gun to your front door. It just doesn't work that way,” he told WTAE, saying that winners had to to pass background checks. “If you win a firearm from us, you come to the store, and as long as you pass a background check, you walk out with your gun.”

News platform Vocativ recently contacted the social network about gun giveaways within the Facebook community. A spokesman for the social network said that, since such pages can be considered ads, they are in violation of the site's terms. Vocativ provided Facebook with the names of multiple stores participating in such contests, and the pages were subsequently removed.

""Our Ad Guidelines prohibit promotion of the sale of weapons and the Ad Guidelines apply to Pages with commercial content on them,” a Facebook rep said. “Ads may not promote the sale or use of weapons, ammunition, or explosives.”

Still, Lowry is angry about what happened.

""This kind of censorship is unconstitutional,"" he told The Blaze regarding Facebook shutting down his page. He plans to reach out to the National Rifle Association (NRA) for legal council.

Facebook could not be reached for comment at the time of publication."

Bright, who is challenging Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the Republican primary, announced in an email to supporters Thursday that he will give away a Palmetto Armory AR-15 as a part of his campaign.

“I know the political talking heads may sneer as they continue blaming guns and law-abiding gun owners for the acts of thugs and madmen. But I am the pro-gun, pro-Constitution candidate in this race for the U.S. Senate -- and I can’t think of a better way to get that word out than by giving away a brand new AR-15,” Bright said in the email. “My hope is this AR-15 giveaway will also help me get my message of liberty out to tens of thousands of South Carolinians.""

On his campaign website, Bright notes that ""one lucky Second Amendment Supporter will be the winner,"" in the raffle scheduled for Feb. 15.

The contest's winner must be 18 years of age or older and will have to pass a criminal background check in order to be eligible.

Bright's email began with a reference to the mass shooting of 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. A drive for gun control after the shooting ultimately failed in Congress.

“In the wake of the horrific tragedy in Newtown, Conn., gun-grabbers were sure they had the votes to ram gun control into law,” the email read. “Thanks to the action of Second Amendment supporters all over the country, their schemed failed -- even despite my Republican primary opponent, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.”

Graham voted to allow debate on the legislation but ultimately voted against the legislation itself, as Politico notes.

Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) made a similar campaign move last year when he also chose an AR-15 to raffle off.

Bright introduced a bill to create a guns, shooting and Second Amendment awareness class for South Carolina's high schoolers last January.

""I believe the more guns we have the safer we are, because had there been someone in Newtown with a weapon, had it been a teacher, they could have stopped it early,"" Bright told WSOC.

Bright is one of four Republicans planning to run against Graham in the June 10 primary.

huffpo142,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-02-16 10:57:41-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-purchase-age_us_5a8606fee4b00bc49f424c9e,"This week’s mass shooting at a Florida high school, where a lone gunman opened fire on students and staff, killing 17 and injuring 15, has distressingly similar details in the profile of the suspect and his weapon. A 19-year-old former student with a history of disciplinary issues had gotten his hands on an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle capable of firing highly lethal rounds in rapid succession. And he’d done so completely legally.

Under federal law, and in almost every state, the minimum age for purchasing a long gun from a licensed dealer is 18. This category of firearms encompasses shotguns and rifles, including the assault-style weapons that have become popular in mass shootings. Federal law provides no minimum age for the possession of long guns, and in some states, it’s legal for children younger than 18 to own these weapons as long as they have parental consent.

For handguns, the age limit increases to 21 under federal law. Just two states, Hawaii and Illinois, have laws specifically raising the minimum purchase age for long guns to 21, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

This system gives millions of young Americans the right to buy the deadliest civilian weaponry three years before they can legally drink alcohol. It dates back to the Gun Control Act of 1968. Although civilian firepower has changed dramatically over the past half-century, these distinctions have not.

“Back in the day, you had a lower gun age for rifles because they were often used for hunting,” said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law. “Young men would have valid reasons for hunting, and they could even have it for self defense, but it was primarily for recreation.”

Back then, many popular civilian rifles were bolt-action, or lever-action. They typically featured lower-capacity magazines, and required the shooter to manually chamber each round, firing more slowly than modern semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15, the now-popular civilian rifle platform modeled off military-issue weapons of the past and present.

In this technological landscape, lawmakers in the 1960s regarded handguns as a much bigger threat in the hands of young people, who can tend to be more erratic and prone to violence.

“This all stems from the idea that handguns were usually weapons of self-defense and criminal misuse, and neither of those two things were seemingly appropriate for most kids.” said Winkler. “So, the idea was that because handguns were thought to be more dangerous than long guns, that they had stricter rules.”

Handguns are still used in the majority of gun violence today. Handguns were involved in about 65 percent of the 11,000 gun homicides recorded by the FBI in 2016. Rifles were used in just 374 of those slayings, though the murder weapon wasn’t specified in 3,077 cases, likely due to inconsistent reporting by law enforcement agencies.

Although shootings involving military-style rifles may be aberrations in the steady stream of daily U.S. gun violence, it’s becoming increasingly clear that they can inflict mass casualties in the wrong hands. Yet state and federal regulations on the purchase of handguns often don’t extend to long guns. For example, gun stores must report to law enforcement any sale of multiple handguns to a single buyer over a five-day period. This requirement doesn’t exist for long guns. Many states also have waiting periods for handgun purchases, which don’t extend to long guns. And state open-carry laws regarding the public display of firearms tend to be far more permissive toward long guns than handguns.

This discrepancy makes some gun violence prevention groups uneasy.

“These highly lethal weapons really have no other purpose other than to kill people fast and efficiently, and to kill as many people as possible,” said Laura Cutilletta, legal director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “Handguns may be more typically used in crime, but these types of assault weapons can actually do more damage.”

The firearms industry doesn’t share this concern. Over the past decade, gun groups have rebranded assault-style rifles as “modern sporting rifles” in an attempt to highlight their increasing popularity for recreational shooting. In 2012, there were an estimated 20 million to 30 million of these weapons in civilian hands, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade group. Gun companies have sold millions each year since then, and they’ve become a significant part of the business.

“The idea of marketing military-style long guns to civilians is something that came about in more recent decades, because the gun industry needed a new way to make money,” said Cutilletta. “People aren’t hunting as much as they did in the past, so this is something they can market to people. It’s marketed as a bit of a toy, something that you might not hunt with, but that you take to the range.”

There have been a number of shootings and failed plots involving people under the age of 21 who have legally purchased their weapons, including both assault-style rifles and shotguns. In 2016, a 19-year-old in Washington state opened fire at a house party with his legally purchased AR-style rifle, killing three people, including his ex-girlfriend, and injuring one.

Winkler said it’s time to institute a uniform gun age nationally for all types of firearms. He also advocates raising the minimum age to buy or possess a firearm without supervision to 25. He noted that people younger than that are responsible for a disproportionate amount of U.S. gun violence, including almost half of all gun homicides.

Winkler suggested following the example of drinking laws, which have led to national incentives encouraging states to implement a 21-year-old limit. But he’s not optimistic about that effort being replicated with firearms, largely because lobbyists from the National Rifle Association and other groups have a stranglehold on the gun debate."

Regardless of the event, the solution remains the same: buy a gun. And if industry and gun fan mags are any indication, it should be an AR-15 assault rifle.

A fact left unstated by the gun lobby (and virtually unnoticed by the news media) is the fact that after gun sales rise, they eventually drop--sometimes precipitously. Sometimes, as Michael Kassnar, president of AR-15 manufacturer KBI/Charles Daly, explains, there's a ""market collapse."" Kassnar should know--he's just shut his business' doors.

According to the March 1, 2010, edition of theNew Gun Week:

One factor that contributed to the company's closure was what Kassner called a ""collapse"" of the market in mid-2009 for semiautomatic sport utility rifles, the so-called ""black guns"" designed on the AR-15 platform.

In other words, AR-15 assault rifles, but let us continue.

He said the rush to purchase those firearms came to a halt in about July, leaving him with a ""warehouse full of guns nobody wanted."" Orders for about $8 million worth of firearms were canceled, he said, leaving KBI/Charles Daly essentially high and dry for the second half of the 2009 sales year. It appeared that the public became less fearful that the Obama administration was going to come after semi-autos, so the panic buying came to an end, Kassnar said.... ""The consumer just stopped buying,"" he said....the ""sales blitz lasted about eight months.""

Not to worry. Despite the long-term trends of declining gun ownership in America's boom and bust gun manufacturing economy, the NRA and gun industry are always on the lookout for another manufactured crisis to exploit and reel in the ""panic"" buyer."

Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and a vocal gun control advocate, told CNN Monday that he had recently purchased an assault weapon to demonstrate the need for stricter gun laws.

Kelly, who in January launched Americans for Responsible Solutions with Giffords, took to Facebook on Friday to express concern over the nation's lax background check requirements, stating that it was ""scary"" to think that people can buy assault weapons ""without a background check at a gun show or the Internet.""

""I just had a background check a few days ago when I went to my local gun store to buy a 45,"" Kelly wrote. ""As I was leaving, I noticed a used AR-15. Bought that too.""

Kelly added, ""Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes ... We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole.""

In Arizona, where Kelly purchased the assault weapon, gun dealers must perform background checks through the Arizona Firearms Clearance Center and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. According to RB Investigations, which offers defensive firearms training in Arizona, this process can take less than a minute to complete.

Kelly wrote on Facebook that he intended to turn over the assault weapon to the Tucson Police Department.

He told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday that it was ""important for me to have firsthand knowledge about how easy it is or difficult it is to buy a weapon like that."" He also stated that he was ""looking forward at some point to buying a gun at a gun show [and] also possibly selling a gun so I know really the ins and outs of this issue.""

Kelly -- who, in addition to increased background checks, has also advocated limits on high-capacity magazines -- has repeatedly noted that he and Giffords are proud gun owners before arguing that it is past time for Congress to respond to gun violence.

""Gabby and I are both very strong supporters of the Second Amendment,"" Kelly told CNN's Anderson Cooper in January. ""Gabby owns a gun, I own a gun. This really isn't about the Second Amendment, I don't believe it is -- this is about gun safety and it's about safety of the public.""

On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a bill that would require background checks for nearly all gun purchases. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), will receive a full vote on the Senate floor, although it lacks bipartisan support."

But, before I show and tell you why it made me feel invincible... Let's back up.

According to a recent NIH report, 14 percent of boys conceived on Long Island in 1966 were born missing the gene for ""how mechanical stuff works."" I believe the medical literature refers to this malady as: Being Jewish.

Regardless of the study's veracity, I was born without the gene for understanding how the internal combustion engine works, how to install a new light switch, and how to hang a curtain rod without drilling 17 ""test"" holes first.

My deficiency is easily overcome in most cases. When I need curtain hung or a switch installed, I just suffer with either too much or too little light. And when my car makes a funny noise... I pretend I can't hear it, because I got the gene for ""ignoring stuff"" in triplicate.

Anyway -- guns are another thing I knew nothing about.

I didn't know the difference between a .9mm bullet and a .223. I knew nothing about muzzle velocity. No idea how the projectile comes out the front when a weapon is fired... and how the shell spits out the side. Clueless why one gun is considered more dangerous than others, and I'm stumped how mobsters keep a gun tucked in their waist stop it from falling down the inside of their pant leg. My guess: velcro?

To me, all guns are made for just one purpose: to kill.

And to compensate for a small penis. Okay, two things. (That's a joke, NRA.)

As the debate over guns became more intense in the last four weeks, I discovered myself in a number of situations discussing the subject and I realized... I don't know enough facts on which to base a cogent opinion.

On one hand, I believe Americans have a right to defend ourselves from well, whoever might come for us, our family, our things or our guns. Heck, I think it's okay to shoot the guy who knocks on my door to sell me magazines -- as if anyone is still reading. On the other hand, guns kill people and well, lots of people are dying. Which I'm against.

Much of the media -- and even many of the people I know -- have made it seem like this issue is black and white. Some say: Get rid of guns... people won't die. Others say: Ban assault weapons, people won't die. While still others say: The Second Amendment says my right to own a gun will not be infringed. And a few people said, ""Muzzle velocity. What the?"" Side note: most of my friends were born on Long Island in 1966.

This debate is not black and white. Answers aren't easily found, ""problems"" aren't easily identified, and band-aids won't cure the horrible plague of gun violence.

It's this murky combination of difficult questions and my own selfish interest in facts that lead me to a gun range in Torrance, Calif., on January 17.

Gathering facts. You may remember ""facts."" Facts are things that are true and incontrovertible. Facts are what media types, reporters and even politicians used to gather before ""talking points"" were invented.

Note to media: Yes, it's possible to find some facts sitting at your computer. However, there's another way to get them as well: Get off your manicured fat ass, get out of the news studio and go out into the world and talk to people. Ask questions. Turn over rocks. Ask more questions. Pick up a gun. Fire it.

It my case, finding some vital gun facts took two hours... leaving me plenty of time in the afternoon to update my Facebook page. Or in your case, media, have your ass manicured.

(Note: I'm not so naïve as to think that two hours at the gun range has given me all the facts... but it's a decent start if you're interested in forming an opinion on guns.)

Anyway, at the Torrance Gun Range I met with an NRA member and former U.S. Army paratrooper who is also a 40-year gun specialist/instructor. He answered my questions and supervised as I fired the AR-15 -- an assault weapon, as well as the Glock 9mm.

So, what was it like firing the AR-15?

It made me feel very powerful. It made me feel invincible. It made me feel like I could very easily kill someone. It made me feel safe.

And, what was it like firing the Glock 9mm?

It made me feel very powerful. It made me feel invincible. It made me feel like I could very easily kill someone. It made me feel safe.

But, in reality, nuclear weapon-related destruction has taken place, with shocking levels of U.S. casualties.

This point is borne out by a recently-published study by a team of investigative journalists at McClatchy News. Drawing upon millions of government records and large numbers of interviews, they concluded that employment in the nation's nuclear weapons plants since 1945 led to 107,394 American workers contracting cancer and other serious diseases. Of these people, some 53,000 judged by government officials to have experienced excessive radiation on the job received $12 billion in compensation under the federal government's Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. And 33,480 of these workers have died.

How could this happen? Let's examine the case of Byron Vaigneur. In October 1975, he saw a brownish sludge containing plutonium break through the wall of his office and start pooling near his desk at the Savannah River, South Carolina nuclear weapons plant. Subsequently, he contracted breast cancer, as well as chronic beryllium disease, a debilitating respiratory condition. Vaigneur, who had a mastectomy to cut out the cancer, is today on oxygen, often unable to walk more than a hundred feet. Declaring he's ready to die, he has promised to donate his body to science in the hope that it will help save the lives of other people exposed to deadly radiation.

Actually, workers in nuclear weapons plants constitute only a fraction of Americans whose lives have been ravaged by preparations for nuclear war. A 2002 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services maintained that, between 1951 and 1963 alone, the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons -- more than half of it done by the United States -- killed 11,000 Americans through cancer. As this estimate does not include internal radiation exposure caused by inhaling or swallowing radioactive particles, the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research has maintained that the actual number of fatal cancers caused by nuclear testing could be 17,000. Of course, a larger number of people contracted cancer from nuclear testing than actually died of it. The government study estimated that those who contracted cancer numbered at least 80,000 Americans.

Who were these Americans? Many of them were ""downwinders"" -- people whose towns and cities were located near U.S. nuclear testing sites and, thus, were contaminated by deadly clouds of nuclear fallout carried along by the wind. During the 1950s, the U.S. government conducted close to a hundred atmospheric nuclear explosions at its Nevada test site. Nearly 30 percent of the radioactive debris drifted over the towns to the east, which housed a population of roughly 100,000 people. The residents of St. George, Utah recalled that a ""pink cloud"" would hang over them while they worked amid the fallout, walked in it, breathed it, washed their clothes in it, and ate it. ""Even the little children ate the snow,"" recalled one resident. ""They didn't know it was going to kill them later on.""

During subsequent decades, leukemia and other cancer rates soared in the counties adjoining the Nevada test site, as they did among the 250,000 U.S. soldiers exposed to U.S. nuclear weapons tests. From the standpoint of U.S. military commanders, it was vital to place American soldiers close to U.S. nuclear explosions to get them ready to fight in a nuclear war. Subsequently, as many of these soldiers developed cancer, had children with birth defects, or died, they and their family members organized atomic veterans' groups to demand that the federal government provide medical care and financial compensation for their suffering. Today, atomic veterans receive both from the federal government.

Uranium miners comprise yet another group of Americans who have suffered and died from the U.S. nuclear weapons program. To obtain the uranium ore necessary to build nuclear weapons, the U.S. government operated thousands of uranium mines, often on the lands of Native Americans, many of whom worked as miners and died premature deaths. The U.S. Public Health Service and the National Institute for Public Safety and Health conducted studies of uranium miners that discovered alarmingly high rates of deaths from lung cancer, other lung diseases, tuberculosis, emphysema, blood disease, and injuries. In addition, when the uranium mines were played out or abandoned for other reasons, they were often left as open pits, thereby polluting the air, land, and water of the surrounding communities with radiation and heavy metals.

This American nuclear catastrophe is not only a matter of the past, but seems likely to continue well into the future. The U.S. government is now beginning a $1 trillion program to ""modernize"" its nuclear weapons complex. This involves building new nuclear weapons factories and labs, as well as churning out new nuclear weapons and warheads for firing from the air, land, and sea. Of course, if these weapons and their overseas counterparts are used, they will destroy the world. But, as we have seen, even when they are not used in war, they exact a dreadful toll -- in the United States and, it should be noted, in other nations around the world.

How long are people going to tolerate this nuclear tragedy?

huffpo148,huffpo,[],2018-03-01 12:13:25-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vladimir-putin-new-nuclear-weapons_us_5a9832f7e4b09c872bb238ca,"MOSCOW, March 1 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin unveiled an array of new nuclear weapons on Thursday, in one of his most bellicose speeches in years, saying they could hit almost any point in the world and evade a U.S.-built missile shield.

Putin was speaking ahead of an election on March 18 that polls indicate he should win easily. He said a nuclear attack on any of Moscow’s allies would be regarded as an attack on Russia itself and draw an immediate response.

It was unclear if he had a particular Russian ally, such as Syria, in mind, but his comments looked like a warning to Washington not to use tactical battlefield nuclear weapons.

His remarks were greeted with skepticism in Washington, where officials cast doubt on whether Russia has added any new capabilities to its nuclear arsenal beyond those already known to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.

The Pentagon, which recently unveiled a nuclear policy revamp based partly on the bellicose posture from Moscow, said it was not surprised by Putin’s presentation.

“We’ve been watching Russia for a long time. We’re not surprised,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White.

“These weapons that are discussed have been in development a very long time,” she said, without addressing any of Putin’s specific claims of new capabilities.

Putin has often used militaristic rhetoric to mobilize support and buttress his narrative that Russia is under siege from the West. His 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea boosted his ratings to a record high and he has cast his military intervention in Syria as a proud moment for Moscow.

On Thursday, he sought to back his rhetoric with video clips of what he said were some of the new missiles. The images were projected onto a giant screen behind him at a conference hall in central Moscow where he was addressing Russia’s political elite.

“They have not succeeded in holding Russia back,” said Putin, referring to the West, which he said had ignored Moscow in the past, but would now have to sit up and listen.

“Now they need to take account of a new reality and understand that everything I have said today is not a bluff.”

Among weapons that Putin said were either in development or ready was a new intercontinental ballistic missile “with a practically unlimited range” able to attack via the North and South Poles and bypass any missile defense systems.

Putin also spoke of a small nuclear-powered engine that could be fitted to what he said were low-flying, highly maneuverable cruise missiles, giving them a practically unlimited range.

The new engine meant Russia was able to make a new type of weapon - nuclear missiles powered by nuclear rather than conventional fuel.

“Nothing like it in the world exists,” Putin told the audience. “At some point it will probably appear (elsewhere) but by that time our guys will have devised something else.”

Other new super weapons he listed included underwater nuclear drones, a supersonic weapon and a laser weapon.

In one of his video clip demos, a weapon appeared to be hovering over what looked like a map of the state of Florida.

The audience, made up of Russian lawmakers and other leading figures, frequently stood up and applauded his presentation, which culminated with the Russian national anthem being played.

Earlier in the speech, he had struck a very different tone, ordering officials to halve the number of Russians living in poverty by sharply boosting social and infrastructure spending in an obvious pre-election pitch to voters.

NATO MEASURES “USELESS”

Putin, who has dominated his country’s political landscape for the last 18 years, said the technological advances meant that NATO’s build-up on Russia’s borders and the roll-out of a U.S. anti-missile system would be rendered useless.

“I hope that everything that was said today will sober up any potential aggressor,” said Putin.

“Unfriendly steps towards Russia such as the deployment of the (U.S.) anti-missile system and of NATO infrastructure nearer our borders and such like, from a military point of view, will become ineffective.”

Steps to contain Russia would also become unjustifiably expensive and pointless, he forecast.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said in a statement after the speech that the new weapons Putin had unveiled meant that NATO’s missile defense shield, in Poland, Romania and Alaska and planned elements in South Korea and Japan was like an umbrella that was full of holes.

“I don’t know why they would now buy such an ‘umbrella’,” Shoigu said, referring to Seoul and Tokyo.

NATO declined immediate comment.

The United States has long asserted that U.S. missile defenses are incapable of halting a large-scale attack by a major nuclear power, like Russia or China, due in part to the limited number of U.S. missile interceptors.

Instead, the technology is aimed at what the U.S. views as “rogue” states, like Iran or North Korea.

“They know very well that it’s not about them. Our missile defense has never been about them,” White said.

She added that the U.S. focus in addressing Russia’s nuclear modernization was strengthening America’s own nuclear forces to serve as a deterrent.

Lisbeth Gronlund, senior scientist and co-director of the Global Security Program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Putin’s announcement of a missile with a nuclear-powered engine, even if true, would change little when it came to the Russian threat since Russia already has large numbers of ICBMs.

Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the IISS think-tank in London, said he was skeptical about some of Putin’s statements.

“It’s a mix of things that are still in the lab, things that are in tests, and things we knew they had. We’ll have to unpick a lot of this to sort out what is really new.”

Putin also voiced concerns about a new U.S. nuclear doctrine, saying Russia’s own doctrine was defensive and only envisaged the use of nuclear weapons in response to an attack.

Russia has repeatedly said it is keen to hold talks with the United States about the balance of strategic nuclear power and Putin put Washington and other nuclear powers on notice.

“We will view any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies, be it of small, medium or any force, as a nuclear attack on our country,” he said.

“Our response will be immediate. Nobody should have any doubts about that.”

Putin said that Russia did not plan to attack anyone, however. Russia’s growing military might was a guarantee of world peace, he said, designed to preserve a strategic balance of power on the planet."

The global outrage in response to the carnage caused by the use of chemical weapons is proof that until they are eradicated, there is a significant risk that one day they will be used, whether by intention or by accident. Nuclear weapons, for all their status and symbolism, are not exempt from this stark reality, and the cost of neglecting to recognize this would be disastrous.

Nuclear weapons are designed to destroy cities. They are indiscriminate weapons, whose effects cannot be limited or controlled. Furthermore, the use of even a small fraction of existing arsenals -- more than 17,000 warheads -- would disrupt the climate and threaten agricultural production, leading to the starvation of up to two billion people.

As was made clear by the Hiroshima Committee of Experts in their analysis of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima, ""It is not possible to protect civilians from a nuclear weapons attack. To protect civilians, there is no measure other than to prevent a nuclear weapons attack from occurring, whether it be deliberate or accidental. To prevent the use of nuclear weapons, there is no way other than to abolish nuclear weapons themselves.""

Study upon study has pointed to the inability to prevent or care for civilian casualties on a mass scale. Mitigation is simply impossible for a weapon capable of producing temperatures comparable to the centre of the sun.

Nuclear weapon possessors are, of course, not ignorant of the true effects of nuclear weapons, just as they are not ignorant of the double standard that is afforded these weapons compared to other weapons of mass destruction. The truth is that, for decades, nuclear weapons have been given an almost mythological status: they are seen as 'keepers of the peace' or 'necessary evils.' They have been transmuted into symbols of power and prestige for the political and military elites of nuclear possessor states.

By keeping the focus on their humanitarian impact, we acknowledge that nuclear weapons are weapons -- not policy tools. No security doctrine or theory can completely obscure the fact that any use of nuclear weapons would entail catastrophic humanitarian consequences -- massive civilian casualties and irreparable damage to the environment, public health and the world economy.

Nuclear disarmament is not solely the province of nuclear weapon possessors. Nuclear weapons are a global humanitarian threat, and the responsibility to eliminate them lies with nuclear free states as much as it does with nuclear weapon possessors. On September 26, the UN General Assembly will hold the first ever High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament, which will be attended by heads of state and foreign ministers. This is an opportunity for nuclear free states to seize the day and steer their own course toward a world free from nuclear weapons.

Images and reports from Syria have reminded us of the reason why international standards must be set. Weapons that cannot discriminate between military targets and civilians, between armed combatants and infants, are anathema to any sense of human dignity. Chemical and biological weapons have been banned through legally binding international instruments. Nuclear weapons are, therefore, an anomaly among weapons of mass destruction. The acceptability of this status quo must end, and this starts with a treaty banning nuclear weapons. While armed conflicts persist, international norms that condemn civilian casualties and demand the preservation of human dignity must respected, and where there are gaps, we must fill them.

Recognising the catastrophic humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons means taking a clear position against the acceptability of these weapons. It means clearly articulating that the possession and threat of use of nuclear weapons are directly opposed to humanitarian principles and formulating that stigma into a legally binding instrument which bans them outright.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the state's prohibition on what the court called ""the vast majority of semi-automatic rifles commonly kept by several million American citizens"" amounted to a violation of their rights under the Constitution.

""In our view, Maryland law implicates the core protection of the Second Amendment -- the right of law-abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home,"" Chief Judge William Traxler wrote in the divided ruling.

Provisions that outlaw these firearms, Traxler wrote, ""substantially burden this fundamental right.""

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who recently suspended his Democratic presidential campaign, signed Maryland's Firearm Safety Act of 2013 in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, which spurred similar initiatives in other Democratic-leaning states.

The legislation mostly targets specific kinds of semi-automatic firearms -- such as AR-15s and AK-47s -- and large-capacity magazines, and adds certain registration and licensing requirements.

But gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, quickly moved to challenge these laws in the courts, claiming that the restrictions they imposed on lawful gun ownership were overly broad and weren't proven to save lives.

""This case was a major victory for the NRA and gun rights advocates."" Adam Winkler, UCLA law professor

The legal attacks have largely failed. Last October, a federal appeals court in Manhattan upheld the most iconic of these laws -- those passed in New York and Connecticut in direct response to the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. And in December, the Supreme Court declined to review a ruling out of Illinois that upheld a similar ban on assault weapons.

The high court's reluctance to intervene in these disputes has left the Second Amendment in a bit of a state of flux. Since the Supreme Court established in 2008 and 2010 that the amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for self-defense within the home, judges have struggled to apply those decisions to the newer spate of gun legislation. And inconsistent rulings and standards across the country have left the scope of the law unclear.

When the Supreme Court refused to take up the Illinois case, Justice Clarence Thomas complained that the Second Amendment was being relegated to ""a second-class right.""

""If a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the Second Amendment guarantees nothing,"" he wrote, and added that those earlier decisions enshrining the right to gun ownership shouldn't be expected to ""clarify the entire field.""

The lack of clarity since then underscores why Thursday's decision may be a boon to those who want to see a broader interpretation of the Second Amendment, setting the stage for the next Supreme Court confrontation.

""This case was a major victory for the NRA and gun rights advocates,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA who specializes in Second Amendment law. ""This opinion is an important one because it subjects important gun control laws to the most strict form of judicial scrutiny.""

Indeed, the biggest surprise in Chief Judge Traxler's 66-page opinion is the words ""strict scrutiny,"" a stringent constitutional test that most government laws and regulations fail. Other courts have applied more forgiving standards to similar gun legislation and upheld it.

The 4th Circuit's decision didn't outright strike down the Maryland legislation. Instead, it instructed a lower court to subject the provision to the higher legal standard, meaning more litigation and the possibility of a future showdown at the Supreme Court -- though maybe not yet, according to Winkler.

As if to illustrate the volatile politics and legalities of gun control, dissenting Circuit Judge Robert King all but declared that the court's ruling would lead to the next mass shooting.

""Let's be real,"" King wrote. ""The assault weapons banned by Maryland's [law] are exceptionally lethal weapons of war.""

Tahera Ahmad, director of Interfaith Engagement and associate chaplain at Northwestern University, has accused United of ""Islamophobia"" after an encounter with a flight attendant Friday that left her in tears.

Ahmad wrote in a Facebook post that she asked for an unopened can of Diet Coke during beverage service on her flight. When she was brought an open can, she requested a new beverage for sanitary reasons but was told, ""I'm sorry I just can't give you an unopened can so no diet coke for you.""

A man sitting near her was later brought an unopened beer, and Ahmad, who wears a hijab in her Facebook profile photo, asked the flight attendant again why she wasn't able to have a similar can.

""She said, 'We are unauthorized to give unopened cans to people because they may use it as a WEAPON on the plane,'"" Ahmad wrote.

I am sitting on a United airlines flight in the air 30,000ft above and I am in tears of humiliation from discrimination.... Posted by Tahera Ahmad on Friday, 29 May 2015

Ahmed also wrote that after the encounter, she asked her fellow passengers if the experience was discriminatory, but no one responded aside from one man who said, ""You Moslem, you need to shut the f** up ... yes you know you would use it as a WEAPON so shut the f**k up.""

When asked about the incident, a representative for United emailed The Huffington Post this statement:

The flight attendant onboard Shuttle America flight 3504 attempted several times to accommodate Ms. Ahmad's beverage request after a misunderstanding regarding a can of diet soda. The inflight crew met with Ms. Ahmad after the flight arrived in Washington to provide assistance and further discuss the matter. Additionally, we spoke with Ms. Ahmad yesterday to get a better understanding of what occurred and to apologize for not delivering the service our customers expect when traveling with us. We look forward to having the opportunity to welcome Ms. Ahmad back.

Ahmad's story has quickly spread on social media, with some people adopting the hashtag #UnitedForTahera, calling for a boycott of the airline. Despite the statement from the airline, Ahmed wrote on Twitter that she has yet to receive a ""sincere apology"" from United and is ""disappointed at [the] dismissal.""

Ahmad told the Chicago Sun-Times she's been targeted because of her hijab before. She said she's been spat on and had the covering ripped off, but the airplane incident was particularly troubling because she was “publicly targeted as a threat to people.”

Ahmad did not immediately return a request for comment from HuffPost."
huffpo152,huffpo,"['Ben Hallman', 'Senior Editor For Projects', 'Investigations', 'The Huffington Post']",2014-02-11 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/guns-in-bars_n_4768884.html,"South Carolina on Tuesday became the latest state to allow concealed weapons in bars, making it the most recent victory ground for gun rights activists who have peeled back more than a dozen state-level gun restrictions in recent years.

The new law, signed by Gov. Nikki Haley a week after a man was fatally shot in a South Carolina bar parking lot, allows people holding concealed-weapon permits to carry firearms in places that serve food or alcohol, as long as they don't drink while inside. The law has a significant exemption: Establishments may enact their own weapon bans, provided they post a large sign in their window warning customers of their policy.

That bar and restaurant owners are now forced into the unpleasant position of potentially alienating some portion of their clientele by either posting a sign -- or not posting a sign -- is a win for gun groups that for decades have pursued local strategies for rolling back gun laws in states. Thanks to their work, it's now easier than ever before to carry guns in many public places in the U.S. South Carolina is their latest conquest.

Oklahoma, for example, recently made it easier for residents to openly carry guns in public, and a movement is underway in Texas to enact a similar measure. (It even has the backing of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis). Tennessee, Ohio, Arizona, Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina have all enacted laws similar to the one just adopted in South Carolina, allowing for concealed-carry in bars and restaurants. Kentucky is also considering legislation.

The advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, formed in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre, has attempted to counter this momentum. Its strategy, thus far, has hinged on persuading business owners that it is in their best economic interest to enact gun bans.

In recent days, volunteers for the South Carolina chapter of Moms Demand Action have gone door-to-door to dozens of establishments, including national chains, said Erin Dando, the chapter leader.

""So far this is mostly about education,"" Dando said. ""Most business and bar owners don't even know that there has been a drastic change in state policy. We are telling them that they still have the right to ban concealed firearms.""

But once educated, Moms Demand Action expects establishments to take their side, or face repercussions.

""We are letting them know we will only go to places that have gun bans,"" Dando said.

So far, this type of approach has yielded some limited success. Last summer, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote an open letter to customers asking that they not bring guns into the coffee chain's retail locations, a position the moms' group had lobbied to bring about. But a recent effort to convince Staples stores to ban guns hasn't gained much traction.

A current fight underway in North Carolina between the Moms Demand Action and gun rights supporters suggests that the organization can achieve some victories at the local level, but that they are hard-fought. After a law similar to the South Carolina one passed in the state last year, dozens of businesses hung ""no guns allowed"" signs in windows at the urging of gun-control activists. Some, though, later took down their sign after they received angry calls and emails from gun rights supporters.

South Carolina bars and restaurants will likely soon face the same choice.

Dando said she is encouraged by what she has heard so far. Some bars, she said, have already hung signs, which under the new law must be uniform: 8-inches by 12 inches, with the words ""NO CONCEALABLE WEAPONS ALLOWED"" in black, 1-inch-tall, uppercase type, with a black silhouette of a handgun inside a 7-inch circle with a diagonal line through it. The law also forces businesses to abide by strict rules in placing the signs.

The rollback of the bar gun ban could be followed by even more drastic action. At the signing ceremony, Haley said she supports another bill currently under consideration by lawmakers that would completely eliminate all permitting, fees and training requirements for carrying weapons, according to The State, a newspaper in Columbia, S.C.

Gov. Haley signed the measure allowing concealed-carry in bars and restaurants around midday on Tuesday, while the attention of most of the state was on a snow and ice storm barreling down on the South.

""She signed it right after she declared a state of emergency, which I find ironic,"" Dando said."

huffpo154,huffpo,"['Robert Creamer', 'Follow Robert Creamer On Twitter', 'Www.Twitter.Com Rbcreamer', 'Political Organizer', 'Strategist', 'Author', 'Partner Democracy Partners']",2012-12-16 22:36:27-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/assault-weapons-ban_b_2313290.html,"The tragedy in Connecticut forces America to confront a simple question: Why should we allow easy access to a weapon of mass destruction just because it could conceivably be referred to as a ""gun""?

I count myself among the many Americans who at various points in their lives have owned and used long guns -- hunting rifles and shotguns -- for hunting and target shooting. No one I know in politics seriously proposes that ordinary Americans be denied the right to own those kinds of weapons.

But guns used for hunting have nothing in common with assault weapons like the ones that were used last week in the mass murder of 20 first-graders -- except the fact that they are referred to ""guns.""

Rapid-fire assault weapons with large clips of ammunition have only one purpose: the mass slaughter of large numbers of human beings. They were designed for use by the military to achieve that mission in combat -- and that mission alone.

No one argues that other combat weapons like rocket-propelled grenades (RPG's) or Stinger Missiles should be widely available to anyone at a local gun shop. Why in the world should we allow pretty much anyone to have easy access to assault weapons?

Every politician in America will tell you they will move heaven and earth to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. Yet we have allowed the ban on this particular weapon of mass destruction to expire. As a result, a terrorist named Adam Lanza was able to have easy access to the assault weapons he used to kill scores of children in minutes.

Let's be clear, Adam Lanza was a terrorist just as surely as he would have been if we were motivated by an extreme jihadist ideology. It makes no difference to those children or to their grieving families whether their loved ones were killed by someone who was mentally deranged or by someone who believed that by killing children he was helping to destroying the great Satan.

When an individual is willing -- or perhaps eager -- to die making a big ""statement"" by killing many of his fellow human beings, it doesn't matter what their motivation is. It does matter whether they have easy access to the weapons that make mass murder possible.

And after last week, can anyone seriously question whether assault weapons are in fact weapons of mass destruction? If Lanza had conventional guns -- or like a man in China who recently went berserk, he only had knives -- he would not have been physically capable of killing so many people in a few short minutes.

Of course you hear people say -- oh, a car or an airliner can be turned into a weapon of mass destruction -- many things can become weapons of mass destruction. And there is no question after 9/11 that we know that this is true. But cars and airliners have to be converted from their primary use in order to become instruments of mass death. It takes an elaborate plot and many actors to take over an airliner and it isn't easy to methodically kill 27 people with a car.

More important, assault weapons have no redeeming social value or alternative use whatsoever. The only reason to purchase an assault weapon, instead of a long gun used for target practice or hunting, is to kill and maim large numbers of human beings.

And it is not the case that if assault weapons were banned ordinary people would get them anyway. We certainly don't take that attitude with nuclear weapons or dirty bombs. We make it very hard for a terrorist to get nuclear weapons or dirty bomb. It used to be hard to get assault weapons.

When the former President of Mexico visited the United States some time ago to discuss the drug-fueled violence on the Mexican border, he pointed out that the end of the assault weapons ban in the U.S. had resulted in an explosion of smuggling of assault weapons from the United States to Mexico. Weapons that were previously unavailable in large numbers, became plentiful. He begged the United States to re-impose the assault weapons ban.

Allowing easy access to assault weapons guarantees that terrorists, criminals and mentally unstable people will use them to commit future acts of mass murder -- it's that simple. There are seven billion people on the planet. Try as we may, we are not going to prevent some of those seven billion people from becoming terrorists, criminals or mentally unstable. Why make it easy for them to do harm to their fellow human beings by giving them easy access to a weapon of mass destruction?

Since this tragedy, there have been calls for greater restrictions and background checks on those who can buy guns -- and there should be. But from all accounts, the weapons used in the Connecticut murders were purchased legally by the shooter's mother -- who herself appeared to be perfectly sane right up to the moment that Lanza used those same weapons to end her life.

The NRA will no doubt repeat its mantra about the ""slippery slope."" ""If we ban assault weapons, shotguns will be next,"" they say. Really? By banning anyone from buying Stinger Missiles that are used to shoot down airplanes do we make it more likely that the government will one day prevent people from hunting ducks?

The simple fact is that no right is absolute because rights come into conflict with each other. Your free speech does not give you the right to cry ""fire"" in a crowded theater.

Is the NRA's concern that banning assault weapons will put us on a ""slippery slope"" more important than the lives of those 20 first graders? Should it really take precedence over the fact that today in Newtown, Connecticut there are 20 families with holiday presents on a closet shelf, that were purchased for an excited six-year-old who will never open them?

Are the NRA's fears more important than the terror faced by children in the Sandy Hook Elementary school last week?

Does the right to own an assault weapon take precedence over the right of those parents to see their children grow up, and graduate from college, and stand at the alter to be married, and have children of their own?

The bottom line is that there is no reason why weapons of mass destruction of any sort - chemical weapons, biological weapons, RPG's, improvised explosive devices (IED's), missiles, dirty bombs, nuclear devices, or assault weapons -- should be easily accessible. For 10 years there was a ban on the production, ownership and use of assault weapons in the United States until Congress and the Bush Administration allowed it to lapse when it sunset and came up for reauthorization in 2004.

A serious response to the tragedy in Connecticut requires that Congress act to reinstate the assault weapons ban before the children of other families fall victim to the fantasies of some other mentally unbalanced individual -- or the ideology of a terrorist who has been empowered by our failure to act.

huffpo155,huffpo,"['Katherine Brooks', 'Deputy Enterprise Editor', 'Culture']",2017-09-15 08:44:10-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-2017-emmys-belong-to-ann-dowd-peak-tvs-greatest-secret-weapon_us_59b80404e4b09be416588866,"Ann Dowd is peak TV’s secret weapon.

Not that the longtime actress’s power is unknown. She’s been hailed widely for her roles in Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” and HBO’s “The Leftovers” ― and she’s appropriately nominated for a 2017 Emmy Award for both. (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Best Drama Guest Actress, respectively.) But whether she was playing the wickedly devout Aunt Lydia in Bruce Miller’s critically acclaimed adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s book, or the largely speechless, yet wildly intimidating cult leader, Patti, in Damon Lindelof’s series based off Tom Perrotta’s 2011 novel, she delivers something more than just a statue-worthy performance.

Across her many roles on TV (not to mention her beloved parts in films like “Compliance”), Dowd seems to bottle all the necessary elements of prestige entertainment into one body. Toss her into a series mix ― preferably, as the quasi-villain to the storied anti-hero of your dystopia ― and she’ll provide the pitch-perfect acting your well-lit drama needs. The best part is that her effectiveness doesn’t rest on scripted violence or gratuitous nudity; rather, her unrivaled elocution and unmissable grimaces are capable of captivating your senses for just as long as those other prestige fallbacks. Forget the 13 rules, just get yourself an Ann who can emote like millions of regularly engaged fans are watching.

Need further proof of her power? Here are just a few more prestige shows and miniseries she’s graced with her presence: “Masters of Sex,” “Olive Kitteridge,” “True Detective,” “Girls.” (If you need a reminder, Dowd’s turn as an emotionally-stunted woman in an incestuous relationship with the series’ killer on “True Detective” Season 1 is fantastically distressing.) Before that, she was featured on fan-favorite shows like “Freaks and Geeks,” “X-Files” and “The Baby-Sitters Club.” Ann is everywhere.

Ahead of the 2017 Emmy Awards, airing on NBC on Sept. 17, we spoke to Dowd about her banger of a year, the possibility of learning more about Aunt Lydia in “Handmaid’s Tale” Season 2, and the undeniable empathy of “The Leftovers.” While she might be more humble when it comes to her star capacity, she’s willing to explain how feeling like “the one who just does not fit in” helped her to stick her landings.

Hulu

Hi, Ann! I was just on hold with some ominous music playing, and I wish I was more fluent in classical music, but I feel like it was very appropriate to talk to the actress behind Lydia and Patti.

Oh, my god, yeah. I bet that was intentional. No, I’m kidding. Wow.

So you have had quite a year in two very different, but two very culturally relevant television shows. So I wanted to ask you about both of them. But I’ll start with “Handmaid’s Tale”: Have you started shooting Season 2 yet?

No we don’t start until, I believe, mid-September. Yes, it’s nice. I’ve finished a series called “Good Behavior,” which is wonderful. And that was in North Carolina. It’s with Michelle Dockery, do you know it? And Juan Botto and Terry Kinney? It’s a terrific show with TNT, but I hope people see it because they’re so darn good. Anyway, and then we go into “Handmaid’s Tale.”

I was pretty excited to read Bruce Miller tell The New York Times that Aunt Lydia is one of his most fascinating characters and that he would like to explore her backstory more in Season 2. During the filming of Season 1, did you start to come up with your own theories about Lydia’s origins?

That’s a great question. I asked Bruce early, before we began shooting, how did he see her life before Gilead? And he said, “Well, I think she was a teacher.” And that made tremendous sense of course ― huge sense. And I thought, wow, I can just imagine her in a Catholic girls school or, say, a public school, watching the world go to hell. Meaning ― the disrespect, the promiscuity, the drug use, the pollution, religion having gone out of the lives of young people. You can imagine her just watching all this go down and thinking there’s got to be a way to salvage this world.

I think of her as having kind of a lonely life, really. She’s a loner, I think. Not a lot of friends, not a lot of social life. I think her church is her refuge. When you think of someone who has such a narrow view of life ― a rigid holding onto the Bible in its most extreme ― you wonder, where does that person come from? What creates that level of rigidness? Did she herself suffer a loss, did she have a baby, did she have an abortion, did she have men who mistreated her, that she had to absolutely shut down and promise God that she wouldn’t abandon him? Do you know what I mean? Going on those lines of, what brought her to this place of extreme beliefs? When you look around and you meet people in your life and think, wow, how did you get there? How did you get to that place where you exclude so much of what is evident in the world? Surely you can’t think that all people are going to fit into your way of thinking. But it’s a serious question, and I always think there’s got to be some level of ... there’s a reason why things are oppressed, let’s just put it that way. And I’m sure Lydia has her reasons.

I think what makes her so fascinating is that she’s a complex villain on the show. We see her preside over these vicious scenes like the salvaging, but we also see her in these pretty stunning moments of gentleness, particularly when it comes to the character of Janine. Did you ever think about the more gentle, mundane parts of her backstory, like what hobbies she might have been interested in?

That’s interesting. I think she loves, loves, loves to teach students and give them a level of understanding. And so she is very drawn to them and isn’t there to hurt them. I think she takes that very seriously and wants to protect them. As to what her hobbies might have been, well, maybe she’s a gardener. You know, and I kind of think of her with a sort of solitary life. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was probably a very fine Mahjong player or bridge player. I think she’s very, very bright and has her church circle. I think these are relatively solitary endeavors, you know? Trips to the country, explore the Vatican.

HBO

One of the last times we saw Lydia, she was in a pretty exasperating situation. She’d just ordered the handmaids to stone Janine only to have them band together and refuse. At this point, do you think Lydia is starting to see the light a little bit? Or do you think this is sort of the beginning of her doubling back down on her devotion?

I think she’s in some form of panic and wondering how in the world this could have happened. How did they miss the boat? How did they not realize the severity of what was happening, and the shift that was underway? I think that she’s going to reinvest, for sure. This just is not acceptable on any level. I mean, things in life are hard. I imagine her feeling, you know, the stoning and so on and so forth. She was very, very conflicted about it herself. But in the end, you don’t just change the plan because something is difficult. And I think the reaction of the girls was unacceptable to her, and I think it really threw her, completely threw her. And she’s regrouping and I think she’s panicking.

Obviously you’ve all been asked a lot about the show’s relevance throughout the series’ first season, and we’re seeing a lot of religiously motivated legislature popping up in state congresses across the country since, particularly related to reproductive rights. For you, did sitting with the story of “The Handmaid’s Tail” over the past year influence the way you digested current events?

Yes. You know, it’s just so hard to believe that people could make a choice to control others and to repress others and then all in the name of God. I am baffled by that. Those who claim to be pro-life. When I think of those in the “far right” or those who are pro-life to the extreme, and at all costs protect the unborn, the thing that enrages me is you want to ask everyone of them: How many foster children are in your home now? What children who have no family, who have no one supporting them, or sticking up for them, or educating them, or loving them ― how many are in your home? How dare you picket and repress, and take into your own or try to take into your own hands others’ rights. Why don’t you pay attention to what is around you? To the issues that surround you? I find it baffling, and really deeply upsetting.

The show has inspired more than a few women across the country to dress up in handmaid robes and protest in congresses in Missouri, Ohio, Texas and California. Was it surprising to you that the show had such an impact on activism?

I was so thrilled. And that was the hope, you know? When someone puts a name and a face to something and says here’s what, it just opens the door to more. That would be the hope. Yes, you can speak up, there is a way! I love that about it so much and that certainly doesn’t surprise me. It just thrills me, actually.

While Handmaid’s Tales had more of a direct connection to current affairs in the U.S., I think that “The Leftovers” has had a different kind of cultural relevance. For me, its relevance was a bit more emotional. It sort of captured this feeling of desperation and anguish that seems to dial into something universal about our present day. Did you feel that or consider that at all when you were playing Patti?

Yes, yes, I agree with you. Because haven’t we all been in that place of panic, and repression? How can I move forward here, what am I going to do? Oh yes, and to see that there is a way to survive, there is a way always to move forward. I don’t say always ― think of those who have lost their lives, think of what goes on all over the world for refugees. It’s so desperate. But yes, I do think [“The Leftovers”] gets right to the core of it. And there’s something, if you’ll forgive the term, that entertainment provides ― something beyond a way to forget your life for a moment. It offers you a chance to think more deeply about your life. To just connect to it, and sit with it, and say, “Wow, how can I move forward with this?”

That to me was a gift in “The Leftovers,” as well. How do you sit with grief? How do you sit with loss and not run from it? How do you let go? And with “Handmaid’s,” [how do you] identify the repression, stay awake, stay alert? Don’t think someone else is going to do it for you. Look up from your phone. Take action. Fight for the small rights, because they build very quickly into the difference between life and death.

The characters that you play in “Handmaid’s” and “Leftovers” ― they have some similarities to varying degrees. They’re both part of cults, and they’re portrayed as villainous or counters to the protagonists. Were you drawing any parallels between the characters of Lydia and Patti?

Well, of course they’re very different human beings, and they come from different lives. Of course, don’t we all? What they have in common, I think, is that they found their true strengths and agency in committing to these various beliefs. Patti, for the first time in her life, became the leader she was meant to be. I think she lived an entirely repressed life, an abusive life, and no one gave her any credit for anything. And she knew something was going to happen, and when it did actually happen, that woke her right up and she stepped straight into her place of power and strength and confidence and leadership. And she was able to commit fully to the end, which was taking her life. Lydia similarly, she was in it for the long haul. She will, I think, go to the mat and stay there until the job is done.

Do you think that you’re personally drawn to acting in roles like these ― strong, agency-driven women ― or do they sort of just find you?

Well, it’s a good question. It would seem that way, that these roles have come to me. And how phenomenal; they’ve fascinated me and you jump on board quickly. I guess I could say I’m drawn to the loner, the outside, the one that just does not fit in, never has, probably never will. I think they’re beautiful creatures, and they move me every time. So to be able to participate in the life of someone like that, it just means the world to me, honestly.

If you could take on a role in TV or film that’s outside the realms of Patti and Lydia and these beautiful outsiders, do you have an idea of what that would be?"

Dwan Diondro Wakefield, 17, Byron McBride, 19, and D’Allen Tyreek Washington, 17, were booked on the charges hours after Kingston Frazier’s body was found inside his mother’s stolen car on Thursday, jailhouse records show.

The child’s mother had said that she left her son asleep in her car when she ran into a Jackson Kroger supermarket around 1 a.m. that morning. When she returned, her car and son were gone, state police have said.

The Madison County coroner said the boy had been shot multiple times, conflicting with previous reports that he had been shot once in his head, Mississippi News Now reported.

MBI Kingston Frazer, 6, was found dead inside of his mother's car after it was stolen outside of a grocery store on Thursday, police said.

“We do believe he was shot in the back of the car,” District Attorney Michael Guest told the local Jackson news outlet. “Whether he was asleep or awake, I don’t have any idea.”

Surveillance video captured the suspects pulling up to the car Kingston was in just moments after his mother, Ebony Archie, entered the store. A suspect left the group’s vehicle and got into Archie’s car. Both vehicles drove off, Jackson police said.

Guest told The Associated Press on Friday that investigators were still looking for the weapon used to kill the child, but that they are confident that his killers are behind bars.

Madison County Sheriffs Office Suspects Dwan Diondro Wakefield, 17, DAllen Tyreek Washington, 17, and Bryon McBride, 19.

Mississippi Bureau of Investigation special agent Rusty Clark said in a sworn statement the AP obtained that Wakefield implicated McBride in interviews as the one who stole Archie’s vehicle and shot and killed her son.

“Other than it just being somebody being mean and evil and cruel, I’m not seeing a motive being developed as to why these individuals would have killed this child,” Guest told the Clarion-Ledger. “That’s probably something we’ll never get. We’ll probably never learn a motive as to why this occurred.”

Though capital murder convictions carry the chance of the death penalty in Mississippi, only McBride would be eligible because of his age. The Supreme Court abolished capital punishment as a sentence for crimes committed by someone younger than 18 in 2005."

A judge has denied bond to a Chicago man who shot himself in the penis after allegedly robbing a hot dog stand.

Terrion Pouncy has been charged with two counts of armed robbery stemming from an alleged robbery that happened Tuesday morning at Maxwell Street Express, according to CBS Chicago.

Police said the 19-year-old suspect held a gun up to two employees and robbed them of their cellphones, wallets and cash, according to NBC Chicago.

At one point, Pouncy allegedly pressed a .38 caliber pistol to the head of a 39-year-old worker who had been passing a bucket filled with grease over the counter.

The victim told his co-worker to hand over the cash from the register. When the two employees gave Pouncy their wallets and a stack of singles, the grease bucket tipped and bills went flying, Assistant Cook County State’s Attorney Erin Antonietti said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Pouncy allegedly bent over to collect the cash and then shifted the gun in his waistband while running away from the restaurant.

At that point, he apparently pulled the trigger and fired a bullet that struck him in the penis, Antonietti told the court. The 39-year-old victim wrestled briefly with Pouncy before he staggered away from the restaurant.

Pouncy called 911 from the steps of a house across the street and reported being shot. He was taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for his injuries before being arrested.

Police said surveillance cameras captured video and audio of the robbery, and showed Pouncy struggling to make it across the the street.

Police recovered the wallets he allegedly stole, as well as the .38 caliber pistol. They said his blood-stained boxers had a particular pattern that matched underwear seen in the surveillance video when he bent over to collect money off the floor."

gofundmecom/help-for-chey In a photo shared on a GoFundMe page after Cheyanne Willis claimed she had a miscarriage, she appears to be pregnant. Police now say she was not pregnant.

But she apparently faked not only her pregnancy but also a miscarriage after a mass shooting at her gender reveal party, according to police in Ohio.

“We were led to believe an unborn child was murdered in this incident only to find out that was not the case,” Colerain Township Police Chief Mark Denney said in a news release this week.

Willis, 21, was shot in the leg on July 8 when two gunmen showed up at a party on Capstan Drive and fired at least 14 rounds at the guests. Autum Garrett, 22, of Andrews, Indiana, was killed in the volley of gunfire. Eight others, including three children, were wounded, police said.

“The purpose of the party was to disclose the gender of Cheyanne Willis’ unborn child,” the police report said.

The next morning, Willis claimed the shooting caused her to have a miscarriage, Cincinnati’s WCPO-TV reported.

Denney didn’t say how investigators determined Willis wasn’t pregnant, but he did say “hours and days have been wasted following leads” that were based on lies.

“From the very beginning of this investigation, we have met significant resistance that is uncommon from victims of crime wanting a resolution,” the police chief said. Police would not comment further on the investigation of the shooting.

Willis made headlines in 2015 when a video was uploaded to Facebook that showed her being assaulted by a group of women. The video showed the women brutally beat her, shave her head and write “I got my ass whopped” on her forehead. Willis was reportedly hospitalized after the attack.

In regard to the fake pregnancy, police spokesman James Love told People magazine that Willis cannot be charged. Charges will likely only be considered if the falsehood is somehow linked to the shooting.

“As ridiculous as it might be, it’s not a crime to lie, [and] it’s not a crime to have a party over that lie,” Love said. “Now if she lied and put everyone in the danger — of course, the shooters would be the main focus, but [to press charges] would be a decision up to the local prosecutors.”

A GoFundMe campaign, titled “Justice for Cheyanne,” is no longer accepting donations. It’s unclear if monies donated before the campaign was closed will be refunded. There was no immediate response from GoFundMe about the status of the account.

As of Wednesday, authorities had not identified any suspects in the shooting.

It can be jarring to see placards advertising ""Flu Shots Today"" in late July or early August in 80-degree weather.

But those signs may be more than just an unwelcome reminder that summer's days are numbered. Mounting scientific evidence is raising questions about whether vaccinating people that early may actually be undermining the effectiveness of the nation's massive flu vaccination program.

Studies from the US and Europe have detected a steady decline in vaccine protection in the months after vaccination. The most recent research, published just last month by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showed that the vaccine's effectiveness was reduced by more than half for a couple of strains of flu, and had diminished almost entirely for another by five or six months after vaccination.

More research is needed to confirm the findings. But Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said there's enough evidence now to suggest early vaccination efforts -- part of an attempt by commercial pharmacies to capture a bigger piece of the flu vaccine pie -- should be discouraged.

""I have been concerned for some time that we have gotten into the marketing of influenza vaccine versus the effective use of influenza vaccine. And we've got to reconsider that,"" Osterholm told STAT.

""Until we get more data, frankly I think the very best approach is to try to make sure we get flu vaccine into people just before flu activity starts, not something convenient to when the marketers want to get people in the door of department stores and grocery stores.""

Other scientists say it's too soon to jump to a conclusion that would require changing recommendations. The CDC currently advises people should be vaccinated by the end of October.

""Is there waning [of protection] within a given season? I do think the evidence is growing and it's growing in a way that suggests that there is something there. But we need more information,"" said Jill Ferdinands, an influenza epidemiologist at the CDC and the lead author of the most recent article on this question.

Influenza vaccination programs are a major public health endeavor. Although the annual effort always falls short of vaccinating everyone -- the CDC estimated that only 40 percent of people had been vaccinated by early November, its most up-to-date data -- the US uses more than 100 million doses of flu vaccine every year. So far this year, manufacturers have shipped nearly 148 million doses.

Once people are vaccinated, it takes about 14 days for the immune system to generate a protective response, a factor in the debate over timing.

""It is hugely disruptive to try to immunize millions of people in a six- to eight-week period beginning in October or November. So I understand in the context of a universal immunization program, to get the vaccine into all those arms it's nice to be able to start earlier,"" said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a flu epidemiologist at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control.

Canada starts its flu vaccination efforts after the US, generally in late October or early November. But Skowronski said at this point that's mainly because it can't get the vaccine from the suppliers sooner.

The biggest challenge for those who plan flu vaccination campaigns is the mercurial virus itself. Flu season is not like fishing season; it does not have a fixed start date.

The fact is health authorities know a flu epidemic will occur sometime between late November and late March, and that the epidemic will spike, then decline, roughly over a 13-week period.

But which strain of the flu will be the major cause of illness? How harsh or mild will the outbreak be? And most crucially, for planning purposes, when will the annual epidemic start? Even the best flu experts can only guess.

(If you're wondering about flu activity this year, it's definitely heating up across the country. If you've been meaning to get a flu shot but haven't gotten around to it, you can still get one -- but you'd be ill-advised to wait much longer. Flu has arrived.)

Some years the worst of the action is in late January and early February. Other years an early season will hit before Christmas. And many years after an initial peak caused by one of the influenza A viruses, H3N2 or H1N1, there will be a second wave of illness triggered by influenza B, in March and April. ""It's part of the complexity of the question,"" acknowledged Ferdinands.

An unusually late flu season in 2011-12 in Europe sparked the latest round of questions about how best to time flu vaccination campaigns. Scientists who study how well the vaccine protects year after year saw a lot of cases of flu among people who had been vaccinated.

A flurry of studies have since followed. A big one from Europe, published last April, looked at data from five flu seasons. It saw protection against the influenza A virus H3N2 decline to virtually nothing by four months after vaccination. By contrast, protection against influenza A H1N1 did not erode and the vaccine's effectiveness against flu B viruses waned substantially, but didn't reach zero.

The CDC study, which looked at data from four flu seasons, showed a more consistent pattern. Protection against all the two influenza A families and influenza B viruses all declined steadily in the months after vaccination, at a rate of about 7 percent per month. (The decline was a bit steeper for protection against H3N2 viruses.) That might seem small, but people aren't starting from 100 percent protection. On average, flu vaccine is estimated to cut the risk of flu by about 50 percent or 60 percent -- and some years, the protection is less than that, when the strains in the vaccine aren't well-matched to those making people sick.

Ferdinands said given the way the studies are designed, one can't be certain the increasing cases late in the season are due to waning protection. For one thing, the circulating viruses might have evolved, which can diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Additionally, people who get vaccinated early may be more vulnerable to flu than those who get vaccinated later. They may have chronic diseases that make them worry more about flu -- but that also could also diminish their immune systems' ability to respond well to a flu shot.

While the evidence is starting to mount, many flu experts appear wary about a change. Ferdinands noted that very few people actually get vaccinated in the summer.

Though summer vaccinations have increased slightly over the past few years, only about 2.4 percent of Americans get a flu shot before September, data from the CDC show. And over the past six years, less than 10 percent of people were vaccinated by the end of September. The peak month for flu shots was October, with between 16 percent and 18 percent of people getting vaccinated then.

Osterholm said public health officials should try to get those people who are getting vaccinated in July, August, and September to delay their shots. ""I think that trying to move vaccination back to mid-October to mid-November catches almost even the earliest flu season and it may give us another couple of months of protection on the other end, when flu season continues on into early spring,"" he argued.

At this point, many researchers, like Dr. Arnold Monto, an influenza researcher at the University of Michigan, don't advocate for changing the recommendations; pushing too close up against the start of early flu seasons doesn't seem wise to them. That said, if you asked Monto when to get your flu shot, based on the emerging studies, you'd get this reply: ""I would say: Don't get it too early."""

She was shot 14 times, and she survived.

Since 2013, photographer Kathy Shorr has chronicled people like Justice, survivors of gun violence in America. In her portrait, Justice stands near a window wearing a bra, revealing the scars writ across her chest and stomach. The expression on her face reads as mournful, even incredulous, yet at peace.

“Fourteen bullets entered my body that day,” Justice recalled in her interview with Shorr. “Fourteen bullets that ripped through every major organ and artery. Fourteen chances to die. ‘I will live for you,’ I promised my girls as I lay on the ground watching my ex-husband flee the scene.”

Shorr’s photo book, simply titled Shot, features 101 portraits accompanied by interviews and descriptions of her subjects, all of whom survived instances of gun violence in America. Shorr first began thinking about the project after she and her daughter were held up at gunpoint during a home invasion.

Neither Shorr nor her daughter were physically injured during the encounter, but the experience and the subsequent emotional trauma left the artist agonizing over the thousands of Americans each year whose lives are irreparably changed by virtue of a loaded gun.

Kathy Shorr ""Ambushed by her ex-husband, Shirley was shot as she got her daughters from nursery school. Her ex-husband used two guns and struck her 14 times. The former military man was released on $25,000 bail."" (Indianapolis, Indiana, 2014.)

According to CNN in 2016, there are more mass shootings in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. That same year, The New York Times reported that gun homicides are a common cause of death in America, killing about as many people as car crashes. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that between 2001 and 2014 alone, 440,095 people died at the hands of a firearm on U.S. soil.

“People don’t always think about the survivors,” Shorr told The Huffington Post. “Gun violence survivors are here and have a voice, a very important voice. They have experienced something that is kind of indescribable to someone that hasn’t experienced it.”

To begin her project, Shorr reached out to a man named Antonius, whose story she’d learned while listening to the NY1 news. She approached him on Facebook, they emailed back and forth and eventually met in person. After talking through the details, Shorr and Antonius returned to the Brooklyn street corner where he had been shot only seven weeks prior. Antonius took a Xanax to stay calm.

The shoot, according to Shorr, was overwhelmingly positive. People from the community came by to shake Antonius’ hand. He pulled up his shirt and Shorr photographed his scar. Antonius told the photographer how cathartic it was to return to the site and take back the space. “At that point I realized this was a project I could really do,” Shorr said.

“I always saw it as a book,” she continued. “I just felt that once I started there was no turning back. Especially once I started talking to people and learning their stories, I felt an incredible amount of responsibility to complete the project.”

Kathy Shorr ""Eight-year-old Taniya was shot by another third-grader in their classroom. The boy had found the gun in his home and brought it to school."" (Augusta, Georgia, 2015.)

Shorr’s subjects adhere to no single age, gender, ethnicity, class or occupation. Their stories are equally as far-ranging. There is 8-year-old Taniya, accidentally shot by a fellow third grader who brought his father’s gun to school, and Greg, a Georgia-based police sergeant shot by a drug dealer during a bust. There are victims of robberies, domestic abuse, hate crimes and stray bullets. The physical impact of the violence manifests in wheelchairs, prosthetic aids, purple contusions or scars of gauzy flesh. The emotional impact the viewer can only attempt to imagine.

Shorr describes her style as part street photography, part documentary portraiture. Some images zoom in on the physical residue of where bullet met flesh, while others are more straightforward portraits, focusing more on the person than the tragedy that shattered their sense of normalcy. Many photos were captured at the location where each subject was wounded, which the artist described as a way of saying, “You didn’t get me, I’m here.”

“The project was always meant to bring a face to an abstract situation,” Shorr said. “To show how gun violence affects everyone, not only certain groups of people. Anyone can be shot, anywhere. Many of the people in the project are gun owners themselves; one is even a member of the NRA.”

Shorr hopes her portrait series serves as a non-partisan foil to the polarizing shouting matches on the subject of gun violence. “It’s time to start talking about these issues so we can grow and learn from each other,” Shorr said. “When people can see both sides of an issue, and both sides have valid points, we can talk to each other rather than at each other. It’s not a black and white issue.”

According to police spokesman Capt. Bo Mathews, neighbors told Sgt. Chris Barnes that 35-year-old Magdiel Sanchez could not hear his commands. It remains unclear whether Barnes heard those warnings before discharging his weapon multiple times.

Barnes and Lt. Matthew Lindsey went to Sanchez’s home to investigate a hit-and-run that had occurred earlier in the evening, Mathews said. Sanchez’s father was allegedly the driver of the car that fled the scene.

The two officers found Sanchez, who did not have a criminal record and was not involved in the hit-and-run, on the porch of the house holding a 2-foot-long metal pipe. The pipe had a small loop on one end, which is meant to be worn around the wrist, NBC reported. A neighbor told The Associated Press that Sanchez often carried the pipe to scare off the neighborhood’s many stray dogs.

When Sanchez approached, the officers ordered him to drop the pipe and “get on the ground,” Mathews said. Sanchez allegedly did not follow their commands and continued to move towards them.

Hearing the commotion, witnesses began yelling at the cops, telling them about Sanchez’s hearing disability.

“He can’t hear you,” they shouted, per Mathews.

Neighbors told KOCO 5 News that Sanchez was deaf and nonverbal.

When Sanchez got within 15 feet of the officers, Barnes fired his gun and Lindsey deployed his Taser. Mathews said Barnes discharged his firearm more than once. A witness told AP she heard “five or six gunshots.”

Sanchez was later pronounced dead at the scene.

“They killed an innocent man,” neighbor Julio Rayos told KOCO. “He was never aggressive to nobody. He was a real nice guy. I don’t think he deserved to die like that.”

The shooting is being investigated as a homicide, and Barnes has been placed on paid administrative leave.

Mathews said he wasn’t sure why the officers had not taken heed of the neighbors’ shouts about Sanchez’s disability, but said “tunnel vision” may have prevented them from processing the warnings.

“In those situations, very volatile situations, you have a weapon out, you can get what they call tunnel vision, or you can really lock into just the person that has the weapon that’d be the threat against you,” Mathews said. “I don’t know exactly what the officers were thinking at that point.”

The Oklahoma City Police Department is in the process of obtaining body cameras for its officers, NBC News reported. Neither Barnes nor Lindsey was wearing one at the time of Sanchez’s shooting."

Hikers found the elderly alpha female abandoned in the woods near the northern boundary of the park near Gardiner, Montana, on April 11. They called for help, but she was so severely injured that she had to be euthanized.

Necropsy results released Thursday show that the 12-year-old — who was twice as old as the average wolf in the park — had been shot with a rifle.

“The death of this wolf is another tragic loss in the trend of illegally poaching iconic species,” said Jaimie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife.

“Yellowstone National Park’s wolves are unequivocally prized. These wolves are valued globally, and local communities reliant on tourism benefit significantly from their presence. Returning wolves to their natural habitat has a beneficial effect on the entire ecosystem.”

The canine was one of three white wolves in the park. She was the alpha female of the Canyon Pack for more than nine years with the same alpha male, and had at least 20 pups. She was one of the most recognizable wolves in the park,

Yellowstone offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer or killers. The wildlife advocacy group the Wolves of the Rockies in Montana doubled the reward.

Some conservationists believe the wolf was shot by someone angry about the reintroduction of the animals into the park 20 years ago — otherwise they would have likely taken the “trophy.”

“People take matters into their own hands and feel they are above the law and they kind of flaunt that fact that they can do what they want to do and there’s no repercussions,” Wolves of the Rockies President Marc Cook told The Associated Press. There are now close to 100 wolves in the park, despite the complaints of many ranchers and hunters.

It’s illegal to shoot animals in the park — or to discharge a firearm.

Walker Daugherty and Edwin Roberts were wounded in the incident on January 6, The Associated Press reported.

Daugherty and his fiancee told police they were shot by undocumented immigrants from Mexico, per CBS 7 in Odessa, Texas. However, the station said police now believe Daugherty actually shot Roberts and another member of the party, Michael Bryant, shot Daugherty.

“There were no bullet casings or projectiles from weapons other than those belonging to the individuals hunting on the ranch nor in the RV belonging to the hunting party,” the sheriff’s department told Big Bend Now last month.

The incident took place near Candelaria, about 250 miles southeast of El Paso.

Bryant and Daugherty, both hunting guides with Redwing Outfitters, were indicted last Wednesday on charges of deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others, local radio station KTSA reported.

A message on Redwing’s Facebook page claimed the two were shot “ambush style,” but thirty investigators searched the area and found no evidence of anyone approaching the camp, AP reported. Police believe the hunters fired on each other by mistake.

“I mean border patrol are experts in tracking in this area, we trust what they say because that’s all they do on a daily basis, and they didn’t find no sign, no indication that there was anybody in or out of that area that night,” Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez told CBS 7.

Daugherty, who is uninsured, raised $26,300 on GoFundMe to pay for his care.

The story of the shooting was widely shared on social media, with some politicizing the incident:

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller cited the shooting as “proof” that the border wall proposed by President Donald Trump was needed.

The Best Time to Get a Flu Shot Is Now

As a specialist in infection prevention and control, I have often fielded the question, ""When is the best time to get a flu shot?"" Usually peaking in November, December, or January, flu season typically runs from September 1 through April 30. I got my flu shot in September, and urge anyone who hasn't been vaccinated this season to do it now.

Why Get a Flu Shot?

With rare exceptions, everyone who is six months of age or older should get a flu shot this year. Getting vaccinated can prevent you from coming down with this very serious, sometimes fatal, disease. It also keeps you from transmitting the virus to people who are vulnerable to life-threatening complications, including infection of the heart, lungs, or even the brain.

Vaccination is especially important for those at high risk for severe illness from flu, including pregnant women, young children, people with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions like heart disease and asthma, and those ages 65 and older (the immune system weakens with age).

When to Get a Flu Shot

Generally, the best time to be vaccinated for flu is September because it takes two to three weeks to develop immunity. You can get vaccinated anytime during flu season, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends doing so at least by the end of October. This will ensure protection as the weather gets colder and forces people to spend more time indoors and in close contact.



Advice for Older People

People 65 years of age or older should get a high-dose vaccine specially designed for their age group, as it induces a stronger immune response. Some older people are under the impression that they should wait until the end of October or even November to get vaccinated. But this is neither necessary nor recommended because it might result in missing chances to be vaccinated, or forgetting altogether.

The way flu shots work is another reason not to wait. The vaccine protects against the flu virus by establishing ""memory"" cells, which start to develop two to three weeks after you are vaccinated. When you are later exposed to flu, these memory cells make the antibodies that your body needs to protect itself. In theory, immunity wanes three to four months after vaccination, but that's only if you're not exposed to the flu virus during that time. In practice, if you are vaccinated in September, say, and the flu virus is circulating from November through February, your memory cells are constantly being reminded to maintain immunity, extending the vaccine's effectiveness.

However, memory cells don't remember forever, and flu viruses change from year to year. That is why the vaccine formulation is updated each year and why it's important to get vaccinated annually.

Get the Shot, Not the Spray

In recent years, a nasal spray flu vaccine called FluMist was offered as an option to people ages 2 to 49 as an alternative to the injectable vaccine. This year, however, getting the shot is essential because the nasal spray will not be effective and is not recommended by the CDC. During last year's flu season, those who got the spray did not have immunity, while those who got the shot did.

Vaccination Concerns

If you are allergic to eggs and concerned about receiving a flu vaccine produced with egg-based technology, you can request an egg-free vaccine. And if you are concerned about preservatives in vaccines--despite the lack of scientific evidence that they cause any harm--you can ask for preservative-free vaccine. A very small group of people, including those with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine, should not receive flu shots.

It is important to note that flu vaccine cannot cause the flu; the shots are made from dead influenza virus or no virus at all.

Staying Healthy During Flu Season

An annual flu shot is the number-one way to prevent flu, but getting lots of rest and eating a healthy diet are essential, too, as is washing your hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer gels. If you are sick, don't go to work, where you might spread illness to others. And keep sick children home from school.

The three most important things to remember are: First, the flu vaccine is safe; second, getting vaccinated can save your life or someone else's; and finally, don't wait until November or December -- get vaccinated now."

In particular, support was strongest for an extension of the NICS background check system to cover most secondary transfers of firearms beyond the initial, counter-top transfer that is covered now. It was this public sentiment which led to the crafting of such legislation, known as Manchin-Toomey, which nevertheless fell short of the votes needed to move the bill through the Senate in April, 2013.

One of the post-Newtown polls showing wide, public support for expanded background checks was conducted by researchers at the Bloomberg Public Health School at Johns Hopkins University, and now that I've mentioned the unmentionable, those readers in the pro-gun community will please do everyone a favor and keep their comments to themselves. The bottom line from this survey was that gun owners and non-gun owners expressed similar degrees of support for universal background checks, prohibitions on ownership for persons convicted of violating domestic restraining orders and mandatory sentences for gun traffickers. Where significant differences appeared between the two groups, however, involved 'bans' on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; the word 'ban' being toxic to gun owners but much less concerning to those who don't own guns.

The Bloomberg group has just released a new poll which, in terms of methodology and sampling, more or less replicates the same poll that was published in 2013. It will shortly appear in the journal Preventive Medicine, but I was able to examine an advance copy of the text. The authors note that in the intervening two years since their last survey, public opinion appears to have shifted away from more gun regulations and is now swinging towards stronger support of 'gun rights.' But comparing such data to the more specific policy-oriented questions which comprise this new survey is really oranges versus apples, since such phrases as 'gun rights' and 'gun control' are simply too vague and too loaded to explain much about public opinion at all.

The new Bloomberg survey shows that there remains a basic bedrock of public opinion that expanding background checks to secondary gun transfers is a good thing to do. In 2013, support for this measure among gun owners and non-gun owners was above 80 percent, both numbers shifted only slightly in the current survey and the difference between gun owners and non-gun owners was negligible at best. On the other side of the ledger, i.e., banning assault rifles and high-capacity mags, there was again a decisive difference between gun owners who said 'no' and non-gun owners who said 'yes,' although in this case the percentage of non-gun owners who favored weapon and ammunition bans appears to have slipped.

What I find significant is that 45 percent of gun owners in both surveys support bans on the sale of assault rifles and high-cap mags. Researchers who focus on policy issues traditionally look for majority opinion as a guide to what may or may not be possibly changed in the public domain. But the fact that slightly less than half of all gun owners support the ban on assault rifles is a finding which needs to be considered on its own terms.

I can't think of a single issue that has generated more noise and more hype in the gun community than the issue of assault rifles over the last several years. From the phony attempt by the NSSF to dress up these guns as 'modern sporting rifles,' to the prancing around by Colion Noir, the industry has done everything it can to promote these guns as akin to motherhood and apple pie. That nearly 50 percent of gun owners don't buy this nonsense should give pause to those who still regard the NRA as a behemoth when it comes to influencing public opinion about guns. To me, it's more like a case of the emperor without clothes."

An attorney representing the gun store’s owners told the Miami Herald that “no red flags were raised” when Cruz completed the purchase. As part of that process, Cruz had to indicate on a government form whether he had ever been adjudicated or institutionalized for mental illness.

Douglas Rudman, an attorney for the owners of Sunrise Tactical Supply, described the owners as distraught. Per the Herald, the store itself has been “closed indefinitely.”

Rudman said his clients feel a “tremendous sense of responsibility in this situation and just horribleness” that “one of their weapons fell into the hands of this maniac.”

“They are scared — not just for their safety — but more importantly about how the reaction is going to be for the rest of the community as they try to reenter it,” he said.

The suspect purchased another two weapons at Gun World of South Florida in Deerfield Beach, according to CNN.

huffpo171,huffpo,['John Aguilar'],2013-01-11 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/jax-president-has-no-reg_n_2455110.html,"LAFAYETTE -- ""No regrets.""

That's how Jax Mercantile President Jim Quinlan feels three weeks after making a controversial decision to stop selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines throughout his outdoor gear retail chain, including the store in Lafayette.

He doesn't deny that a fair number of customers were angry enough that they pledged never to shop Jax again, but Quinlan said the bulk of the reaction he has received has been from those applauding the stand he took in the wake of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn. The killer in the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting that left 26 people dead -- 20 of them students -- used a Bushmaster .223-caliber AR-15 rifle, classified by the federal government as an assault weapon.

Until mid-December, Jax sold the popular AR-15 model rifle. The chain also no longer sells magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds.

""The feedback that I've directly received has been overwhelmingly positive,"" said Quinlan, who estimates that of the 500 to 1,000 emails, letters and phone calls he's personally gotten since the policy was announced, 80 percent have been supportive of his decision. ""The common theme has been one of thanking us for having the courage to take a stand.""

A quick look at Jax Mercantile's Facebook page reveals a long list of visitor comments -- many impassioned -- from both sides of the issue. One supporter of the company's decision wrote that she would ""patronize Jax whenever possible"" while an opponent pledged to ""never walk through your door again.""

""Another worthless company giving in and giving up our 2nd Amendment rights. Might as well close your doors now,"" Trent Neutgens of Waconia, Minn., posted last week.

Chris Nugent in a late December post thanked the company, which has five locations in Colorado and one in Iowa, for its decision.

""It's refreshing to see a business owner act on their principles rather than on what's best for the bottom line,"" he wrote. ""Firearm owner and 30-year supporter of Jax here, and will continue to be.""

The gun counter at the Lafayette Jax did a steady business Thursday, with several men looking over the wide array handguns, hunting rifles and shotguns the store still sells.

Bob Towery, a hunter from Erie, walked out of Jax with several boxes of ammunition. He disagreed with the store's decision to discontinue the sale of certain firearms and magazines because he said it perpetuates the notion that guns are to blame instead of the person pulling the trigger.

""The problem with the Aurora shooting and the Connecticut shooting is not the firearm or the availability of firearms -- it's the problem of mental health,"" he said. ""All the signs were there (with Aurora theater shooter James Holmes). We've become a complacent society in that regard.""

But Towery said the store's policy wouldn't be enough to keep him out of Jax, which sells a wide selection of other outdoor gear, such as fishing rods, snowshoes and sleeping bags.

Travis Ness, a former Marine from Thornton who was looking for firearms accessories at the Lafayette store Thursday, criticized Jax for overreacting to the Connecticut shooting and feeding into the ""misguided concept that firearms are the problem and not the people who use them.""

Ness said he knows at least 10 people who will no longer shop at Jax because of Quinlan's decision. He said he hasn't entirely given up on Jax himself, but he won't make the store a priority stop for outdoor-related products going forward.

""It wouldn't be the first place I'd get something anymore,"" he said.

Quinlan understands the passion his decision has ignited. Aside from lost customers, he said an employee at the Lafayette store resigned after the policy against assault rifles went into effect.

But the father of three said the Newtown shooting, which he told the Camera in December left him feeling ""sick,"" was a pivotal moment for him.

""This isn't the type of thing that I want my company selling,"" Quinlan said of assault-style weaponry.

He takes heart at a recent proposal he received from a Lafayette resident, who offered to buy Jax's remaining inventory of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and destroy them. While appreciating the gesture, Quinlan was unable to take him up on it.

He had long ago sold out.

huffpo172,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Viral Editor', 'The Huffington Post']",2013-09-13 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/13/slide-fire-machine-gun_n_3922177.html,"A CNN report this week is bringing renewed attention to a firearms manufacturer that is effectively giving gun enthusiasts legal access to automatic weapons.

Slide Fire, a Texas-based manufacturer, announced plans this week to release its latest weapon, a $6,000 rifle that the company says ""sprays like a fire hose."" The new weapons employ the company's patented stock -- a rifle accessory that rests against the shooter's shoulder and uses a gun's recoil to trigger the next round -- and are belt-fed, allowing for huge strings of bullets to be fired at a rate of up to 800 rounds per minute.

(Watch the video above for a demonstration of Slide Fire's belt-fed rifle.)

""We recommend no more than 30 rounds on the belt, but one person could make it as big as they want,"" Brandon Renner, sales and marketing manager for Slide Fire told CNN Money of the latest product.

For all intents and purposes, Slide Fire's new SFS BFRs function like machine guns; much like the company's other rifles, which use magazines that limit their ammo load. But technically speaking, all of Slide Fire's weapons are semi-automatic, and therefore not beholden to the strict federal regulations on actual machine guns.

Slide Fire's bump stock, which can also be purchased separately to add on to other rifles, is the key to this loophole. The Associated Press broke down the technology in a February report:

A bump stock fits over a rifle's ""buffer tube,"" replacing the gun's shoulder rest. A ""support step"" attached to the pistol grip partially covers the trigger opening, preventing contact with the finger. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, ""bumping"" the trigger. So, technically, the finger is ""pulling"" the trigger for each round fired.

Because Slide Fire only modifies the trigger and the stock -- not the receiver, the only part regulated by federal authorities -- its products have been deemed legal. As Slide Fire proudly touts on its website, the ATF has determined ""the 'bump-stock' is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms act."" A representative for the ATF confirmed that statement to CNN.

While Slide Fire markets its products as easy to control, some gun enthusiasts like Tom Mannewitz of the TargetMaster store and indoor gun ranges in Garland, Texas, aren't convinced.

""If somebody was shooting a 'bumpfire' gun here they might be on their target; they’re more than likely going to be on somebody else’s target or the floor or the ceiling or whatever,"" he told CBS 11.

Washington lawmakers are also aware of the product's ability to effectively skirt broader bans on machine guns and have expressed concerns.

""This replacement shoulder stock turns a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of 400 to 800 rounds per minute,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a key proponent of gun control legislation, told AP earlier this year. ""I strongly believe that devices allowing shooters to fire at similar rates should also be outlawed."""

(See the initial report from ABCNews.com and the Nightline segment from Monday night.)

In a press release issued by Trijicon on January 21, the company stated that it will do the following to remedy what many view as an egregious mixing of religion and the military, as well as an offense to the Christian religion:

- Remove the inscription reference on all U.S. military products that are in the company's factory that have already been produced, but have yet to be shipped. - Provide 100 modification kits to forces in the field to remove the reference on the already forward deployed optical sights. - Ensure all future procurements from the Department of Defense are produced without scripture references.

Trijicon will provide the same remedy to foreign militaries that have purchased their products. Maj. Kristian Dunne, a spokesman for the New Zealand defense force, one of the foreign militaries currently using the sights, stated, ""We were unaware of it and we're unhappy that the manufacturer didn't give us any indication that these were on there. We deem them to be inappropriate.""

In a press release issued by CENTCOM, Gen. David Petraeus stated, ""The codes on the scopes are contrary to U.S. Central Command guidance.""

Another purchaser of Trijicon products, for use in Afghanistan, is the British military. The revelation that there were Bible verses on its country's weapons prompted the following statement from the Church of England, as reported by the The Guardian:

""It would be unfortunate if this practice by an arms manufacturer undermined the military effort in areas of the world where our forces are trying to bring long-term stability. People of all faiths and none are being killed and injured in these conflicts, on all sides, and any suggestion that this is being done in the name of the Bible would be deeply worrying to many Christians. The meaning of the Bible is to be found in reflective reading and prayer, not in sloganising and soundbites.""

In a statement to ABC News, Tom Munson, director of sales and marketing for Trijicon, a company that states on its website, ""We believe that America is great when its people are good. This goodness has been based on Biblical standards throughout our history, and we will strive to follow those morals,"" said that there was nothing wrong with adding the Bible references, and that Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), which initially raised the issue after receiving complaints about the sights from active duty service members, was ""not Christian."" Apparently, the Church of England must also be ""not Christian,"" given that they also find the Bible references inappropriate. Tom Munson might also be surprised to learn that 96% of the service members who reach out to MRFF for assistance are actually Christians, but just not Christian enough or the 'right kind' of Christians for today's military.

In addition to being called anti-Christian for exposing the Bible verses, two other criticisms have been leveled at MRFF, both in comments on the many articles and blog posts on the story and in hate mail received by MRFF.

The first is that MRFF should have just gone to the military rather than the media. Well, MRFF actually did try to go to the military first, and only went to the media after attempts to get the military to deal with the issue had failed. In fact, it was one of the military officers contacted by MRFF who suggested that going to the media might be the only way to get the Pentagon to take any action.

The second is that nobody would have found out about the Bible verses if ABC News hadn't exposed them. This is simply not true. Many of our troops already knew about them, and there have been plenty of message board postings, as well as online videos, pointing them out. Interestingly, although Trijicon has been putting the Bible references on its products for many years, the widespread discussion of these references began in 2006, not long after the sights were put into wide use by the military. On one message board, a soldier even provided instructions on how to remove the reference after removing it from his own sight. The other common misconception is that the Iraqis and Afghans would never see the Trijicon sights closely enough to see the Bible references. This is also untrue, as is clear from photos released by the Department of Defense.

People have only seen one of the photos uncovered by MRFF showing an Iraqi holding a rifle equipped with a Trijicon sight -- the close-up of the Iraqi police officer first used by ABC News, and then picked up by pretty much everybody else reporting on the story. If this was the only such photo, it might be reasonable to wonder if it is only occasionally that an Iraqi or Afghan might casually happen to see one of these sights. But this is not the only such photo, and the captions for the other photos make it very clear that the Iraqis and Afghans are not just casually or occasionally getting a glimpse of these sights, but being actively trained with and supplied with them. There is no question from these photos that the Iraqis and Afghans are regularly looking at these sights closely enough to spot the Bible references.

Here are some of the other photos, followed by their original captions.

As already mentioned, the investigation into Trijicon's rifle scopes was prompted by complaints received by MRFF from active duty service members. Here is an email received by MRFF founder and president Mikey Weinstein from one of those service members. Clearly, according to the account of this soldier, a very senior NCO not only knew about the Bible reference, but promoted it as making an ordinary rifle a ""spiritually transformed into the Fire Arm of Jesus Christ."" Worse yet, this brilliant NCO was yelling this out within earshot of Afghan civilians and military personnel.

To: Mikey Wenstein [sic] and MRFF: I am a U.S. Army infantry soldier with the rank of (rank withheld). I am married with children. I am stationed at Fort (installation name withheld). I have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan multiple times. I have been awarded medals for direct combat engagement as well as for injuries and wounds received in hand-to-hand combat. I am a Muslim American. My family converted when I was very young. I am caucasian and have a last name that does not sound ethnic. Therefore, few of my fellow soldiers know that I am a Muslim. My wife comes from a Christian tradition but rarely practices or attends church. I have witnessed terrible religious persecution in the my (number withheld) years in the Army. Most of it comes from ""angry"" conservative Christians in my unit chains of command and occasionally from my fellow infantry soldiers. I am very familiar with the Trijicon ACOG gunsights and have often had them as part of my personal weapons; both my M-4 and my M-16. In my first 2 deployments I saw and experienced no incidents regarding the New Testament bible quotes that are written on the metal casing of the gun sights. Many soldiers know of them and are very confused as to why they are there and what it is supposed to mean. Everyone is worried that if they were captured in combat that the enemy would use the bible quotes against them in captivity or some other form of propaganda. As an American soldier I am ashamed that those bible quotes are on our primary weapons. As a Muslim American I am horrified. As one who swore his oath to the Constitution, I am driven to fight this Christian insanity but I know if I try to do so in a visible way that I will suffer at the hands of my military superiors. I am of low enlisted rank and can be crushed easily. I am prepared to suffer, but I am not prepared for my wife and children to suffer. So I have reached out to MRFF because there is nowhere else safe to go to try to fight this thing of disgrace. There are many other soldiers who feel as I do. Many are Protestant and Catholic and they fear reprisal just as much as I do for trying to stand up to the Christian bullies in uniform who outrank us. But if you try to fight back, you are not ""asking"" for trouble, YOU ARE IN TROUBLE from the start. And if you are a Muslim American, the hatred is always just below the surface and ready to explode at a moment's notice. After the Fort Hood shootings, it was so bad, even for a low profile Muslim like me, that I had to ask MRFF for help. Nothing in my first 2 deployments prepared me for what happened with the Trijicon ACOG gun sights during my 3rd deployment to Afghanistan. I will never forget the day it occurred. It was morning and there was a mandatory formation of several companies. A very senior NCO was yelling at us which is not that unusual. He asked a private what it was that he (the private) was holding in his hand and the private said it was his ""weapon"" several times to which the senior NCO replied ""and what ELSE is it""? FInally, the senior NCO said that the private's rifle was also something else; that because of the biblical quote on the ACOG gunsight it had been ""spiritually transformed into the Fire Arm of Jesus Christ"" and that we would be expected to kill every ""haji"" we could find with it. He said that if we were to run out of ammo, then the rifle would become the ""spiritually transformed club of Jesus Christ"" and that we should ""bust open the head of every haji we find with it."" He said that Uncle Sam had seen fit not to give us a ""pussy 'Jewzzi' (combination of the word 'Jew' and Israeli made weapon 'Uzi') but the ""fire arm of Jesus Christ"" and made specific mention of the biblical quotes on our gun sights. He said that the enemy no doubt had quotes from the Koran on their guns but that ""our Lord is bigger than theirs because theirs is a fraud and an idol"". As a Muslim and an American soldier I was fit to be tied but I kept it in. There were many Afghans, both civilian and military, on base within earshot of what was being yelled at us and I can only wonder in shock what they must have thought. This senior NCO was apparently also the head person of a conservative, crazy Christian group called the ""Christian Military Fellowship"" and made a big deal about the importance of joining to everyone. He told us all that we MUST read a book called ""Under Orders"" in order to make it through this combat deployment and said he had many copies for everyone. Some of my friends went and got their copies. I refused. Finally, this senior NCO ended his yelling by warning us that if we did not ""get right with Jesus"" then our rifles would not provide spiritual strength despite the bible quotes on our ACOG gunsights and that we would be considered ""spiritual cripples"" to our fellow units and soldiers. He didn't say it in so many words, but the message was clear; if anything bad happened in a combat situation, it would be the fault of anyone who had not accepted Jesus Chris in the ""right way"". I have never felt so ashamed and scared in my life. I have never hated myself so much for not speaking out. So I thought of my wife and children and endured. Every time I looked at my rifle with that Trijicon ACOG gunsight/scope with the biblical quote from the book of John (8:12), it would make me sick. If I had tried to protest, it would have made me dead. And if I'm dead I'm of no use to my wife and children.

While Trijicon's decision to remove the Bible references is great news, it is only one step in the right direction. Back in September, I wrote a piece titled Top Ten Ways to Convince the Muslims We're On a Crusade, detailing the many ways in which our military has made us look like crusaders in a holy war against Islam. In the process of investigating the Trijicon issue, MRFF's research department uncovered even more examples. A photo of one of these examples was briefly shown during the Nightline report, and I want to end by explaining what that photo was.

The photo, taken in August 2009 at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Loyalty near Baghdad, was one of several photos released by the Department of Defense showing Iraqi Security Forces in training sessions conducted by the U.S. Army. The building where these training session were held appears to be used for a variety of purposes. And, what's on the wall right next to the screen on which the training presentation is being shown? A nice big cross, as tall as the soldier giving the presentation. Army regulations don't even allow symbols of any particular religion to be displayed in a chapel except when an actual worship service is in progress, yet here we have an impossible to miss cross not only being displayed, but being displayed in a multi-purpose building while the training of Iraqi troops is taking place.

Interestingly, as the following photo of another event held around the same time in the same building shows, the cross was not displayed while the Oakland Raiders cheerleaders were performing for the troops. Apparently, that would have been inappropriate."
huffpo174,huffpo,"['Steve Bell', 'Follow Steve Bell On Twitter', 'Www.Twitter.Com Stevebelldc', 'Senior Director', 'Economic Policy Project', 'Bipartisan Policy Center']",2012-12-20 14:15:51-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-bell/bushmaster-rifle_b_2331024.html,"I am a life member of the National Rifle Association. My family has owned guns for generations and has sent men to military service for more than a century. I strongly support the Second Amendment to the Constitution.

But, I have a simple question: what does a civilian need with a .223, a caliber developed by and for the military for small arms combat situations?

This question occurs to me for three reasons: the late mother of the Newton, Ct., killer owned and practiced with a .223; the .223, reports have it, is the single biggest seller among rifles in the United States; finally, the .223 serves no civilian or hunting purpose, in my view, that other calibers serve at least as well and with less opportunity for deadly mistakes.

Please know that I am not talking about the silly argument about the physical configuration of ""assault rifles."" The changes brought about by the now-lapsed assault rifle ban were almost entirely cosmetic. It was at least interesting, if not amusing, to listen to lawmakers who didn't know an assault rifle from Aunt Mamie's goat pontificate about how outlawing assault rifles would lead to some nirvana. Let's disregard for this discussion that kind of ignorance.

Let's concentrate instead on the essentials. What does this caliber do that cannot be done in hunting and personal defense better by other weapons in other calibers. Perhaps this argument can be best illustrated by a heated series of exchanges among serious gun-owners after the post-Hurricane Katrina violence.

What weapon(s), gun owners were asked by a highly-respected gun magazine, would you choose if you had had to defend yourself and your family in the violent aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. As one might expect, thousands of suggestions flooded in. A few opted for the .223 in semi-automatic, rifle configuration. Others suggested a variety of handguns in different calibers and different kinds of bullets. Some offered hunting rifles used widely for deer and other larger animals.

What seemed to me to be the dispositive comment came from an elderly man who noted: ""My son has been an emergency room physician for many years. He reports to me that he has never seen anyone survive a .12 gauge, double ought buck shot wound to the upper torso."" In short, if you want to protect your home and family from intruders, don't buy an AR-15. If such a situation occurs, you are going to be full of adrenaline, your heart beating 150 bpm or so, and you will panic. If you are a member of a SWAT team, or have just left military combat, you are likely to be able to hit a target, often in the dark and in the matter of seconds you have to react properly. If you are almost anyone else, the odds that you will hit your target with an AR-15 in .223 are small.

Do you really want to protect home and family from intruders? Go out and buy a .12 gauge or .16 gauge shotgun. Load it with buckshot. Make sure the gun has a fully open choke. That way, when that mysterious figure breaks into your house and begins marching up the stairs, and your hands are shaking almost uncontrollably, you can fire in the general direction of the intruder with some certainty of disabling him. Throw out the .223; it will likely be more dangerous to you than the intruder.

Let's get serious. Many states, including those in our region, demand that anyone who wishes to use a long gun to hunt deer or similar prey pass a hunter safety course before being allowed to get a license to hunt. Long guns' records reveal that they are vastly safer than hand guns or semi-auto AR-15s. If we require a license and training for long guns, it makes eminent sense to require at least as much training and licensing to own an AR-15 or similarly configured semi-automatic rifle.

Finally, for those who like the AR-15 as a varmint gun, here's what we used on the ranch I used to own in very rural, southwest Colorado -- a single shot .22 long rifle. We used a .300 WinMag for big deer and elk. We had our trusty .12 gauges for home protection.

We in the NRA should demand licensing and training certification, especially by an NRA certified instructor, before we allow purchase of handguns and semi-auto rifles. It is sensible, will save accidental deaths as well as mass murders, and it will lead to much safer homes and hearths."

They’ve fought it as mothers, as feminists. Indeed, many have said that gun violence is a feminist issue, noting that mass killers are usually abusers of women. This refrain has emerged once more in the aftermath of the grievously preventable massacre of 17 high school students and faculty members in Parkland, Florida.

This time, men are publicly insisting that women need to wage this war against arms.

But this is one hideous mess we can’t just clean up on our own.

Not because gun violence doesn’t affect us. There’s a reason women take this so personally, and it’s not just because our children are getting murdered in their classrooms. Four and a half million of us have survived threats at gunpoint from our intimate partners. Those partners kill another 50 of us each month.

And it’s not because it’s unfair that we’re asked to do this work. The losses are so tragic, enormous, so consistent, that fair doesn’t have a damn thing to do with it. We can, and must, keep fighting. But men, we need you — and you need you — to win this war.

Guns are synonymous with masculinity, and it’s men who need to organize to lay them down. There is no winning strategy in women hectoring men about what masculinity they can be afforded ― even if we’re right, which we are. That leads to deeper emasculation, which scholars have found to be at the root of so much gun ownership and violence.

If we want men with guns to stop killing our kids, our friends, our partners and our parents, we need to make damn sure men are out in front.

As the middle class has slipped into the welfare class, and housing and health care costs have surged, men have gripped those guns even tighter as protectors of their own power.

Even the American Psychological Association is aghast at the murderous marriage of masculinity and firearms. “Any account of gun violence in the United States must be able to explain both why males are perpetrators of the vast majority of gun violence,” a recent APA report says in summary, and must “aim to change gendered expectations for males that emphasize self-sufficiency, toughness, and violence, including gun violence.”

Misogynists — which can mean both sexist men and their female allies —habitually train their ire on women with the power to change policy. It has been a constant feature of Nancy Pelosi’s tenure in the House. It lost Hillary Clinton the damn presidency. And, due to our gun laws, it nearly killed Gabby Giffords.

Do we really think that our “shrill” voices will convince American men to lay down the always steel-hard phalluses that shoot raw murder-power? This is not a battle for women to wage alone.

This isn’t to say that women aren’t part of gun culture. The National Rifle Association has been sure to make that point clear; it named a woman chief spokesperson, and its television network, which “celebrates” female gun owners, serves up bald and breathless publicity for sponsors Smith & Wesson. These aren’t mere lobbyist optics: Twenty-two percent of American women own guns. But most women who own guns buy them for protection. Most men who own guns buy them because the use of weaponry is how they get their kicks.

Again, this is the gender binary of gun ownership, and frankly, of so many toxic aspects of our world: men’s entitlement versus women’s safeguarding. And to respond according to a binary is to debilitate urgent, vital progress for us all.

There’s a bigger issue at play here, even bigger than gun violence: If we decide collectively that gun violence is a women’s issue, we will all but guarantee that efforts to solve the problem will fail.

It’s a bleak truth: If you want to fetter an issue, make it a women’s issue. You’ll get marchers in the street, calls to legislators, grassroots discourse — all necessary hallmarks of functioning democracy. But because this is hardly a functioning democracy, legislative change will fail to track the howl arising from a very vocal majority.

This is a nation where, even at our best, the so-called men’s issues of defense, crime, business and foreign policy garner the lion’s share of our tax dollars and legislative attention. Meanwhile, so-called women’s issues like education, social services, civil rights and general health care are left begging to divide up the ever-shrinking leftover scraps. And those aren’t even the issues left to sit in the gynecologist’s waiting room. You want to fully disempower an issue, not in the culture, but on Capitol Hill? Paint it pink.

Jonathan Drake/Reuters David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, speaks at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, three days after the shooting at his school.

School shootings are ground zero for this binary collision. They involve kids. And teachers. In schools. We rely on social workers’ assessments, not gun bans, for prevention. This is all the provenance of female concern, populated by a largely female workforce.

And the solution from our education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a men’s issues advocate in lipstick and pumps, is classic binary ― a man’s solution to a women’s problem: Let teachers be armed. Others, like one North Carolina lawmaker, believe that we should arm those teachers ourselves, in an impoverished public education system where teachers pay for classroom supplies from their own meager salaries. But that’s a woman’s issue.

Gun violence is a men’s problem. No organization has been as effective in framing the crisis as a public health epidemic as Women Against Gun Violence, which began 25 years ago as the result of a conversation between founder Ann Reiss Lane and Betty Friedan herself. Then, after the Sandy Hook massacre, now 300 school shootings ago, Moms Demand Action rose up as a force far fiercer than its bake-sale identifier might suggest. This fight has defaulted to women because men have not stepped up to join us. Male silence, and nothing else, has made our gun crisis a women’s issue.

We can’t re-norm our society overnight, any more than women can re-norm men en masse by saying they should be different. We have no choice but to be smarter about how we reform the situation, now. If we want men with guns to stop killing our kids, our friends, our partners and our parents, we need to make damn sure men are out in front.

Boys who survived the Parkland shooting know this, as do girls who have made it their own fight without making it a gendered one: Cameron Kasky and David Hogg are showing you the way, gentlemen. Because in this country, we’ve got nowhere else to run."

The “Never Again” demonstrations began after a young man with an assault-style rifle killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week and wounded more than a dozen more.

Hundreds of students across Miami-Dade and Broward counties in South Florida walked out of school mid-morning on Wednesday, their action broadcast live as a news helicopter followed from above.

“We want to show support for those who lost their lives and make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” one student from Cypress Bay High School told Local 10 News.

Several hundred students, including some from Stoneman Douglas High, took a bus to the Florida Capitol in Tallahassee to press the issue with state lawmakers there. Further protests across the region are expected later Wednesday; the state also saw walkouts on Tuesday.

In Maryland, hundreds of students from at least three high schools in Montgomery County walked out Wednesday, many of them heading toward the U.S. Capitol for a gun control rally:

Daniel Gelillo‎, a senior at Richard Montgomery High in Rockville, Maryland, helped organize part of the local protest. He said students are taking to the streets because they’ve had enough of politicians’ inaction.

“All people in this country, particularly children, should feel safe and should not live in fear of a gunman killing them in their school, place of worship, or a nightclub,” Gelillo wrote in a press release. “We expect our leaders to do whatever is required to keep us safe. That has not happened.”

He continued, “We are young and can fight until we can vote and then we can vote out every politician that obstructs real change and is owned by the NRA.”

Students also staged walkouts in Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky and Minnesota, among other states.

Not all schools condoned such teenage activism.

The Houston-area Needville Independent School District threatened Tuesday to suspend students for three days if they walked out or otherwise disrupted school in protest.

“Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness!!” Superintendent Curtis Rhodes wrote in a note sent to parents. “Should students choose to do so, they will be suspended from school for 3 days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension.”"

For some black activists who have long been mobilizing around gun violence, the current wave of public attention and outrage over the issue is welcome. But it also invites the question of why there’s been comparatively little attention and outrage focused on the even more common reality of routine gun homicides in the country, which disproportionately affect communities of color, and specifically black Americans.

Prominent black organizers and public figures have also noted the largely positive public response to the student activists from Parkland ― most of whom are not black and who attended school in a largely white, relatively affluent Florida suburb ― compared to the frequent vilification of young black activists protesting gun violence, particularly police shootings.

“It’s complicated, but I would encourage us to lean into the complicated,” Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said on a panel with HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen on Wednesday. “Why don’t black people get to be victims? That’s the question we have to ask ourselves ... It’s a question not just for elected officials but it’s a question for us ... Who gets to be a victim?”

“I’m so grateful these children are getting the support they need,” she added. “And where is our support?”

It is interesting to note the difference in support for the kids in FL versus the kids in Black Lives Matter. I say that with full admiration for the kids in FL, to survive such a trauma and fight for everyone to be safer.

Gosh. This is amazing. And a I'm not being sarcastic. I have to be honest and say that I'm a bit taken aback (and a bit hurt) that those of us who were in the streets in the past five years for Black lives didn't receive this type of reception or public support. https://t.co/HLYXTcVdfL — Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018

In the wake of the Florida shooting, students from Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have led a bold wave of mobilizations ― organizing school walkouts, speaking at rallies and planning the nationwide March for Our Lives protest next month. The teens have been justifiably celebrated on social media, featured in the news (including at HuffPost), and some were even invited to the White House.

HuffPost reached out to March for Our Lives, but did not immediately receive a response.

Importantly, those bringing up this disparity are not criticizing the Parkland students’ activism ― quite the opposite. The only people seeking to discredit the teens so far seem to be right-wing conspiracy theorists claiming the teens are “crisis actors.”

Still, the different public responses are telling: There’s justified, universal outrage at a shooting in a largely white, affluent area, but not so much at the frequent shooting deaths of black Americans; the public is praising Parkland’s student activists, but not so much Black Lives Matter organizers.

“I’m excited these young people are getting attention, which they deserve, and they’re driving amazing social change,” Dante Barry, co-founder of anti-racist, anti-violence organization Million Hoodies, told HuffPost on Thursday. “But I’m also disheartened and a little shocked to see folks like Oprah give $500,000 to [March for Our Lives], while she’s seen black folks in the streets for years.”

Other communities that have been devastated by gun violence are still fighting for crumbs. Dante Barry, Million Hoodies

“The way people are responding to predominantly white communities is notable: Whose movement is more valuable to support?” he added. “Other communities that have been devastated by gun violence are still fighting for crumbs.”

Young black activists who have been mobilizing around gun violence, including police shootings, for several years are generally perceived negatively by white Americans, are often arrested for protesting, and have been labeled as “extremists” by the FBI.

When black activists have taken to the streets to protest police shootings, members of law enforcement have met them in full riot gear, and at times attacked them with tear gas. By contrast, the largely non-black student activists from Parkland have been invited to a CNN town hall event with lawmakers.

“What happens is white people get to be everything ― they get to be victims, they get to be heroes,” Cullors said on the Wednesday panel. “Black people unfortunately continue to be criminalized for our moments of courage, mourning or grieving. When we go out to the streets to protest for our lives that matter, we’re given heavy police repression. This is a race question.”

Mass shootings like the one in Florida often spur an important national conversation on gun control, particularly when shooters target schools, like at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, or when there are high death counts, like in Las Vegas last year.

Yet while mass shootings have been on the rise in recent years, they represent just a portion of overall gun deaths in the U.S. annually.

In total, there were around 12,500 to 15,500 gun deaths per year in the U.S. from 2014 to 2017, not including suicides, according to the Gun Violence Archive. According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of just over 100 people died each year in mass shootings from 2009 to 2016 ― with mass shootings defined as incidents in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter.

“I’m very impressed and inspired by what I’m seeing these students do. Fighting for gun control ― I take my hat off to them,” Cobe Williams, deputy director at Chicago-based gun violence prevention organization Cure Violence told HuffPost on Wednesday."

The administration billed the event as a listening session in the wake of the Florida mass shooting, but it quickly turned into a powerful and heartbreaking moment in the decades-long debate over gun control as survivors and family members stood up and called on lawmakers to come up with solutions to gun violence.

“We’re here because my daughter has no voice. She was murdered last week and she was taken from us. Shot nine times on the third floor. We as a country failed our children. This shouldn’t happen,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“I’m very angry that this happened, because it keeps happening,” Pollack added, while speaking directly to the camera. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here with this administration and me. I’m not going to sleep until it gets fixed.”

Vice President Mike Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky joined Trump at the event, as well as dozens of parents and survivors of the Florida shooting and the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting.

Trump listened while survivors spoke during the event, but he later used the school shooting in Florida to make a case for looser laws on concealed carry permits. He proposed that arming 20 percent of teaching staff at schools may be effective at quickly ending attacks.

“If he had a firearm ... he would have shot and that would have ended,” Trump said about Stoneman Douglas coach Aaron Feis, who was slain.

Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters Wednesday that last week’s shooter bypassed the school’s armed officer.

In addition to suggesting ending gun-free school zones, Trump proposed opening more hospitals for the mentally ill and toughening background checks. “We’re going to go very strong into age — age of purchase, and we’re also going to go very strong into the mental health aspect of what’s going on,” he said.

Some of the participants at the session made the case for stricter gun control laws.

“How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon?” Stoneman Douglas student Sam Zeif asked of the ability to purchase an AR-15, the assault-style weapon used by the Parkland gunman. “How did we not stop this after Columbine? After Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening,” he said, tearfully gesturing to Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.

“After Sandy Hook, they said we wouldn’t let this happen again, yet it has continued to happen for five years. How many more deaths can we take as a country?” Hockley said.

Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, which represents 3 million educators, rejected the idea of arming more people on campuses. “Bringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms. ... We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that.”

“We owe it to the students and school personnel, who’ve lost their lives at schools and on campuses across the country, to work together so that we can thoughtfully and carefully develop common sense solutions that really will save lives.”

The National Education Association represents 3 million educators.

This is one of many recent media appearances by groups of Parkland students affected by last week’s shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 students and faculty members. It marked the 17th school shooting incident so far in 2018.

Many have made strong calls for Congress to act on gun control legislation, and students and adults plan to participate in the March for Our Lives next month, a protest they’re organizing in Washington, D.C., and several sister cities.

Several of the students seated around Trump thanked him for his leadership on mass shooting issues but made few remarks about gun access, marking a sharp tone shift from the Parkland students behind next month’s march.

One of the students, Cameron Kasky, tweeted after the listening session that he, student organizer Emma Gonzalez and the other Parkland students calling for gun control were “not invited” to the White House on Wednesday."

(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott announced a proposal on Friday to increase restrictions on buying guns and to strengthen school safety measures after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in the state last week.

Scott said he would work with state lawmakers during the next two weeks to raise the minimum age for buying any kind of gun in Florida to 21 years old, with some exceptions for younger military members and law enforcement officers. Long guns, including the semiautomatic AR-15-style assault rifle used in the Feb. 14 attack, can be bought by people as young as 18 under current law.

The Republican governor also said he would change laws to make it “virtually impossible for anyone who has mental issues to use a gun.” He wants to ban the sale and purchase of bump stocks, an accessory that transforms a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon able to fire hundreds of rounds a minute.

He called for a mandatory law enforcement officer in every public school and for mandatory “active shooter training” for student and faculty.

Staff members returned for the first time on Friday to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, now the site of one of the deadliest school attacks in U.S. history in which 14 students and three faculty were killed.

The attack at the school last week has inflamed the national debate about gun rights. Many of the student survivors of the massacre have since advocated for tougher gun-control laws. They have been widely interviewed on national television and have traveled to meet politicians in Tallahassee, the state capital, and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House.

The bill, from Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), allows anyone with a permit from one state to carry hidden, loaded firearms into all other states. It would allow people with permits from states with weak permitting rules to carry into states with strict rules, like New York and California. And if a state will issue a concealed carry permit to a nonresident, an applicant could get one and carry the weapon into any other state.

Opponents of the legislation, known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, warn that it would allow the states with the loosest permitting standards to define the laws of the nation and would undermine states’ rights to protect their own residents.

The National Rifle Association has called this legislation, which is expected to pass in the House, its “highest legislative priority.” It is likely to be the first gun bill to receive a vote since the back-to-back mass shootings in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas.

Gun violence experts and victims’ advocates say the legislation is particularly alarming for domestic violence survivors, who are in more danger when their abusers are able to carry hidden firearms.

Under federal law, a person convicted of domestic violence or subject to certain protective orders is not allowed to own firearms. But the law is limited ― it only covers spouses, not dating partners or stalkers ― and dozens of states have passed their own laws that expand on federal legislation in the interest of keeping guns away from abusers.

Currently, each state sets its own rules about who is eligible to carry concealed weapons. In some states, law enforcement can prohibit a person from carrying a concealed gun at their discretion, such as if they believe the applicant lacks good character or doesn’t have a good reason to carry a loaded gun in public. In other states, officials are essentially required to issue a permit to anyone who meets basic requirements, such as passing a background check or completing safety training.

Some states offer significantly more protections to victims of domestic abuse, dating violence and stalking than others. In 28 states, for example, individuals convicted of stalking are not allowed to carry in public. But, as Everytown for Gun Safety counsel Courtney Zale explained to HuffPost, under concealed carry reciprocity, a stalker in one of those states could obtain a permit from Florida, which does not prohibit stalkers from concealed carry and issues permits to nonresidents through the mail. He could then use that permit to carry throughout the country.

In another example, an abuser who is convicted of sexually assaulting his girlfriend cannot currently legally carry a concealed firearm in Massachusetts. But under this bill, he could obtain a permit from nearby New Hampshire ― which issues permits to nonresidents and does not consider that offense prohibitory ― and carry his firearm back into his home state.

In 25 states and Washington, D.C., law enforcement can deny individuals a concealed carry permit if they have a history of red flags, such as repeated domestic disturbances. Under concealed carry reciprocity, a person could bypass state rules by applying for a permit from a state with less stringent standards.

Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said the House measure would effectively “zero out” countless state laws designed to protect victims of abuse. A person who is banned from carrying guns in his home state because of domestic violence could just apply for a permit from another state where he is still eligible because of more permissive laws, she said.

“The efforts that some states have made will be for naught,” Glenn said. “Domestic abusers are very crafty. If we think they don’t know about these laws and ways around them, we are sadly mistaken.”

If a woman in the U.S. is a victim of gun violence, it’s usually because of domestic abuse. More than half of women killed with guns in the U.S. between 2010 and 2014 were killed by intimate partners or family members. The research on this topic is unambiguous: Firearms make abusive relationships more dangerous. If abusers have access to guns, victims are five times more likely to be killed.

Even when they are not being used to kill and maim women, guns are often deployed as a tactic to control and terrorize victims. In addition, most mass shootings in the U.S. involve a male perpetrator targeting a family member or intimate partner.

Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said that when survivors relocate to escape their abusers, they often take into consideration a state’s firearms protections.

“Imagine fleeing to another state where you believe your abuser won’t be able to carry a gun, and then finding out that Congress says that he can bring his gun with him ― and he can hide it,” she said.

Susan B. Sorenson, a gun violence researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, said the House bill could endanger lives. There’s some evidence to back that up: A recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that states with weaker concealed carry laws were associated with 10.6 percent higher handgun homicide rates.

“If this law gets passed, it will be the state with the easiest permit requirements that will define the permitting requirements for every state,” said Adam Winkler, a gun policy expert and law professor at UCLA. “A state that is willing to give permits to people with a history of domestic violence will undermine the laws of many other states that are trying to restrict abusers.”

Buried on Page 719 of his fiscal year 2019 budget, released Monday, the president calls for cuts to the National Criminal Records History Improvement Program and the NICS Act Record Improvement Program. Both provide federal grants to states to help them improve their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database for background checks, including domestic violence records.

The two programs are currently budgeted at $73 million. Trump’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would slash their funding to $61 million, which amounts to a 16 percent cut.

Trumps FY19 budget

(Why do the numbers in the infographic jump around so much from 2017 to 2019? A House Appropriations Committee staffer said it’s unclear, but notes the 2017 figure reflects what the Justice Department actually spent while the 2018 and 2019 figures reflect what Trump requested.)

Gun control advocates say these federal grants have been “critical funding sources” for states trying to routinely submit comprehensive records to the national background check database.

“President Trump claims that he wants to build ‘a safe, strong, and proud America’ but his actions do not live up to his words,” said Robin Lloyd of Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived a gunshot to the head in 2011.

“Instead of strengthening the nation’s background check system to make sure it effectively keeps guns out of dangerous hands, he slashed funding to this critically important system, which will significantly undermine its effectiveness,” Lloyd said.

There are about 30 million reasons why Trump would want to weaken gun safety measures. That’s roughly how many dollars the National Rifle Association spent helping to elect him president. His proposed cuts are also wildly out of step with polls showing near-universal support for strengthening background checks to apply to all gun sales, not just those done by licensed firearms dealers.

The president’s budget, however, is more an overview of White House priorities than it is a document that translates into law. Republicans in Congress will use Trump’s proposal as a baseline but come up with their own government spending levels when they put forward annual appropriation bills.

Trump’s call for cutting funds for gun background checks comes just three months after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, involving a gunman who was prohibited from buying or owning firearms because of a domestic violence conviction but who had a gun nonetheless because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the national criminal background check database. The error has prompted the Air Force to begin a review.

Mass shootings are now a regular occurrence in the country ― and so is Congress’ inaction on it. There have already been 30 mass shootings and 18 school shootings in 2018. Republican leaders in Congress routinely offer “thoughts and prayers” in response to each shooting but don’t follow up with any policy changes aimed at stemming gun violence.

Another mass shooting took place as this article was being written Wednesday. This one was at a high school in Parkland, Florida. At least 17 people died and many others were injured."

According to the findings released Tuesday, 97 percent of respondents support the checks, with 2 percent opposing and 1 percent declining to respond. Even among gun owners polled, support is at 97 percent.

Overall support for the policy is 2 percentage points higher than what the university measured in December, and has been steadily on the rise since Quinnipiac University first started polling on this topic in 2013, when just 89 percent of respondents supported such background checks.

The school conducted the survey days after a gunman used an AR-15 assault-style rifle to kill 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week.

“If you think Americans are largely unmoved by the mass shootings, you should think again,” Tim Malloy, the Quinnipiac University Poll assistant director, said in a statement about the overall polling results.

If you think Americans are largely unmoved by the mass shootings, you should think again. Tim Malloy, Quinnipiac University Poll

The poll also found majority support for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons and a mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases and other gun control proposals.

“In the last two months, some of the biggest surges in support for tightening gun laws comes from demographic groups you may not expect, independent voters, men, and whites with no college degree,” Malloy said.

The poll surveyed 1,249 voters nationwide from Feb. 16-19.

While support for background checks is nearly universal, there are some apparent cracks in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the federal program that handles these checks to ensure certain criminals are not able to purchase firearms.

In November, it was revealed that the gunman who killed 26 people in a Texas church should have been prohibited from buying the firearm he used because of a domestic violence conviction he’d received while serving in the Air Force. However, the Air Force admitted that it had failed to submit that information to the background check database."
huffpo183,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-02-22 20:11:26-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atf-gun-industry_us_5a8dc6ece4b0273053a737dd,"The U.S. gun industry has grown explosively over the past decade, leaving the federal agency responsible for regulating it, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, struggling to keep up with the rising flow of guns into the civilian market. And if the ATF stumbles, it could mean serious consequences for public safety.

Production at U.S. gun companies more than doubled under the Obama administration, with manufacturing totals going from 5.5 million firearms in 2009 to 11.5 million in 2016, the latest year for which federal data are available. Gun sales appeared to go up by similar margins over that period. At the same time, the number of federally licensed gun dealers increased by about 9,000, topping out at 56,754 in 2016, while the number of federally licensed firearms manufacturers more than tripled, according to the ATF.

The ATF’s budget, which includes funds for monitoring the network of gun manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers, has increased only slightly amid the recent boom, and it has remained unchanged at $1.25 billion over the last few years. The agency hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed director since 2015, and, as The New York Times reported on Thursday, the National Rifle Association has been part of a campaign to ensure that the ATF remains a small agency grappling with a wide-reaching set of duties, including prosecuting gun crimes, combating gun violence and trafficking, and regulating firearm commerce in the U.S.

“As an organization, personnel wise, ATF is smaller than the Broward County Sheriff’s department, which would be law enforcement in the Miami area,” said David Chipman, a former ATF agent who now serves as senior policy adviser for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “The last aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, so that’d be like 10 years of ATF budgets.”

In 2016, the ATF employed 821 industry operations investigators, who were in charge of regulating more than 100,000 federal firearms licensees, or FFLs. These agents periodically inspect gun dealers and manufacturers to make sure their businesses comply with federal law. ATF investigators review paperwork at gun stores to confirm sales have been legally conducted and properly recorded, so firearms can be traced if they’re used in a crime. For gun manufacturers, the ATF examines inventory and transaction records to make sure the company has distributed its products according to the law.

“The inspector comes in, they take a sample of the forms ― the key is it’s got to be a random sample because they’re not looking at them all ― he looks for troubling answers that shouldn’t be there. If he finds them, he tries to get them resolved or he refers them to law enforcement to get resolved,” said Howard Wolfe, a former ATF supervisor.

By catching illegal sales, straw purchases and other improper dealings, these inspections keep guns out of the hands of those who are not allowed to own them. The inspections also allow the ATF to proactively identify and crack down on the relatively small number of bad actors who are responsible for a disproportionate number of crime guns.

“Although most gun dealers are law abiding and their compliance is pretty good, when you have a dirty dealer, they can push out so many guns into the criminal market quickly, so you’d want to be on top of that immediately,” Chipman said.

But with meager resources and no law specifying how frequently the ATF must inspect firearms licensees, or even mandating that it conduct the inspections at all, the agency is fighting to keep up. From 2007 to 2012, the ATF failed to inspect 58 percent of all FFLs, according to a 2013 Office of the Inspector General report. In 2016, the agency estimated that it conducted 9,790 inspections, only about 7 percent of the 137,464 active licensees.

“You’ve got many dealers that haven’t been inspected in five or 10 years, and that can have dramatic impacts,” Chipman said. “I don’t know about you, but I’d probably shy away from eating at a restaurant that was only health-inspected once a year.”

You’ve got many dealers that haven’t been inspected in five or 10 years ... . I don’t know about you, but I’d probably shy away from eating at a restaurant that was only health-inspected once a year. David Chipman, senior policy adviser for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

Of those 137,000 federal licensees, more than 57,000 are firearms collectors. The ATF’s failure to inspect those collectors is less of a concern to Wolfe, because they’re rarely the source of guns used in crimes. But Wolfe admitted that keeping tabs on gun dealers alone remains difficult.

“The FFL license is good for three years, so ATF’s goal is to get each dealer inspected once every three years, but I doubt if they’re making it because there are just way more firearms licensees than there are inspectors,” he said. “The more records an inspector has to look at, the harder his job is. He’s got to do more statistical sampling, he’s got to cut back to a number of records he can actually look at, which increases the chances that he could miss something.”

Although there has been some discussion of mandating routine ATF inspections for each licensee over a certain period, Wolfe said that it would be impossible for inspectors to abide by such a standard with the agency in its current financial shape.

“The powers that be need to realize that if they demand a higher number of inspections with the same number of people, they’re going to get lower quality inspections, and that means things are going to get missed,” he said.

The ATF has pleaded for more funding over the past few years in order to patch up some of these holes.

“The growth in firearms commerce is an external challenge that has strained ATF’s ability to meet the needs of the firearms industry and the citizens of the United States,” the agency wrote in a recent budget request for fiscal year 2019.

“As the volume of firearms commerce continues to increase, the number of individual firearms records and transactions that FFLs maintain has significantly increased, leading to lengthier inspection times,” the document explained.

In its request, the ATF calls specific attention to the lack of timely inspections of FFLs, saying it “presents a significant risk to public safety.”

For the time being, however, the agency doesn’t appear to be getting much help on the regulatory front.

President Donald Trump’s recently released 2019 budget proposal requests an additional $66.6 million for the ATF. The largest increase would go to bolstering the agency’s ability to process applications for equipment regulated under the 1934 National Firearms Act. These items include gun silencers, machine guns and short-barreled rifles, which have surged in popularity in the last decade.

If the federal government is truly committed to addressing gun violence and responsibly regulating a rapidly growing gun industry, it could start by investing in the ATF, Chipman said."
huffpo184,huffpo,"['Jane Sarasohn-Kahn', 'Health Economist', 'Advisor', 'Trend Weaver']",2017-02-09 10:39:05-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-100-flu-shot-how-much-paper-waste-costs-us-healthcare_us_589c8cc6e4b02bbb1816c3a5,"America ranks dead-last in health care efficiency compared with our peer countries, the Commonwealth Fund concluded in its study on how the U.S. health care system performs internationally.

Waste and inefficiency add costs to U.S. health care system. And health care costs rank highest on a new list of consumers’ worries found by the Monmouth Poll this week, well above jobs, housing, terrorism or immigration.

In the current American health reform debate, inefficiency and waste don’t get raised as top concerns. Consider that the U.S. spent $3.2 trillion on health care in 2015. As much as $300 billion of that money is wasted, and a big piece of that inefficiency is due to paper processes with which last century’s TV doctors Kildare, Welby, and perhaps even Hawkeye Pierce would have been familiar.

But this is the 21st century, and today is Feb. 9, 2017. Here is my personal story of health care paper and wasted costs to illustrate that this issue belongs to every U.S. health citizen.

On October 19, 2016, I went to the pharmacy in a suburban Philadelphia grocery store to get a flu shot. Before heading to the store, I checked with my health plan’s list of approved providers for immunizations, and that particular location was included.

I checked in with the pharmacy tech, who asked for my insurance card. When he clicked into the system for authorization, my coverage wasn’t available. The tech asked for assistance from the pharmacist, who double-checked the tech’s workflow and, sure enough, my health plan information wasn’t current in the computer system even though our premium for coverage had been paid.

After 15 minutes of the staff’s various computer clicks, I phoned my health plan’s third party administrator to inquire. In 10 minutes on the phone, I was counseled to “simply” pay for the flu shot and submit for reimbursement, which would be paid in full given that this was a covered preventive service in our health plan.

I got the shot, and handed a credit card to the tech who charged me $28.99 for the service.

Since that day, I have received six emails from the third party administrator concerning my reimbursement. She informed me that I would receive three (paper) checks to cover the $28.99.

I subsequently received two Explanations of Benefit forms from my health plan on October 31, 2016 and January 9, 2017. The first detailed the billed amount of $28.99, an allowed amount of $13.88, a coinsurance of $6.94, a “not covered” amount of $15.11, “what my plan paid” of $6.94, and “what I owed” amounting to $22.05. The second EOB indicated that of the $28.99 total flu shot cost, the plan paid $8.06.

So far, I have received a check for $6.94 (the “what my plan paid” amount) dated October 31, 2016, and a check for $8.06, dated January 9, 2017. I have been told, in one of the third party admin’s emails, that I should be receiving a third check in the amount of $13.99 from the grocery store pharmacy, but that check hasn’t yet arrived.

It’s now 121 days since I got my flu shot. I’ve calculated the real cost of that shot, and specifically the paper and workflows associated with the transaction and its aftermath: it’s at least $100. That accounts for the pharmacy workers’ time, the third part admin’s emails and follow-ups, and the insurance company’s EOBs and paper check cutting.

This direct cost calculation doesn’t include the patient’s (my) time-cost and aggravation that can lead to lower satisfaction and, potentially, plan and provider “flight.”

I am the shoemaker’s child with no shoes in this story. For nine years, I have been a member of the Advisory Council to the CAQH Index, which has been measuring the adoption of electronic, real-time transactions, away from paper-based processes, by health plans and health care providers.

The 2016 Index found continued migration to electronic transactions among health plans and providers, especially for submitting claims, verifying eligibility for the patient-member, inquiring into claim status, and paying for claims. Nevertheless, the use of manual transactions is not declining as rapidly as we would like, with phone calls still consuming significant time and money. This is happening, even though health plans are offering web portals and interactive voice response systems to replace manual processes.

“Our research for the Index shows that while progress has been steady, there are opportunities to encourage greater industry use of electronic transactions by reducing adoption barriers and sharing best practices,” observed Robin Thomashauer, Executive Director, CAQH. “Realizing the full potential of these transactions will require an ongoing commitment by all health care stakeholders, including health plans, providers, vendors and government.”

Each manual transaction costs health plans and health care providers about $3 more than the electronic transaction that could replace them. Since there were over 3 billion manual transactions between health plans and providers in 2015, moving to digital transactions represents a potential $9 billion savings for the U.S. health care system and its payors – which include consumers as we take on greater up-front financial risk in high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts.

My $100 flu shot was but one single transaction in the U.S. health care ecosystem that represents a much larger scenario of waste in American health care. That waste costs, in terms of money, time, and ultimately, the nation’s public and financial health."

Road rage is an American pastime. Nearly 80 percent of motorists admitted to at least one instance of aggressive driving in the past year, according to a 2016 study. A generation ago, drivers confronting each other over a traffic squabble could assume their quarrel would end with strong words or, at worst, a black eye. But in 2013, after one car tailgated another, two men in Ionia, Michigan, stopped in a parking lot to resolve their dispute. Instead of duking it out, they pulled out guns and shot each other. Both men legally carried a concealed weapon; both died in the hospital. (In states without a “right to carry,” the law usually requires people to store their firearms in the trunks of their cars.)1 Ad Policy

In 1997, researchers John Lott and David Mustard asserted that more guns meant less crime; it was an influential argument that likely contributed to states passing right-to-carry laws. Ever since, there’s been a debate over the effects of this legislation on violent crime.2

But with an updated paper by legal scholars John Donohue and Abhay Aneja and economist Kyle Weber, there’s a new consensus: Right-to-carry laws actually increase the rate of violent crime. Ten years after a state passes a right-to-carry law, violent crime—which includes murder, manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault—will be 13 to 15 percent higher than if the state had done nothing.3

What makes this new report so convincing? First, there’s simply a lot more experience with right-to-carry laws: 33 states adopted such legislation between 1981 and 2007. There’s also a lot more data: The researchers were able to track crime statistics until 2014.4

Starting in the early 1990s, violent crime plummeted across the United States. That reduction has masked the effects of right-to-carry laws, but the states that implemented them showed a smaller decrease in violent crime than the ones that didn’t. By itself, this isn’t sufficient evidence, since there could be other factors involved. But the study’s authors used a variety of controls to compare the two sets of states, and they found that the increase in violent crime holds. Interestingly, with the additional data, they found that even the methods of researchers like Lott and Mustard confirm this rise.5

The authors of this new paper have taken advantage of cutting-edge statistical techniques. They constructed synthetic control groups for states and used what’s known as a LASSO analysis to pick the best variables for comparison. The important thing to know about these methods is that, no matter the relative trade-offs of the statistical tool, the findings were consistent: When states passed right-to-carry laws, violent crime ended up higher than it would have been otherwise.6

The report also found that a right to carry has no deterrent effect on property crimes. (Indeed, in some of the calculations, such crimes increased.) This lack of deterrence isn’t surprising, given that victims of violent crimes fail to defend themselves with a gun 99.2 percent of the time. Using reasonable estimates of the relationship between incarceration and crime—that for every 10 percent increase in incarceration, there’s a 1.5 percent decrease in crime—the researchers estimate that the average right-to-carry state would have to double its prison population to counter the effects of this legislation.7 Related Article No Wonder Teachers Are Saying Enough Is Enough Bryce Covert

What causes this rise? The authors note several channels, including road rage, bar fights, and other heated interactions that once would have ended in insults or a fistfight, but that now suddenly turn deadly. Also, people who carry guns outside their homes have their firearms stolen at a rate of more than 1 percent a year, making these concealed-carry permit holders a nice source of guns for would-be criminals.8

This research comes at a perfect time. A bill that passed the House in December and is currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee would allow people with a concealed-carry permit in a given state to carry their firearms in the rest of the country. On April 19, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which includes the heads of 18,000 departments, sent a letter to Congress opposing the law. Now there is overwhelming evidence to back up their claims: Right-to-carry laws only lead to more violence.9"

The Parkland shooting unfolded with a grim familiarity. News alerts that shots had been fired at a Florida high school quickly gave way to reports of multiple casualties and then a final, horrible number: 17 dead, students and teachers. Republicans offered their thoughts and prayers as ambulances pulled away from the school, and they also warned against any “knee-jerk” reactions to the killings, in the words of House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ad Policy

But then something rare happened: The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High got angry and declared war on inaction. “Every single person up here today, all these people, should be at home grieving. But instead we are up here standing together, because if all our government and president can do is send ‘thoughts and prayers,’ then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see,” said student Emma Gonzalez at a rally, speaking through her tears and while still holding notes for her AP Government class. “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this—we call BS.” Video of her speech quickly went viral, and “We call BS” became a new rallying cry for the gun-control movement. In short order, plans came together for a nationwide student walkout and a march on Washington.

Listen to George Zornick on the Start Making Sense podcast.

Fatalism about what these young people—and the larger gun-control movement—can achieve is unwarranted and self-reinforcing. Last November in Virginia, the National Rifle Association backed 13 State House candidates in competitive races and Republican Ed Gillespie for governor. Twelve of those candidates lost (the 13th won on a coin toss), and Gillespie got trounced. At the state and local levels, gun-control advocates have been able to pass measures that Congress has failed to enact, like assault-weapons bans and expanded background checks. It’s worth remembering that the movement didn’t really exist in its current form before the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. Most of the major gun-control groups today were formed in response to that shooting, and Democrats rarely advocated for gun control in the decades prior to that. Given time, this movement can grow—and win—if it has confidence in itself and its arguments.

That’s not to discount the immediate limits of our ossified political system, especially with Donald Trump in the White House after getting over $30 million from the NRA. Trump will never sign significant gun-control legislation, and a Congress that couldn’t even ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre won’t pass it anyway. But as the movement works to elect a different Congress and president, there’s another thing it can do. It can go after the one thing that gun manufacturers value above all else, including human life: money. Current Issue View our current issue

These days, the gun titans are loaded with debt and facing declining consumer demand. In the same week as the Parkland shooting, Remington Outdoor Company, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the United States, announced plans to declare bankruptcy. Signs abound that other parts of the gun industry are in danger, too: According to an SEC filing, a $140 million loan to United Sporting Companies, a major middleman between manufacturers and retailers, lost half its value in 2017. Gun retailers aren’t faring much better: Gander Mountain, a big-box sports retailer that sold guns in most of its stores, went belly-up in 2017 and began to liquidate locations nationwide.

Activists can help deliver a knockout punch to these merchants of death. Divestment is one route, by making guns as radioactive as fossil fuels. In 2013, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System voted to divest itself of millions of dollars’ worth of shares in gun manufacturers. New York City’s employee pension fund did the same in 2016 and also pulled money from sporting stores like Cabela’s and Dick’s that sell guns. College students nationwide should ask their endowment offices whether they have holdings in gun stocks—and if so, challenge their colleges to dump them.

Divestment can happen at the personal level, too. Thirty-five percent of US stock funds include investments in gun and ammunition manufacturers—a staggering $17.3 billion invested in 2,120 funds. At GoodbyeGunStocks.com, you can learn whether your investment fund owns shares in gun companies. If it does, a tool on the website allows you to find gun-free funds.

Letitia James, New York City’s public advocate, has put considerable pressure on banks to stop lending to gun manufacturers, and suggests the city shouldn’t do business with them if they continue to make those loans. PayPal, Square, Stripe, and Apple Pay already don’t allow payments for firearms to be processed—what if the major banks and credit-card companies did the same?

If Congress managed to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005, gun manufacturers would no longer enjoy broad immunity from civil claims. The families of people hurt or killed by guns could finally hold manufacturers responsible for the damage they caused, with the lawsuits against Big Tobacco serving as a model. Both industries sold things that, when they worked as intended, ended countless lives.

The NRA’s power in Washington is fueled by money from the gun industry. It’s time to turn off the spigot and make it unprofitable to sell death."

There is a learned hopelessness about mass shootings in America that creates the foundations for an emotionally hollow, politically impotent, media-saturated response. Conservatives offer prayers for those who have died and oppose any action that will prevent more deaths. Liberals offer outrage at the carnage and demand that something must be done, but then go on to do relatively little. (Gun owners are almost twice as likely as non–gun owners to have contacted a public official about gun policy, and almost three times as likely to have donated to a group that takes a position on the issue.) The rest of the world looks on aghast that an ostensibly mature democracy could witness such a tragedy and decide to do nothing to prevent it from happening again. Cable-news channels screen mawkish portraits of the dead and arm’s-length, usually posthumous profiles of the killer. Talk of evil is “balanced” by calls for legislation. Then, after a few days, the talking and the calling stop—until the next time. Ad Policy

With nothing changing but the name, place, and number of victims, what some call “compassion fatigue” sets in. But as Susan Moeller, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland, argued in her study of the responses to the media’s reporting of such atrocities, the problem isn’t so much fatigue as it is the cycle of avoidance that causes people to avert their gaze. She writes, “We’ve got compassion fatigue, we say, as if we have involuntarily contracted some kind of disease that we’re stuck with no matter what we might do.”

There is reason to believe that the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed by a single shooter, has the potential to break that cycle. Students, including those from Parkland, have spoken out in ways that are difficult to ignore, calling for youth-led activism against political complacency in general and the National Rifle Association in particular. Piercing through the “Now is not the time for judgment” rhetoric, these students leveraged their vulnerability to political effect. They have held a press conference and called a national demonstration. The issue isn’t fading from the news as quickly as mass shootings tend to do, with interest in the term “gun control” enjoying a sustained high in Google searches a week later.

There are, nonetheless, grounds to be pessimistic or even cynical. We remember Sandy Hook. The kids were younger, the outrage greater; the president even cried—and still, many insist, nothing happened.

But there are three main reasons why we might see progressive possibilities in this moment. The first is that something did happen after Sandy Hook: President Obama spoke up. Five months before that atrocity, James Holmes went into a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and shot 12 people dead during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. The next morning, at a scheduled event in Fort Myers, Florida, Obama said what presidents white and black, Republican and Democrat, have said for the best part of a generation: “There are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection.” But after Sandy Hook, he said something else: “We can’t tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change.” Belatedly, Obama set a new tone. We shouldn’t be too surprised that, after years of presidents and congressional leaders refusing to bring the issue of gun control into mainstream political debate, this new tone did not result in legislative change the first time. You can’t fatten a pig on market day. It takes time. Related Article America’s Refusal to Control Firearms Is Killing Teens at an Absurd Rate Gary Younge

Second, this time the challenge is being led by young people who are motivated in a way that the mostly white, suburban gun-control movement has not been. “Maybe the adults have got used to saying, ‘It is what it is,'” said 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez, who was in the school when the shooting happened. “But if us students have learned anything, it’s that if you don’t study, you will fail. And in this case, if you actively do nothing, people continually end up dead.” Parkland was the eighth school shooting and the 30th mass shooting of the year—and it was only Valentine’s Day. In the four days afterward, there were four more mass shootings.

Finally, and crucially, this fight comes at a moment of heightened consciousness about the nation’s political trajectory and with a new critical mass determined to correct it. As a result of Donald Trump’s victory, many liberals and progressives have been doing things over the past year—campaigning, marching, phone banking, running for office—that they hadn’t done for a long time, if at all.

In the course of this activism, many are now realizing that the issues that energize us most—whether it’s immigration, sexual harassment, racism, or health care—are not isolated. In the past, campaigning around a tragedy like Parkland would have concentrated solely on gun control. That doesn’t go far enough. Avoiding the more enduring American pathologies that allow the gun culture to flourish—the obsessions with conquest, domination, force, power, masculinity, and rugged individualism—means failing to explain why a racist, anti-Semitic teenage boy with a grudge and an easily available weapon of war can go to school and kill others at will, and what might be done to prevent it. It means failing to recognize that America’s gun culture is deeply embedded in its general culture.

The Trump agenda is a broad and unrelenting assault on equality and human rights. But it did not come out of nowhere, and it did not invent the divisions that it exploits. For the resistance to be effective, it cannot be narrowly focused. It must, instead, shed light on how these various struggles are connected. The young campaigners have a stake, an audience, a platform, and allies. That may not be enough to stop the next school shooting. But it’s more than gun-control advocates have had for some time."

This weekend, thousands of people will gather in DC and at over 800 events across the world for the March For Our Lives, a protest organized by the student survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, to demand action to end gun violence. The march comes after students across the country walked out of their classrooms last week, many for seventeen minutes in tribute to the seventeen lives lost in Parkland. A similar walkout is planned for April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. Ad Policy Ready to fight back?

After so many mass shootings, there’s a temptation to be cynical. With little legislative movement, the violence continues; the past six months have seen three of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history. Just as brutal are the deaths that often fail to grab our attention—according to data from the CDC, an average of 96 Americans are killed by guns each day, a number that climbs by the year.

But this time, the impassioned protests of high school activists and survivors have ignited action and revealed a nationwide frustration with the relentless sequence of massacres. “People right now are just fed up with the lack of change,” says Andrew Patrick, the media director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV).

The students of Parkland are also attempting to connect with activists and victims of gun violence not given the same amount of attention. Acknowledging the discrepancy between their suddenly high-profile platform and that afforded to young black activists who have been at the forefront of this issue, they met over pizza with their peers in Chicago and attempted to bridge their experience with the high rates of gun homicides endemic within communities of color.

A recent CNN poll found that 70 percent of Americans support stricter gun control laws, the highest level since 1993. After public pressure following the Parkland shooting, corporations in industries ranging from aviation to banking have started to cut ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA). The movement has even led to tangible legislative success; the Republican-controlled Florida state legislature recently passed a bill that added restrictions on gun purchases—the first of its kind in the state in over 20 years.

The cracks are beginning to show and advocates of “gun sense” policies (activists say that there’s nothing controlling about protecting public safety and so “gun control” is a misnomer) are beginning to win. Here are five ways you can join the fight:

1. Contact your elected officials—at every level.

A raft of proposals are being considered at the city, state, and federal levels. Here are just a few to write and call lawmakers about: Current Issue View our current issue

FEDERAL:

• Stop Concealed Carry Reciprocity. Last December, on the fifth anniversary of Sandy Hook, the House passed an NRA-backed bill for concealed carry reciprocity, which would allow individuals who have a concealed carry permit in one state to carry a gun in another, even when current laws differ. The bill, now being considered by the Senate, would essentially create a national gun license and loosen the ability of states to regulate concealed carry.

• Support “gun sense” bills. Legislation with bipartisan support up for consideration include raising the age limit for purchasing AR-15s and banning bump stocks. Dianne Feinstein has also introduced a bill to ban assault weapons altogether. There is also a push to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (Fix NICS), though Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demands this be accompanied with a more in-depth, universal background check system. Read more about the bills and their supporters here.

STATE:

• Support GVRO/ERPO policies. In the 12 months after the 2012 Newtown shooting, states passed 70 laws easing restrictions on gun sales and owners, highlighting the role state legislatures have played in abetting gun proliferation. Advocates for gun safety are answering with their own ideas and right now many are promoting Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) policies—also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPO)—to statehouses across the country. GVRO/ERPO policies allow family members and law enforcement officials to temporarily have access to guns removed for individuals who are at high risk of endangering themselves or others, with studies showing a significant influence in preventing gun deaths. The goal is to have ERPO-style policies implemented at the state level in all 50 states; so far, five have passed laws.

• Check out States United to Prevent Gun Violence, a national network of grassroots affiliates across the country, to find out more about the specific laws in your state. Each affiliate serves as a regional hub for information, partnership, and advocacy. You can find and follow your local affiliate here.

LOCAL:

• Fight preemption laws. After decades of lobbying by the NRA, more than 40 states now have preemption laws regarding firearms that strip the authority of municipalities to regulate the sale and use of guns. In some states such as Florida, extreme preemption laws threaten officials who enforce their own gun ordinances with personal $5,000 fines and removal from office, and a fine of up to $100,000 for the town itself. Urge your city council members and mayors to vocally oppose state preemption laws and to join coalitions such as the nonpartisan Campaign to Defend Local Solutions, which seeks to protect the rights of local authorities to create their own gun laws free from state interference.

• Stop schools from arming teachers. Florida’s governor signed a measure allowing trained school workers to carry handguns, a proposition that is also gaining traction in the White House. In some areas, local school boards are starting to reject this pressure. Attend local school board meetings to make your disapproval heard.

2. Exercise consumer power.

The NRA and the dangerous agenda of gun deregulation it pushes is the principal threat to gun safety in America. Isolating this immensely powerful group through the commercial sector is a particularly potent tactic that is gaining traction right now. “Corporate America is usually quick to pick up on an issue, and their responses are a major sign that the cultural landscape is shifting,” says Patrick.

Amid a flurry of a customer complaints and threats of boycott, Delta Airlines, MetLife, Hertz, and the First National Bank of Omaha—which used to offer an “NRA Visa Card”—dropped discount programs and business partnerships with the NRA. Retail giants like Walmart and Dick’s have also recently toughened their restrictions on gun sales.

Campaigns are now encouraging customers to call, email, and tweet at Fedex and Amazon: the former has bucked the tide and resisted demands to cut its discount program for NRA members, while the latter continues to host NRATV, a channel that streams NRA propaganda 24/7.

You can find more information on the Fedex and Amazon campaigns here (about halfway down the page). And if you’re a customer of any of these other companies continuing their associations with the NRA, you can also tell them that you oppose their partnership.

Consumer power is also effective in negotiating the presence of guns at private establishments themselves. A few years ago, Target, Chili’s, Chipotle, and other chains requested customers stop bringing guns into their stores. While the power businesses have to prohibit open and concealed carry varies from state to state, reach out to those near you and encourage them to take public stances against guns on their premises.

3. Participate in rallies and petitions, get in the loop.

Mass demonstrations of popular support for gun reform help to end the normalization of gun violence. You can find information about the March For Our Lives in DC here and other events here. On April 20th, students, faculty, and staff will stage another walkout (you can find one near you here). Another method of action is through petitions: here’s one to remove the ban on federal gun violence research and another to stop “bad apple” gun dealers.

Gun safety organizations will be driving protests and proposals throughout the year, so it’s important to keep updated. Sign up for the newsletters of national groups such as the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and States United to Prevent Gun Violence.

4. Join and support grassroots organizations in disproportionately affected communities.

The Parkland high school activists are just one node in a larger movement to stop gun violence that traces back at least to the 1970s. Grassroots efforts have been leading the struggle, especially within communities which are disproportionately affected by gun violence. For instance, African-Americans are more than twice as likely to die from gun violence than any other racial group and black activists have been pushing for gun reform through anti-violence campaigns for decades, often without much in the way of resources or national attention. Here are a few organizations to follow and donate your money, time, and energy to:

• Dream Defenders is a black youth-led group that was founded in Florida after the killing of Trayvon Martin. With a racial justice mission, the collective has organized actions protesting gun violence around the state and led a 2013 sit-in in the Florida Capitol protesting the state’s Stand Your Ground laws in the context of George Zimmerman’s acquittal.

• LIVE FREE is a social justice campaign created by people of faith seeking to end mass incarceration and gun violence. They’ve organized campaigns with black and brown leadership in more than ten states, and also use a unique, community-oriented “ceasefire” strategy to deter chronic perpetrators who are responsible for the majority of gun homicides.

• Community Justice Reform Coalition is an anti-violence coalition that aims to prevent gun violence through policy advocacy and programs. The organization centers criminal justice reform in communities of color. Past gun safety initiatives have included community interventions, domestic violence programs, and public health approaches.

5. Make your vote count this November.

35 Senate seats, 6,066 state legislative seats, and all members of the House are up for election in 2018, meaning that one of the most effective ways to take action on gun violence prevention is through the polls. If you haven’t already, make sure to register to vote and research your district representatives. Here, it’s useful to follow the money: Drain The NRA has aggregated data on politicians who have received funding from the gun lobby, while NPR has compiled an extensive list of the voting records of representatives on key gun bills since 1993.

“People are viewing gun violence through a different prism since Parkland and it’s kind of been changing in the five years since Sandy Hook,” Patrick said. “The elected officials in power had their time to act and I think eventually we’ll see a lot of Americans vote on this come November.” With all the energy around this issue, we have a great opportunity to flip seats that are bought by the corporate gun lobby and replace them with representatives who will prioritize gun safety."

Two days before the March for Our Lives drew as many as 800,000 demonstrators to Pennsylvania Avenue, students at Thurgood Marshall Academy in southeast Washington held their own rally in the school gymnasium. “Living in DC, it’s easy to be in a bubble. We live in the nation’s capital. There’s the monuments, the statues, the memorials, and all of that,” Jayla Holdip told her classmates. “But we need our stories to be heard. It should not be normal for everybody in this room to be affected by gun violence.”1 Ad Policy

In 2016, 77 percent of all homicides in Washington, DC, were committed with a gun, and Thurgood Marshall is located in one of the most dangerous zip codes in the city. In the past two years, the Sixth and Seventh Police Districts, which cover the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, recorded 154 homicides and 829 assaults with a deadly weapon in which a gun was used. By comparison, the Second Police District, which encompasses a geographical area about as large as the Sixth and Seventh combined but also has a richer and whiter population, saw just five homicides and 37 gun assaults over the same period.2

“Gun violence is an issue that our DC community and other cities have experienced for generations. Although we personally have not experienced a school shooting, we know the destruction of guns all so well,” said Zion Kelly when it was his turn to speak. At the beginning of the school year, Kelly’s twin brother Zaire, also a Thurgood Marshall student, had been shot and killed on the way home from a college-prep class. He was 16. In January, Paris Brown, a junior, was shot to death less than two miles away—the second person in a school of fewer than 400 students to be killed with a gun since the school year began.3

Murders in this part of the city, much less meetings of student activists, aren’t normally headline news. But that day, two risers full of news cameras were on hand to record the rally. “To these cameras,” said one of the students, Aaron Woods, staring directly at the camera to the laughter of his classmates, “and these government officials who we’re trying to reach—yeah, we’re looking for y’all.”4 “It should not be normal for everybody in this room to be affected by gun violence.” —Jayla Holdip, student at Thurgood Marshall Academy

The cameras were there because some of the now-famous students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida, had come to join the rally. They didn’t waste any time noting the irony. “We’ve seen again and again the media focus on school shootings, and oftentimes be biased towards white, privileged students,” said David Hogg, one of the most visible Parkland survivors. “Many of these communities are disproportionately affected by gun violence, but they don’t get the same share of media attention that we do.”5

Hogg’s admonition wasn’t immediately absorbed by at least some of the media people present that day—when Hogg had to depart early, a good number of the camera crews followed him into the hallway, even as the Thurgood Marshall students were still speaking. But the Parkland survivors and other youth leaders of #NeverAgain have made it clear that they’re aiming to build a movement that’s multiracial and inclusive—one that addresses gun violence everywhere, not just in suburban schools and movie theaters. In so doing, they are trying to eliminate one of the central paradoxes of our gun-control debate: While a disproportionate number of the victims of gun violence are black, most mainstream gun-control advocacy is conducted by white people, and the subjects of race and racial inequality have, for the most part, gone unbroached.6

The contemporary gun-control movement was essentially born again after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in late 2012. Until that point, politicians very rarely talked about new gun laws. Even when a gunman killed 12 people and injured 70 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, right in the middle of the 2012 presidential campaign, then–President Barack Obama refused to call for any new legislation.7 Current Issue View our current issue

Then Newtown happened. Six adults and 20 children, all between 6 and 7 years old, were massacred in 11 minutes by a 20-year-old shooter wielding a semiautomatic rifle and two handguns. In the shock and outrage that followed, several new gun-control groups were born: Americans for Responsible Solutions, now called Giffords after its founder, Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in 2011, and Everytown for Gun Safety, which is funded by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and former New York City mayor, and which absorbed Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action. The first real gun-control push in decades revolved around the 2013 bill proposed by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA), which would have expanded background checks for gun purchases and heightened gun-trafficking penalties. It failed to get the necessary 60 votes in the Senate.8

These post-Newtown groups genuinely care about gun violence in the inner city, and the policies they’re advocating really would help: Background checks and tighter enforcement against so-called straw purchasers would stem the flow of handguns into big cities, where they are overwhelmingly responsible for most of the violence. (In Chicago, for example, over 90 percent of the guns recovered at crime scenes were handguns, and in 95 percent of the cases where police could identify the possessor, that person was not the first purchaser of the gun.) But in the same way that the opioid epidemic suddenly focused national attention on the pointless, punitive nature of the War on Drugs only after the crack-cocaine epidemic had ravaged cities and exploded the prison population, the political space for gun legislation didn’t truly open up until white kids in the suburbs started becoming victims, too.9

Shaped by this political context, the post-Newtown gun groups are, at their core, small-C conservative. They emphasize soccer moms who want to protect their children, or law-enforcement officers who think the streets have become too dangerous, or veterans who believe weapons of war should not be used by civilians. They also haven’t been able to get hundreds of thousands of people out into the streets—preferring an inside game of slow consensus building with lawmakers and taking small legislative wins where they can.10

Yet during almost exactly the same period that these post-Newtown groups took off, in what often seemed like a universe parallel to the Newtowns and Auroras, a vibrant, youth-led, anti-racist movement against police and vigilante shootings was rising up across the country. “We’ve been marching. We’ve been rallying. We’ve been saying our chants and our calls for justice,” said Samantha Johnson, co-chair of the Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, which formed in response to Trayvon Martin’s death. “We, as activists, understand the ebb and flow of how society views individuals in certain communities of color. We understand that.”11

The #NeverAgain movement is poised to bring these two streams together. “It’s important, as people of the American society and people in the media, [that we] recognize this inequality and that we work to solve it,” said Hogg. “First, though, we must call it out, and we must call it for what it is, and that’s racial bias towards us and many other people that’s not only in the media, but that’s in our society, too, as a whole.”12

The March for Our Lives rally featured several speakers of color who drew specific, sustained attention to the toll that gun violence takes in inner cities. It wasn’t just a pro forma checking of that box, but a central part of the movement that the students are trying to build. Edna Chavez told the crowd in DC about her brother, killed by a gun in Los Angeles. “My brother, he was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset going down on South Central. You hear pops thinking they’re fireworks. They weren’t pops. You see the melanin in your brother’s skin turn gray.” Sixteen-year-old Mya Middleton described having a gun stuck in her face in Chicago. “He said, ‘If you say anything, I will find you.’ And yet, I’m still saying something today.” And the star of the rally, who created perhaps its most viral moment, was Naomi Wadler, an 11-year-old from Virginia. “I represent the African-American women who are victims of gun violence, who are simply statistics instead of vibrant, beautiful girls full of potential,” she said. “For far too long, these black girls and women have been just numbers. I am here to say ‘Never again!’ for those girls too.”13

These kids are disrupting politics as usual in other ways as well. #NeverAgain’s key tactical innovation has been to call bullshit on the country’s broken dialogue around guns—that’s literally one of the movement’s slogans. “We call BS,” Parkland student Emma González declared in the speech that helped jump-start the movement. “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS.”14

That’s an explicit rebuke to the National Rifle Association’s tired talking points, but also an implicit repudiation of the cautious incrementalism that has characterized the post-Newtown gun-control movement. When the Las Vegas shooting happened last October—the deadliest mass shooting in the United States—there was no federal policy response except for a clarification of federal rules that may ban bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic guns to operate at nearly an automatic rate of fire. The youth leaders of #NeverAgain are much more maximalist in their views and straightforwardly unafraid to reject small-scale compromises as insufficient. “When they give us that inch, that bump-stock ban, we will take a mile,” said Delaney Tarr, one of the Parkland survivors, at the rally. This radicalism—or, some might say, utopianism—is rooted in a strange mix of youthful confidence that all the world’s problems can be solved, and a horrendous and very adult experience with flying bullets and bloodshed. “Talking to politicians, they’re always gonna try to talk around in circles and say that you’re wrong because of X, Y, and Z. But that’s not true. They don’t know what it’s like to be 20 feet from an AR-15,” Alfonso Calderon, a 16-year-old Parkland student, told the crowd at Thurgood Marshall. “They don’t know what it’s like to have somebody that you love die because of laws that are inadequate. And it’s heartbreaking. They’re presenting ideas that aren’t solutions—they’re bandages to stab wounds. It’s just not gonna work.”15 “When they give us that inch, that bump-stock ban, we will take a mile.” —Delaney Tarr, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High student

The Parkland students have not been afraid to frame the gun problem in stark moral terms—without worrying about the discourse police. “It just makes me think: What sick fuckers are out there that want to sell more guns, murder more children, and, honestly, just get reelected?” Hogg vented in an interview with The Outline earlier this month. “What type of person are you, when you want to see more fucking money than children’s lives? What type of shitty person does that?”16

All of this has thrown pro-gun politicians and activists off their game. At the heart of their panic is the notion that the passion gap that has long characterized the gun debate—one in which, for example, 21 percent of gun owners contact a public official to express an opinion on gun policy, versus 12 percent of non–gun owners—may be suddenly, and resoundingly, closing.17

The NRA’s Twitter account fell silent on the day of the march, an occurrence usually reserved only for the hours after a mass shooting, when the NRA feels that its advocacy would do more harm than good. On Fox News, as footage rolled of a massive, energetic march expanding the terms of the gun-control debate by the minute, the network’s “young” talking heads criticized the event in boilerplate terms, deploying the shibboleth that armed guards were present at the rally, so guns must de facto be good. (In fact, the only armed guards I saw during the march in Washington were DC police officers.)18

There has also been a pervasive effort on the right to discredit the Parkland kids as simply not real. Naturally, some prominent conservatives dubbed them mere pawns of George Soros. The hugely popular blog RedState ran a long post after the march in which the author claimed to have discovered that Hogg wasn’t even at school during the shooting. (He was; RedState retracted the entire post with one long strike-through, but blamed a “confusing” CBS report.) After the march, a photoshopped video of González ripping up the Constitution flew around right-wing Twitter accounts and blogs. (In the actual video, she was tearing up a shooting-range target.)19

In the days following the Parkland shooting, as the student survivors were becoming household names, the top trending video on YouTube purported to show that some of the kids were actually “crisis actors,” part of some inscrutable mega-plot to confiscate everyone’s guns. (YouTube was forced to remove the video after an outcry.) Normally the purview of niche conspiracy cranks like Alex Jones, the crisis-actor theory was spread by a Florida legislator’s aide, who was later fired, and reached all the way to Donald Trump Jr., who “liked” posts about it on Twitter. Hogg, one of the main targets of these charges, had to go on CNN to publicly declare: “I’m not a crisis actor—I’m somebody that had to witness this and live through this, and I continue to have to do that.”20

Many adults simply cannot accept that high-school kids are sick and tired of mass shootings in their schools, nor that their moral outrage is real. “The fact that these people refuse to believe that something like this could happen is something that all of us don’t want to believe,” Hogg said on CNN. “But the sad truth is that it is.”21

It seems clear that in the weeks since the Parkland shooting, the student survivors have been winning their battles. Whether they win the war depends a lot on how this movement evolves and is able to channel the energy of the streets into actual changes to gun policy.22

So far, the results have been mixed. In the wake of the shooting, the notoriously gun-friendly, Republican-controlled Florida Legislature did pass a raft of new gun laws: It raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21, created a three-day waiting period for sales, and banned bump stocks. But it left out most of the Parkland students’ key demands: banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and expanding background checks. The adults of the gun-control movement haven’t cracked that particularly tough nut either—but the kids have, in a way, taken on a much larger task, by very publicly putting on the mantle of solving inner-city gun violence, too.23 “It’s bad enough that we have to return with clear backpacks. Should we also return with our hands up?” —Kai Koerber, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High student

If you live in a wealthy suburban neighborhood where crime is low and the schools are good, and somebody shoots up the local shopping center, the policy solution is simple: Get rid of the guns, and life can resume happily after that. In the country’s largest urban areas—which have less than one-tenth of the US population but more than one-fifth of the country’s gun violence—shootings are the final coda to a tragic story of economic segregation, terrible educational options, over-incarceration, and a flourishing underground drug trade.24

And some of the proposals that accompany gun-control legislation, such as increased criminal penalties and heightened policing, have the potential to harm people of color more than they would help. When Florida legislators passed their post-Parkland measures, they included more law enforcement inside schools and made searches of students much easier. “It’s bad enough we have to return with clear backpacks,” said Kai Koerber, a black student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, speaking to reporters recently. “Should we also return with our hands up?”25

While reducing the number of illegal guns flowing into big cities has been a priority of community activists’ for decades, it’s far from the only one, and complex demands will lead to an even more complex political strategy for achieving the fundamental goal: that Americans should be able to live free of the fear of being killed in their neighborhoods or schools.26

Black Americans worry about gun violence by a much larger percentage than do either white or Latino voters, and therefore are likely to support drastic solutions. A new, intersectional gun-control movement can thus expand the political base agitating for change. But it might also find itself in a trap in which gun violence can’t be solved until racism and inequality are, too; it might fail thanks to the bigotry of incredibly high expectations.27

Reconciling sky-high dreams with the realities on the ground is the very definition of growing up. And the Parkland survivors will grow up alongside their movement. We don’t know where it will go yet, but could anyone else have started it and disrupted decades of bullshit about guns?28

“People believe that the youth of this country are insignificant,” said Parkland student Alex Wind during the rally. “People believe that the youth have no voice. I say that we were the only people who could have made this movement possible.”29"

Lucy McBath effectively put her Georgia state House race on hold when she got the news of the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14. “We had to be there for these children,” she told me over coffee at an Emily’s List conference last week. Ad Policy

McBath lost her own child, Jordan Davis, to gun violence in 2012, when a white man who didn’t like the music Jordan and his friends were playing shot him through an open car window at close range. His killer, Michael Dunn, invoked Florida’s stand-your-ground law in defense during trial. Devastated, McBath worked to keep the media from tarnishing her extraordinary son the way so many other young black victims have been diminished in death. After a mistrial, Dunn was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. McBath has been organizing, in some fashion, to be there for “these children”—from Jordan, to the first-graders of Newtown, to the Parkland survivors—ever since.

McBath helped plan the March for Our Lives last month and organized a prayer vigil at Washington’s National Cathedral the night before. Sometime during that whirlwind, she developed a new plan: She would run for the House of Representatives in Georgia’s sixth district against first-term GOP Representative Karen Handel. Lucy McBath decided to move from a small state House race where she’d already raised more than $100,000 and was given a decent chance to win, to contest a US House seat that was the most expensive in history last year, when newcomer Jon Ossoff tried to become the first Democrat to represent the district in 40 years and narrowly lost in a special election.

Handel is sitting on almost $1 million, and two of McBath’s three male Democratic rivals have written their campaigns big checks. McBath, by contrast, had to return all the money she’d raised for the state House seat and start over. She is also starting late; the primary is May 22. Two of her primary opponents have gained some traction in the activist community: Former local CBS news anchor Bobby Kaple is running on “affordable, accessible health care,” while Kevin Abel, a businessman and a South African immigrant who is Jewish, has attacked Donald Trump’s treatment of DACA kids and other immigrants. Having raised less than $50,000 so far, McBath is an underdog in every sense of the word, but she is also Lucy McBath, a nationally known activist and the only woman in a Democratic primary that will be decided by women. In the sixth district, roughly 60 percent of likely Democratic voters are women, and a quarter are people of color. McBath sees a path to victory, despite her late start.

But money isn’t McBath’s only obstacle. There are Democrats in her district who are upset that she walked away from her state House race, leaving the party scrambling to find a candidate. One likely supporter told me the busy McBath is alienating some potential backers by skipping many local candidate forums, which lends an impression she’s a national figure who thinks her name recognition will boost her over lesser-known Democrats. “It might not,” this person says. “We’ve had so many requests it’s unreal, and we’re incredibly grateful,” campaign manager Rebecca Walldorff responds. “We’ll do as many as we can.”

Still, if McBath makes it through the Democratic primary, this will be an epic race in an epic midterm year, pitting a conservative, white, pro-NRA, anti-abortion incumbent against a liberal, African-American, pro-choice, and pro–“gun sense” woman who toured the country as one of the “Mothers of the Movement” on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Current Issue View our current issue

JW: So tell me why you decided to move from running for the state House seat to running for Congress.

LM: I was lobbying in Denver—Colorado’s been doing some really good work on gun laws—and the minute I got off the plane my phone was blowing up over Parkland. I moved right into getting prepared to support the children. Getting prepared for the march. Organizing the event at the National Cathedral.

That was the catalyst for me. I felt, my God, our kids are standing up, and nobody’s there supporting them? Our children are going to bat for themselves? I just thought that was unacceptable—we as adults weren’t standing up and doing the right thing. These are the civil rights leaders of their day and time. They’re the kids at the lunch counters, they’re the young people who were opposing the Vietnam War, they’re the kids who were fighting for civil rights right along with Martin Luther King Jr.

This is a demographic we did not have in 2016. When I was traveling with the Mothers of the Movement, I cannot tell you how many millennials we met who weren’t voting. Our hearts were broken. They weren’t coming to the rallies. They would tell me, “My vote doesn’t matter.” I was a staunch Hillary supporter, but I have to applaud Bernie, he did get the kids out.

So I just realized I’d have far greater impact to move the needle, on so many issues, in Congress. Plus, I’ve been working everywhere else, but people didn’t even know I lived in this district. How dare I not do it for my own community? That’s Jordan’s legacy.

JW: Georgia’s sixth district saw an explosion of activism last year, even though Jon Ossoff lost…

LM: What Jon Ossoff was able to do for us, to have that tidal wave of Democratic voters interested in making that shift…

JW: Yes, I covered your Indivisible chapter, plus the Liberal Moms of Cobb and Roswell Counties…

LM: And now we have Cobb Progressives, No Safe Seats, we have a whole infrastructure that we didn’t before. The sixth is so moving forward, and they have all been diligently building. It’s amazing how motivated and structured they have become. The Democratic primary voters will be 60 percent women, 24 percent minorities, and I fit both demographics. The reality that I have lived is that I can speak to my neighbors about being a single mom, I can speak about women’s reproductive health, about health care…

JW: And about guns.

LM: You know when Trump had all those Congress members in to talk about guns, after Parkland? I was pissed off by that! They were making nice with him. Dianne Feinstein, I love her, but she was just sitting there smiling, they weren’t asking the right questions. They want to trade Fix NICS [a bill that strengthens the National Instant Criminal Background Check System] in exchange for concealed carry reciprocity? No! They want everybody to be able to carry their guns across state lines—no background checks, no training, they might be domestic abusers, but we’re gonna let them carry the guns anywhere they want? No!

JW: How did the 2016 campaign, and your role with Hillary Clinton and the Mothers of the Movement, influence your decision to run for office this year?

LM: All along people would say: have you thought about running for office? The entire time I was on the campaign trail with Hillary. I’d say: I’m not a politician! I really got a baptism by fire. I came to understand the depth of what it takes to be a public servant. Even though she didn’t win, that effort wasn’t wasted, not at all. She gave us confidence, so now we’re able to be the mouthpiece that she wasn’t able to be in the White House. We are that cadre of women who can push her agenda forward. I’m excited that I get to be a part of that process—that I get to carry out what she couldn’t carry out.

JW: Are you still in touch with the other mothers?

LM: We are still in touch. We text all the time. Everyone’s stayed active, everyone’s still on the trail in whatever way they can be.

JW: And what about Hillary—has she endorsed you?

LM: Not…verbally endorsed me [pauses, smiles]. But she’s my friend.

JW: What has she told you?

LM: Run my race. She said: “We need people like you in office.”"

In the aftermath of mass shootings, a now familiar pattern emerges: tragedy, accusations, pledges to do better, and eventual silence. Laudable desires to enact effective gun control tend to lie at the center of these fleeting public discussions. With some 250–350 million guns in circulation, firearms regulation is an issue of mammoth proportions, and it should be debated. But, unfortunately, attempts to identify the factors that lead to gun violence often take on a stigmatizing and inaccurate bent. That was exemplified by the president’s comment that the man who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February was “mentally disturbed.” Later, he suggested that the lack of “mental hospitals” was to blame for the incident, and even suggested incarcerating innocent people in mental-health facilities because “he hasn’t committed the crime, but he may very well.” Meanwhile, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch suggested “crazy” people should be barred from gun ownership at a CNN town-hall meeting on Wednesday, while Wayne LaPierre told a packed house at CPAC that the “failure of the mental health system” is to blame for gun violence. With sentiments like these, it’s easy to see why “not guilty by reason of insanity” can still result in a lifetime of incarceration. Ad Policy

The president, like much of the rest of the country, is having the wrong conversation about mental health, guns, and violence.

There’s a popular myth that mass shootings are the work of “madmen,” and that keeping guns out of the hands of mentally ill people via discriminatory policy decisions will resolve the ongoing epidemic of gun violence in the United States. This misconception persists despite the fact that it’s blatantly inaccurate: Mass shootings account for less than 1 percent of gun deaths in the United States (by the FBI’s definition of four or more deaths in one incident). Moreover, a 2015 analysis of 235 mass murders, including shootings, found just 46 mentally ill perpetrators; factors like “rage,” “hostility,” and being “disgruntled” were more common than mental-health conditions.

Mentally ill people are not inherently more violent than anybody else. Issues like substance abuse and situational factors can increase violent behavior, but the same is true of people without mental-health conditions. Evidence suggests mentally ill people are actually less likely to kill someone with a firearm, overall, than their sane counterparts. Related Article Out of Bloodshed, Hope for Gun Control Gary Younge

But when they do, they’re usually killing themselves. This cuts to the crux of the problem with the way we talk about guns and mental health: Rather than taking on the very real and horrific toll of suicide in the United States, pundits and members of the public focus on the very tiny fraction of mentally ill people who commit heinous crimes and extrapolate wild conclusions.

According to the Brady Campaign, approximately two-thirds of gun fatalities in the United States are suicides—that’s 50 people every day dying by gun, accounting for half of all suicides. Suicide, commonly an act of extreme desperation, is highly impulsive in nature; people make decisions about suicide in less than an hour. And of those who attempt suicide and survive, only around 10 percent try again and succeed. The ready availability of an extremely lethal device is a recipe for disaster for people in crisis: Guns account for a small fraction of methods used to attempt suicide, but they are the most successful.

Limiting access to guns could have a profound impact on the suicide rate. There’s evidence to support this: Efforts like changing the formulation of domestic gas, adding suicide barriers at popular jumping sites, and regulating poisons have resulted in reductions in suicide. When a method isn’t available, it gives suicidal people time to stop, think, and seek help. Current Issue View our current issue

If the United States is deeply worried about gun deaths—and it should be—identifying an easy point of intervention should be highly appealing. Yet suicide rarely comes up in conversations about gun violence. A few simple measures would save lives, without stigmatizing mental illness or creating discriminatory legislation that might violate privacy, civil rights, and the autonomy of the mentally ill community. There’s no reason for suicide to be the 10th leading cause of death in the United States overall, and the second for people aged 10–34.

Background checks should keep guns out of the hands of people with a history of violence who clearly shouldn’t be owning them—as for example in the case of the man who gunned down 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017. A mental-health condition alone isn’t sufficient cause to blacklist someone. Neither is relying on a representative payee for Social Security. This program appoints people to manage finances for Social Security beneficiaries who can’t handle them on their own, and applies primarily to people with significant cognitive, intellectual, and developmental disabilities, not mentally ill people. Yet it was namechecked in Obama-era regulations that the GOP voted to roll back in 2017, leading to widespread outcry that Republicans were handing guns to “people too mentally ill to cash a check.”

That said, self-exclusion is certainly an option for people who worry that they can’t handle weapons responsibly. Research in 2016 found that many mentally ill people would be interested in the opportunity to add themselves to a “do not sell” list, fearing they might try to buy a gun in a moment of desperation and use it to commit suicide. Of 200 survey respondents receiving inpatient or outpatient psychiatric care, 46 percent said they’d like to be able to add their name to such a list, voluntarily flagging themselves so they’d fail a background check.

Requiring people to secure their firearms could also make a huge difference. Yet there’s no federal gun-storage or -locking law, leaving this issue up to the states. Proper storage keeps children from playing with guns—Everytown for Gun Safety identified nearly 300 “accidents” involving minors in 2017—but it can also prevent an impulsive decision on the part of someone who lives in a home with guns.

Waiting periods could be another powerful tool for reducing the availability of firearms for use in homicides as well as for people in crisis, as evidenced by a 2017 study that explored 45 years of data across 16 states and the District of Columbia. The researchers found drops in both homicide and suicide rates in states with waiting periods. To the dismay of gun proponents, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a challenge to California’s 10-day waiting period.

There are few, if any, settings in which someone needs to obtain a gun instantaneously. Enacting a waiting period might create a brief inconvenience for someone purchasing a gun for a legitimate purpose, like hunting, but it could also save a life: A suicidal person should not be able to walk into a gun shop, buy a weapon, and leave. Some states are already exploring experimental programs to get suicide-prevention training and materials into gun shops and ranges, creating another point of intervention, but blocking instant purchases could be highly effective.

It’s undeniable that the United States needs to take meaningful steps to prevent gun deaths. Rampage killings capture the bulk of the attention, but the use of guns in intimate-partner violence, unrelated homicides, and suicides should be cause for grave concern. While Congress continues to limit the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence thanks to the Dickey Amendment, there is enough information from other sources to understand that the guns/mental health narrative advanced in the media in the wake of mass shootings is wrong, stigmatizing, and ultimately unhelpful.

To meaningfully address gun violence, we need to reduce the number of weapons in circulation overall, and cut down on weapons sales to people likely to harm themselves or others. The trinity of universal background checks backed by better databases, waiting periods, and gun-storage laws could radically reduce gun violence in the United States. These are basic lifesaving measures akin to requiring people to wear seatbelts, and they’re not dependent on broadly stigmatizing 20 percent of the population.

Rather than demonizing mentally ill people for mass shootings, the United States should be talking about the real risk with guns and mental health: That it’s too easy for suicidal people to obtain guns to shoot themselves, leading to nearly 22,00 preventable deaths every year. Until the conversation about gun violence can be reframed onto actual, rather than mythological, risks, needless gun deaths will continue."

When Adam Lanza entered Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, inexplicably bent on ending as many lives as possible, he was carrying a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle and several high-capacity magazines. Although it is not clear yet where the AR-15 used by Lanza (which was registered to his mother) was purchased, the model is familiar to many shoppers at Walmart. It’s on sale at about 1,700 Walmart stores nationwide (though the retail chain pulled the weapon from its website early this afternoon), along with other guns of questionable use for duck hunting. Which other assault weapons can shoppers pick up at their Walmart?





Sig Sauer M400 semiautomatic assault rifle

The Sig Sauer M400 semiautomatic assault rifle is advertised on Walmart’s website as “designed for use in law enforcement, military operations…as well as competitive shooting.”



“Imagine my shock to see this rifle hanging in the gun case at my local store,” a Utah reviewer raved on the Walmart site. “I went back the next day to get it, alas, it was gone. No biggie, there’s always another Walmart within a couple dozen miles right? Two hours later I had one in hand.”





Semiautomatic Colt M4 OPS .22 rifle

Colt’s M4 Ops .22 rifle carries a thirty-round magazine, which you can also purchase at Walmart.





Colt LE6920 Carbine Semi-Auto Rifle, 223 Rem/5.56 NATO

This Colt semiautomatic rifle comes with high praise from one Walmart reviewer: “I am a former Marine and this is just the same as the M16 but for the AUTO, never used AUTO that much in the Marines anyway.” That’s reassuring.





Smith & Wesson 811030 MP1522 Rifle and Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun

When James Holmes killed twelve people and injured fifty-eight others in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater, he was carrying a Smith & Wesson M&P15 (another in the AR-15 class of weapons) and a Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun, along with two handguns.





Winchester 22LR Hollow Point Rounds, 555pk

There are also 381 types of ammunition listed on the Walmart web site. You can buy a 555-pack of Winchester hollow-point bullets, which the Walmart website advertises as “great for plinking and varmints,” but which would cause extensive damage should they enter a human body and expand, as they are designed to do.

Given that a hypothetical American, who is underage, has been convicted of a gun crime, has restraining orders out against him, and is on a terror watchlist could go online and have an assault rifle shipped to his door without incident, the US gun lobby seems to have its work cut out for it: simply blocking any action in Congress will perpetuate this madness. Ad Policy

President Obama issued executive orders Tuesday in an attempt to bypass this legislative stasis. The biggest piece is expanding the number of small private dealers who must obtain licenses to sell guns and then must perform background checks. He will also send more money to agencies conducting the background checks, increase mental-health funding, and make it easier for states to send mental-health information into the background-check system. Federal agencies will also fund more research into making guns safer.

These efforts have been widely praised by gun-control groups, and are probably the outer limit of what Obama can hope to achieve on guns while he is president. He doesn’t claim the changes will solve the country’s gun problem, and they won’t: They will mainly nibble at the edges. It may be harder to buy a gun from a private seller online, but it will remain far from impossible.

Obama likely knows, however, that he’s facing an increasingly serious situation. The gun lobby isn’t content to simply play defense, but has pressed a completely unashamed effort in courts and state legislatures across the country to further weaken America’s already anemic gun laws.

Would it be crazy in a country already seeing a spike in mass killings, many of them conducted with semi-automatic assault weapons, to allow fully automatic machines guns to flood the streets? Yes, but that’s the aim of dueling court cases working their way up the federal judiciary at the moment. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP!

In both Hollis vs. Lynch and Watson vs. Lynch, the plaintiffs are mounting an innovative challenge to federal laws that since 1986 have prohibited anyone from manufacturing fully automatic machine guns. (There are a relatively small number of pre-1986 machine guns still in existence, which one could obtain right now after a background check and an agreement to be monitored by federal authorities).* Working in tandem, Ryan Watson of Pennsylvania and Jay Lynch of Texas both applied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives for permits to manufacture fully automatic machine guns.

Both men made the application under the auspices of individual, unincorporated trusts. Their argument was simple: While the 1986 Gun Control Act forbids “persons” from possessing machine guns, Hollis and Lynch argued that the definition applied to actual people, corporations, or partnerships—but not trusts.

The ATF actually approved both applications, before declaring them a mistake almost immediately and subsequently revoking the approval. The two men mounted immediate court challenges, and made dueling claims: one, that unincorporated trusts should be allowed to legally manufacture machine guns, but also more broadly, that laws against machines guns passed in 1986 are fundamentally unconstitutional breaches of the individual right to bear arms.

(Watson added an additional Fifth Amendment claim to his suit because the ATF seized a machine gun he was able to manufacture in the brief period between when his application was approved and revoked, which he claimed was an undue denial of his right to property by the federal government.)

These concurrent challenges were no coincidence—they are both receiving financial backing and coordination from an array of pro-gun groups, including the Gun Owners of America, a group considered even more extreme than the National Rifle Association, and some of the same pro-gun groups who engineered the landmark Supreme Court decision in United States vs Heller that clarified an individual’s right to bear arms.

Neither case has so far been successful in a federal court, but these pro-gun groups have supplied money to keep the appeals going, and both cases are now at the federal appellate level. If the more narrow question of trusts owning machine guns is decided favorably for the plaintiffs, it’s possible people might be able to pay a few thousand dollars to a lawyer, form a trust, and manufacture machine guns—though Obama’s recent executive actions incidentally attempt to tighten the ATF definition of persons to include trusts, because people have also been forming trusts in order to transfer weapons with a mandated background check. It’s not yet clear how that would affect the claims in Hollis and Lynch.

But the big fish, in any case, is a court ruling that machine guns are “arms” just like handguns, and thus the federal government must allow their possession. The brief filed by Gun Owners of America in Watson argues that “Machine guns are not dangerous and unusual weapons, but rather the lineal descendants of founding-era firearms,” and specifically cites a passage in Heller that says “the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms.”

The case is a bit of a long shot: To succeed, it would probably have to reach the Supreme Court, and then find five justices willing to make some new law as to what is, and is not, a bearable arm.

Michael McLively, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks legal challenges to gun laws nationwide, told me that the chances for success were “pretty small,” though not impossible. He said Watson may have a better shot because his case has landed in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, which is generally more conservative. His group may file a brief in Watson’s case, which he said “has been on our radar for the past few months now.”

There is some unsettled law in Heller as it relates to machine guns, McLively said, though he isn’t too worried the courts will actually find them permissible. “The court didn’t come out and say that machine guns are outside scope of Second Amendment [in Heller], but they telegraphed that outcome,” he said.

Still, you can see why this is a shot worth taking for gun groups. There is a potential legal opening to exploit, and it can be done largely out of public view—while a congressional push to legalize machine guns would no doubt be met extremely poorly, this effort requires no voting and is being done largely out of public view.

And it’s far from the only challenge: McLively said his group has tracked over one-thousand Second Amendment challenges since the Heller decision in 2008, 94 percent of which have been unsuccessful. But with persistence and a seemingly unlimited amount of money, gun groups can keep chipping away.

The most dangerous cases involve whether the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms, elucidated in Heller, extends outside the home. Most courts have ruled that it applies only to conduct in the home, and thus various local restrictions on concealed or open-carry permits have been upheld. But two federal appeals courts have found the Second Amendment applies or likely applies outside the home—findings that, if cemented by the Supreme Court, could wash away a number of existing state restrictions on firearm possession in public places.

That would be unfortunate for the many states trying to keep some gun restrictions in place—but there are many others going in the opposite direction. Texas’s open-carry law just went into effect, meaning permitted citizens can have a gun strapped to their belt as they grocery shop or pick up their child from daycare. In fact, as The New York Times recently noted, the Texas legislature has a no-wait security line for people carrying licensed guns, while everyone else has to go through metal detectors.

And Texas isn’t alone in its absurdity. In 2015, Arkansas passed a law explicitly allowing guns in a locked car on the premises of K-12 schools and colleges, and Oklahoma allowed K-12 employees to carry guns at school functions. Florida said it was okay for everyone to carry unlicensed weapons in a declared state of emergency. Idaho permitted unlicensed firearms outside the limits of any city. (There are not many cities in Idaho.) Tennessee created concealed-carry permits that would last for a person’s lifetime.

All the while, American appetites for guns is growing. In December, after a string of mass shootings capped off by the carnage in San Bernadino, California, gun sales reached a post–Sandy Hook high point. Obama’s executive actions are creating some much-needed momentum in the opposite direction, but make no mistake—he’s swimming against an extremely strong current.

The following is a Q & A with Professor Garen Wintemute, Baker-Teret Chair of Violence Prevention, at the University of California at Davis medical school. Wintemute is one of the country’s leading experts on the public health theory of gun control. He has long argued that gun violence is equivalent to a medical epidemic, and that, as such, public health measures ought to be taken to counter its spread.



Sasha Abramsky: What happened in Connecticut last Friday was by some measures an appalling aberration; yet by other measures it was all too predictable. How can we understand this event as something more than an aberration? Ad Policy

Garen Wintemute: We may very much want to understand and to predict. But predicting exactly who and where and when and what the body count will be is simply impossible—because no two of these events are alike. And one of the great mistakes is trying to prevent the last one—because the next one will be different. But will there be another similar event, will there be another body count? That’s an absolute certainty. Firearms are readily available. We have created “global gunning,” much as we have created global warming. We have made a whole series of policy decisions that have made the widest possible array of firearms available to the widest possible array of people for use in the widest in the widest possible array of circumstances. And we are paying the price for those decisions; or, in this case, our children are paying it for us.

What can be done about this? You’ve got the issue of mental illness; the issue of gun control. You read about Syria’s chemical weapons, for example; they’re in a binary state—you need both elements to make them deadly. It’s the same thing here. You’ve got two elements. How do you stop them fusing?

We don’t know how big a role mental illness played here. But let’s step back; we have conversations like this at times when there’s been a mass murder, particularly of children, because we’re wired to see these catastrophes as salient events. But take Sandy Hook, Oak Creek, Aurora, Columbine, Virginia Tech, all of them together come to ninety-one dead. It’s awful. But we lose, on average, eighty-eight people every day to firearm violence in the United States, and we have more than 200 people every day injured seriously enough to go to the emergency department. You ask me what we do? The answer is first what we do not do is try to figure out a way simply to prevent mass shootings. That won’t work. The one option we might have had in the past is closed to us now. That’s the option Australia took; they got rid of high-capacity weapons. But we have nearly as many firearms in this country as we have people; our context is different. We could ban high-capacity magazines. That would be fine. But there are tens of millions of them already in circulation. What do we do about those? We could ban further sales of assault weapons. But we need to understand there are millions of those guns in circulation in the US already. Unless we are willing to recover those weapons, we are going to continue to pay the price for the decisions we have made over the last thirty to fifty years.

We need to have solutions that will make a difference in the presence of 300 million firearms. Our chance to emulate the model set by Britain and Australia and Canada is gone. The guns are here now. We all participated at one level or another in letting that happen. And we will continue to pay a price. But we can make a difference. We can make a dent, and that’s worth shooting for.

So we work to prevent firearm violence. We require a background check for all firearm purchases. Forty percent of gun sales in the US do not involve a background check. Number two, we improve the data on which those background checks are run, so somebody whose mental illness is known in one state, that mental illness is known in all states. Improving the mental health records database would help us identify seriously mentally ill people so that they can’t buy guns. The third thing I’d recommend is we expand the criteria we now use for denying the purchase and possession of firearms. For example, under federal law we do not ban people from purchasing firearms for alcohol abuse; it doesn’t matter how serious the abuse is. We don’t ban people from purchasing firearms who have long records of violent crimes when those crimes are misdemeanors. If I beat my partner, I am prohibited [from gun ownership] for life. If I beat you up, nothing happens; I can buy guns the next day.

After what happened in Connecticut, it’s at least possible that there will be a momentum to a conversation on gun control. If it’s to be done well, what should it involve?

Assault weapons play a disproportionate role in violence generally. If we’re going to go after assault weapons, we’ll need to do so in a more comprehensive way than we did before. The two signature pieces of violence prevention legislation in the last thirty years have been the Brady Act and assault weapons ban. The assault weapons ban was a great idea, it got watered down, and it’s been very difficult to show a beneficial effect. The Brady Act, denying the purchase of firearms to people who are prohibited, that’s been shown to be effective, but at the same time not to prevent firearms homicides; because 40 percent of gun sales are not subject to the Brady Act because they are made by private parties. If you think you’re going to fail a background check, you don’t waste your time with a dealer; you go to private parties.

We know they [universal background checks and expanded denial-of-purchase criteria] are feasible, effective, and at the political level we know they’re supported not just by the general population, but by gun owners and even NRA members. Poll after poll after poll on background checks and broadening denial criteria. Gun policy in the US does not reflect the priorities of gun owners, let alone the general public. It reflects the priorities of a radical fringe of gun owners."

Despite a sordid and deadly reputation in Iraq, the mercenary army that began as Blackwater and is now known as Academi was a top recipient of Pentagon contracts for training Afghanistan’s security forces from 2002 to 2014, a government watchdog reported Tuesday. Ad Policy

The latest report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) also includes the surprising disclosure that IBM—a company not generally known as a defense contractor—was the largest beneficiary of a Pentagon program to stabilize Afghanistan by facilitating private investment in its vast mineral wealth.

Both findings were included in a SIGAR report that attempts to account for $66 billion appropriated by Congress to the Department of Defense for Afghanistan reconstruction. Altogether, the government spent $104 billion between 2002 and 2014 for the program. The Pentagon issued the bulk of the contracts, and the rest came from the Department of State and the US Agency for International Development.

Of the $66 billion spent by the Pentagon, however, SIGAR said DoD could only report on $21 billion, or less than one-third of its total. It accounted for the huge “discrepancy” to differences in executing contracts between “DoD and Federal accounting systems.” The Pentagon was also “unable to provide” contract data from the pre-2010 time, SIGAR said.

In 12 years of war, the report says, Academi Training Center Inc. received $569 million in contracts, or 31.9 percent of the total, of the Pentagon’s $1.8 billion Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities Fund for Afghanistan. The program, known as “DOD CN,” was designed to stabilize Afghanistan by training the country’s security forces to support military operations against drug traffickers and other armed groups.

The total puts Academi, which acquired Blackwater in 2011, far ahead of the Pentagon’s top contractors, including Northrop Grumman, CACI, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, all of which obtained multi-million dollar contracts under DOD CN.

Through two subsidiaries, Northrop Grumman received $363 million, which included “support to Afghan air capability,” SIGAR said.

(Correction: SIGAR contacted reporters after posting its report to say that it had miscalculated its contract totals and concluded that Blackwater/Academi was actually the second-largest Pentagon contractor for its Afghanistan training program. Northrop Grumman was the largest—see the update below.)

CACI, the intelligence contractor best known as the supplier of private interrogators at the US military prison in Abu Ghraib, received $248 million; Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest military contractor, won $195 million in contracts; and Raytheon Technical Services $88 million, the report said.

The awards to Blackwater and Academi were made despite the public condemnation of the company for its brutal tactics in Iraq. Those tactics were symbolized by the 2014 murder and manslaughter convictions of four Blackwater security guards for their roles in a deadly 2007 massacre at Baghdad’s Nisour Square that killed 17 and injured 14 unarmed civilians. That incident “marked a bloody nadir in America’s war in Iraq,” the New York Times reported at the time.

The trial was an epilogue to the story of Blackwater, which began as a police- and military-training facility in North Carolina and came to symbolize the country’s outsourcing of its wartime responsibilities. About 1,000 of Blackwater’s contractors guarded diplomats in Iraq. Others loaded bombs onto Predator drones. The company’s founder, Erik Prince, tapped retired Central Intelligence Agency officials for executive positions, and at one point, the C.I.A. hired Blackwater contractors to covertly track and kill Qaeda operatives worldwide, a program that was shelved before any killings were conducted.

Prince, who gained his notoriety in part from Jeremy Scahill’s 2007 book, Blackwater: The Rise of the World’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army, left the company five years ago. But he’s still seeking opportunities abroad as a kind of mercenary-consultant for foreign governments under the rubric of the Frontier Resources Group, a private equity fund based in the Cayman Islands that focuses on Africa.

In 2013, according to a recent story by Aram Roston in Buzzfeed, Prince met with the former president of Nigeria and proposed to “assemble a well-trained fighting force of non-Nigerians to battle Boko Haram,” the Islamist army that’s been terrorizing much of the country. In October 2014, he proposed that the United States use private contractors—presumably people on his payroll—to fight the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

“If the old Blackwater team were still together, I have high confidence that a multi-brigade-size unit of veteran American contractors or a multi-national force could be rapidly assembled and deployed to be that necessary ground combat team,” he wrote.

Ironically, the SIGAR report comes one day after three of the guards convicted for manslaughter asked a federal judge for leniency in their case, arguing that “a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 30 years is unconstitutionally harsh,” according to the Washington Post. The four former Blackwater defendants are scheduled to be sentenced later this month.

The $65 million appropriated to IBM was about 9 percent of the total spent by the Pentagon for a controversial project designed to convince foreign investors and mining companies to develop Afghanistan’s extensive mineral wealth. As I reported here in February on a contractor called Praetorian Standard:

The program, run by a Department of Defense Task Force for Business Stability Operations with the US Army’s Corp of Engineers, was first described by New York Times reporter James Risen in 2010. At the time, Afghan officials estimated that their deposits of copper, gold, lithium and other minerals could be worth as much as $3 trillion… In December 2014, the special inspector general began what he called a “full-court press” to determine how the Pentagon mismanaged its Business Task Force in Afghanistan. “They’ve spent approximately $700, $800 million, and as far as we can see, they’ve accomplished nothing,” SIGAR John Sopko wrote in a letter to [then] Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel detailing the corruption.

According to the latest SIGAR report, the task force spent a total of $696 million between 2010 and 2013 (it ceased operations at the end of fiscal year 2014). Of that, IBM received $65 million in obligations, or over nine percent. “IBM implemented projects designed to foster the use of information technology in order to bolster the Afghan economy,” SIGAR said.

Other US contractors identified in the SIGAR report include Navistar Defense, DynCorp International, Triple Canopy and Textron Marine & Defense.

Overall, the two largest recipients of the Pentagon’s reconstruction program were Asia Global Shipping Group and the Parwan Group. Both are Afghan logistics companies that provided transportation, building supplies and fuel to the Afghan National Security Forces. AGS received close to $1.8 billion and Parwan about $1.4 billion.

Blackwater/Academi’s total of $569 million places the mercenary at number five on the contract total. Not bad for a company responsible for so much murder and mayhem.

UPDATE: On April 2, SIGAR posted an updated report with the following corrections to its fact sheet:

*In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported $1.8 billion in DOD CN obligations. The correct reported total obligation is $1.5 billion.

**In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported that Northrop Grumman and its associated companies had received $363 million in total awards. The correct total obligation amount is $325 million.

***In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported that Northrop Grumman and its associated companies received the second-largest amount of total DOD CN obligations. The company was in fact the top recipient of DOD CN obligations.

****In the initial published version of this fact sheet, SIGAR reported that Academi Training Center, Incorporated had received $569 million in total DOD CN obligations and that Academi Training Center, Incorporated was the top recipient of DOD CN awards. The correct number of total awards is $309 million and Academi Training Center, Incorporated is the recipient of the second largest number of total rewards."

Listings for semi-automatic rifles on the popular online gun website Armslist.com, September 27, 2013. Ad Policy

Last October, while most of the country was obsessed with the presidential election only a week away, Radcliffe Haughton walked into a Wisconsin spa with an entirely different obsession. Earlier in the month, Zina Daniel, his estranged wife, obtained a restraining order against him after a long history of domestic abuse and stalking. She worked at the spa, and he had visited before—seventeen days prior, he slashed her car’s tires in the parking lot outside.

But now he came with more than a knife: Haughton had a .40 caliber semi-automatic Glock handgun with him. Immediately upon entering the store, he shot Zina dead—and then murdered one of her co-workers, and then another. He continued shooting, and four other people were wounded before he finally turned the gun on himself.

The judge’s restraining order specifically forbade Haughton from buying a gun, and had he gone to any licensed firearms dealer, he presumably would have been denied. Instead, Haugton went to the increasingly popular Armslist.com, where tens of thousands of guns are up for sale, and where the vast majority of the sellers are private citizens. Within days he had the Glock.

Armslist.com is only a part of the online gun marketplace, but it is a big part—there were almost 100,000 listings on the site in August. The site, and many others like it, went from being virtually unknown to hugely popular in a matter of months, as other mainstream online retail markets, like Craigslist, cracked down on gun listings:



Courtesy Mayors Against Illegal Guns

A new study by Mayors Against Illegal Guns has revealed that every thirtieth gun sold on Armslist.com was sold to someone who would have failed a background check. Of 607 would-be buyers in the sample, which stretched from February to May of this year, 3.3 percent were sold to someone who committed a crime that prohibited firearm possession under federal law.

That ratio is many magnitudes higher than the one for licensed gun dealers—based on the rate of background check denials, only 0.87 percent of would-be buyers at licensed dealers are prohibited purchasers. The report gives a troubling analogy for the Armslist.com marketplace: if one in every thirty passengers on a Boeing 747 were on the federal terror watch list, there would be twenty-two suspected terrorists on board.

And in fact, the ratio is likely much higher. Mayors Against Illegal Guns had a relatively simple methodology—the group examined 13,000 “want-to-buy” ads where the buyer entered a name and contact information, and then compared that information to publicly available criminal records.

So the one-in-thirty result is almost definitely an undercount, because it doesn’t include people who are precluded from gun ownership for other reasons: serious mental illness, immigration status, a history of drug abuse or other non-criminal criteria.

But more notably, only 5 percent of the people who place “want-to-buy” ads on Armslist.com disclose their name and contact information. So one could fairly assume that among the people who choose anonymity, the ratio of prohibited buyers is higher. The analysis also doesn’t, and couldn’t, take into account the people who simply respond to the sellers’ ads directly—another likely approach if someone knows they can’t buy a gun legally.

And again, Armslist.com is only one part of the huge online gun marketplace; Mayors Against Illegal Guns is just scratching the surface here. But other investigations have borne similar results. In 2011, investigators working for New York City called 125 sellers in fourteen states advertising on ten different websites, including Armslist.com. The investigators plainly said they were unlikely to pass a background check—and 62 percent of the sellers agreed to transfer a weapon anyway. On Armslist.com the rate was 54 percent.

These are exactly the kinds of sales the Manchin-Toomey gun legislation that failed in the Senate earlier this year was designed to stop. Under that bill—which 90 percent of the public supported—a background check would be applied almost universally, including, crucially, for online sales.

“Loopholes in our federal gun laws have taken a devastating toll on communities and neighborhoods across America. Yet in April, a minority of US senators blocked the common-sense legislation that would have closed these deadly loopholes,” said Boston Mayor Thomas Menino when the study was released. (He is a co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.) “It’s time for our leaders in Washington to put public safety first and pass sensible gun laws that will help save lives.”

The common refrain from pro-gun activists is that criminals will avoid background checks anyway—which, as this study shows, is true. But maybe we shouldn’t make it so easy for them.

When Adam Lanza entered Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, December 14, inexplicably bent on ending as many lives as possible, he was carrying a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle and several high-capacity magazines. Sadly, this isn’t the first time the country has had to deal with the aftermath of a horrific shooting spree, nor is it the first time we’ve encountered an AR-15 in this context: only days earlier, it was the weapon of choice for a shooting at an Oregon mall that killed two people. Five months earlier, it was used by James Holmes in an attack that wounded fifty-eight people and killed twelve in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. And several years before that, a man and his teenage accomplice used a Bushmaster AR-15 to terrorize the Washington, DC, area with a series of random shootings. Ad Policy

Although it is not yet clear where the Bushmaster AR-15 used by Lanza (and registered to his mother) was purchased, the model is familiar to many Walmart shoppers. It’s on sale at about 1,700 Walmart stores nationwide, though the retail chain pulled the weapon from its website three days after the attack. While the deadly rampage in Connecticut has finally and unmistakably highlighted the madness of making such weapons readily available, it’s a concern that many people with a Walmart in their community have been trying to address for years. Several months back, the Rev. Greg Brown had a troubling conversation with two members of his youth group from the northwest side of South Bend, Indiana. “They were honor roll students and little young folks that love the Lord,” Brown recounted. “One of the kids came up to me and said, ‘Rev, you ain’t gonna believe what happened the other day at Walmart.’” The kids went on to describe how, on a recent visit to the big-box store, a man asked them to fill up a gym bag with ammunition and sneak it out of the store for him. They declined.

Walmart’s ammunition sales have troubled Brown since at least 2009, when two teenagers shoplifted bullets from the local Walmart, shot at an employee who tried to stop them in the parking lot, and then embarked on a citywide robbery spree in which one man was seriously injured. When Brown headed down to the store to see how easy it would be to steal ammunition, he was shocked. Not only were there bullets arrayed on the unlocked shelves; there were rows of guns as well, including assault rifles.

South Bend has the most violent crime per capita in Indiana and well more than double the national median. Brown was outraged that Walmart was even selling these weapons, let alone that they were unlocked and under the supervision of hourly employees without specific training in firearm handling and sales. (Brown says a former Marine handles the gun sales at a nearby Dick’s Sporting Goods.) “It’s totally wrong, and it’s totally unacceptable,” he said. “You look back there and see a dad holding a gun, his son pulling on his pocket. And the son knows the gun is going home. The son’s going to know where the gun is.”

South Bend isn’t the only place where Walmart is stocking guns, including combat-style weapons and gun-related paraphernalia. The big-box chain at one point sold guns in only about a third of its stores, mainly in remote rural areas where hunting is popular. But in 2011, without much fanfare, Walmart expanded gun sales to about half of its 3,982 stores nationwide, including those in more urban areas like Albuquerque and Spokane.

The expansion of gun sales at Walmart came after a five-year slowdown. In 2006, the chain announced that it was rolling back gun sales, citing declining profit margins on the relatively expensive weapons, which even at Walmart can retail for hundreds of dollars. But in 2011, company executives were looking at eight straight quarters of declining sales at stores open for a year or more—the worst slump in Walmart’s history.

They must also have noticed that Barack Obama’s inauguration had sparked a rally in gun sales, which have steadily increased every year since 2008. The government isn’t allowed to track firearm sales, but the FBI does release figures on how many retailers ask it to run background checks—a relatively reliable indicator of total gun sales, although likely a lowball estimate, since a person can buy multiple guns on a single background check, and many gun shows aren’t required to perform such checks. In 2007, retailers asked the FBI for just over 11 million background checks; by the end of 2009, 14 million checks were requested—a 27 percent increase.

In April 2011, Walmart began stocking guns in more and more stores, expanding the sales to 1,750 outlets nationwide. By the end of that year, the FBI received 16.4 million background check requests; the number is 16.8 million this year. Overall Walmart sales figures are back on track after the 2011 slump, and executive vice president Duncan Mac Naughton told shareholders at a meeting in October 2012 that gun sales in particular are a staple of the chain’s strategy to continue boosting its numbers. He said that over the past twenty-six months, gun sales at Walmart stores open for a year or more were up an astonishing 76 percent, while ammunition sales were up 30 percent. Walmart is now the biggest seller of firearms and ammunition in America.

“This gun thing, it’s really just a nightmare,” says Bertha Lewis, president of the Black Institute, which has been organizing Walmart workers this year to protest wages and working conditions. Given its aggressive gun sales, Walmart’s logo “shouldn’t be a smiley face; it should be an automatic weapon,” she adds.

* * *

Nearly 400 guns are available in Walmart’s catalog. And even if your local store doesn’t sell a particular model, you can special-order it (assuming you pay half the cost ahead of time). With the exception of its stores in Alaska, Walmart doesn’t sell handguns, though it does sell ammunition for them, along with a wide variety of semi-automatic long-barrel weapons. For example, at half the Walmarts in America, you can buy a semiautomatic Colt M4 Ops .22 rifle; it carries a thirty-round magazine, which you can also purchase in the store. Or perhaps a Sig Sauer M400 assault rifle, advertised on Walmart’s website as “designed for use in law enforcement, military operations…as well as competitive shooting,” which is just one of several AR-15 assault rifles for sale.

In keeping with the store’s pitch as a one-stop destination for shoppers, with everything from gas to groceries, gun enthusiasts can also obtain a wide range of gun accessories—including the 360 types of ammunition listed on Walmart’s website. You can buy a 555-pack of Winchester hollow-point bullets, which the website advertises as “great for plinking and varmints,” but which would cause extensive damage should they enter a human body and expand, as they are designed to do. There are full clips of ammunition for assault rifles, including “quiet ammo” that makes only a quarter of the noise of regular bullets. Laser-pointing sights for handguns are also available, as well as belts for holding shotgun shells (only $4.97 at select stores).

Walmart, which declined to comment for this story, has said elsewhere that its stores will always respect local laws and ordinances on gun sales. But in 2005, Walmart was busted by Bill Lockyer, then the California attorney general, for thousands of state gun law violations—including selling to people that the AG’s office had notified Walmart were prohibited from owning firearms; delivering guns to customers before they passed a background check; and sometimes even failing to ascertain a customer’s identity. The company settled the suit for $14.5 million.

And, of course, Walmart has contributed to efforts to change state gun laws and make the possession and use of firearms even easier. It was one of the key backers of the American Legislative Exchange Council when the group aggressively pushed “stand your ground” laws in states across the country. (Walmart has since dropped out of ALEC under public pressure.)

In 2008, the store reached an agreement with Mayors Against Illegal Guns to adopt tough new standards for sales above the federal requirements for gun retailers. But even if every regulation is adhered to, the mass sale of weapons and ammunition will undoubtedly contribute to this country’s horrifying gun violence problem.

In fact, Walmart is increasingly popping up in court documents. In 2011, on the morning that he killed six people, including a federal judge, and injured thirteen others, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Jared Lee Loughner went to two Walmarts in Tucson in search of ammunition. He was turned away at one store for “strange behavior,” according to police, but got what he was looking for at the next Walmart. (“We share in the sadness for those people whose lives were ended too soon,” the store said in a statement at the time.)

In November, a disturbed 20-year-old in Missouri was arrested for planning mass shootings at a screening of the new Twilight movie and at the local Walmart—the latter because he could reload there. “He decided that he would go and shoot people at Walmart in Bolivar,” according to the court documents. “He would walk into the store and just start shooting people at random and if he ran out of ammunition…he would just break the glass where the ammunition is being stored and get some more and keep on shooting until police arrived.”

Local news reports are rife with stories of gun thefts at Walmart stores, often apparently because of lax oversight of the weapons inventory. In October, a man and a woman cracked open a display case at a Walmart store in Tyler, Texas, “while a clerk wasn’t looking,” according to local reports, and stole four assault rifles. The two have yet to be apprehended.

A week earlier, at a Walmart in Missoula County, Montana, a clerk was showing a Sig Sauer semiautomatic rifle to a man who then “grabbed it and ran for the store’s entrance,” according to the charging documents. The police nabbed him a short time later, after he had tossed the AR-15 from his car. In early November, police in Summerville, South Carolina, were on the lookout for suspects in incidents at two separate Walmarts, where display cases had been smashed with a hammer and the AR-15s and other assault rifles inside them stolen. And these are just a few of the incidents involving guns or ammunition at Walmart in the past two months. Since the start of 2012, there have been at least fifty shootings in a Walmart store or parking lot, incidents tracked on a blog called Walmart Shootings (walmartshootings.blogspot.com).

The possibility that South Bend could end up on that list once again is what has the Reverend Brown so alarmed. For forty-eight years, he has lived with his mother, Bertha, a retired schoolteacher, in a house less than a mile from a Walmart. The neighborhood is a rough one, and he’s seen it get worse; Brown said that the locals sometimes call it Babylon, “because ain’t nothing righteous.”

Bertha, who has lived in South Bend for sixty-five years, says the violence is the worst she’s ever seen. “It’s real sad, because we’ve got a lot of young people, and people are getting killed—every time you look, someone is getting shot,” she says. “Every time you pick up the paper…. I don’t know who’s doing it, and they can’t seem to catch these people, but the guns are out there.”

For four months last summer, Reverend Brown’s prayer group, nicknamed the God Squad, walked around town sticking three strips of tape (symbolizing the Father, Son and Holy Spirit) with anti-violence messages onto telephone poles. The group was “praying that we could cease the violence, cease the drama. And it worked in some areas,” Brown said. “But I’m going to be honest with you: we’re at an all-time high.”

So when he saw the weapons for sale at Walmart, Brown took action. He called the chief of police and members of the City Council, who in turn applied pressure on local Walmart managers. In response, the chain promised the city in writing, in June, that it would no longer sell assault weapons in South Bend.

Brown thought the problem was solved. Then, this past fall, his phone rang: “I had a parent call me and say, ‘Mr. Brown, they’re selling them.’” He went back to Walmart, and indeed, the weapons were still on display—without much in the way of security. “I saw the glass unsecured,” Brown said. “The employee who worked there said, ‘I only work part-time back here.’ He opened the glass…. This guy left the cabinet open and walked away.”

This time, Brown came prepared: he’d brought a police officer and a reporter for the local ABC station with him. They took pictures, and the reporter did a story that made waves in South Bend. Walmart apologized and promised to fix the error.

A month later, Brown said he’d heard from a police officer that the combat-style weapons were being sold inside the packed store on Black Friday. He said he’ll keep up the fight and plans to visit the City Council again to ask for tougher action. “I’m not against guns; I’m not trying to go against the NRA,” Brown said. “But I’m against the way they sell them. You can go in Walmart at 3:30 in the morning and you can’t buy a can of beer. But you can walk in there to the ammunition [counter] and buy as many boxes as you want. I have a problem with that.”

Other anti-violence activists are disturbed by Walmart’s ballyhooed expansion into urban markets like Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles, Reno, Detroit and other cities. That, combined with the increased gun sales, could be a recipe for disaster.

The chain says it won’t sell guns at those stores—a condition of approval for a new Walmart in Washington, DC—but Bertha Lewis is wary. Even if that turns out to be true, the guns are likely to be sold at a Walmart somewhere else in the area. “Guns are a scourge in black and brown and low- and moderate-income communities,” Lewis said. “And here comes Walmart with Mr. Smiley Face: ‘Here, here’s a $5 sweater—and, oh, by the way, you can get this gun.’”

Lewis thinks the gun sales will soon be a new front in the activist campaign against Walmart. “You’re going to see it more and more and more as folks organize against Walmart,” she said. “One of their vulnerabilities is their stance on guns. Don’t try to sell me an apple and a gun at the same time. Don’t tell me that you’re trying to give fresh fruit and vegetables to people so that they can have a healthy life, and then you turn around and on the next counter you have instruments of death.”

Also in this issue, the editors say nothing like the Newtown massacre ever needs to happen again and Katherine S. Newman examines “The Roots of a Rampage.”"

On Sunday morning, the president of the United States humiliated his secretary of state, derided diplomacy as “wasting time,” mocked North Korea’s national leader as “Little Rocket Man,” and renewed his macho threat to “do what needs to be done” to thwart North Korea’s nuclear program—at the UN last month he said he might “need” to “destroy” the country. As always, analysts struggled to make sense of Trump’s tweets—geopolitically, psychologically—but the conclusion seemed inescapable that he is itching for a military conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary. Ad Policy

On Sunday night, a 64-year-old retiree by the name of Stephen Paddock took at least 10 rifles, some of them semi-automatic or automatic weapons, to the 32nd floor of the gilded Mandalay Bay resort casino, and gunned down hundreds of people, killing at least 50, in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Paddock shot his prey from up high and watched them scatter, like ants, like animals. There is no connection between Trump’s threat and Paddock’s massacre, except a profound lack of empathy, a toxic male willingness to indulge grievances (we don’t yet know Paddock’s, but we soon will) with violence, and an obsession with the display of absolute power.

Maybe it’s because I went to bed fearing a war, even a nuclear conflict, with North Korea, and woke up to random bloody gun terror at a country-music concert in Las Vegas that I see the two tragedies as entwined. There is something deeply wrong with the American male identification of guns as a symbol of freedom. We need to translate that correctly: By this definition, it is the capacity for brutal violence that is also a symbol, maybe even a prerequisite, of freedom. Of almost strictly male freedom, we must emphasize. This set of values wasn’t invented by the madman in the White House; he is just a symptom of a country and an electorate that value guns over children’s lives. On social media today I saw a heartbreaking impotence among many pundits and political activists, repeatedly expressed this way: If we didn’t do something to regulate guns, especially automatic weapons, after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre—in which 20 first-graders and six school staffers were murdered—we’ll never do anything. I don’t share that point of view, but I understand it.

Once again, the National Rifle Association has blood on its hands. At one time a respectable organization of gun owners promoting proper gun use and gun safety, three decades ago the NRA began to turn itself into a trade association for big gun manufacturers, and a purveyor of canny right-wing paranoia designed to spur gun sales. In the 1990s, as right-wing anti-government zealots began a backlash against what they perceived as a Democratic administration intent on taking their guns and their freedom, the NRA channeled that paranoia. Even after the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 by government-hating extremists, NRA head Wayne La Pierre was describing Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents as “jackbooted government thugs” in a fundraising letter. Guns went from being something used to hunt or—perhaps, in a rare event—to protect oneself and one’s family, to being a symbol of individual sovereignty and freedom from control of government. The Obama administration was a great gift to the NRA; gun and bullet purchases soared after the election of our first black president. Nonetheless, the NRA spent $30 million to elect Trump, who spoke at its national convention and praised LaPierre as a patriot.

Trump repaid the NRA’s investment by signing a bill that lifted Obama-era limits on gun sales to the mentally ill. Yet, with the departure of the Obama administration, gun sales have sagged; the first black president is no longer around to take your guns, and the NRA-loving Trump is in the White House, so maybe it’s safe to stop hoarding guns? Not so fast, said the NRA. In a despicable propaganda video earlier this year, NRA cheerleader Dana Loesch spun a lurid tale of Black Lives Matters protesters and Women’s Marchers as the latest threat to guns and, yes, freedom. Hollywood liberals, the fake-news media, as well as an ex-president (you know whom they mean) are painting Trump as an illegitimate “Hitler.” Only the NRA—and, yes, more guns—can protect your freedom.

On Monday morning, Trump again repaid the NRA’s $30 million investment with a pathetically passive statement that described the Las Vegas massacre as though it were a natural disaster, never once mentioning the weapons of hell that caused it. He called it “an act of pure evil,” extolled the bravery of police and first responders, and made appeals for love, prayers, and unity. He displayed his trademark lack of empathy about the victims’ families: “We cannot fathom their pain or imagine their loss.” What a strange thing to say: Many of us can, and if we can’t, it’s our human responsibility to try, to bear witness. If we really can’t fathom their pain or loss, we don’t have to do anything about it.

Sadly, we are unlikely to do anything about it. In the wake of the murders, gun stocks are soaring, anticipating a rise in gun sales as the result of a possible move to restrict firearms such as used to be routine after a bloody spree like this one. I don’t think the gun industry has much to worry about. I hope to be proven wrong. Nevada has among the most lax gun laws in the country, with no limits on the number of firearms one can own, no requirement of registration, no limits on automatic weapons. The dead suspect’s brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters: “Find out who sold him the machine gun!” Will any Nevada lawmaker be brave enough to make that an issue?

This morning, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Trump still planned to visit Puerto Rico this week. That’s good—there’s plenty he could do to help the storm-ravaged island. One easy helpful move would be to shut down his Twitter attacks on San Juan Mayor Carmen Cruz and on the people of Puerto Rico as lazy. With reports over the weekend that the commonwealth’s morgues are filling up, there may well have been more than 50 deaths last night there. But their slow-motion tragedy has been nearly blasted out of the news by this cruel assault on people Trump more easily sees as real Americans.

President Obama used to use these occasions, which hit him all too frequently in his eight years, to search for ways to prevent future tragedies, usually ideas for gun-safety legislation and mental-health funding. In his brief remarks Monday, Trump did nothing of the kind. He seemed to warn against “searching for some kind of meaning; the answers do not come easy.” I preferred the response to the massacre that came from Senator Chris Murphy, who represents Newtown, Connecticut: “It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.”

We’ll see, but I’m not optimistic. The president rode a wave of white male paranoia and perceived lost power to the White House; the GOP has stoked those emotions for 50 years. It’s hard to imagine this president, or this Congress, begin to unravel the connections they’ve woven between masculinity, power, guns, and violence. The best short-term outcome I can see? Trump may be too busy to tweet insults and up the likelihood of war with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un."

We have been here before and we will find ourselves here again. The extrajudicial killing of black people like 12-year-old Tamir Rice is not new, and neither is the fact that Timothy Loehmann, the officer who killed him, will not face any criminal charges. Our recent history with Darren Wilson and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Daniel Pantaleo and Eric Garner in New York, and the mysterious death of Sandra Bland in Walter County, Texas, show us how little to expect for black lives in the current “justice” system. Ad Policy

The killing of Tamir Rice felt like it could have been different. He was a 12-year-old shot in broad daylight while playing with a toy gun. That much was surmised, or at least hypothesized, by the person who made the initial 911 call. But somehow, that information didn’t make it to the officers who responded to the call, Loehmann and Frank Garmback, and when they arrived to the scene Loehmann opened fire within two seconds. They later claimed that Tamir had ignored their repeated commands to drop the (toy) weapon, but video that surfaced shows them acting more swiftly than their accounts of the shooting would have you believe—too swiftly to have assessed any threat, to make any commands, or made any good-faith attempt at de-escalation. It was the video, that damning piece of evidence, that was supposed to make this time different—the video we didn’t have when Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. The police are not afraid of cameras because the cameras only capture the police doing their jobs.

We had video when Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner, and that didn’t make a difference. But maybe Tamir, a child, would be a more sympathetic victim than the 53-year-old Garner, who was accused of the vicious crime of selling loose cigarettes. Tamir was a child playing in the park.

But black children aren’t children, as we were reminded after the McKinney, Texas, pool-party incident, where officers assaulted a black girl wearing a bathing suit, and the assault on a 16-year-old Spring Valley High School student in South Carolina. Black children are assumed latent criminals with violent intentions. Tamir was big for his age and therefore perceived as older, we are told, and should have known as much before playing with his toy gun in a public space. Then again, Ohio is a state where it is legal for an adult to carry a firearm openly, so what grounds, then, did the police have for shooting him?

And what to make of Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty’s declining to indict Loehmann and Garmback, and, in the words of Samaria Rice, Tamir’s mother, acting “like the police officers’ defense attorney” by suggesting to the grand jury that no charges be brought against them? What does it mean when those charged with upholding the law interpret the law in a way that leads no one being held accountable for the death of a 12-year-old black child? How could anyone look at that video and draw any other conclusion than the legal definition of murder?

The video didn’t matter to McGinty, because killing black people is not a crime. The police are not afraid of cameras, because the cameras only capture the police doing their jobs. “Serve and protect,” as popularly understood, is a myth. For the police, to serve means to use violence, including lethal force, at their discretion at any time, and to protect means to validate the threat of blackness born of the racist imagination. They are not meant to deter or prevent crime; the police exist to violently reinforce the status quo of white supremacy and economic degradation. Killing black people is not a crime. Instead, it is the basis of American identity. Related Article How Can No One Be to Blame for Tamir Rice’s Death? Dani McClain

Every now and then, the system surprises us, as in the case of former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, recently convicted on four counts of rape after assaulting 13 black women. It’s these moments that are suppose to inspire hope that the system can be tinkered with and reformed, that we can find justice for black lives within the current structure. But this is the exception. More often, “justice” looks like non-indictments in the death of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, and Tamir Rice. It looks like a year to bring charges against Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke in the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, or a hung jury in the case of William Porter, the first officer to go to trial for the death of Freddie Gray. More often than not, “justice” looks like black people being killed by police with no headlines or hashtags. It is the routine killing of black people by the state with no chance for accountability.

When indictments and charges and convictions do come down, it feels like a moment to rejoice. This system has never accounted for black people as citizens, so on the rare occasion that it does, there is some relief. But that relief is tempered by the fact that killings and beatings will continue, no matter the consequences for a select few officers, because the job of the police has not changed. We still call on them to “serve and protect”—to arrest and kill—because every black child is seen as latent criminal with violent intentions. We are still delusional about the role police can play in curbing violence. We still think that 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, who was killed when cops responded to a domestic disturbance call in Chicago last weekend, deserved to die, and that 55-year-old Bettie Jones’s death in the same incident was an “accident.” We think Tamir Rice’s being big for his age is enough of a justification for the bullet that killed him.

We have been here before and, unless white people decide that black lives are more valuable than the American identity built on violence toward blackness, we will find ourselves here again. Until then, the police will do their jobs, the cameras will capture it, and everyone will go about their business."

While I write this dispatch, I’m waiting patiently for the next set of dispiriting killings in this country. And I have faith. Before I’m done, some angry—or simply mentally disturbed—and well-armed American “lone wolf” (or lone wolves) will gun down someone (or a number of people) somewhere and possibly himself (or themselves) as well. Count on that. It’ll be my last paragraph. Think of it as, in a grim way, something to look forward to as you read this piece on American armed mayhem.

National security officials and politicians have been pounding home the message that the “greatest threat” to Americans is an extreme and brutal jihadist movement thousands of miles away and the videos and social media messages its followers produce that make it seem close at hand. With that in mind, let’s take a look at a few of the dangers of armed life in these United States, a quick survey of national insecurity in a country armed to the teeth.

I’m sure you won’t be surprised to learn that, in the first half of 2015, there’s been a plethora of incidents to draw on. There’s the killer still on the loose in northern Colorado who shot at people in cars or out biking or walking late at night. There’s the suspected serial killer who dumped seven bodies behind a strip mall in New Britain, Connecticut, and may now be in jail on unrelated charges. There’s the ongoing trial of James Holmes who blew away 12 moviegoers and wounded 70 in a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012. There was the mass killing of seven people in February in the tiny town of Tyrone, Missouri, by Joseph Aldridge, an armed recluse who then killed himself. And don’t forget Sudheer Khamitkar, who shot to death his wife and two young sons and then himself in Tulsa in April, or Christopher Carrillo, who murdered four of his family members and then turned his gun on himself in a Tucson home in May. And many others.

In such a list, there should be a special place for a phenomenon that, though largely untabulated, has been gaining attention in recent years as ever more Americans “carry” in ever more places. This means ever more loose guns lying around. I’m talking about the mayhem committed by toddlers (or perhaps they should be thought of as American lone wolf cubs). Toddler shootings range from the 2-year-old who killed his mother in a Walmart in Idaho with the gun she was packing in her purse as 2014 ended to the 3-year-old who discovered a gun in a purse in an Albuquerque motel room in February and wounded his father and pregnant mother with a single shot. Such a list for this year would have to include the Florida 2-year-old who found his father’s gun in the family car and killed himself with it in January, the 3-year-old who picked up an unattended gun and killed a 1-year-old in a Cleveland home in April, the Virginia 2-year-old who found a gun on top of a dresser and killed himself in late May, and the 4-year-old who, at about the same time in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, picked up a shotgun at a target shooting range and killed his 22-year-old uncle. Toddler killings have been commonplace enough in these pistol-packin’ years that they now significantly outpace terror killings in the United States. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED.

The Big Leagues of Violence

While we’re at it (before we get to the really big stuff), there is the crew I think of as American-style suicide killers. They lack a political or religious ideology like the suicide bombers of the Middle East, but they are on missions for which killing yourself as well as others is the imagined end. Think of them as informal American jihadis, in touch with no ISIS social media types, watching no inflammatory terror videos, but all riled up anyway, often deeply disturbed, armed, and on suicide missions in the American homeland.

Moving on to bigger things, one kind of killing has been much in the news of late: police shootings. The figures the FBI has traditionally compiled on them have proven to be way too low, so others have entered the fray. The Washington Post, for instance, recently began compiling a database of “every fatal shooting by police” in the United States in 2015 (deaths by Taser not included). Their figure so far: at least 385 for the first five months of 2015 or approximately one of every 13 non-suicide gun deaths so far this year.

“About half the victims,” the Post reports, “were white, half minority. But the demographics shifted sharply among the unarmed victims, two-thirds of whom were black or Hispanic. Overall, blacks were killed at three times the rate of whites or other minorities when adjusting by the population of the census tracts where the shootings occurred.” A Guardian study adds this detail: “Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people.”

According to The Guardian, a recent Bureau of Justice report found that over the last eight years an average of 928 Americans have died annually at the hands of the police. (FBI figures: only 383.) In other words in those years, there were 7,427 police homicides, the equivalent of more than two 9/11s. Compared to other developed countries, these figures are staggering. There were, for instance, more fatal police shootings in the United States in the month of March 2015 (97) than Australia had between 1992 and 2011 (94). Similarly, there have been almost three times as many police shootings in California alone in 2015 (72) as Canada experiences annually (25).

And when it comes to armed dangers in a country in which there are estimated to be between 270 and 310 million guns or, on average, nearly one firearm for every man, woman, and child, we haven’t even made it to the major leagues of death yet. Take, for instance, suicide by gun. In the last year for which we have figures, 2013, there were 21,175 such deaths and they seem to be rising. Deaths by firearm in this country totaled 33,636 in that year and seem to be rising as well.

And just for the heck of it, maybe we should throw in one other kind of weapon (even if it generally lacks the intentionality of firearms): cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Many traffic deaths could certainly qualify as assaults, however unintentional, with a deadly weapon. In 2013, there were 32,719 such deaths, essentially equaling death by gun in America.

In all, then, we’re talking about approximately 66,000 death-dealing assaults with weapons or vehicles in this country yearly.

Armed Dangers and Meal Tickets

Now, let’s leave those annual fields of carnage behind and turn to the “greatest threat” of our moment—or so the officials of the national security state would have you believe. You know what that is, of course: the Islamic State with its sophisticated propaganda skills that, according to official Washington, regularly run circles around whatever this country and its allies can muster in response. Despite the nearly trillion dollars a year that goes into national security and the elaborate surveillance and monitoring systems that have been put in place, we remain strangely defenseless against its wiles. Using social media, its facilitators threaten to obliterate distance, reach across oceans, and rile up displaced, marginalized, and often slightly unhinged young American Muslims, and—at least so the story goes—prepare the groundwork for unparalleled mayhem in “the homeland.”

With that dire scenario in mind, here is 2015 in Islamic State terrorism in the US in terms of death and destruction: In May, evidently affected by ISIS’s social media presence, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, two young American Muslims from Phoenix who were roommates, set out to attack a cartoon exhibit and contest in Garland, Texas, devoted to the Prophet Muhammad and organized by Islamophobe Pam Geller. Armed with assault rifles and wearing body armor, they managed to wound an unarmed security guard in the ankle before they were killed by an off-duty traffic officer, also working security at the event.

Similarly, this month a 26-year-old black Muslim, Usaamah Rahim, was reportedly involved in an ISIS-inspired plot in Boston to somehow behead Geller. He then supposedly abandoned that plan, deciding instead to behead some local “boys in blue.” Approached on the street for questioning by Boston police and FBI agents in plain clothes, he pulled out a “military-style knife,” they claimed, threatened them, and was shot to death. (Some aspects of their account have been questioned.) And that’s it, folks. The greatest threat on the planet has, so far this year, managed to inspire three marginal young men to get themselves killed. When it comes to the dangers in American life, put that in the context of tens of thousands of annual deaths by firearm, or even of the toddler killings.

Despite all the talk of possible jihadist plots, this is the evidence we have of the threat to the “homeland” which the Islamic State represents at the moment and into which so much money and preventive activity flows (to the exclusion of so much else). It is, we are told, a “new threat,” utterly unlike the normal dangers of our American world. In fact, such violence, rare as it may be, shouldn’t seem aberrational at all. It really should strike us as more of the same—even if the names of the perpetrators sometimes have a different ring to them: men, often young, with access to weapons, in some cases mentally unstable, and with a grudge, intent on striking out. They should remind us of those American men who so regularly kill their girlfriends and then themselves or of many of the mass killers of recent years.

Yet this is the lone danger that is constantly played up as the one worthy of both fear and investment. Of course, jihadist terror is perfectly real, and if Americans lived in Syria or Iraq or Libya, it would be a horrifying problem. But whatever the present skills of ISIS’s propagandists, such violence has, since 9/11, proven more dangerous than shark attacks, but not much else in American life. And when law enforcement agencies are surveyed, according to Charles Kurzman and David Schanzer, they, too, see the dangers of Islamist terrorism as modest indeed in this country, particularly in comparison to the homegrown far-right-wing version of the same.

It matters that we are still protected by two oceans and that the Islamic jihadist heartlands are distant indeed. But let’s be honest: the threat of Islamic terrorism here is also a meal ticket for the national security state. (Hence all those plots that turn out to be essentially instigated, funded, often essentially organized by FBI informers and then “cracked” by the FBI.) It’s one major way that the officials of that state-within-a-state ensure support and funding, endow themselves with special privileges, including never having to appear in court for potential criminal acts, and entrench their anti-democratic methods and the blanket of secrecy that goes with them ever more deeply in American life.

As for the real armed dangers in our world, nobody’s likely to put much money into protecting you from them and, despite those 66,000 deaths a year, somehow the world continues to spin and the end is not nigh.

By the way, you do have one thing coming to you, don’t you? I promised you a last paragraph. So here goes.

In the week-plus since I first began writing this piece, there was indeed one Islamic State–“inspired” attack in the United States. A 21-year-old man lunged at an FBI agent searching his home in Staten Island, New York, with “a large kitchen knife.” He was reputed to be part of another of those ISIS-inspired terror “plots” that seem unlikely to ever be successfully carried out. There was also a mass killing. A 21-year-old white racist walked into a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and opened fire in what, if he had been Muslim, would have been called a terror attack, killing nine, including the church’s pastor, who was also a state senator. As Reuters reported, the massacre “recalled the 1963 bombing of an African-American church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four girls and galvanized the civil rights movement of the 1960s.” There was as well at least one more grim toddler shooting. A Cincinnati 3-year-old found his mother’s gun in her purse, shot himself in the chest, and died. There was also at least one more fellow on a suicide mission: a Vermont man sought by the police in the killing of his ex-girlfriend engaged in a high-speed car chase before crashing and committing suicide by gun. There were a number of police homicides, including: a man on probation in a Hacienda Inn in South Lake Tahoe; a 28-year-old man in a high-speed car chase in Stockton, California; a 28-year-old man, unarmed but “behaving erratically,” in Des Moines, Iowa; a man who stabbed a policeman trying to arrest him in Brighton Beach, New York; and a man tentatively identified as African in Louisville, Kentucky, accused of violently threatening the police with a flag pole (with the usual conflicting stories from police and eyewitnesses about what actually happened). And in the smorgasbord that is America’s cavalcade of violence, we shouldn’t leave out the off-duty Neptune, New Jersey, police sergeant who chased his ex-wife in 7-year-old daughter before threatening to kill himself and being arrested by the police; or the Iowa City mall security guard, evidently fired from his job earlier that day, who went home, got a weapon, returned, and killed a 20-year-old female employee of the mall’s children’s museum whom he had previously been harassing. He fled, but was arrested by the police soon after. Meanwhile, a mentally disturbed young man with a grudge against the police bought an armored van on eBay (“touted as a ‘Zombie apocalypse assault vehicle’ with ‘gun ports’ capable of ‘drive-by mow-downs’ and full armor and bulletproof windows ‘just in case someone might try to take this bad boy from you’”). He then built pipe bombs, armed himself with an assault rifle and shotgun, drove to Police Headquarters in Dallas, and launched a full-scale attack on the place. Miraculously, he managed to kill no one, despite also crashing his van into several police cars, and was finally killed by a police sniper. And last but hardly least, some gunfire hit closer to home. Three young men in Brooklyn, New York, were shot and wounded in a housing-project playground complex (named after a neighborhood 13-year-old who had been killed by a policeman in 1994). Someone I know gives classes in that complex. The shooter remains on the loose."

My little girl was invited to a cowboy theme birthday party. She wanted to go as Annie Oakley, but we can’t find a single store in New York that sells toy guns. What gives?

Concerned Mother

Dear Concerned:

There is a ban on the sale and distribution of toy guns in New York City. This measure was enacted after police accidentally shot and killed a child who was brandishing a toy pistol. There is no such ban on real guns, however. Perhaps you could lend her one of your own. Have fun at the party.

Troubled Mind

Dear Troubled:

There is a ban on innocent suspect profiles in New York City. This measure was enacted after police accidentally shot several dozen innocent suspect profiles who were brandishing their bodies in suspiciously expressive and unpredictable ways. As you can surely understand, it becomes very confusing for law enforcement when they have to make on-the-spot judgments balancing the presumption of innocence, one of our most sacred jurisprudential ideals, against the kinds of decisive action necessary to protect us all from high crime statistics. You will be pleased to know that since the enactment of this ban, the police have shot only guilty suspect profiles whose résumés provided ample probable cause for prolonged gunfire.

Have you considered moving to New Jersey? I hear that there are quite a few innocent suspect profiles who commute.

Dear Dr. Mad Law:

While on vacation in Jamaica, I sent a postcard to my sister, who lives in New York City. When she got it, the card was in little pieces and wrapped in a plastic bag with a note of apology from the post office. My sister says it’s because the post office unfairly singles out Jamaican postcards; next thing you know they’re in a plastic bag. Can this be true? What gives?

Bewildered Sister

Dear Bewildered:

There is a ban on the sale and distribution of all postcards, regardless of ethnic or national origin, in New York City. This measure was enacted after a recent flood of angry postcards nearly buried City Hall and threatened to sweep the occupants from their various offices. Better safe than sorry.

Furthermore, I was able to confirm that the postal workers who encountered your particular postcard acted reasonably under the circumstances. What your letter fails to mention is that your card pictured a suspiciously beady-eyed, gaudily outfitted tropical parrot whose talons were clenched around a large gun-shaped branch. Understandably, the postal police, whose jobs are very stressful, feared for their lives and drew their weapons. But despite repeated volleys, the parrot’s fierce raptor talons remained clenched, leading frightened law officers to reasonably conclude that the parrot was wearing bulletproof bootlets. They continued shooting in self-defense until they were sure that they had made a tragic mistake. As you must know, Jamaican parrots have often appeared on When Good Pets Go Bad, and your shifty little bird bore a strong resemblance to them all. I’d say those fine public servants were just doing their job.

A Connecticut judge ruled Thursday afternoon that a lawsuit against Remington Arms Company over the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School can move forward. Ad Policy

The ruling is a victory for the victims and families who brought what could be a landmark case against gun manufacturers—but it should be understood as a narrow procedural win that did not yet beat back the gunmaker-immunity law passed by Congress in 2005. Ultimately, the unprecedented immunity given to gun manufacturers may still shield Remington from any liability for the deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook in December 2012.

The families are arguing that Remington is liable for “negligent entrustment” of the Bushmaster XM15-E2S that Adam Lanza used to carry out the massacre. When Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), the highly controversial legislation that gave gun manufacturers broad immunity against civil suits, it wrote in an exemption for negligent-entrustment claims.

But negligent-entrustment cases have commonly involved situations where a gun shop sells a weapon to someone it knows shouldn’t have it. The Sandy Hook families are making a novel claim that gun companies, and in this case Remington, are guilty of negligent entrustment by the very act of mass producing and marketing lethal, military-style weapons to the general public despite recurring evidence that assault rifles are used in mass killings—and that the gunmaker-immunity law does not apply.

If successful, their case would open the industry to waves of lawsuits over deaths caused by assault rifles. If the trial even got to the discovery phase, it might reveal fascinating information about how gun companies market their weapons, and what they truly believe about the lethality of their products.

Judge Barbara Bellis didn’t rule on the question of whether the families have a legitimate negligent-entrustment claim that gets past the PLCAA. Rather, she rejected a bold defense motion to dismiss the case that argued that the court doesn’t even have jurisdiction in the first place. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST ANALYSIS AND REPORTING

“[Defense lawyers] were trying to get the case dismissed before any discussion of the facts simply on the basis of PLCAA, saying that it was a jurisdictional statute that denies the court the opportunity to even consider the claims,” said Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA who has written extensively about the legal landscape around gun control. Bellis rejected that claim, and said her court does have jurisdiction.

If the defense lawyers had successfully argued that courts can’t even hear cases against gun manufacturers, it would have been a notable victory for the industry. But just because Bellis will continue to hear the case, it doesn’t mean she will ultimately decide that the families can get around PLCAA. “As to other issues about the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ claim, she sort of kicked the can down the road, and so they’re going to have to fight about that again,” said Sachin Pandya, a law professor at the University of Connecticut.

The next court hearing is scheduled for April 19, and victory for the Sandy Hook victims and families remains a distant goal. “I think the plaintiffs still have very tough road ahead of them,” said Winkler. “The PLCAA provides broad protection for gunmakers, and the gunmakers may yet win this case and get the plaintiffs’ claims thrown out.”

Gunmaker immunity has taken a central role in the Democratic presidential primary, as Bernie Sanders voted for the immunity legislation. During the campaign, he co-sponsored a bill to repeal most of the immunity provisions in PLCAA, but he also has defended his vote at times, and told the New York Daily News this month that he doesn’t think “the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer.”

Bellis’s ruling came down only hours before the final Democratic presidential debate. In a statement, Clinton said, “Today’s ruling in Connecticut is an important step forward for these families, who are bravely fighting to hold irresponsible gunmakers accountable for their actions. They deserve their day in court. Period. Unfortunately, PLCAA—the sweeping immunity law that protects gun manufacturers and dealers—still remains a major obstacle for these families and others seeking to hold these gun companies accountable.”"

On the February 25 edition of MSNBC’s AM Joy, host Joy Reid moderated a segment about the NRA, digging into the callous attacks the NRA has made against the Parkland students who are demanding gun control. Reid and her panel had a merry time belittling the NRA’s most visible spokesperson of late, political soldier of fortune Dana Loesch. To put a period on the point that the NRA is behind the times, Reid shared an ad featuring Loesch pitching her new show on NRA TV as a program that will challenge media giants. The panel called the NRA format “so ’90s” and rightfully pointed out that NRA TV isn’t likely to make a big splash on social media. Ad Policy

I wasn’t laughing. Yes, NRA TV—presented on NRATV.com, Roku, and Youtube, among other outlets—is nonetheless watched by almost no one. And, yes, NRA TV is far from representative of mainstream views about guns. NRA TV’s mix of live talk and short videos, which feature sensational attacks on the media, speeches by NRA bigwigs like Wayne LaPierre and Chris W. Cox (the principal political strategist for Institute for Legislative Action, NRA’s lobbying arm), scare videos, and cable-news style punditry, makes arguments very few people in the United States would support. Take, for example, a recent segment featuring former Secret Service agent and failed Florida congressional candidate Dan Bongino, in which he argues that for a “good number of people,” the AR-15 is “a fantastic self-defense weapon.”

The existence of NRA TV is, in fact, one of many signs that the right wing has lost the real culture wars, having almost no influence in Hollywood, popular music, or mainstream media. No wonder it promotes the meme “fake news.”

But there’s something very important missing from this analysis. NRA TV isn’t targeting the mainstream. No, NRA TV is directly speaking to the group Donald Trump referred to as “Second Amendment people” in a campaign speech many read as an incitement to violent action from gun advocates if the election were “rigged” and Hillary Clinton won.

Trump’s “Second Amendment people” include the Patriot Movement, a network made up of groups like the Bundy bunch that famously staged a 41-day armed occupation of the Malheur County Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon, in January 2016. The animating, radicalizing core ideology of that movement is violent white nationalism. NRA TV ideologically trains these front-line troops, which many believe will only grow more dangerous as the Trump presidency continues, particularly if he is perceived to be under attack, scandalized, and humiliated. That’s no joke.

Trump is like a fetish object for far right, whose rage is not really animated by corrupt banks, failing government, the rise of the 1 percent, and globalization. These forces may create the underlying conditions for the rise of radical movements, but what animates movements on the right—the demons that drive them to action and keep them tucked into Trumpist foolishness—is their hatred of people like us. We are the targets of their rage specifically because they’re losing cultural currency as we grow in cultural influence. We have become proxies for all of the ills of society. For these radical elements of the white-identity movement, the stockpiling of guns is one way of signaling in-group belonging, their commitment to the past in a world where they are losing the future, and, of course, their possession of the ultimate tools of the bully.

But don’t underestimate the right. Yeah, the NRA may well be out of touch with the mainstream. But what the far right generally, and the NRA in particular, is very good at is manipulating the Overton Window. By organizing and training the most active and extreme elements of the right, the NRA capitalizes on the radicalizing effect of the arguments made by that part of the movement.

The Overton Window is what public-policy advocates often use to frame the viable range of ideas in political discourse, while excluding what is considered too extreme. But the window isn’t static. Extremists can stretch the limits of what is acceptable and push political debates to the right when the political climate is ripe for change, as is the case right now.

In the 1980s, religious right-wing groups employed debate coaches to teach evangelical youth how to engage in the abortion debate in order to push the debate over abortion to the right. NRA TV is an updated version of the same tactic that attempts to drive Second Amendment panic."

Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr is a person without political fear. Maybe that comes from being the son of the brilliant Dr. Malcolm Kerr, “a pioneer in the field of Middle East studies,” who was killed in Lebanon in 1984 when president of an American University in Beirut. Maybe it comes from having nothing left to prove after leading the Warriors to two championships as well as a 73-win season over the last three years. Maybe it comes from coaching in the Bay Area, where the political winds tend to move toward wanting prominent athletic figures to engage on issues instead of “sticking to sports.” Whatever the motivations, Kerr has again chosen to use his platform to try to reach people who may not otherwise be reached by speaking out after yesterday’s mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. The greatest tool of the National Rifle Association and the politicians they own is our cynical belief that none of this can ever change. Meanwhile, racist politicians push for “a wall” to keep out imaginary enemies. This is depressing, but it cannot be an excuse for inaction. Steve Kerr spoke to that dynamic before Wednesday’s game against the Portland Trailblazers, saying: Ad Policy

Nothing has been done. It doesn’t seem to matter to our government that children are being shot to death day after day in schools. It doesn’t matter that people are being shot at a concert, in a movie theater. It’s not enough, apparently, to move our leadership, our government, people that are running this country, to actually do anything. That’s demoralizing. But we can do something about it. We can vote people in who actually have the courage to protect people’s lives and not just bow down to the NRA because they’ve financed their campaign for them. So, hopefully we’ll find enough people, first of all, to vote good people in, but hopefully we can find enough people with courage to help our citizens remain safe and focus on the real safety issues. Not building some stupid wall for billions of dollars that has nothing to do with our safety, but actually protecting us from what truly is dangerous, which is maniacs with semi-automatic weapons just slaughtering our children. It’s disgusting.

Kerr wasn’t the only person in the sports world to speak out. After Trump tweeted out, “No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school,” Seattle Seahawk wide receiver Doug Baldwin tweeted back to him, “Yea.. but the fact is that they AREN’T safe. Just more rhetoric and no action. WAKEUP!!!!”

These may seem like small gestures, but when you have a president and NRA-owned Congress gaslighting an entire country by telling us that these kinds of shootings are merely “mental-health issues” while both making it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns and cutting funds for mental-health programs, it’s easy to fear that we are collectively going mad ourselves. I don’t write these words lightly. Coming from a family where mental health is a serious issue, I see the NRA and GOP’s instinct to stigmatize people with mental illnesses as craven and contemptible. But when these shootings occur and all we get is a shrug, some prayers, and bombast about this being “the price of freedom,” it is easy to feel like we are losing our own grip on reality. I am not saying gun control is the answer to what ails us, because the rot runs so much deeper. We live in a country where the killer in Parkland and the people he slaughtered have lived their entire lives in a post-Columbine, post-9/11 world. Now that we know the shooter was trained by white supremacists and wore MAGA hats, we also know the politics that we must defeat… politics that give rise to this kind of senseless slaughter. We live in a a country where school shootings and the everyday specter of violence has been baked into our lives. It will take as many voices as possible, from the sports world and beyond, to tells us that this is not the way it has to be. Another world is still possible if we have the will to fight for it. One thing is certain: It is glaringly obvious who stands in our way."

AFTER NEWTOWN. Our editorial in this week’s issue calls on Congress to pass legislation banning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. “Gun control advocates should not be intimidated: the political winds at their back are strong,” we write. But with no political will to ban the sale of handguns, we argue that its time to broaden the fight—and target those who profit from guns. George Zornick reports how Walmart, the top seller of firearms and ammunition nationwide, helped make the Newtown shooter’s AR-15 the most popular assault weapon in the country. Just as his story was going to press, Walmart pulled the weapon from its website. But don’t be fooled—as Zornick reports, the move is a public relations one: the retail giant never directly sold the AR-15 on its website, and it’s still on the shelves in about 1,700 stores nationwide. Click here for more on five assault weapons you can pick up at Walmart. And take a look at a clip of George Zornick talking to MSNBC’s Tamron Hall about his investigation. Ad Policy

Also this week, Lee Fang asks who the NRA really represents: gun manufacturers or gun owners? “In reality, the NRA is composed of half a dozen legal entities; some designed to run undisclosed attack ads in political campaigns, others to lobby and collect tens of millions of undisclosed, tax-deductible sums,” writes Fang. Find out more on how corporations who profit from unregulated guns are funding the NRA. And take a look at Todd Gitlin’s piece on the “unbearable elasticity of gun logic” and how for the gun lobby, Newtown was evidence that more guns are necessary.

THE GREAT WALMART WALKOUT. A new labor campaign against Walmart faces daunting odds—do workers have a chance at taking on the retail giant? Josh Eidelson, whose reporting on the Black Friday strikes won this month’s Sidney Award, reports on OUR Walmart, an organization of Walmart workers demanding respect, affordable healthcare, and a living wage. While it would take years for workers to be able to yield significant power, Eidelson notes that “in an era when organized labor is on the ropes, and when most victories are defensive or only partial, they’re making labor’s chief antagonist sweat.” Find out more from Eidelson on how strikes are still an effective way to organize—and what the Black Friday strikes mean for the future of the movement.

“We beat the NRA!” Judge Rebecca Dallet announced as she claimed her pattern-breaking win in a contentious race for a position on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Ad Policy

Dallet trounced conservative Judge Michael Screnock, securing 56 percent of the vote statewide to become the first liberal contender elected to an open seat on the high court since 1995. Dallet will replace one of its most right-wing members, retiring Justice Michael Gableman.

The outcome of the first such high-profile statewide contest of 2018 signaled that the influence of the National Rifle Association is far less of a defining force in swing states such as Wisconsin than was once imagined.

Conservatives built their dominance in Wisconsin judicial races over the past several decades by pulling together classic right-wing coalitions. Although these contests are decided on a nonpartisan ballot, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and his fellow partisans relied on the infrastructure of the Republican Party and its allies—such as the NRA, anti-choice groups, and corporate interests—to generate enthusiasm in traditionally low-turnout spring elections.

Screnock, who had long been involved with right-wing causes, earned an enthusiastic endorsement from the the NRA’s political operation before the Supreme Court primary election in February. In fact, on the day before a gunman murdered 17 students, teachers, and coaches at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Chris W. Cox, the national chairman of the the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, identified Screnock’s campaign as a priority for the group and said, “It’s important that all pro-Second Amendment voters get to the polls on Feb. 20 and elect Judge Michael Screnock to the state Supreme Court.”

Screnock finished first in the primary, which set up Tuesday’s contest with Dallet.

While mailings from the gun group identified Screnock as “the candidate who has committed” to the NRA’s agenda, Dallet bet that Wisconsinites were ready for a sensible response to gun violence—and to the special-interest groups that thwart necessary action. “It’s lawful to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of dangerous criminals and those who shouldn’t have them,” she argued. “I value human lives over money. My opponent cannot say the same.” Current Issue View our current issue

Running in a state with a hunting heritage and high levels of gun ownership, Dallet explained: “In Wisconsin, the vast majority of gun owners are responsible people. Hunting will remain one of our state’s favorite pastimes. In my court, I’ll always defend our rights and the rule of law. Common-sense gun restrictions are clearly constitutional.” And she went a step further, highlighting the fact that her opponent was backed by the NRA and that she was not.

“Just hours before a 19-year-old boy took an AR-15 and murdered 17 of his former classmates, the #NRA endorsed my opponent for Wisconsin Supreme Court. Their last tweet before the #ParklandShooting was announcing their support for @JudgeScrenock,” noted Dallet, the mother of three teenage daughters.

Dismissing Screnock as “an extreme activist who has pledged to stand with the #NRA over the people,” Dallet tweeted after the primary: “That’s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won’t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money?”

She got responses like: “Give ’em Hell Judge Dallett!” And she never looked back.

The Wisconsin race was about more than guns. Dallet took on Trump and Trumpism, even airing a television ad that featured images of the president and a narrator saying: “He’s attacked our civil rights and our value. She’ll protect them.” When women marched to protest Trump and his policies, Dallet marched with them. “I wake up every day with gratefulness and joy for my family, and dread for my country. What nonsense will President Trump tweet today, and what group of Americans will he attack?” she said. “And I think most of us are disgusted at the lowering of our standards. Most of us agree that the distasteful attacks on women, immigrants, and the vulnerable need to stop.”

Dallet also distanced herself from Walker and the big-money politics he has brought to Wisconsin. While Screnock rejected a proposal to strengthen rules that require judges to recuse themselves from cases involving their major campaign donors and supporters, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel explained: “Dallet was very critical of the Supreme Court’s refusal to adopt a rule about when justices should recuse themselves from cases, and particularly of its vote to shut down the John Doe II investigation of Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign.”

As Walker campaigned for Screnock, Dallet made her support for an independent judiciary central to her campaigning.

Several national Democrats endorsed Dallet, including Vice President Joe Biden and former attorney general Eric Holder. But when Holder came to the state, Dallet chose not to appear with him and reemphasized her commitment to drawing firm lines on ethics issues, telling reporters: “Certainly if millions of dollars were spent on my campaign by a party in a case that was sitting in front of me…then I would recuse myself. And I think that distinguishes me from Judge Screnock, who refuses to make those assurances.”

In a measure of how desperate Screnock supporters became as the race progressed, the conservative’s backers claimed that because Dallet had publicly refused money from the NRA, she had shown more bias on gun issues than Screnock, who had accepted NRA support but had “not stated his personal views on firearms.”

The argument was laughable, as were many of the last-minute efforts by Walker’s political team and corporate special-interest groups to smear Dallet. By speaking in smart, nuanced ways about gun issues, while at the same time refusing to bend to the NRA, Dallet framed an approach that was in tune with voters—in Wisconsin and, potentially, other states across the country where the NRA has historically bullied candidates of both parties.

On Election Day, she ran well in urban areas. But Dallet also won a number of rural counties in western and northern Wisconsin—many of which backed Donald Trump in 2016—where at least some pundits had presumed that the NRA endorsement of her opponent would sway the result in the other direction.

The calculus had changed. So it was that, before a cheering crowd on election night, the judge who will soon be Justice Rebecca Dallet declared: “Tonight we proved that when the people rise up and stand together, we can beat the special interests. We beat the NRA, and we beat the millions of dollars that were spent on this race—flooding into our state.”"

In this week’s issue, we describe how Walmart has expanded gun sales—including military-style assault weapons—to half of its stores nationwide, and is the country’s biggest retailer of guns and ammunition in the country. Ad Policy

As our story was about to be published, Walmart removed a Bushmaster AR-15 style assault rifle, the same gun Adam Lanza used to carry out his attack on the Sandy Hook Elementary School, from its website. All of the other assault weapons remain. (See other examples here).

This is one of the most transparent public relations moves in relation to a dangerous product that I can recall—it was literally the least Walmart could do. To be clear, the store never actually sold the guns online. Rather, you can peruse Walmart’s gun inventory on its website, read customer reviews and product specifications and then find a Walmart near you that carries the item.

All Walmart did was remove that one gun, the one most likely to create a public relations problem, from a website where you couldn’t buy it anyway. But the Bushmaster remains on Walmart shelves—something the retail giant confirmed to MSNBC this afternoon, saying there is “no change” to its firearm sales.

Other retail chains, however, are making changes—though only slightly more substantial than Walmart’s URL adjustment. Dick’s Sporting Goods is “suspending” sales of some rifles in stores nationwide during “this time of national mourning,” and taking all guns out of stores located near Newtown, Connecticut. Cabela’s will stop selling AR-15s in Connecticut only.

If Walmart were to curtail weapons sales, however, it wouldn’t just hurt their bottom line. Freedom Group, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the country with $237.9 million in annual sales, said in its most recent financial statement that Walmart accounts for 13 percent of those sales alone, and warned investors of trouble should Walmart ever change its policy:

Our sales to Wal-Mart are generally not governed by a written long-term contract between the parties. In the event that Wal-Mart were to significantly reduce or terminate its purchases of firearms, ammunition and/or other products from us, our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Freedom Group was dumped today by its private equity owner, Cerberus Capital, following investor pressure. They’re in for more trouble if Walmart stops selling guns—but don’t look for that to happen anytime soon, based on how the retail giant has responded so far.

On October 1, there were 16,000 American soldiers serving in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. But it was Las Vegas that most resembled a war zone and represented the biggest danger to American lives that day. From the punched-out windows of his 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel, Stephen Paddock rained down an appalling level of destruction on a country-music concert below. Using an enormous cache of guns, in less than 12 minutes he single-handedly massacred 58 people and injured 527 more. It was a deadlier day than American soldiers have ever suffered in Iraq or Afghanistan, and the worst mass shooting in modern US history.1 Ad Policy

This latest slaughter demands that the country grapple with gun-control issues beyond the debate over background checks. A more fundamental question is at hand: How much lethal firepower should citizens be allowed to possess?2

There will be a fierce debate about where to draw the line, but no reasonable person can say the Vegas shooter wasn’t well past it. Paddock had effectively assembled a small ordnance depot in his luxury hotel suite. He had at least 23 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. A majority of those guns were military-style assault weapons; some were mounted on shooting platforms with scopes and tripods and outfitted with devices that made them fully automatic. Investigators later found 19 more guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition at his home.3

The destructive capacity of this arsenal is staggering, but it is not out of line with the firepower unleashed by other mass shooters. Omar Mateen, who was responsible for the 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, had three weapons, including an assault rifle, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He killed 49 people and wounded 68 more. Adam Lanza had only 300 seconds to shoot his assault rifle inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown before the police engaged him, but he got off 154 rounds and killed 26 people. James Holmes shot 82 people inside an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 90 seconds. When Jared Loughner shot up a meet-and-greet with then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in Tucson, he fired 33 times in 19 seconds.4 Related Article The American Impulse to Equate Guns With Freedom and Masculinity With Violence Is Killing Us Joan Walsh

Assault weapons with large magazines for ammunition are the common denominator in these killings. After World War II, the US Army’s Operations Research Office performed a study and found that the chief predictor of casualties was the number of shots fired. The military then asked the private sector to develop a lightweight weapon with a large, detachable magazine that could be used to inflict extreme damage on the enemy. The firearms manufacturer ArmaLite answered the call with the AR-15, which became the military’s standard-issue rifle.5

Now weapons very similar to the AR-15 are sold by sporting-goods stores, gun shops, and online retailers nationwide to any citizen with any level of training, or none at all. Large magazines that carry up to 100 rounds are also legal, and ammunition sales are barely regulated. The devices that Paddock used to make his weapons fully automatic are legal as well. Remarkably, Republicans in Congress plan to make lethal weapons even more dangerous: The House may soon vote on a bill making it much easier for citizens to obtain silencers and armor-piercing ammunition.6

Such measures must be blocked, but the gun-control movement also needs to push for action on reducing the number and kinds of weapons that Americans can possess. Creating a nationwide registry of gun owners and their firearms would be a start, along with enacting federal laws that prohibit more than one handgun purchase per month. Three percent of Americans already own 50 percent of the guns and can let loose military-level assaults on any venue they choose: concerts, malls, elementary schools. Background checks wouldn’t have stopped Paddock, Mateen, Lanza, Holmes, or Loughner. All those guns were purchased legally. But why were they allowed to be sold?7"

Ed. Note: In the light of today's tragic mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, many people are calling for an immediate discussion on gun control. Here are three places where Congress can get started–a list we published in the wake of the Aurora theater shooting that is, alas, still just as relevant. No action has been taken on any of these measures. Ad Policy

America’s gun laws are truly outrageous: in Colorado they allowed James Holmes to stockpile several weapons in a short period of time, including an AR-15 assault rifle with a high-capacity magazine, without ever registering the purchases with authorities. On the federal level, as we described yesterday, there are efforts underway to put guns into the hands of veterans with mental incapabilities, people on terror watch lists, and to weaken the federal bureau that enforces many gun laws.

President Obama has repeatedly relayed that he is only interested in enforcing “existing” gun laws. Even right-wing pundit Bill Kristol thinks this is misguided: he said on Fox News this weekend that “I actually think the Democrats are being foolish as they are being cowardly. I think there is more support for some moderate forms of gun control.”

So what are some moderate reforms that President Obama could get behind? Here are three bills introduced recently in Congress that would easily fall into the category of “common sense”—yet cannot seem to be passed.

Reinstating the Assault Weapons Ban. In 1994, gun-control advocates vanquished the NRA and passed a federal ban on assault weapons, but during Congressional negotiations they had to compromise: the ban would affect only weapons manufactured after the date of enactment, and the bill would have a ten-year sunset. Bill Clinton signed the law in September of that year.

Alas, ten years later, the Congress and the White House were both controlled by pro-gun Republicans, and it was an election year—so the ban expired. Today, you can for example walk into most big-box sporting goods stores and buy an AR-15 assault rifle. (This is what Holmes, the Colorado shooter, did).

In the wake of the mass shootings in Tuscon in 2010, Represenative Caroline McCarthy—who’s husband was killed in a mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad in the early ’90s—re-introduced a permanent ban on assault weapons in the House. Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Neither came up for a vote.

Obama campaigned on reinstating the ban, but “won’t even talk” about it today. When he was a Senator and chair of the Judiciary Committee in 2007, Joe Biden tried to get the ban reinstated as part of the Crime Control and Prevention Act. Mitt Romney, for that matter, signed a ban on assault weapons in Massachusetts in 2004.

Banning high-capacity magazines. Reports indicate that at most ninety seconds passed between the first 911 call in Aurora and the apprehension of the suspect. Yet he was still able to shoot seventy-one people—in large part because his AR-15 rifle had a 100-round drum capable of firing fifty to sixty shots per minute.

Just this week, Senator Lautenberg said he plans to introduce legislation banning these high-volume ammunition clips. “No sportsman needs 100 rounds to shoot a duck, but allowing high-capacity magazines in the hands of killers…puts law enforcement at a disadvantage and innocent lives at risk,” Lautenberg said. Other Senate Democrats, like Senator Dianne Feinstein, said they will support the legislation. “We’ve got to really sit down and come to grips with what is sold to the average citizen in America,” she said.

Republican Senator Ron Johnson, however, said the bill will “restrict our freedoms.” It’s extremely unlikely it can muster the sixty votes needed to overcome a Senate filibuster.

Regulate Sniper Rifles. Among the more dangerous weapons currently sold in America are .50-caliber rifles. Some can be outfitted to fire large rounds originally intended for use with Browning Machine Guns, and have been adopted by the military as long-range sniper rifles. According to a Congressional Research Service report, these weapons—freely available at most gun retailers—“could be used to shoot down aircraft, rupture pressurized chemical tanks, or penetrate armored personnel carriers” and “have little sporting, hunting, or recreational purpose.”

In the 110th Congress, Senator Feinstein introduced the Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons Regulation Act, which had very modest goals: to simply treat those weapons as short-barreled shotguns and silencers are treated, that is, to levy taxes on their manufacture and transfer, and require they be registered with authorities. That bill was defeated."

Hartung', 'Katrina Vanden Heuvel', 'Joseph Hogan', 'Cassidy Dawn Graves', 'Rian Thum', 'Jeffrey Wasserstrom', 'Michelle Chen', 'The Nation', 'Mychal Denzel Smith']",2016-07-26 14:11:59-04:00,https://www.thenation.com/article/the-obama-administration-has-sold-more-weapons-than-any-other-administration-since-world-war-ii/,"When American firms dominate a global market worth more than $70 billion a year, you’d expect to hear about it. Not so with the global arms trade. It’s good for one or two stories a year in the mainstream media, usually when the annual statistics on the state of the business come out. Ad Policy This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com.

It’s not that no one writes about aspects of the arms trade. There are occasional pieces that, for example, take note of the impact of US weapons transfers, including cluster bombs, to Saudi Arabia, or of the disastrous dispensation of weaponry to US allies in Syria, or of foreign sales of the costly, controversial F-35 combat aircraft. And once in a while, if a foreign leader meets with the president, US arms sales to his or her country might generate an article or two. But the sheer size of the American arms trade, the politics that drive it, the companies that profit from it, and its devastating global impacts are rarely discussed, much less analyzed in any depth.

So here’s a question that’s puzzled me for years (and I’m something of an arms wonk): Why do other major US exports—from Hollywood movies to Midwestern grain shipments to Boeing airliners—garner regular coverage while trends in weapons exports remain in relative obscurity? Are we ashamed of standing essentially alone as the world’s number one arms dealer, or is our Weapons “R” Us role such a commonplace that we take it for granted, like death or taxes?

The numbers should stagger anyone. According to the latest figures available from the Congressional Research Service, the United States was credited with more than half the value of all global arms transfer agreements in 2014, the most recent year for which full statistics are available. At 14 percent, the world’s second largest supplier, Russia, lagged far behind. Washington’s “leadership” in this field has never truly been challenged. The US share has fluctuated between one-third and one-half of the global market for the past two decades, peaking at an almost monopolistic 70 percent of all weapons sold in 2011. And the gold rush continues. Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who heads the Pentagon’s arms sales agency, euphemistically known as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, estimates that arms deals facilitated by the Pentagon topped $46 billion in 2015, and are on track to hit $40 billion in 2016.

To be completely accurate, there is one group of people who pay remarkably close attention to these trends—executives of the defense contractors that are cashing in on this growth market. With the Pentagon and related agencies taking in “only” about $600 billion a year—high by historical standards but tens of billions of dollars less than hoped for by the defense industry—companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and General Dynamics have been looking to global markets as their major source of new revenue.

In a January 2015 investor call, for example, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson was asked whether the Iran nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration and five other powers might reduce tensions in the Middle East, undermining the company’s strategy of increasing its arms exports to the region. She responded that continuing “volatility” in both the Middle East and Asia would make them “growth areas” for the foreseeable future. In other words, no worries. As long as the world stays at war or on the verge of it, Lockheed Martin’s profits won’t suffer—and, of course, its products will help ensure that any such “volatility” will prove lethal indeed.

Under Hewson, Lockheed has set a goal of getting at least 25 percent of its revenues from weapons exports, and Boeing has done that company one better. It’s seeking to make overseas arms sales 30 percent of its business.

Good News From the Middle East (If You’re an Arms Maker)

Arms deals are a way of life in Washington. From the president on down, significant parts of the government are intent on ensuring that American arms will flood the global market and companies like Lockheed and Boeing will live the good life. From the president on his trips abroad to visit allied world leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to the staffs of US embassies, American officials regularly act as salespeople for the arms firms. And the Pentagon is their enabler. From brokering, facilitating, and literally banking the money from arms deals to transferring weapons to favored allies on the taxpayers’ dime, it is in essence the world’s largest arms dealer.

In a typical sale, the US government is involved every step of the way. The Pentagon often does assessments of an allied nation’s armed forces in order to tell them what they “need”—and of course what they always need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied equipment. Then the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the deal, notifies Congress of its details, and collects the funds from the foreign buyer, which it then gives to the US supplier in the form of a defense contract. In most deals, the Pentagon is also the point of contact for maintenance and spare parts for any US-supplied system. The bureaucracy that helps make all of this happen, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, is funded from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals it negotiates. This gives it all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell.

And the pressure for yet more of the same is always intense, in part because the weapons makers are careful to spread their production facilities to as many states and localities as possible. In this way, they ensure that endless support for government promotion of major arms sales becomes part and parcel of domestic politics.

General Dynamics, for instance, has managed to keep its tank plants in Ohio and Michigan running through a combination of add-ons to the Army budget—funds inserted into that budget by Congress even though the Pentagon didn’t request them—and exports to Saudi Arabia. Boeing is banking on a proposed deal to sell 40 F-18s to Kuwait to keep its St. Louis production line open, and is currently jousting with the Obama administration to get it to move more quickly on the deal. Not surprisingly, members of Congress and local business leaders in such states become strong supporters of weapons exports.

Though seldom thought of this way, the US political system is also a global arms distribution system of the first order. In this context, the Obama administration has proven itself a good friend to arms exporting firms. During President Obama’s first six years in office, Washington entered into agreements to sell more than $190 billion in weaponry worldwide—more, that is, than any US administration since World War II. In addition, Team Obama has loosened restrictions on arms exports, making it possible to send abroad a whole new range of weapons and weapons components—including Black Hawk and Huey helicopters and engines for C-17 transport planes—with far less scrutiny than was previously required.

This has been good news for the industry, which had been pressing for such changes for decades with little success. But the weaker regulations also make it potentially easier for arms smugglers and human rights abusers to get their hands on US arms. For example, 36 US allies—from Argentina and Bulgaria to Romania and Turkey—will no longer need licenses from the State Department to import weapons and weapons parts from the United States. This will make it far easier for smuggling networks to set up front companies in such countries and get US arms and arms components that they can then pass on to third parties like Iran or China. Already a common practice, it will only increase under the new regulations.

The degree to which the Obama administration has been willing to bend over backward to help weapons exporters was underscored at a 2013 hearing on those administration export “reforms.” Tom Kelly, then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American arms exports. He responded:

“[We are] advocating on behalf of our companies and doing everything we can to make sure that these sales go through… and that is something we are doing every day, basically [on] every continent in the world… and we’re constantly thinking of how we can do better.”

One place where, with a helping hand from the Obama administration and the Pentagon, the arms industry has been doing a lot better of late is the Middle East. Washington has brokered deals for more than $50 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia alone for everything from F-15 fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to combat ships and missile defense systems.

The most damaging deals, if not the most lucrative, have been the sales of bombs and missiles to the Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have been killed and millions of people are going hungry. Members of Congress like Michigan Representative John Conyers and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy have pressed for legislation that would at least stem the flow of the most deadly of the weaponry being sent for use there, but they have yet to overcome the considerable clout of the Saudis in Washington (and, of course, that of the arms industry as well).

When it comes to the arms business, however, there’s no end to the good news from the Middle East. Take the administration’s proposed new 10-year aid deal with Israel. If enacted as currently planned, it would boost US military assistance to that country by up to 25 percent—to roughly $4 billion per year. At the same time, it would phase out a provision that had allowed Israel to spend one-quarter of Washington’s aid developing its own defense industry. In other words, all that money, the full $4 billion in taxpayer dollars, will now flow directly into the coffers of companies like Lockheed Martin, which is in the midst of completing a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell the Israelis F-35s.

“Volatility” in Asia and Europe

As Lockheed Martin’s Marillyn Hewson noted, however, the Middle East is hardly the only growth area for that firm or others like it. The dispute between China and its neighbors over the control of the South China Sea (which is in many ways an incipient conflict over whether that country or the United States will control that part of the Pacific Ocean) has opened up new vistas when it comes to the sale of American warships and other military equipment to Washington’s East Asian allies. The recent Hague court decision rejecting Chinese claims to those waters (and the Chinese rejection of it) is only likely to increase the pace of arms buying in the region.

At the same time, in the good-news-never-ends department, growing fears of North Korea’s nuclear program have stoked a demand for US-supplied missile defense systems. The South Koreans have, in fact, just agreed to deploy Lockheed Martin’s THAAD anti-missile system. In addition, the Obama administration’s decision to end the longstanding embargo on US arms sales to Vietnam is likely to open yet another significant market for US firms. In the past two years alone, the United States has offered more than $15 billion worth of weaponry to allies in East Asia, with Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea accounting for the bulk of the sales.

In addition, the Obama administration has gone to great lengths to build a defense relationship with India, a development guaranteed to benefit US arms exporters. Last year, Washington and New Delhi signed a 10-year defense agreement that included pledges of future joint work on aircraft engines and aircraft carrier designs. In these years, the United States has made significant inroads into the Indian arms market, which had traditionally been dominated by the Soviet Union and then Russia. Recent deals include a $5.8 billion sale of Boeing C-17 transport aircraft and a $1.4 billion agreement to provide support services related to a planned purchase of Apache attack helicopters.

And don’t forget “volatile” Europe. Great Britain’s recent Brexit vote introduced an uncertainty factor into American arms exports to that country. The United Kingdom has been by far the biggest purchaser of US weapons in Europe of late, with more than $6 billion in deals struck over the past two years alone—more, that is, than the United States has sold to all other European countries combined.

The British defense behemoth BAE is Lockheed Martin’s principal foreign partner on the F-35 combat aircraft, which at a projected cost of $1.4 trillion over its lifetime already qualifies as the most expensive weapons program in history. If Brexit-driven austerity were to lead to a delay in, or the cancellation of, the F-35 deal (or any other major weapons shipments), it would be a blow to American arms makers. But count on one thing: were there to be even a hint that this might happen to the F-35, lobbyists for BAE will mobilize to get the deal privileged status, whatever other budget cuts may be in the works.

On the bright side (if you happen to be a weapons maker), any British reductions will certainly be more than offset by opportunities in Eastern and Central Europe, where a new Cold War seems to be gaining traction. Between 2014 and 2015, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, military spending increased by 13 percent in the region in response to the Russian intervention in Ukraine. The rise in Poland’s outlays, at 22 percent, was particularly steep.

Under the circumstances, it should be obvious that trends in the global arms trade are a major news story and should be dealt with as such in the country most responsible for putting more weapons of a more powerful nature into the hands of those living in “volatile” regions. It’s a monster business (in every sense of the word) and certainly has far more dangerous consequences than licensing a Hollywood blockbuster or selling another Boeing airliner.

Historically, there have been rare occasions of public protest against unbridled arms trafficking, as with the backlash against “the merchants of death” after World War I, or the controversy over who armed Saddam Hussein that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Even now, small numbers of congressional representatives, including John Conyers, Chris Murphy, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, continue to try to halt the sale of cluster munitions, bombs, and missiles to Saudi Arabia.

There is, however, unlikely to be a genuine public debate about the value of the arms business and Washington’s place in it if it isn’t even considered a subject worthy of more than an occasional media story. In the meantime, the United States continues to hold onto the number one role in the global arms trade, the White House does its part, the Pentagon greases the wheels, and the dollars roll in to profit-hungry US weapons contractors."

On February 21, one week after a former student with an AR-15 murdered 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, students around the country walked out of their schools and into protests in support of meaningful gun-control laws. Ad Policy

In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, nearly 100 high-school students from Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) left their school building and marched to a downtown commercial square, where they joined hands and observed 17 minutes of silence. The goal, according to the protest’s media liaison, senior Serena Zets, was to “express solidarity with the students in Parkland and show [gun violence] is not only an issue that affects individual schools and individual people, but a societal issue we need to reckon with as a country.” This story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words. For more Student Nation, check out our archive. Are you a student with a campus activism story? Send questions and pitches to Samantha Schuyler at samantha@thenation.com.

In the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland, senior Christian Carter, one of three lead organizers of the protest, said he had been alarmed when he noticed that classmates and teachers weren’t talking about the shooting. “At CAPA we’re used to having conversations about what’s going on in the news,” he said. “But we didn’t talk about it, we didn’t have a conversation about these shootings.” He and the other organizers of the march spread word of the walkout plan on social media.

“No one stopped us as we left the building,” said Senior Nia Arrington, another lead organizer of the action. “They held the doors open for us. They called the police to escort us down there.… [principal] Ms. [Melissa] Pearlman stood in the office and waved us goodbye.” Students said teachers knew about the planned walkout and that many expressed support.

Zets was surprised by the turnout. As one of its leaders, she was at the front of the march and could only see the 10 people in front of her and 10 behind. But by the time the group had made it a block away from the school, she turned around to see 80 more trailing behind. She said that rumors of punishment by the school administration deterred many others from participating.

Carter said he remembered “looking at every single one of those kids’ faces” and appreciating “the beauty in seeing so much diversity in our walkout.” “It was three black kids who planned, who were the faces of our walkout, who organized it,” he said, referring to himself, Arrington, and senior Anyah Jackson. “I saw so many kids from CAPA who don’t shut up at school, so for them to stand—for students, for students to stand—for 17 minutes and not talk, there’s something powerful about that,” Carter said.

In Market Square, Arrington stood in the middle of the circle of students and addressed the crowd. “If our politicians won’t lead us—if our politicians won’t make change, we make that change!” she said. “The students, when we come together, it’s something powerful.…We will not be divided; we will not be locked out; we will not stop.” Current Issue View our current issue

As she led students in 17 minutes of silence, Arrington said she thought about the victims at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “It’s hard to not put yourself in their shoes,” she said. “When is it going to happen again?”

After the walkout, the students said, the school called their parents and served the protesters with after-school detentions. According to students who attended a meeting with the school principal and district administrators, Superintendent Anthony Hamlet stressed that students who left the building unauthorized had created a safety concern, while Principal Pearlman wrote in an e-mail that she had learned about the walkout from a parent the morning that it took place, not from the students at a prior time. She said students had told her about their intent to walk out and march to the square when she asked later that morning. “While we all understand the immense emotional aspects to these events and respect the intent of students and staff that want to participate, we do not support such ‘walk outs,’” she wrote. “A ‘walk out’ of students creates additional safety concerns for both students and staff.”

Kate Daher, a retired Pittsburgh Public Schools social-studies teacher of 20 years who spent the latter part of her career at CAPA, led a brief, but effective, campaign against the punishment. She wrote in a letter to the editor, “I find it especially ironic that during Black History Month while our students engage in non-violent civic action, they are to be disciplined for doing what they learn to do in their 9th grade Civic classes under the course theme, ‘Be the Change.’… Instead of punishment, students and teachers should be encouraged to protest the dangerous conditions that exist as a result of gun violence. After all, it is their lives that are at stake.”

Daher described a “firestorm” of calls and e-mails hitting the school in response to the proposed punishment. It worked. Pearlman waived the detentions in favor of small group discussions known as “restorative circles,” saying she was “moved by the ‘passion’ and the ‘advocacy’” of participating students,” the Post-Gazette reported.

Building on the success of the walkout, Carter said organizers have raised hundreds of dollars to support PPS students’ travel to Washington, DC, for the March 24 March for Our Lives. Zets, who had previously organized a voter-registration drive that resulted in the registration of 80 percent of her eligible classmates, said that bringing elected officials to CAPA for a New Voters’ Forum is also among the students’ next steps.

“I think people need to look out,” Carter said. “Because 2018 is going to be a year of change, and a year of students raising our voices, and a year of saying that we are not backing down.”"

Twenty-five years ago, on June 12, 1982, approximately a million people demonstrated in New York City’s Central Park against nuclear arms and for an end to the arms race of the cold war. Nothing like it had ever happened before. It was not only the largest antinuclear demonstration but the largest political demonstration of any description in American history. Nothing like it has happened again, either. The tide of protest was at its high-water mark, and thereafter receded steadily. Ad Policy

June 12 was the culmination of a movement that had begun in the 1970s with resistance to nuclear power and then proceeded to nuclear arms. Its immediate objective, launched in early 1980 in a “Call to Halt the Nuclear Arms Race,” written by antinuclear activist Randall Forsberg, was a bilateral Soviet-American “freeze on testing, production, and further deployment of nuclear weapons.” In 1982 freeze resolutions were introduced in nine states and passed in eight; later, freeze resolutions, though in watered-down form, passed the House and the Senate.

Although the nationwide strength of the movement is rightly associated with anxiety produced by the nuclear buildup launched by Ronald Reagan, it is telling to recollect that the freeze was in fact born in President Jimmy Carter’s final year in office. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Carter responded by announcing what became known as the Carter Doctrine, threatening the use of nuclear arms if the Soviet Union should attempt to move beyond Afghanistan to dominate the Persian Gulf and its oil reserves. At the time, the United States had no large conventional forces available in the Middle East to deter Russia, leaving nuclear weapons as the only military means available. None other than Paul Wolfowitz, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Regional Programs, wrote in a “Limited Contingency Study” in 1977, “We…have a vital and growing stake in the Persian Gulf region because of our need for Persian Gulf oil and because events in the Persian Gulf affect the Arab-Israeli conflict.” Thus, the Carter Doctrine initiated the long shift from cold war concerns to the preoccupation with the Persian Gulf that later would result in the two Iraq wars and now threatens a third war, against Iran. The recent refusal of not only George W. Bush but GOP presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in a possible war with Iran seems to bring this long development full circle.

The reasons for the decline of the antinuclear movement are full of paradox and, in the last analysis, possibly unknowable. In part, it became a victim of its own success. Few riddles are harder to untangle than the relationship of the success of the freeze movement and the simultaneous success of its antagonist, President Reagan. It is a matter of record that the movement powerfully undercut public support for Reagan’s nuclear buildup. According to a CBS/New York Times poll, between 1981 and 1985 support for increases in military spending dropped from 61 percent to 16 percent. It is a matter of record, too, that in response Reagan returned to nuclear arms negotiations with the Soviet Union.

But even more important, in March 1983, in part for the same reason, he startled observers, including most of the top officials of his own Administration, by proposing his Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars, to defend the United States from nuclear attack. When that was accomplished, he added in a second bombshell, the two superpowers, finding their nuclear weapons now “impotent and obsolete,” could do away with them. The motivation for co-opting the freeze is well documented, yet so is the sincerity of Reagan’s fervent desire not just to freeze but actually to abolish nuclear weapons. That sincerity was put on spectacular display at the summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, between Reagan and Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, also a nuclear abolitionist. As memorandums of the summit show, the two leaders came within a hair’s breadth of agreeing to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. Thus, in a sense the spirit of June 12 reached a high point and expired at Reykjavik.

The aftermath has been dispiriting. Arms control resumed and had some successes, but no fresh or bold initiative to deal with the nuclear danger has been launched. No heir to either the freeze movement or Reagan has arisen. The end of the cold war, seemingly the greatest opportunity to lift nuclear danger since 1946, was wasted. Instead, the whole issue fell into a shocking state of neglect, as if people believed that a mortal illness could be dealt with by forgetting about it.

In the years of silence, the unattended predicament quietly went haywire, assuming a malevolent post-cold war shape. Observing that the cold war powers, whatever they might say or not say, were determined to hold on to their nuclear arsenals, other nations–India, Pakistan, North Korea, perhaps Iran–determined to join the undissolved nuclear club. Whereupon the nuclear powers suddenly awoke to the danger and declared that these nuclear arsenals were intolerable. Having, in the early post-cold war years, mutely forgone the idea of negotiated nuclear disarmament for all, the United States soon turned to war as the ultimate solution to proliferation, and the Bush Doctrine of preventive war was born. There followed the Iraq War and, now, the threat of war with Iran, including the multiplying threats to use nuclear weapons. The wellsprings of change in public opinion are as hard to predict as ever. No one can say whether a June 12, or some twenty-first-century equivalent, is in the offing. That one is needed is beyond argument."

“We are standing at the assembly line the whole day, doing the same task again and again. It has nothing to do with my education,” says Xu Min, a 19-year-old college student in Hubei, China. “None of us want to be here. We are all depressed, but we have no choice.… The work is exhausting.” Ad Policy

For ambitious young people worldwide, the internship offers an on-ramp to a corporate career through office grunt work. But whereas American interns “pay their dues” as coffee-making cubicle peons, Chinese interns serve as a different kind of cog in the “emerging economy’s” manufacturing machine. Xu Min’s internship program, according to investigators, sent her and about 300 fellow students to serve as cheap labor on the global electronics assembly line.

An investigation by Danish labor watchdog group Danwatch traces connections between students at Chinese vocational schools and universities, and supplier factories of major tech brands, which furnish European educational institutions and other consumer markets with information technology equipment. So Xu Min’s labor on a server assembly line run by the Taiwanese multinational company Wistron may, ironically, help her European student counterpart enjoy state-of-the-art gadgetry on her university campus.

Drawing on field research and interviews with workers last summer, investigators concluded that an officially sanctioned pipeline of deregulated labor allows both schools and multinationals to benefit from the exploitation of young temp workers. Under pressure from their institutions and the approval of Western brands, “Thousands of Chinese students…work 10-12 hours a day, six days a week, for up to 5 months.” Their overtime—typically needed to cover basic living expenses—may amount to as much as 100 hours a month, far exceeding the regulatory limit of 36 hours per month. The investigated subcontractor, Taiwanese multinational Wistron—along with its multinational clients Lenovo, Dell, and HP—have acknowledged Danwatch’s concerns overall, but generally denied students were systematically forced to work.

Traditionally, rural migrants have filled manufacturing labor demands, but conscripted interns now form a major surplus army of labor, enabling manufacturers to capture a vulnerable youth workforce that’s increasingly striving for a life beyond factory drudgery. Though less publicized than Asia’s notorious garment sweatshops, advocates say the exploitation of contingent student workers follows similar practices of predatory capitalism as “development.”

Exploitative internships are imposed as graduation requirements, Danwatch reports, violating both Chinese laws and the International Labour Organisation Convention on Forced Labor.

A labor recruiting agent told Danwatch that Wistron’s Zhongshan factory held some 15,000 workers and “between 2,000 and 3,000 students,” with more due for arrival soon, and that they “have to work as regular workers, they also do overtime, but they are not supposed to work the night shift.” THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

But investigators found that many do work night shifts, and the system seems to allow employers to skirt other social-security mandates. Norma Josefa Martinez, author of the report, says via e-mail from Denmark that the gargantuan, controversial Apple supplier Foxconn has been known to employ some 150,000 interns and, according to academic researchers, may “save around 45 million Yuan (6.3 million euros) in a single month by not providing their 150,000 interns with welfare benefits and insurances.”

Education Ministry regulations mandate that internships be “directly relevant” to students’ academic programs. However—echoing common criticisms of internships in Western countries—students (typically not in tech-related fields) told researchers their duties were not only irrelevant but were potentially undermining their academic progress. Business student Zhu Wen told researchers: “The school sent us here, but I don’t learn anything that contributes to my studies in the assembly line. I can’t stand it here.”

Xu Wen, of Huanggang Normal University, told Danwatch that after students learned they were being sent for factory stints at Wistron shortly before summer started, “Many students protested, as we are accounting majors and want to do relevant internships. The school told us that if we refused, we would not get our diploma.”

The student preciariat’s complaints highlight structural economic problems facing China’s upward-striving youth. College is sold as a ticket into the middle class, but amid exploding wealth inequality, social frustration is roiling as students chafe against Beijing’s wall of elitism, which reserves the best jobs for children of the connected upper class.

While schools tell students “eating bitterness” through harsh work builds morale, they often feel powerless under Beijing’s paternalistic labor policies. Her research shows, Jimenez says, that many students just accepted that “that is just how things are and even though it is not fair, that is how the system is.”

This system could undermine labor standards for all, as factories’ intensifying use of intern labor apparently provides an alternative to better-regulated, higher-cost standard employees, according to Danwatch. As the labor recruiter explained matter-of-factly: “We are not hiring workers, because the student workers have arrived.”

Meanwhile, regular workers are experiencing significant pay raises through local minimum-wage hikes—populist policies enacted amid spiking labor unrest among factory workers and slumping economic growth.

The government recently announced plans to dramatically expand vocational programs—a seemingly well-intentioned policy that, without tighter oversight, could indirectly expand the trend of “student interns being used by businesses as a source of cheap and flexible labour,” according to Hong Kong–based advocacy group China Labour Bulletin.

Though the companies deny charges of forced labor, in statements to Danwatch both HP and Dell have acknowledged “gaps” in their supply chain oversight, and reported they had temporarily suspended their internship programs and “committed themselves to monitor Wistron Corporation internships programs more closely in the future.”

But for the students milling through factories now, activists want corporations to establish strong public procurement guidelines in universities’ contracts with tech vendors, coupled with transparent independent auditing (an alternative to the conventional voluntary, weaker “corporate social responsibility” codes).

Perhaps the hope lies in the students themselves. Just as student-labor activism spawned global movements against sweatshops and other corporate abuses, today the Hong Kong-based student group SACOM is leading campaigns against tech-sector worker abuse on the mainland.

The sense of outrage trickles down the production line: As intern Li Xiaoying told researchers, “I’d rather work for free and learn than be here.”

Now transborder solidarity could reemerge in the tech space as students at opposite ends of the campus supply chain work toward labor and educational freedom."

On July 2, Occupy Wall Street protester Cecily McMillan was released from Rikers Island, completing a sentence that her jury never wanted her to serve. On May 19, that jury of twelve convicted McMillan of felony assault against police officer Grantley Bovell. The verdict came after a four-week trial, during which McMillan’s defense team argued that it was actually Bovell who assaulted McMillan, and that she had elbowed him as a reflexive response after he grabbed her breast. The trial carried symbolic weight because it was the last Occupy criminal case, one of the few Occupy-related felonies, and an incident of alleged police violence that many protesters felt characterized NYPD norms. Still, the jury returned a “guilty” verdict. As is typical, jurors had been instructed by the judge not to read or research any further details of the case on their own, including the punishment that McMillan would face if convicted. Ad Policy

After the conviction, members of the jury learned that McMillan faced two to seven years in prison, according to sentencing guidelines. An anonymous juror told The Guardian that “they felt bad,” and that “even a year in jail is ridiculous.” The juror added that he hadn’t been convinced of McMillan’s guilt, but gave in to his fellow jurors and, not expecting harsh sentencing, voted to convict. Nine of the twelve jurors petitioned Judge Ronald Zweibel for leniency and no incarceration. At that point, however, the power was out of their hands (Zweibel ended up sentencing McMillan to ninety days in jail and five years’ probation). Many of McMillan’s supporters expressed frustration that the jurors who had held Cecily’s freedom in their hands didn’t take the consequences of the trial seriously until after it was over.

In trials that involve police testimony, as McMillan’s did, jurors are often inclined to trust state authority: the police and prosecutors. “When juries refuse to acquit people, it’s a nod to authoritarianism and our natural willingness not to be skeptical,” says Mariame Kaba, founding director of Project NIA, which works to end youth incarceration. In fact, according to an article published last year in the journal Law and Social Inquiry, “as jurors indicate more trust and confidence in the police, their likelihood of favoring the prosecution increases,” a serious problem for defendants in trials like McMillan’s. And “white jurors overall are more likely to favor the prosecution and are more willing to vote for guilt on the first ballot than are black jurors.” This fundamental trust in the criminal justice system betrays a profound ignorance of what Kaba calls “the inconceivable notion that the system could be railroading you.” Jurors become an extension of state power, trusting rather than checking it.

In fact, the right to a trial by jury is meant to be “part of the system of checks and balances to rein in the power of the state,” explains Paul Butler, a law professor and former prosecutor, and the author of Let’s Get Free: A Hip-Hop Theory of Justice. “You could call it political or you could call it constitutional. But the right of jurors to establish justice is deeply embedded in both the Constitution and our Anglo-American tradition.” This includes the practice of jury nullification, in which jurors may acquit a defendant whom they believe to be guilty, due to objections to the law or sentencing practices. No judge can overturn a “not guilty” jury verdict, and such cases cannot be retried.

Nullification dates back to the trial of William Penn and William Mead in 1670 in England. When jurors refused to convict them of unlawful assembly, the judge imprisoned the jurors. On appeal, a higher court released the jurors and found that they could not be punished for acquittal. The first chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, John Jay, said in 1794: “The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy.” And it remains entirely legal for a jury to acquit, regardless of the evidence, as a means of resisting unjust laws and sentencing. Juries have nullified to protest injustices throughout American history—in defense of the Boston Tea Party, against the Fugitive Slave Act, against Prohibition.

Despite this proud tradition, nullification has been a well-kept secret since 1895, when the Supreme Court ruled that while juries had the right to nullify, judges were not required to inform them of this power. “Most courts have refused to tell jurors about this power, because judges want to be the ones that have the last say,” explains Butler. “Most courts tell jurors that if you find the defendant is guilty, you must convict.” Not only are judges not required to inform juries of their right to nullify, but lawyers are prohibited from doing so, with rare exceptions (New Hampshire, for example, requires that juries be informed in criminal cases of their right to nullify). To mention nullification would land lawyers in contempt in most courts.

“It’s very strange for it to be a fairly essential power that jurors have, but no one’s allowed to express it,” says attorney and law professor David Kairys. Kairys defended the “Camden 28” in an unusual trial in which the defense was permitted to inform the jury of their right to acquit for any reason. The case involved a group of twenty-eight Catholic activists who in 1971 raided a local draft board to protest the Vietnam War. They had been entrapped by the FBI and were clearly guilty of the prosecution’s charges. At the trial, the judge instructed the jury: “The law does not recognize religious or moral motives or higher law for the commission of a crime, no matter how noble. I charge you that you may not treat the defendants’ beliefs with respect to the war in Vietnam, or other possible injustices to which you have heard references, as a possible negation of criminal intent.” Kairys and the defense team argued that, in saying this, the judge had misinformed the jury and had to correct himself. As a result, the judge ruled that the defense could openly address nullification in their closing arguments. This was rare, according to Kairys—so rare that he knows of no other case where nullification has been openly discussed in court.

In his closing statements, Kairys told the jury:

This power that juries have is the reason why we have you jurors sitting there instead of computers. You are supposed to be the conscience of the community. You are supposed to decide if the law, as the judge explains it to you, should or should not be applied in these circumstances. Nothing the judge will say to you is inconsistent with this power. This is not a request on our part that you show any disrespect for the law. It’s an essential part of the law. It’s as essential as reasonable doubt. You decide what to do with the law the judge explains. You decide, considering the circumstances of the case, whether you should brand the defendants as criminal. You are only required to say ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’; you don’t decide that they did it or they didn’t do it.

Kairys talked about Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and Daniel Ellsberg—all of whom, he said, “violated laws to preserve life and liberty.” He concluded: “The prosecution is asking you to brand these people as criminals. If that’s done, it will be done in your name. No one else’s. I urge you to say no to the prosecution, say no to this horrible war, say no to the FBI’s manufacture of a crime, and say yes to some hope for the future. Say yes for life. Thank you.”

All twelve members of the jury voted to acquit. Upon hearing the verdict, people in the courtroom began to sing “Amazing Grace.” Kairys says that although popular sentiment against the Vietnam War played a part in the jury’s decision, similar acquittals did not occur. The opportunity to explain nullification to the jury was crucial.

While the Camden 28 acquittal made explicit use of nullification, Butler says that nullification is effectively invoked all the time. “When I was a prosecutor in DC in the early ’90s, the jurors in DC were mainly African-American,” he explains. “It was commonplace in the prosecutor’s office that if we had a young black defendant and it was a nonviolent drug crime, the jury was not going to send him to jail. They would acquit him.” Butler says that such juries recognize the overrepresentation of African-Americans in the criminal justice system, and decide that, as long as there is no violent threat, they will not send another black person to prison. “Those are political acts by jurors, even if they’re not explicitly political,” he says.

Exercising the right to nullification can be tricky. If a potential juror, during jury selection, criticizes certain laws or their selective enforcement, it can result in his or her exclusion from the jury. Prosecutors, after all, want a conviction. When Butler was practicing in DC, sodomy laws were still in place, and many potential jurors would tell prosecutors that they didn’t support the laws, only to find themselves dismissed from jury duty. He says people’s feelings about drug laws are often similar and can lead to their dismissal. A Pew Research Center poll found that Americans, by a ratio of almost two to one, approve of states that have reduced mandatory sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders. Meanwhile, according to Department of Justice statistics, almost half of federal prisoners in the United States are incarcerated because of a drug offense. “People famously don’t show up for jury duty, and one reason is they don’t like the criminal justice system. They think it’s unfair and they don’t want to be complicit in it,” says Butler. But “you don’t have to be. There’s actually something you can do to protest it.”

People must know their rights before they get called to jury duty. Telling a sitting juror about nullification can be considered illegal tampering. But ensuring that all potential jurors know about nullification is not only legal but critical to the administration of justice. “When people start to understand the power they can exercise as jurors, I think that makes them more enthusiastic about jury service,” Butler says. And in an era of mass incarceration, harsh sentencing, racial profiling and police repression, the jury box is arguably the most powerful spot in the courtroom."

Bernie Sanders’s secret weapon is hiding in plain sight. It was there for everyone to see throughout the Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night, but we aren’t hearing about it in the post-debate coverage. Apparently it is invisible to the TV talking heads, headline writers, pundits, campaign reporters, and other media types who decide these things. Ad Policy

The media elites are fixated on a single question only: Who won? The American media’s tendency to cover politics like a sporting event dates back decades, of course, but it seems to grow more entrenched and absurd with each passing election. Thus the presidential election is covered like a horse race, presidential debates like boxing matches. Who landed the best punches? Who avoided them? Hence most news stories after Tuesday night’s debate carried headlines along the lines of “Hillary Triumphs After Attacking Sanders’s Gun Record.”

What actual voters think about Tuesday’s debate, however, might be quite different. Michael Tomasky, the political columnist at the Daily Beast, seems to be the only mainstream commentator who broke from the herd to make this point. Citing the results of two separate focus groups whose opinions had not been influenced by the media’s post-mortem declarations, Tomasky wrote, “There’s reason to believe that people watching at home didn’t share the media’s overwhelming verdict” that “Clinton crushed it.” On the contrary, both focus groups thought Sanders had won.

Leaving aside the simplistic focus on who won or lost, Sanders clearly appealed to many people Tuesday night, and his secret weapon helps explain why. That secret weapon is the gift of plain speech. This gift is less about the content of Sanders’s remarks, though that matters, than it is about the way he delivers them—he uses the kind of language ordinary people use themselves and speaks with a passion that makes it clear he genuinely believes what he’s saying.

Agree with his specific ideas and policies or not, Sanders was the only person on that stage Tuesday night who talked like a real person, not a calculating politician or policy wonk. Sanders didn’t talk about a “five-point plan,” like Clinton did in describing her proposal to reform banking regulation, or try to cram statistics into every answer like former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley did. Sanders didn’t mince words (“of course” he’d shut down the NSA’s domestic surveillance program) or run away from what he believes in (democratic socialism, as manifested in Scandinavia). He embraced his beliefs and actions and explained them in straightforward terms: yes, he had a different voting record on guns, because he represented a rural state where guns play a different role in daily life than they do in urban areas, but he was still tough enough to receive a grade of D-minus from the National Rifle Association. You might like that answer or not like it, but at least you can understand it.

Maybe the reason today’s media elites miss this aspect of Sanders’s appeal is that they’ve been on the inside of the political carnival looking out for so long that they’ve forgotten that debates, campaigns, and elections are not for them, they’re for the public. Most media elites are so distanced from ordinary people, and have been rubbing shoulders with conventional politicians for so long, that they don’t really get how alien and off-putting most politicians sound to the average person.

A second case in point: Sanders also was the only person on stage Tuesday night whose every other sentence didn’t contain a self-praising “I”: I accomplished this as governor, I have a plan for that, I have high ethical standards. What regular person likes listening to a braggart? (Well, clearly millions of Tea Party supporters and other right-wingers find Donald Trump’s bragging appealing, but even that is likely to wane after a while.) Sanders likewise refused to be drawn into attacking other candidates—even after Clinton went out of her way to attack his gun record and despite CNN’s childish insistence on trying to provoke cat fights, as if urging two candidates to criticize one another somehow amounts to hard-hitting journalism).

Again, this is an area where the media elite is in its own world, annoyingly out of touch with average Americans. The media likes cat fights because they make for dramatic television moments that the rest of the media can then talk and write about. The average American, by contrast, has been saying for years that she doesn’t like attack ads or their journalistic equivalent. The political and media elite’s continued wallowing in this mud is a part of the reason so many Americans are turned off to politics, at least as it’s presented by the mainstream media.

Bernie Sanders’s secret weapon of plain speech means that he comes across as, in a word, authentic. And authenticity goes a long way with Americans. We are a people for whom ideology matters a lot less than speaking plainly and sticking by your beliefs.

All of which recalls a leader who could not be more different from Bernie Sanders ideologically: Ronald Reagan. When Reagan ran for president in 1980, media elites ridiculed him as a simplistic former Hollywood actor whose ideas were too extreme for middle America. Voters, however, responded to Reagan’s clear, simple message and made him president. Fingers ever to the wind, the media elites soon changed their tune, christening Reagan “the Great Communicator.” There was sycophancy in the media’s about-face, but also reality: Poll numbers showed that even many Democrats who did not agree with this or that specific policy of Reagan’s nevertheless gave him the benefit of the doubt because he communicated his ideas in a clear, simple way and obviously believed they would work. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

If the first half of Sanders’s secret weapon is how he speaks, the second half is what he says. The political and media class in Washington haven’t caught up to this either, but Sanders’s basic message is one that very large numbers of Americans agree with: The system is rigged. The top 1 percent—“the millionaire and billionaire class,” as Sanders puts it—take too much of the nation’s wealth. Our political system and its elections are corrupt: The rich can buy a government that’s to their liking by throwing unlimited amounts of money at elections.

This may sound like radical, left-wing talk within the elite circles where most of the Washington political and media class travel, but it sounds like common sense to vast numbers of people across the country. Americans of all regions, political affiliations, ages, and races recognize that what Sanders says is true. And they find it refreshing that finally there is a politician who says it with the kind of conviction and track record that makes it believable, not just a campaign posture.

Speaking plainly and saying things that vast numbers of the American people agree with is what makes Bernie Sanders a much more creditable candidate than the mainstream media has recognized. It’s why Sanders is drawing such enormous crowds on the campaign trail. It’s why his poll numbers are close to or better than Clinton’s in key primary states and nationwide. It’s why he is raising as much money as Clinton is, despite forgoing donations from the millionaires and billionaires who dominate every other candidate’s fundraising efforts.

None of this means that Sanders will be the next president of the United States. But isn’t it a bit early to be drawing that conclusion about anyone? Here’s a prediction, though: The more opportunities ordinary Americans have to see and hear Bernie Sanders directly, unfiltered by the mainstream media and its silly definitions of proper news coverage, the less secret Sander’s secret weapon will be—and the more likely that Sanders will get what he asked for Tuesday night: for “millions of people to come together” to make a “political revolution” and take back their government from the 1 percent and those who do its bidding."

[This piece has been updated and adapted from William D. Hartung’s “Nuclear Politics” in Sleepwalking to Armageddon: The Threat of Nuclear Annihilation, edited by Helen Caldicott and just published by the New Press.] Ad Policy

Until recently, few of us woke up worrying about the threat of nuclear war. Such dangers seemed like Cold War relics, associated with outmoded practices like building fallout shelters and “duck and cover” drills.

But give Donald Trump credit. When it comes to nukes, he’s gotten our attention. He’s prompted renewed concern, if not outright alarm, about the possibility that such weaponry could actually be used for the first time since the 6th and 9th of August 1945. That’s what happens when the man in the Oval Office begins threatening to rain “fire and fury like the world has never seen” on another country or, as he did in his presidential campaign, claiming cryptically that, when it comes to nuclear weapons, “the devastation is very important to me.”

Trump’s pronouncements are at least as unnerving as President Ronald Reagan’s infamous “joke” that “we begin bombing [the Soviet Union] in five minutes” or the comment of a Reagan aide that, “with enough shovels,” the United States could survive a superpower nuclear exchange.

Whether in the 1980s or today, a tough-guy attitude on nuclear weapons, when combined with an apparent ignorance about their world-ending potential, adds up to a toxic brew. An unprecedented global anti-nuclear movement—spearheaded by the European Nuclear Disarmament campaign and, in the United States, the Nuclear Freeze campaign—helped turn President Reagan around, so much so that he later agreed to substantial nuclear cuts and acknowledged that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”

It remains to be seen whether anything could similarly influence Donald Trump. One thing is certain, however: The president has plenty of nuclear weapons to back up his aggressive rhetoric—more than 4,000 of them in the active US stockpile, when a mere handful of them could obliterate North Korea at the cost of millions of lives. Indeed, a few hundred nuclear warheads could do the same for even the largest of nations and those 4,000, if ever used, could essentially destroy the planet.

In other words, in every sense of the term, the US nuclear arsenal already represents overkill on an almost unimaginable scale. Independent experts from US war colleges suggest that about 300 warheads would be more than enough to deter any country from launching a nuclear attack on the United States. Current Issue View our current issue

Despite this, Donald Trump is all in (and more) on the Pentagon’s plan—developed under Barack Obama—to build a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers, submarines, and missiles, as well as new generations of warheads to go with them. The cost of this “modernization” program? The Congressional Budget Office recently pegged it at $1.7 trillion over the next three decades, adjusted for inflation. As Derek Johnson, director of the antinuclear organization Global Zero, has noted, “That’s money we don’t have for an arsenal we don’t need.”

Building a Nuclear Complex

Why the desire for so many nukes? There is, in fact, a dirty little secret behind the massive US arsenal: It has more to do with the power and profits of this country’s major weapons makers than it does with any imaginable strategic considerations.

It may not surprise you to learn that there’s nothing new about the influence the nuclear weapons lobby has over Pentagon spending priorities. The successful machinations of the makers of strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles, intended to keep taxpayer dollars flowing their way, date back to the dawn of the nuclear age and are the primary reason President Dwight D. Eisenhower coined the term “military-industrial complex” and warned of its dangers in his 1961 farewell address.

Without the development of such weapons, that complex simply would not exist in the form it does today. The Manhattan Project, the vast scientific-industrial endeavor that produced the first such weaponry during World War II, was one of the largest government-funded research and manufacturing projects in history. Today’s nuclear warhead complex is still largely built around facilities and locations that date back to that time.

The Manhattan Project was the first building block of the permanent arms establishment that came to rule Washington. In addition, the nuclear arms race against that other superpower of the era, the Soviet Union, was crucial to the rationale for a permanent war state. In those years, it was the key to sustaining the building, funding, and institutionalizing of the arms establishment.

As Eisenhower noted in that farewell address of his, “a permanent arms industry of vast proportions” had developed for a simple enough reason. In a nuclear age, America had to be ready ahead of time. As he put it, “We can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.” And that was for a simple enough reason: In an era of potential nuclear war, any society could be destroyed in a matter of hours. There would be no time, as in the past, to mobilize or prepare after the fact.

In addition, there were some very specific ways in which the quest for more nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles drove Eisenhower to give that farewell address. One of his biggest fights was over whether to build a new nuclear bomber. The Air Force and the arms industry were desperate to do so. Eisenhower thought it a waste of money, given all the other nuclear delivery vehicles the United States was building at the time. He even cancelled the bomber, only to find himself forced to revive it under immense pressure from the arms lobby. In the process, he lost the larger struggle to rein in the nation’s nuclear buildup and corral the burgeoning military-industrial complex.

At the same time, there were rumblings in the intelligence community, the military establishment, the media, and Congress about a “missile gap” with the Soviet Union. The notion was that Moscow had somehow jumped ahead of the United States in developing and building intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). There was no definitive intelligence to substantiate the claim (and it was later proved to be false). However, a wave of worst-case scenarios leaked by or promoted by intelligence analysts and eagerly backed by industry propaganda made that missile gap part of the everyday news of the time.

Such fears were then exaggerated further, thanks to hawkish journalists of the era like Joseph Alsop and prominent Democratic senators like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, as well as Stuart Symington, who just happened to be a friend and former colleague of an executive at the aircraft manufacturing company Convair, which, in turn, just happened to make ICBMs. As a result, he lobbied hard on behalf of a Pentagon plan to build more of that corporation’s Atlas ballistic missiles, while Kennedy would famously make the nonexistent missile gap a central theme of his successful 1960 campaign for the presidency.

Eisenhower couldn’t have been more clear-eyed about all of this. He saw the missile gap for the fiction it was or, as he put it, a “useful piece of political demagoguery” for his opponents. “Munitions makers,” he insisted, “are making tremendous efforts towards getting more contracts and in fact seem to be exerting undue influence over the Senators.”

Once Kennedy took office, it became all too apparent that there was no missile gap, but by then it hardly mattered. The damage had been done. Billions of dollars more were flowing into the nuclear-industrial complex to build up an American arsenal of ICBMs already unmatched on the planet.

The techniques that the arms lobby and its allies in government used more than half a century ago to promote sky-high nuclear weapons spending continue to be wielded to this day. The twenty-first-century arms complex employs tools of influence that Kennedy and his compatriots would have found familiar indeed—including millions of dollars in campaign contributions that flow to members of Congress and the continual employment of 700 to 1,000 lobbyists to influence them. At certain moments, in other words, there have been nearly two arms lobbyists for every member of Congress. Much of this sort of activity remains focused on ensuring that nuclear weapons of all types are amply financed and that the funding for the new generations of the bombers, submarines, and missiles that will deliver them stays on track.

When traditional lobbying methods don’t get the job done, the industry’s argument of last resort is jobs—in particular, jobs in the states and districts of key members of Congress. This process is aided by the fact that nuclear weapons facilities are spread remarkably widely across the country. There are nuclear weapons labs in California and New Mexico; a nuclear weapons testing and research site in Nevada; a nuclear warhead assembly and disassembly plant in Texas; a factory in Kansas City, Missouri, that builds nonnuclear parts for such weapons; and a plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that enriches uranium for those same weapons. There are factories or bases for ICBMs, bombers, and ballistic missile submarines in Connecticut, Georgia, Washington State, California, Ohio, Massachusetts, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Such a nuclear geography ensures that a striking number of congressional representatives will automatically favor more spending on nuclear weapons.

In reality, the jobs argument is deeply flawed. As the experts know, virtually any other activity into which such funding flowed would create significantly more jobs than Pentagon spending. A study by economists at the University of Massachusetts, for example, found infrastructure investment would create one and one-half times as many jobs as Pentagon funding and education spending twice as many.

In most cases it hasn’t seemed to matter that the jobs claims for weapons spending are grotesquely exaggerated and better alternatives litter the landscape. The argument remains remarkably potent in states and communities that are particularly dependent on the Pentagon. Perhaps unsurprisingly, members of Congress from such areas are disproportionately represented on the committees that decide how much will be spent on nuclear and conventional weaponry.

A Field Guide to Influencing Nuclear Thinking in Washington

Another way the nuclear weapons industry (like the rest of the military-industrial complex) tries to control and focus public debate is by funding hawkish, right-wing think tanks. The advantage to weapons makers is that those institutions and their associated “experts” can serve as front groups for the complex, while posing as objective policy analysts. Think of it as an intellectual version of money laundering.

One of the most effective industry-funded think tanks in terms of promoting costly, ill-advised policies has undoubtedly been Frank Gaffney’s Center for Security Policy. In 1983, when President Ronald Reagan first announced his Strategic Defense Initiative (which soon gained the nickname “Star Wars”), the high-tech space weapons system that was either meant to defend the country against a future Soviet first strike or—depending on how you looked at it—free the country to use its nuclear weapons without fear of being attacked, Gaffney was its biggest booster. More recently, he has become a prominent purveyor of Islamophobia, but the impact of his promotional work for Star Wars continues to be felt in contracts for future weaponry to this day.

He had served in the Reagan-era Pentagon, but left because even that administration wasn’t anti-Soviet enough for his tastes, once the president and his advisers began to discuss things like reducing nuclear weapons in Europe. It didn’t take him long to set up his center with funding from Boeing, Lockheed, and other defense contractors.

Another key industry-backed think tank in the nuclear policy field is the National Institute for Public Policy (NIPP). It released a report on nuclear weapons policy just as George W. Bush was entering the White House that would be adopted almost wholesale by his administration for its first key nuclear posture review. It advocated such things as increasing the number of countries targeted by the country’s nuclear arsenal and building a new, more “usable,” bunker-busting nuke. At that time, NIPP had an executive from Boeing on its board and its director was Keith Payne. He would become infamous in the annals of nuclear policy for co-authoring a 1980 article at Foreign Policy entitled “Victory Is Possible,” suggesting that the United States could actually win a nuclear war, while “only” losing 30 million to 40 million people. This is the kind of expert the nuclear weapons complex chose to fund to promulgate its views.

Then there is the Lexington Institute, the think tank that never met a weapons system it didn’t like. Their key front man, Loren Thompson, is frequently quoted in news stories on defense issues. It is rarely pointed out that he is funded by Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and other nuclear weapons contractors.

And these are just a small sampling of Washington’s research and advocacy groups that take money from weapons contractors, ranging from organizations on the right like the Heritage Foundation to Democratic-leaning outfits like the Center for a New American Security, co-founded by former Obama administration Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michèle Flournoy (who was believed to have the inside track on being appointed secretary of defense had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election).

And you may not be surprised to learn that Donald Trump is no piker when it comes to colluding with the weapons industry. His strong preference for populating his administration with former arms industry executives is so blatant that Senator John McCain recently pledged to oppose any new nominees with industry ties. Examples of Trump’s industry-heavy administration include Secretary of Defense James Mattis, a former board member at General Dynamics; White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who worked for a number of defense firms and was an adviser to DynCorp, a private security firm that has done everything from (poorly) training the Iraqi police to contracting with the Department of Homeland Security; former Boeing executive and now Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan; former Lockheed Martin executive John Rood, nominated as undersecretary of defense for policy; former Raytheon vice president Mark Esper, newly confirmed as secretary of the Army; Heather Wilson, a former consultant to Lockheed Martin, who is secretary of the Air Force; Ellen Lord, a former CEO for the aerospace company Textron, who is undersecretary of defense for acquisition; and National Security Council Chief of Staff Keith Kellogg, a former employee of the major defense and intelligence contractor CACI, where he dealt with “ground combat systems” among other things. And keep in mind that these high-profile industry figures are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the corporate revolving door that has for decades been installed in the Pentagon (as documented by Lee Fang of The Intercept in a story from early in Trump’s tenure).

Given the composition of his national security team and Trump’s love of all things nuclear, what can we expect from his administration on the nuclear weapons front? As noted, he has already signed on to the Pentagon’s budget-busting $1.7 trillion nuclear build-up and his impending nuclear posture review seems to include proposals for dangerous new weapons like a “low-yield,” purportedly more usable nuclear warhead. He’s spoken privately with his national security team about expanding the American nuclear arsenal in a staggering fashion, the equivalent of a ten-fold increase. He’s wholeheartedly embraced missile defense spending, pledging to put billions of dollars more into that already overfunded, under-producing set of programs. And of course, he is assiduously trying to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, one of the most effective arms control agreements of recent times, and so threatening to open the door to a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

Unless the nuclear spending spree long in the making and now being pushed by President Trump as the best thing since the invention of golf is stopped thanks to public opposition, the rise of an antinuclear movement, or Congressional action, we’re in trouble. And of course, the nuclear weapons lobby will once again have won the day, just as it did almost 60 years ago, despite the opposition of a popular president and decorated war hero. And needless to say, Donald Trump, “bone spurs” and all, is no Dwight D. Eisenhower."

Very few people enjoy paying taxes, so it’s hardly surprising the Internal Revenue Service is unpopular. This makes it an easy political target, particularly for those who are already on a mission to slash and eliminate as many taxes as possible. Senator Ted Cruz, for example, proposed shuttering the IRS entirely during his recent presidential campaign and said he would post the 125,000 agents along the southern border. Ad Policy

For years, the agency has been in the crosshairs of the Republican Party, particularly the far-right members of the House who have now organized themselves as the Freedom Caucus. But last week the war on the IRS escalated significantly, beyond mere rhetoric and hectoring: the House Judiciary Committee is now seeking to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

Ostensibly, the decapitation of the IRS can be traced to the scandal that broke three years ago, when it was disclosed that conservative groups were being held to a higher standard in their quest for tax-exempt status. The agency’s bungling of that issue and the subsequent dodginess of those responding to Republican fury—including Koskinen—only added to Republican resentment.

But impeaching a civil servant? Even if Koskinen were inept (his real crime may be his failure to genuflect before those who badgered him in hearings,) invoking impeachment is like using a nuke for pest control. The last civil servant who was impeached was William W. Belknap, the secretary of war, for taking a kickback. That was 1876.

If Koskinen survives the impeachment process, as expected, he still faces possible censure, but whatever the outcome, assaults on the agency are sure to multiply. That’s because the real complaint many Republicans have with the IRS is not that it is underperforming but, rather, that it is performing at all.

For Republicans, particularly members of the Freedom Caucus, targeting the IRS represents a crafty—some might say “cunning”—strategy: a pincer movement designed to emasculate government’s ability to raise revenues, even as it draws the line on deficit spending. In such a scheme, the IRS is the carotid, that vital artery that oxygenates all of government. The less it takes in, the more government atrophies.

And the political risks are minimal. In an election year, what’s not to like? Name one politician whose career was set back by attacking the IRS, a cultural whipping boy for as long as there has been a government. In the Bible, “publican” (or tax man) is a dirty word, and only Jesus could make an honest man of Matthew, the corrupt tax collector turned disciple.

For years, Republicans have whittled away at the IRS budget, deliberately undercutting its capabilities. Its budget has been cut by about $1 billion—about 17 percent—over its 2010 budget, factoring in inflation. The agency has been forced to shed some 13,000 people. The result: During the height of last year’s filing season, 90 percent of calls to the agency’s helpline went unanswered. That further incited discontent, fed the perception of a callous bureaucracy, and allowed those in oversight to cast themselves as champions of the aggrieved.

You can’t kick a dog and then yell at him for not being able to run. But that is the perversity of the policy now pursued by the Freedom Caucus. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

The ranks of auditors have also been depleted, reducing the efficiency of collection, and emboldening those already inclined to cheat. In 2015, there were 1.2 million audits conducted—a drop of some 350,000 over the course of five years. That in turn meant government collected $30 billion less in revenue. For perspective, the Environmental Protection Agency, reviled by many on the right, has a budget of $8 billion, the equally detested Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a mere $600 million.

The impeachment effort, radical and nearly unprecedented as it is, masks a much broader attempt to reshape government itself. And as worrisome as it may be to pragmatists that the revenue-raising function of the nation is in jeopardy, so too is the entire oversight apparatus of Congress, or at least what remains of it.

The impeachment drama may share more in common with Kabuki than oversight. And impeachment represents a serious escalation in a conflict in which the IRS is only the proximate target: the debacle is certain to have an impact on the tenor and integrity of congressional investigative and oversight hearings—and on whatever tattered remnants of comity have survived the ravages of political polarization.

Government itself has long relied on such hearings and investigations for vital information, accountability, and reform. Historically, such hearings have exposed some of the nation’s most egregious abuses and produced some of the most important reforms, like those resulting from hearings on Teapot Dome, Watergate, and the CIA. (They have also, on occasion, veered wildly off course and shamed the nation: think Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.)

Republicans are not the only culprits here. As a committee chair, then-Representative John Dingell was notorious for his bullying tactics and withering assaults. But at least the findings and the facts still enjoyed a measure of respect.

This can no longer be said. Even before hearings on Koskinen’s impeachment, meaningful oversight had been reduced to preaching to the choir, a display of histrionics, not designed to produce information, but calculated to discredit political adversaries. One might well ask why Representative Jason Chaffetz was so determined to have Koskinen’s head on a platter, why he suggested Obama might be impeached for the Benghazi affair, and yet long resisted calling Michigan’s Republican Governor Rick Snyder to testify on the Flint, Michigan, water scandal.

As chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Chaffetz only followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, Representative Darrell Issa. The hallmarks of their hearings have been incivility, bombast, and innuendo. In addition, no committee has provided a purer example of such partisan excess as the House Select Committee on Benghazi, whose interminable quest to mortally wound candidate Hillary Clinton has itself profoundly devalued oversight and congressional credibility.

There is the very real danger this impeachment effort will not be the last, that it is the opening gambit by those who would normalize impeachment as a way to punish or exile political opponents or use the congressional equivalent of capital punishment as a warning to others to take heed and not resist their demands for obeisance. And no one should imagine the Democrats are above taking a page from the Republican playbook. Adding impeachment to the arsenal of partisan options only further institutionalizes the tit-for-tat-ism that already cripples Congress.

Some five years ago, former Oklahoma representative Micky Edwards, onetime chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, offered this advice for those tasked with oversight: “…take off your party hat. Put it in a drawer, and deal with this as somebody who has taken an oath of office…to carry out the mandates of the Constitution to function as the people’s voice.” That’s “people’s,” not “party’s.”

Which brings us to the nettlesome question asked by the Roman poet Juvenal: “Who shall guard the guards?” Who is there to provide oversight of those charged with oversight? And what is to prevent not only the further deterioration of Congress’s oversight function but also a deeper erosion of faith in government? If there were to be a legitimate exercise of impeachment authority, perhaps it should be reserved for those now so willing to wield it against others."

Oslo, Norway—From the indigenous communities exposed by remote nuclear tests, to activists living in bustling cities across the globe—a new resistance is growing. Peace Organizations worldwide have joined together to stand up to the nine nuclear-armed states in the form of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, known commonly as ICAN. While many have hailed them for revitalizing the nuclear-disarmament movement, their greatest achievement to date is their influence on the creation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. This bold new step in disarmament stands out from previous anti-nuclear movements, because it went after a comprehensive ban. While it won’t as of yet directly eliminate a single nuclear weapon, as none of the current signatories have them, many believe it will significantly alter the nuclear-weapons industry. Ad Policy

The world’s powers remain at a crossroads. According to a recent Pew Poll, one of the few things Americans agree on today is that the nuclear threat coming from North Korea is real and should be taken seriously. On the other hand, the United Nations overwhelmingly voted to adopt a treaty that will prohibit nuclear weapons, and the disarmament movement, it seems, has never been more democratized. That is, ordinary people have never seemed to have such an impact on global affairs. So how can a campaign be awarded for its role in ridding the world of nuclear weapons when nuclear war seems so near?

The Norwegian Nobel Committee acknowledged ICAN’s role in the negotiations as the key factor for awarding it the Nobel Peace Prize for 2017. At this year’s ceremony, Berit Reiss-Andersen, chairman of the Nobel Committee, addressed critics of this movement: “Many people think that the vision of a nuclear weapons free world, global zero, is utopic, or even irresponsible. Similar arguments were once used to oppose treaties banning biological weapons, chemical weapons, cluster munitions and land mines. Nevertheless, the prohibitions became a reality and most of these weapons are far less prevalent as a result. Using them is a taboo.”

The Nobel chairwoman later invoked the words of Ronald Regan, saying, “A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The only value for our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will be never used, but then would it not be better to do away with them entirely?” Nuclear Weapons Resisting Nuclear Weapons Means Resisting Injustice and Oppression Ray Acheson

While many groups have come before them, ICAN is a unique coalition of people and organizations who have influenced governments to fill the crucial legal gap to nuclear disarmament, one they believe will help stigmatize and delegitimize these weapons as a valuable tool in global politics. Current Issue View our current issue

This global coalition has taken the reigns of the disarmament movement that has been active since the 1940s. Its approach has engaged activists and diplomats in the global south, from countries that have been exposed to nuclear weapons and rejected them. ICAN democratized nuclear disarmament as an issue for anyone to take part in.

There are too many people in ICAN to profile in one article, so I dug through to find different representatives from different corners of the earth. Each brought their own backgrounds, medical, legal, social, and all came together over a decade ago to lobby for the ban.

In Australia, ICAN began with Felicity Ruby, Dimity Hawkins, Dr. Bill Williams, Dr. Tilman Ruff, and others who launched the global effort with a strong medical and scientific perspective. According to Dr. Kathleen Sullivan, a disarmament educator in the United States, and one of the campaign’s earlier members, “the initial thinking revolved around horror, humor, and hope—to amplify the need for a louder nuclear taboo, to educate the public, reignite the movement fueled more by what we love than what we fear.”

Ray Acheson, director of Reaching Critical Will, the disarmament program at the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), was at the launch of ICAN in 2007 in Vienna, at a side event on the margins of the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee. “Originally the goal was to pursue a multilateral disarmament treaty with the nuclear-armed states’ support,” she explained, “but after these governments failed to implement their disarmament commitments and continued investing billions into nuclear-weapon modernization, our thinking shifted to go after a ban treaty instead.” While the nine nuclear-armed states and the NATO alliance show no signs of support for the treaty, ICAN helped design a treaty that didn’t need them, at least not at first. When Acheson appeared on Democracy Now!, the longtime member of ICAN’s International Steering Group said, “The treaty is actually designed not to include them necessarily. It would have been great if they had have come along, and it would have looked like a very different treaty. But given that they weren’t engaged in the negotiations and that they aren’t interested currently in disarmament, we needed to create something that could attack the system of nuclear weapons indirectly, getting around different economic, political, legal structures of nuclear weapons that keep the practices and policies of nuclear deterrence going currently.”

Tim Wright, director of ICAN Australia, was the very first volunteer back in 2006. Tim has advocated for ICAN in the Asia-Pacific region, and around the globe. According to Acheson, “He personally sat on the phone in New York and Australia and called individual countries to persuade them to join the humanitarian pledge against nuclear weapons, and will now do so for the treaty.” Wright, alongside a team of volunteers, also maintains the digital voice of ICAN, and constantly works to keep campaigners around the world informed and engaged with videos and social-media posts.

ICAN has inspired thousands of people around the world whose countries do not maintain nuclear arsenals to join the struggle for a nuclear-free world. Members like Drs. Peter Mburu and Kelvin Kibet of the International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) have been moved by the devastating effects nuclear war would have on the planet, including in their hometown of Nairobi, Kenya. Mburu admits, “It is true we have bigger problems—extreme poverty, corruption, youth unemployment, but there is a question of justice. A few countries can form a cabal hoarding power under pretenses of global security. The effects of nuclear weapons are well-documented, and even a small detonation would indiscriminately affect far too many people, including people in my part of the world, albeit indirectly. That is unacceptable.”

“Nuclear disarmament is not top priority in many non-nuclear-armed states, let alone in the developing world,” agreed Kibet.”Fighting poverty and disease among others come first. However, if a nuclear war happened, research shows that it’s the developing world that will be hardest hit.”

Lawyers, like Seth Shelden, a Fulbright specialist and a professor of law at CUNY, volunteered their time to ICAN to help ensure that the treaty would be as comprehensive and effective as possible. According to Shelden, “The treaty builds on existing international humanitarian law regarding use and threats of use of nuclear weapons, and goes several steps further by banning actions such as possession, testing, and development, as well as use and threats of use, of nuclear weapons under all circumstances.” It also addresses such issues as environmental remediation, victim assistance, and the illegality of stationing, transferring, and investing in nuclear weapons.

Maral Hassanshahi, a young Iranian physician studying at the University of Maryland–College Park, wanted “to stand up for myself and for others. I have seen women who could not defend themselves and live lives full of fear and regret. I didn’t want to be one of them.” She became a doctor and in her studies and activism learned how she could help the public through the Nobel Prize–winning IPPNW, which maintains an active presence in Iran. “ICAN has campaigned to inform people that the effects of these weapons are horrible, and even a limited use could affect them, too. They know no boundaries,” she says. “My work is mostly to empower and educate youth to work toward a healthier, safer world for everyone. Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous and destructive issue of our time and, together, we need to do something before it is too late.”

Dr. Carlos Umaña, director of IPPNW Costa Rica, also believes that just because his country doesn’t have nuclear weapons doesn’t mean he shouldn’t have a say on nuclear weapons-related issues. “There is really no such thing as a non-nuclear nation, for as long as any state has them, the entire international community lives under the nuclear threat.”

In 1967, Latin American governments created the first international nuclear-weapon-free zone, and have been involved since then in the fight for a nuclear-weapon-free world. However, “The Latin American public,” according to Silesky, “is preoccupied with other issues—such as violence, poverty, and instability. They do not think much about the nuclear threat.” He aims to change to that.

The global campaign convened on the United Nations Headquarters in New York to influence the treaty process. Coordinated by Daniel Högsta, ICAN’s campaigners and advocates encouraged member states to push for language agreed upon in campaigner meetings to ensure that the final draft was an effective document. However, at the heart of the negotiations were the testimony of those who have survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the countless others who have been exposed to nuclear tests.

Sue Coleman Haseldine knows all too well the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. She was exposed to the “black mist” fallout from tests held in her native homeland of Maralinga, in the southern Australian outback. Despite being evacuated to an outside compound, she was exposed as a child. She and her granddaughter suffer from thyroid cancer. Her township also has high levels of cancer. Haseldine believes the bombs brought this: “It has changed our genes,” she told her local media. “These diseases weren’t around before the bombs.”

Abacca Anjain Maddison hails from Rongelap, an island that will remain uninhabitable for generations because of radioactive contamination caused by nuclear testing conducted in the Pacific. A former senator of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, she travels the world with ICAN, gives voice to the survivors of the nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and aims to get compensation for the damage done to her land.

The earliest days of Setsuko Thurlow’s activism date back to 1954, when she came to the United States on a scholarship and she spoke out about the atmospheric testing in Bikini Atoll region. Setsuko Thurlow survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima when she was 13 years old. Like most children her age, she was mobilized for the war effort. On August 6 at 8:15 am she found herself buried in a collapsed building when the atomic blast ripped through her city. She told me how she escaped, but the ghostly victims, burned and mangled from the incredible heat still haunt her. “We Hibakusha have always felt that no one should ever allow what happened to us, to ever happen to another human being.”

When Thurlow accepted the Nobel on behalf of ICAN, she decried the use of nuclear weapons and being known as a victim: “We refused to wait for an immediate fiery end or the slow poisoning of our world. We refused to sit idly in terror as the so-called great powers took us past nuclear dusk and brought us recklessly close to nuclear midnight. We rose up. We shared our stories of survival. We said: Humanity and nuclear weapons cannot coexist.”

Members of ICAN refuse to accept the argument that nuclear weapons will never be abolished. Their strategy is to focus on the long term goal of abolishment, rather than short-term politics of who sits in what seat.

According to Acheson, ICAN’s next mission is to reach nuclear “umbrella” states, like those in NATO, and lobby against their practices. “We will work hard to ensure the treaty enters into force as quickly as possible—which means getting as many countries as possible from around the world to sign and ratify the treaty—our national campaigners will be very active in supportive states,” she said. The action plan involves educational programs, direct action, and parliamentary hearings to help reach both civil society and their political leaders."

It was the gun. It was the mental illness. It was the Tea. It was ""Second Amendment remedies"" and ""reload"" and candidates’ districts marked with cross hairs. It was glennbeckrushlimbaughmichaelsavagetalkradiotv with its 24/7 fomenting of hatred and contempt for Democrats, its antigovernment paranoia. It was the incivility. It was Arizona. It was the Internet. It was hypermasculinity and contempt for women. It was the gun. Ad Policy

It’s been only a few days since Jared Loughner opened fire with a Glock 19 in the Tucson supermarket parking lot where Representative Gabrielle Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet. And with Giffords gravely wounded, six dead and thirteen others injured, already millions of words have been written about why. In the Guardian, my Nation colleagues Gary Younge and Max Blumenthal point to Arizona’s poisonous right-wingery, some of it aimed directly at Giffords, a well-liked centrist Democrat: after she voted in favor of healthcare reform, her Tucson office was vandalized; at a 2009 meet-and-greet, a protester dropped a gun. In a letter to the New York Times, Giffords constituent Ronnie Bergen recalls attending a healthcare forum arranged by the Congresswoman: ""the event was packed with anti-Obama people, and the tone was ugly: shouting, rude, menacing individuals…. It was a chilling experience, even for one who had grown up in the bitter politics of the 1960s."" As Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik put it, Arizona has become ""the mecca for prejudice and bigotry.""

Might an unbalanced young man be influenced by the world around him? The very idea is ""political opportunism,"" harrumphs David Brooks: Loughner was simply deranged, possibly schizophrenic and ""locked in a world far removed from politics as we normally understand it.""

In a way, sure. For example, there’s no evidence that Loughner knew about Sarah Palin’s notorious electoral map on which Giffords’s district was one of twenty marked with cross hairs. This was a man who disrupted his community college math class by shouting out questions about the end of the world, posted gibberish on YouTube and was fired as an animal-shelter volunteer because he deliberately walked puppies in an area quarantined for parvovirus. But you don’t have to be Michel Foucault to understand that mentally ill people express their demons in ways that are culturally—and politically—inflected, and in Arizona that inflection is right-wing antigovernment hysteria. He may never have mentioned Palin (and really, must she always be the center of attention?), but his obsessions—the gold standard, government tyranny through mind control, the ""second Constitution""—are familiar themes of far-right patriot movements. Mark Potok, who monitors wing-nut extremism for the Southern Poverty Law Center, sees in the jumble of novels on Loughner’s MySpace page a theme of the individual against the totalitarian state, with Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto thrown in ""as variants of a kind of generalized ‘smash the state’ attitude."" And David Brooks, let’s get real: Loughner opened fire on a government event—a Democratic government event—not a shopping mall, a swimming pool or a classroom at Pima County Community College, from which he’d been suspended.

It used to be that after a spectacular killing there would be a lot of hopeful/rueful talk about keeping it from happening again: the media would be full of self-examinations and mea culpas, calls for more tolerance, more civic engagement and better laws. Who hasn’t vowed never to be like Kitty Genovese’s neighbors? Now right-wingers claim that they are the real victims of the Tucson shooting: Palin has just released a video claiming that attacks on her cross-hairs map are a ""blood libel."" (Because it’s Sarah Palin, one wonders if she even knows that ""blood libel"" almost always refers to anti-Semitic accusations that Jews kill Christian children and use their blood for ritual purposes.) Rush Limbaugh ""jokes"" that Loughner has Democrats’ ""full support"" because now they can take away your guns.

As if. Democrats abandoned gun control years ago, when they decided it lost Gore crucial votes in 2000 and they pivoted to go after the white male vote. Even progressives dropped the issue as hopeless, part of what made NASCAR dads and other red-state he-men see them as effete, effeminate and out of touch. Jon Tester, Brian Schweitzer and Jim Webb got high marks from both the NRA and progressives. Now there are some sixty-five pro-gun Democrats in Congress, including, ironically, Giffords. What are the chances they’ll support the bill Carolyn McCarthy is proposing, which would ban the sale of large ammunition clips like the one Loughner used? Or even Republican Peter King’s call to ban carrying guns within 1,000 feet of certain elected officials and judges? As Howard Dean told Lawrence O’Donnell on The Last Word, ""The so-called pro-gun lobby has won,"" and the most we can do is ""something around the edges."" That is what passes for a positive, muscular, vigorous response in the most highly armed nation in the world, with ninety guns for every 100 people, 10,000 gun murders a year and 20,000 more gun deaths from suicide and accidents.

We can’t ban speech. But whatever Loughner’s demons turn out to be, what let him kill six people and wound fourteen was that he had access to a gun—and a magazine that let him shoot thirty-three bullets without reloading. (Indeed, the Glock 19 was the same model gun Seung-Hui Cho used to kill thirty-two people at Virginia Tech.) It’s a little pathetic—has it really come to this, that it will be a huge uphill battle to ban something that has no purpose except to kill up to thirty-three people before anyone can stop you? Apparently, yes. In Arizona, Glocks have been flying off the shelves since the shootings. Meanwhile, in Congress, Democrat Heath Shuler and Republican Jason Chaffetz have announced they will be packing heat."

On Saturday night, Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old black boy who was said to be well-liked, died after Balch Springs police officer Roy Oliver fired his gun at the car in which Edwards was riding. Oliver shot Edwards in the head, and Edwards succumbed to the wound at a nearby hospital. Ad Policy

When I first saw Edwards’s school picture on Monday, I smiled. The cheesy background, the adolescent forehead acne, the half-smile—like he wanted to bare his teeth but knew that would slash his cool in half—were all familiar. It’s the kind of photo I remember putting in my middle-school diary—scored from a boy I had a crush on, after giving him mine. I wondered whether Edwards gave his crush this school photo, and if the crush pasted it in their diary with a heart around it like I once did.

And then I remembered Edwards was dead and that the diary entries of those who knew and loved him would never be about him as a person who lives.

The story of a black boy shot dead by law enforcement is a regrettably commonplace one at this point. Last year The Washington Post found that even though black Americans represent only 13 percent of the population, they are 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by law enforcement. The photo of Edwards feels particularly reminiscent of the widely circulated photo of Jordan Davis, another teen who was shot in a car by a white man, in 2012.

Each time a black boy is shot and killed we go through the same trauma. A photo of the boy is released, his sweet, pimply face imprinted in our minds. And every time this happens we think, “Maybe, just maybe this will be the boy who gets justice.”

And every time this happens, there is always a glimmer of hope that the justice system will bring accountability to the perpetrators and the police department they work for. I remember that sense of hope right before the it was announced that no charges would be brought against the officer who shot dead 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Surely, I thought, justice would be brought for a child. I was wrong.

Then there was Freddie Gray, whose death sparked powerful civil unrest in Baltimore. After the state’s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, brought charges against the officers involved in his death, I thought, surely, they’ll be found guilty. Instead, two officers were acquitted and then the prosecutor’s office decided not to proceed on the charges brought against other four officers involved.

And I remember feeling that sense of hope when it was a possibility that the cops involved in the shooting death of Louisiana man Alton Sterling could face federal charges. On Wednesday, in the midst of news over Edwards’s case, the Justice Department announced that it would not seek charges.

I can count on one finger the times a police officer has even gotten to the point of guilty plea in a high-profile case—once. On Tuesday, Michael Slager, the officer who fired eight rounds and killed 33-year-old Walter Scott, pleaded guilty to the charge of violating Scott’s civil rights by using excessive force.

But that glimmer of hope returned on Tuesday. This time, the police admitted that the story they originally gave to the public—that police fired shots at the car Edwards was riding in because the driver of the car was backing it up and using the car as a weapon—was false. The officer was even fired from the force. Balch Springs police chief Jonathan Haber did not mince words about holding the officer who shot and killed Edwards accountable. “From our policies, which I went by, there were violations. I acted on them,” Haber told the Dallas News on Tuesday evening. Balch Springs is a suburb of Dallas, which employs one of the largest forces in the country, and its police chief, David Brown, “a reformer,” has dedicated his career to improving relations between community members and police by advocating for a reduction in the use of force.

Now that a tragedy has taken place, the police department in Balch Springs might be trying its best to respond to the needs of Edwards’s family and the community at large. But the department already knew that Oliver was troubled. According to an NBC News report, Oliver was ordered to attend anger-management classes in 2013 after he lashed out on the stand in court. Arisha Michelle Hatch, a managing director at the racial-justice organization Color of Change, is wary of labeling the response in Balch Springs as progress. “Such a low bar has been set for responsiveness from police and prosecutors in tragic situations like these—so from that standpoint, the decisions made by the Balch Springs’s police department to correct the record about the events that led to Jordan’s death and to fire one of the officers feels extraordinary,” she tells me. But there are “troubling signs,” she said, that point to “deeper problems” in the department. Edwards’s brother, who was in the car with Jordan, was held in jail after his brother was shot in the head, but the police officer who shot Jordan was not. Hatch also wonders why the district attorney hasn’t made a statement, why the video of the shooting hasn’t been released to the public, and why the officer hasn’t been arrested. “There’s still so much work to do to shift to a culture of accountability around policing,” Hatch says.

No matter how proactively the Balch Springs PD responds to this killing, without a Department of Justice that seeks to hold police departments accountable, as it did during the Obama era, the actions taken by this suburb will be just a blip, an anomaly. The change in administrations—from a Department of Justice committed to reducing police violence against black Americans, to one that seeks to eliminate all traces of that commitment—makes the fight for police accountability even that much tougher for families and communities impacted by excessive force.

In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered a speech in Detroit that explicitly named the Justice Department’s position on police accountability. “The communities we serve must see our commitment to the impartial enforcement of our nation’s laws—every day,” he told the crowd. “Our communities must know that we enforce the laws that protect our civil rights with the same vigor that we enforce the laws that protect our public safety. I can assure you that under my leadership, the Department of Justice will enforce all of our nation’s laws, with equal conviction.”

Under Obama, the Justice Department did indeed make strides in holding individual police forces accountable. After 18-year-old Michael Brown died in a police-involved shooting in Ferguson, the DoJ investigated the police department and published a damning report that said there was a pattern of discrimination against the city’s black residents. The department did the same thing in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray. The DoJ also entered into formal agreements with 15 troubled police departments across the country to reduce discrimination.

But since Jeff Sessions took the helm at the Justice Department, he has made it clear that he is committed to rolling back the incremental and institutional changes the former administration’s DoJ had set in motion. Sessions has announced that he plans to review all existing reform agreements between the DoJ and police departments and has said on multiple occasions that criticisms of police departments leads to an increase in crime.

Without federal oversight, troubled police departments that do not already have a strong commitment to accountability will continue to shoot and kill unarmed black men without an iota of fear that they will be held responsible. And that is a terrifying possibility."

A friend recently played a tape for me which he had made at the press conference when Bill Leonard, head of CBS News, announced that Dan Rather would succeed Walter Cronkite as anchorman and managing editor of CBS Evening News, a job Cronkite had held for nineteen years. The mood of the occasion was almost randomly solemn or businesslike or playful– as though no one could be certain as to how seriously the changeover should be taken. The principal concern, I sensed, was for the American people. There seemed a chance that Cronkite had accidentally become our electronic monarch, in which case this ordinary corporate event, the semi-retirement of an employee at the age of 65, had better sound a little like an abdication followed by a coronation–which it did.

Rather was the most solemn of all, and that is nothing against him. I don't see how he could have gotten out of being humble yet brave, and so on.

But that was a year ago. The actual crisis is upon us. On March 6, Cronkite vanishes from the Evening News, as promised. This is a test of how crazy television can make us, or fail to make us, and the news is good. I can find no one who feels that we are losing a leadership figure of any sort. The people have somehow managed to keep Cronkite nicely in scale–with a lot of help from Cronkite himself. A subliminal message in every one of his broadcasts was that he had no power and wanted none. So now we feel that a kindly and intelligent teacher is leaving our village. It turns out not to matter that the village happens to be as big as all outdoors.

I have seen Cronkite laugh like Father Christmas when he is told that he should run for President or Vice President or Senator. No one ever seems to mention a governorship or a seat in the House of Representatives. I have also noticed that nobody else laughs much at the joke, even when Cronkite explains it–when he says that he is only a newsman, Without any of the gifts and enthusiasms good leaders have. He intimated in a recent interview that he hadn't even aspired to be a big shot in television, that he would have been nearly as contented as he is today if he had remained what he was in the beginning–a print journalist of no great fame. He loves his family. He loves his friends. He loves his sailboat. And he remains as entranced by the unfolding of each day's news as a child with a new kaleidoscope.

What makes it hard for others to laugh along with him is that this is the land of opportunity, and no one here is supposed to fail to snatch any opportunity that is unlucky enough to be caught in the open. Walter Cronkite could have been President of this country, just as George Washington in his own day could have become King. All he had to do was to lose his temper in public, and to pick a side:

""This is Walter Cronkite, born in Joplin, Missouri, and raised in Texas, and you all know me, and I am fed to the teeth with all the stupidity and greed I see in Washington. I can no longer sit by idly and so on.

His last name is Dutch, by the way–like Roosevelt.

Morley Safer, Cronkite's CBS colleague for the past fifteen years, said the other day that he expected local rather than national television news people to transmute their popularity into hard-edged political power. I thought at once of a young man of my acquaintance who had been a star reporter a few years back on a local show here in New York City. At the age of 30, he concluded in all seriousness that he should run for mayor, and that nobody could stop him.

""Why should you be mayor?"" I asked him.

""Because nobody can jive me,"" he replied.

The young man was a famous crusader. Cronkite is not. He may still become one, although I myself do not particularly recommend it, but he has so far done nothing to match, for example, Edward R. Murrow's vivisection of Senator Joseph McCarthy on the air. Cronkite's lack of rudeness to any political faction over so many years may have had a curious side effect, as unwelcome to him, I'm sure, as it should be to all of us: he may have encouraged us to imagine that there is a sort of sanity and wisdom on which all Americans can and-should agree. Cronkite is not our electronic monarch–but he just might, accidentally, have become our electronic Uncle Sam.

No, Virginia, this is an acrimoniously pluralistic society. There is no Uncle Sam.

I asked Safer if there were any particular political, issues in which Cronkite had felt personally involved year after year. He said that Cronkite, as a public speaker off the air, is regularly angry and disgusted and alarmed over anyone, no matter how powerful or popular, who would in any way limit the freedom of the press.

This, I submit, is not how Uncle Sam talks. It is the romantic stubbornness of an old newspaperman.

Safer said, too, that when he worked under him Cronkite declared with utmost sincerity that his assistants were doing all the work, and that the investigating they were doing out in the world was what he himself most loved to do.

This is the raffish gallantry of an old newspaperman.

Cronkite steps aside just as old newspapermen are becoming as legendary as cowboys. As young as this country is, we will have a rich mythology, by and by. Radio and television news began with old newspaper people. How else could they have begun?

The noun ""press"" is now archaic as applied to news editors and reporters. Equally antique is the cliche that describes Walter Cronkite so well:

""He has printer's ink in his veins."""

Like a medieval wizard, Donald Trump has performed an extraordinary act of alchemy in recent months. He has converted one thing into something different entirely. Instead of an election being “a discussion and contest about policies and policy choices,” he has changed its definition. In 2016, in the GOP primary—and possibly in the general election itself—he has remade “election” to be “a popularity contest based around spectacle.” Ad Policy

As a political journalist, I’d say it’s craziness-inducing. Quite simply, there are no in-depth policies or ideas in the Trump campaign, other than build a wall, deport some people, impose some vague tariffs on China and other global competitors, and “make America great again.” It’s almost certainly the flimsiest set of proposals of any presidential campaign in history. And that’s deliberate. A campaign about absolutely nothing is a campaign that devolves into a reality TV–style popularity contest. Which is why we now have the ungodly spectacle of Marco Rubio saying Trump pees his pants and Trump saying Rubio sweats too much. It’s the ultimate infantilization of politics, reducing everything to a spectacle of the crass and the absurd. And in such a milieu, with the political process utterly denuded of politics, a barbarian such as Trump has a huge advantage. He plays the caveman game better than anyone else. He throws bigger and better tantrums, and his insults are coarser and harsher.

If you look back at history, that’s what Fascist messages, whether it be Mussolini’s rise or Hitler’s, Pinochet’s or Somoza’s, have always been: a vile stew of inchoate nationalism and racism, an iron-fist intolerance for dissent, a lot of name-calling and bluster, and a gross simplification of every political and sociological problem. Ultimately, all prospect for real social reform gets silenced, because the political process no longer has room, or even language, for proper policy debate and discussion; and the culture as a whole becomes completely debased.

We already see that in the vast GOP crowds Trump is drawing—people who treat the choice of president, the choice of whose finger should be on the nuclear button, as no different from a WWE spectacle or a vote on American Idol or The Apprentice. They don’t want to talk about climate change; or refugees—other than to bar them or deport them; Syria—other than to say they hate all Muslims; poverty; or global public health challenges. They don’t want to discuss education or wealth inequity. They have no desire for a conversation on how to get the uninsured access to doctors, or how to fix public infrastructure, or how to deal with police brutality, or the heroin epidemic, or the crisis in affordable housing. Or how to secure nuclear materials, or how to deal with the potential implosion of the European Union.

There’s nothing about any of these issues of national or international significance in a Trump speech. In fact, there’s nothing that in any understandable form is political. His campaign speeches are about “toughness” and national salvation. His victory speeches, when he notches up another primary success, are barely literate bromides about the joys of greed and of grabbing. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Trump’s supporters want theater—and not of the highbrow variety. They want blood and gore, tits and ass. They want adrenalin. If Trump took his cock out and shook it about onstage, I suspect his audiences would go wild. They want the money shot. Which is why they love it when he urges them to beat up protesters, or when he calls his opponents crybabies, or when he mocks a female journalist for menstruating.

This is, quite simply, pornography vaguely masquerading as politics. Which is why the other GOP candidates have had so little success knocking him off the pedestal. They are, however crudely, politicians; and, as politicians tend to do in an election, they’re talking politics. Trump is a manipulative stage-man, like the snake-oil sellers of yesteryear…and while his rivals talk politics, he sells his snake oil. His extraordinary success has come about not because he’s out-politicking Rubio et al., but because he has convinced the GOP electorate that this election has absolutely nothing to do with politics. He hasn’t done an end run around his opponents; he has simply decided to play a different game on an entirely different field.

The Romans in their decadence had bread and circuses, as well as gladiatorial combat, to keep the masses happy. We, apparently, now have reality TV and WWE. The Romans ended up with their Neros and Caligulas, mad megalomaniacs with brains warped by lead poisoning and gene pools warped by incest. We have Trump, whose bullying, self-pitying, aggrandizing rants suggest something approaching syphilitic madness.

But there is one difference: The problems Roman emperors had to deal with didn’t have quite the globally cataclysmic potential that today’s great challenges do. The Roman emperors didn’t control thousands of nuclear weapons, nor did they have to make critical decisions regarding how to put the brakes on climate change.

If the GOP base has now, finally, fully devolved into a mob, and if that mob wants spectacle instead of policy, the party has signed its own death warrant. It will have ceased to function as a political party and will have become simply a springboard for demagogues.

In the long run, because I have to believe in an arc of progress spanning the great eons of history, I can only hope that such a group will eventually become irrelevant—a vengeful, thuggish outlier on the edge of the political system. But as John Maynard Keynes once noted, “In the long run we are all dead.” The vast, overwhelming question of the moment is what happens in the short term? How do we as a country rescue the political process—that extraordinary process by which the most powerful country on Earth chooses its leaders, its public face, its top officials, whose every decision affects every corner of the globe—from this grotesque, pornographic, alchemical hijacking that it is now facing? If we don’t, the lights will go out all over America—as Sir Edward Grey, Britain’s foreign secretary, said of Europe, when pondering the hideous spectacle of the continent sliding into what would become the First World War—and they won’t come on again in our lifetimes."

Ad Policy This article was reported in partnership with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute, with support from the Puffin Foundation. Louis Baggetto contributed data analysis to this report.

One of them was South Side resident Damian Turner. A tall, charismatic teenager with a passion for video games and rapping, 18-year-old Turner had cofounded the grassroots activist group Fearless Leading by the Youth (FLY). With it, he campaigned to improve conditions at a city juvenile-detention center. On August 15, he was shot in the back just after midnight at a South Side intersection. He was pronounced dead about an hour later, after an ambulance drove him to a downtown hospital.

The next week, about a month before Turner would have turned 19, friends and family packed the nearby St. Andrews Temple for his funeral, where they received copies of his rap mixtape. “People really didn’t want to listen to it, because they were going to cry,” recalled Turner’s stepsister Alexssa Moore.

Turner’s homicide—the result of a stray bullet from a drive-by shooting—was one of 436 in Chicago that year. But it stirred a city in which activists, politicians, and medical experts were already grappling with the absence of trauma care for the victims of gun violence on the South Side. After Turner died, FLY made his 10-mile ambulance trip downtown its signature issue.

* * *

On what would have been Turner’s 19th birthday, members of FLY and its parent organization, Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP), held a rally in front of the University of Chicago Medical Center to call for the opening of a facility that would treat severely injured patients. The state-of-the-art medical complex, which touts itself as “The Forefront of Medicine” and is backed by a $782 million endowment, sits in the affluent neighborhood of Hyde Park, just four blocks north of the weedy intersection where Turner was shot. But like many other South Side shooting victims, Turner traveled downtown, to the trauma center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Often, the victims of traumatic injuries—caused by such things as car crashes, shootings, and falls—are taken to the nearest trauma center, hospital operating rooms equipped with cutting-edge tools and teams of specialized surgeons. Severely injured patients are 25 percent less likely to die if they receive treatment at a top-level trauma center than if they are treated in an emergency room. But it’s been 25 years since the South Side has had one. The University of Chicago Medical Center closed its adult trauma center in 1988, after only two years of operation. And in 1990, the South Side’s last adult trauma center closed. Today, the only four adult trauma facilities within city limits are downtown and on the North and West sides.

FLY has argued that the university’s lack of an adult trauma center fuels a serious health inequity, disproportionately affecting black youth in some of the city’s most violent neighborhoods. Since 2010, FLY’s fight for the University of Chicago Medical Center to open a trauma center has mushroomed into a full-blown movement, fueled by support from doctors, students, religious leaders, and union nurses who are convinced that a South Side trauma center would save lives.

“Nobody on this earth deserves to die if they have a chance to live,” Turner’s mother, Sheila Rush, told The Nation in an interview last May. “My son did not even have a chance, because he was fighting for his life on the way in that ambulance on that long ride to the hospital.”

Representative Bobby Rush of Chicago—who introduced a bill in Congress in 2013 that would have appropriated $100 million in federal funds for trauma centers—lays part of the blame for his own son’s shooting death in 1999 on the University of Chicago’s lack of a trauma center. “The fact that a community that’s home to about 750,000 people on the greater South Side of Chicago—an overwhelming portion of which sits in my congressional district—does not have one, not one, Level I trauma-care center literally results in the needless loss of life for far too many of us,” Rush testified before Congress in 2011.

In 1984, years before Michael Jordan was a household name, Chicagoans were getting excited about another, younger homegrown basketball star: Ben Wilson, who had been named the best high-school player in the country. But the 17-year-old athlete’s career was cut short after he was shot twice outside his high school—less than five miles away from where Turner was shot—and operated on more than two hours later at a hospital without a trauma center.

Nine Chicago-area trauma centers banded together to form a network two years later, to direct ambulances to the closest, most appropriate care available. Although several hospitals have since left the system, one of the architects of the original network, Dr. Gary Merlotti of Chicago’s Mount Sinai Hospital, insists that the city suffers from neither an insufficient quantity nor quality of trauma centers.

“I don’t think we have an inadequate number,” Merlotti says. “We have a geographic maldistribution.”

Activists calling for a South Side trauma center agree. But it wasn’t until two years ago that they could point to hard data to make their case.

A 2013 study, led by Northwestern University trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, found that Chicago gunshot-wound victims more than five miles away from a trauma center were likelier to die. She dubbed these regions “trauma deserts.” According to a Nation analysis of city data, nearly a fifth of Chicago residents live five or more miles away from a trauma center, most of them on the South Side. And between 2001 and 2013, more than a third of the city’s homicides and shootings have taken place more than five miles away from a trauma center.

“I found that particularly with life-threatening gunshot wounds or stab wounds to the heart or to the chest, that I wasn’t saving those folks that I might have saved when I was a resident,” said Crandall, whose curiosity was sparked because the majority of her downtown hospital’s gunshot-wound victims hail from the city’s South Side, more than a dozen miles away.

Another study, published last year and led by Dr. Renee Hsia of the University of San Francisco, focused on California. It determined that victims of all types of traumatic injuries were 21 percent more likely to die if their driving time to a trauma center increased after the closure of their nearest facility.

While trauma-care experts have criticized the research, most notably for its focus on distance instead of time, they have also found its premise to be straightforward and reasonable. “Obviously, the longer distance you are from definitive care by experts, the more likely the outcome from whatever physiologic derangement is afflicting you will be less favorable,” said Dr. Joseph Tepas, a trauma researcher at UF Health Jacksonville in Florida. “That’s logic.”

In fact, the idea that trauma patients who wait longer for treatment are likelier to die is a cornerstone of American trauma care. In 1960, the US Army gave Dr. R. Adams Cowley of the University of Maryland Medical Center a grant to study severe civilian injuries. The researcher—commonly called the “father of trauma care”—used it to open the country’s first-ever hospital trauma unit, a four-bed section dubbed the “death lab,” in which he treated and studied dying patients. Cowley’s observations produced his theory of the “golden hour,” a period after traumatic injury in which medical attention is most likely to save a life. It remains accepted wisdom that trauma patients face a much higher risk of dying the longer they wait for care.

The creation of trauma centers grew in tandem with federal involvement in coordinating emergency medical services, driven by the expansion of the national highway system and a rise in automobile accidents. In 1973, President Richard Nixon signed the Emergency Medical Service Systems Act. This led to the appropriation of more than $300 million to develop and expand regional EMS systems across the country. Hospitals joined in, hoping to attract patients, staff, and revenue by investing in trauma centers. By the mid-1980s, however, the trend in some regions had reversed. One major factor was a shift in Medicare reimbursements in 1982: Seeking to rein in hospital bills, Congress switched the program from a retrospective to a prospective payment system, setting average payments for specific classes of illnesses instead of covering the cost of individual Medicare patients’ treatments after the fact. The aim was to encourage cost-effective treatments by letting hospitals keep the difference between actual treatment costs and Medicare payments. But trauma centers paid a price: The initial prospective payments not only failed to account for the severity of patient injuries, but they ultimately put tremendous financial pressure on a hospital’s overall finances. As R. Adams Cowley and his colleagues found in a 1992 study of 44 recently closed trauma centers, this payment shift was cited by hospital administrators as one of the top reasons for the closures of their trauma centers.

In 1991, one year after the South Side’s last trauma center closed its doors, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) recognized urban trauma-center closures as a disturbing phenomenon, citing 22 such closures nationwide since the mid-1980s in the six major American cities they studied: Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, Miami, San Diego, and Washington. According to the report, the South Side’s last trauma center—the one at which Damian Turner would have been treated for his gunshot wound—closed in 1990, largely due to a doubling of its caseload, and three other metropolitan areas out of the six in the study experienced a similar phenomenon. “When trauma centers withdraw from established trauma systems, the patients who normally would be seen at those closed facilities must be taken to other, open trauma centers, usually the next closest in the system,” the GAO noted. “If continued, the domino effect can deteriorate trauma systems to the point of failure.”

A Nation analysis of American Hospital Association data from the 25 biggest US cities reveals that between fiscal years 2006 and 2011, a dozen hospitals with trauma centers closed. In East St. Louis, Illinois, where 98 percent of the population is black and 47 percent live below the poverty line, the approximately 27,000 residents were served by a single facility, Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital, which housed the only trauma center in the city. The trauma center closed in 2008, and the hospital itself shut down in 2011. “It was a horrible feeling,” then-mayor Alvin Parks said. “I can remember standing there, in front of Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital the day that the trauma center was going to close. It was snowy, it was sleeting, and we stood out in front of the hospital, protesting the closure of the trauma center, with many people with tears in their eyes, because we knew that some people were going to die as a result of the trauma center being closed.”

* * *

At a coffee shop in Damian Turner’s neighborhood last April, antiviolence activists Jimmy Poole and Martin Johnson debated the South Side’s lack of trauma care. Johnson insisted that the absence of a trauma center at University of Chicago Medical Center was “racially motivated and discriminatory to the poor.” But Poole maintained that it was about cost, not color.

¨You can’t put a number on a moral obligation,” Johnson countered.

“No, you can’t,” Poole replied. Then he asked Johnson to imagine the number of people who would come to the only trauma center on the South Side.

In 1987, a year before it closed, the UCMC’s trauma center accrued a $2 million loss treating 217 patients—65 percent of them subsidized or uninsured. In the first three months after the UCMC facility closed, most new patients at the South Side’s last remaining trauma center were government-insured or uninsured, and the hospital lost $400,000. The cost of caring for uninsured and government-insured patients is a major factor in a trauma center’s profitability. Because patients by law cannot be denied care once at an emergency facility, trauma centers have no choice but to provide care, whether it pays or not.

“The major challenge with keeping trauma centers open is the financial aspect: If you’re not seeing the cases that are paying your bills, it’s very difficult to keep a trauma center solvent,” says Ian Weston, executive director of the advocacy group American Trauma Society.

According to estimates by the Trauma Center Association of America, the cost of treating uninsured trauma patients alone is at least $230 million a year. Penetrating trauma—which includes gunshot wounds and stabbings—is more common among uninsured patients and at urban trauma centers.

As the battle for a South Side trauma center rages, the Nashville-based Hospital Corporation of America has, since 2010, opened five new trauma centers in Florida, all of which operate in zip codes where a majority of the residents have health insurance. And in four out of the five zip codes, a majority of the residents have private insurance. (HCA has since been accused of inflating treatment charges.)

HCA’s openings stand in stark contrast to the closings on the South Side, where a well-endowed nonprofit institution like UCMC may be able to cover the losses incurred by treating uninsured trauma patients, but lacks any financial incentive to do so.

“This sign behind is more than a sign. it’s a prescription for the University of Chicago,” FLY activist Veronica Morris-Moore told a May 2014 rally of some two dozen activists flanked by reporters and cameras. Unfurled near the medical center’s entrance was a banner reading Rx Prescription, with the words Trauma Center Now below it. So far, FLY’s prescription has proved a bitter pill, one that the university is unlikely to swallow. So what can be done for the South Side and similar communities across the United States?

Jennifer Ward, president of the Trauma Center Association of America, argues that one solution is ensuring that everyone has a right to high-quality trauma care, just as they do police, fire-fighting, or ambulance services. “I think that the country needs to understand that trauma-center care should be categorized in the same way as any other public good,” she says.

The Affordable Care Act may reduce the number of uninsured trauma patients, which in turn might help trauma centers better handle their costs—but only in those states that don’t opt out of Medicaid expansion. Some states already subsidize uncompensated trauma care with taxes on cigarettes (Hawaii) or fines on driver offenses (Texas). But in those states, the safety net for financially vulnerable trauma centers with a large population of uninsured patients remains tied to state economies and budgets.

Federal funding could ease the burden. In 2010, Congress passed legislation authorizing $100 million every year through 2015 to help cover the cost of uncompensated trauma care. Yet Congress never appropriated those funds, even in the wake of the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), who survived thanks to treatment at the only Level I trauma center in southern Arizona.

From the top down, advocacy for federal trauma-care funding has fallen on deaf ears. President Obama has never mentioned trauma centers in any of his proposed budgets. And since fiscal year 2010, trauma centers have never appeared in any of Congress’s appropriation bills.

Funding may be on the way: In March, the House of Representatives passed the Access to Life-Saving Trauma Care for All Americans Act, which would authorize $100 million in grants for uncompensated trauma care through 2020. As of press time, the bill—introduced by Representative Michael Burgess (R-TX)—has been referred to the Senate. Even if the bill passed, Congress would still need to appropriate the funds, which would cover only a portion of the country’s uncompensated trauma-care costs.

But in the meantime, injury will continue to strike often and without warning, and its unluckiest victims will remain at the mercy of hospital balance sheets.

“You try and go to any private institution with a colon cancer and see if they’ll take care of you. And the answer is they won’t,” Dr. Merlotti says. “But in that circumstance, you have some time to locate somebody who will. Trauma doesn’t afford that opportunity.”"

It’s been a month since former New York Police Department Officer Peter Liang was found guilty of manslaughter, but the movement to “save” him is gaining momentum. Liang, who in 2014 shot and killed Akai Gurley, an unarmed 28-year-old black man, is Chinese-American. He’s also the first New York City cop to be convicted in a police-involved shooting in more than a decade, causing many people in Asian-American communities to accuse the justice system of “scapegoating.” In the immediate aftermath of his conviction, thousands of supporters rallied in cities across the country, flooding the streets with signs that read: “Save Peter Liang,” “No Selective Justice,” and “One Tragedy, Two Victims.” Last week, amid continued calls for protest and massive social media support, Liang began to assemble a new team of lawyers to appeal the verdict. Ad Policy

On February 5, I sat in a cramped courtroom watching his trial alongside other journalists, the Brooklyn district attorney, and supporters of both Peter Liang and Akai Gurley’s family. The basic events of the evening are not disputed: On November 20, 2014, Liang and his partner were patrolling a Brooklyn housing project when he shot Gurley in a dark stairwell. They did not attempt to resuscitate Gurley, and spent two critical minutes debating whether to call their supervisor while Liang said over and over again that he was going to lose his job. Gurley was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Liang maintains he fired his weapon by accident, and that he was in shock and inadequately trained to perform CPR. As the room waited impatiently for the defense to present its case, I caught a glimpse of Liang sitting next to his lawyers on the far side of the room. His head was bowed low, his back small. The sight of him conjured in me a familiar sense of despair.

As a daughter of Japanese parents, I’ve often felt a deep sense of duty and obligation, perhaps a burden, that I couldn’t quite explain to my white peers. That is, for an Asian kid, there always seemed to be more at stake. The narrative of the model minority has been so deeply embedded into the Asian immigration story that it’s seeped into our collective psyche. Our “success” is a way of justifying why we’re here and why we belong. Our sense of worth is tied to the “success” of our people as a whole. To fail is to betray generations. It’s hard to explain the depth of filial piety, but it’s impossible to understand Asian support for Liang without it. Peter Liang is everything to his parents. As I watched Liang and his family in the courtroom, I saw my parents in his, myself in him. But no matter how deeply I felt this cultural kinship, I couldn’t defend him.

The following week, Akai Gurley’s family and those of other victims of police shootings gathered outside the courthouse for a press conference. I stood by as cameras swarmed around them on the sidewalk, cars zipping behind them. Among those who spoke was Nicholas Heyward Sr., the father of Nicholas Heyward Jr., an African-American boy shot by a police officer in 1994. Like Akai Gurley, he was shot in the dark stairwell of a New York City housing project. He was 13 years old. More than 20 years later, Heyward Sr. was standing in front of the courthouse again, holding up a picture of his son in his hand. I felt the weight of one’s life being changed forever.

Our “success” comes at a cost. What supporters of Peter Liang are asking for is to grant Liang, like Darren Wilson and Daniel Pantaleo, the license to take black lives at will. In other words, to defend Liang is to affirm the system in place. The final stage of our “success,” then, is to achieve equal status with the oppressor, so that we too can fully enjoy the fruits of white supremacy, even if it means casting aside those who are impoverished and discriminated against in our own communities under the shadow of the model minority myth.

But there are those in our communities who stand on the other side. As Akai Gurley’s family members spoke that day, they were surrounded by young Asian-American activists, some raising their fists in the air. They were members of the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV), a pan-Asian community organization based in Chinatown that helps low-income Asian immigrants and refugees living in the city. Founded in 1986, the group opposes institutional racism, and from the beginning has called for the indictment of Peter Liang despite relentless attacks from pro-Liang groups. LIKE THIS?

As snow began to fall onto the sidewalk, Cathy Dang, executive director of CAAAV, stood before the cameras and recited the names of two Asian-American men beaten by the Police Department: Peter Yew, a young Chinese-American engineer living in New York City who was brutalized by cops during a traffic stop in 1975; and Kang Wong, an 84-year-old Chinese man, who was battered in 2014 for allegedly “jaywalking.” In both cases, Dang pointed out, it was black communities that stood on the front lines with Asian-American protesters.

It is undeniable that the very rights and freedoms we have today are inextricably tied to black struggle—they were fought for and won by warriors in the civil-rights and black nationalist movements, carried on today by Black Lives Matter. In what was to be his last public speech, Malcolm X put forth the basic premise that black liberation lies at the core of the liberation of all peoples. “It is incorrect to classify the revolt of the Negro as simply a racial conflict of black against white, or as purely an American problem,” he told the room of students. “Rather, we are today seeing a global rebellion of the oppressed against the oppressor, the exploited against the exploiters.”

From the internment of Japanese Americans in the 1940s to the brutal murder of Vincent Chin in 1982, Asian Americans have often been on the side of the oppressed rather than the oppressor. As writer I.Y. Lee writes in her essay “Are We Trayvon Martin?,” Grace Lee Boggs, Yuri Kochiyama, and other Asian-American leaders worked closely with black organizers, including Malcolm X, during the civil-rights movement, reifying the Afro-Asian solidarity that raged against a system bent on dividing people of color. As antiblack racism permeates almost every facet of society today, we need to ask ourselves once again: Whose side are we on?

Peter Liang killed Akai Gurley. As Gurley lay dying, Liang didn’t call the ambulance. He didn’t offer any medical assistance. In that moment, he deprived a parent of a son and a child of a father. No, this verdict wasn’t a tragedy. No, there weren’t two victims. Peter Liang is part of a racist system that tries to tell us black lives don’t matter. We must stand with Akai Gurley’s family in opposition to any appeal of Liang’s conviction, call for systemic change in the Police Department, and demand all police officers be held accountable. Until we see the loss of Akai Gurley as the loss of our own, we are complicit in the cycle of systemic racism—and our own oppression."

Last night around 10:45 in Minneapolis, a group of suspected white supremacists opened fire on a crowd of Black Lives Matter activists, injuring five people. All five were taken to the hospital and one underwent surgery early this morning. The shooters targeted a Black Lives Matter encampment near the Minneapolis Police Department’s 4th Precinct, where protesters have remained for over a week to demand consequences for the police killing of unarmed 24-year-old Jamar Clark. Ad Policy

Miski Noor, a Black Lives Matter organizer, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “A group of white supremacists showed up at the protest, as they have done most nights.” Noor told the Star Tribune that when Black Lives Matter activists tried to get the group to leave, “they opened fire on about six protesters.”

The attackers, some of whom were allegedly wearing masks and bullet-proof vests, fled from the encampment, which was a block away from the police station. Many protesters at the encampment claim police officers simply stood around. One Black Lives Matter activist, Toor, 21, came to the encampment after work, having heard about the shooting. “People heard the police saying, ‘This is what you wanted, this is what you asked for.’” According to one eyewitness, it took the police 15 to 20 minutes to respond, evoking the Ferguson police’s decision to let the body of Michael Brown lie outside for hours.

Cops started macing concerned bystanders and being violent was even more triggering #4thPrecinctShutDown — h a f s a (@QUESADILLABABY) November 24, 2015

The police did not respond to these specific accusations and issued a statement claiming that officers immediately responded to the shooting.

As of now, little is known about the identity of the attackers. Over the last week, protesters in Minneapolis have been facing regular threats from white supremacists. On Friday night, two masked men decked in camouflage came to the protests and made Black Lives Matter activists feel threatened. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP!

One of the masked men gave the local outlet, City Pages, an ominous statement that night. “I don’t know if this is what [protesters] were planning, just standing here. It’s almost as if they expect one of us to do something. They expect one of us to be in the wreckage of all this. It’s boiling. It’s going to be happening soon.” According to City Pages, the same men released a video of them driving to the precinct, brandishing a gun, and declaring, “We’re going to knock this shit out.… a little reverse-cultural enriching. Let the fire rise.” As of now, it is unclear whether there is any connection between these masked, armed men and those that shot at protesters last night.

These attacks are just the latest of what appears to be a resurgence of organized white supremacy in America, made disturbingly clear by Dylann Roof’s shooting spree on a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this summer. According to Sam Richards of the North Star Post, the Minneapolis shooters are alleged to have yelled, “Race war and Trump 2016” before there shooting.

Three days ago, a mob of white supporters at a Trump rally attacked a Mercutio Southall Jr., a Black Lives Matter activist, who recalls being called “N*****” and “monkey,” as he was kicked, punched, and shoved to the ground. The assault took place in Birmingham, Alabama, where white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church over 52 years ago.

In response to the assault, Trump appeared to endorse the violence, declaring, “Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing. I have a lot of fans, and they were not happy about it. And this was a very obnoxious guy who was a trouble-maker who was looking to make trouble.” Trump added to the controversy on Sunday, tweeting out false, racist statistics about murder rates that turned out to be have been posted by a neo-Nazi.

According to Black Lives Matter activists in Minneapolis, as in the civil-rights movement, there is little distinction to be made between this rising vigilante white-supremacist movement and the police.

In a 2007 federal employer discrimination suit, for example, several minority police officers accused the department of systematic discrimination. In the suit, Robert Kroll, now the head of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, is accused of regularly wearing a “motorcycle jacket with a “White Power” badge sewn into it.”

“None of these groups are new,” says Yohanan Blackkwell, an organizer, who was present for the beginning of the precinct occupation. The KKK has been around and police were the original slave catchers. We’re going to deal with it the same way we always do, singing the gospel and holding up the mirror to these terrorists. The plantation here in Minneapolis is going to be torn down.”"

Jonathan Ferrell is seen in an undated photo provided by Florida A&M University. Ferrell, 24, was shot and killed Saturday, Sept. 14, 2013, by North Carolina police officer Randall Kerrick after a wreck in Charlotte, N.C. Ferrell was unarmed. (AP Photo/Florida A&M University) Ad Policy

If after Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and Darius Simmons, you thought that you could be sickened by racist violence but no longer shocked, you need to know the story of Jonathan Ferrell. This past weekend, as the country remembered the fiftieth anniversary of the 16th St. Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham that took the lives of four little girls, another murder draped in racism took place, and the details, even in these jaded times, are shocking.

Jonathan Ferrell, a 24-year-old former football player at Florida A&M University crashed his car in Charlotte, North Carolina. The wreck was so awful that Ferrell, according to police reports, had to climb out of his back window. He somehow stumbled in the middle of the night to the closest home and pounded on the door—“banging on the door viciously,” in the bizarre phrasing of Charlotte police chief Rodney Monroe—and begged for help. According to police reports, the person inside didn’t call an ambulance but hit her alarm panic button, indicating to police that a home invasion was in progress. As the Charlotte PD approached, Ferrell continued to “attempt to gain the attention of the homeowner.” When they arrived, Ferrell “charged” toward them. One of the three officers tasered Ferrell. When that did not stop his “advance”, 27-year-old Officer Randall Kerrick opened fire, hitting Jonathan Ferrell ten times – initial media reports said three times – killing him at the scene.

Officer Kerrick was the only policeman to take out his gun and fire, which raises questions about their description of Ferrell as “charging” towards them after being tasered. According to The Charlotte Observer, police actually said initially that Kerrick’s actions were “appropriate and lawful.” Yet the brazenness of the shooting, the absence of any evidence Ferrell was under the influence of anything other than a possible concussion, and the fact that there was really no way to spin this, meant that Kerrick was quickly arrested and charged with voluntary manslaughter. According to North Carolina law, “voluntary manslaughter” means that Kerrick acted with “imperfect self-defense.” The police statement said that “the evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive. Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.”

Jonathan Ferrell was a member of Florida A&M’s 2010 championship team. He was going to turn 25 in October and was engaged to be married. He was called “the shepherd” for the way he looked after those around him. His mother Georgia and twin brother Willie Ferrell, who also played on Florida A&M team, spoke to CNN this morning, their shocked sadness on full display. His college coach, Earl Holmes, was “stunned”, saying, “I was saddened when they told me. They told me he was murdered. I said, ‘What? Murder? That doesn’t sound like him. Not the Jonathan I remembered.’ The Jonathan I remembered was a soft-spoken kid, quiet and to himself…. A lot of times bad things happen to good people.”

But they don’t just “happen.” One of the reasons there was so much media and mainstream outrage around the murder of Trayvon Martin was because he wasn’t killed at the hands of police. When the police kill an unarmed black or brown male, the media, the political establishment, and even many mainstream civil rights organizations are inclined to give them a major benefit of the doubt. One can ask the families of Ramarley Graham or Sean Bell if that sounds about right. Being stopped by police for DWB (Driving While Black) is outrage enough. Being killed by police for SHWB (Seeking Help While Black) demands a response.

When the four girls of the 16th St. Baptist Church were killed, many asked how the United States could lecture the world about democracy and human rights when it couldn’t guarantee the safety of children in a house of worship. Let’s update this. How can President Obama lecture the world about the “American values” the United States wants to project in the Middle East when an unarmed young man can’t ask for help after a car wreck without being seen as a lethal target? Forget “post-racial” America. We can only hope that, after Trayvon Martin, we aren’t “post-outrage.” The Ferrells deserve if nothing else our collective insistence that there be justice for Jonathan Ferrell and that such a senseless death never happen again.

At a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump made an extemporaneous comment that appeared to suggest that Hillary Clinton should be shot to prevent the appointment of liberal Supreme Court judges: Ad Policy

“Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick —[crowd booing]—if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know.”

The straightforward reading of these comments would be that he suggested assassination, if even in a joking manner. (Ending sentences in “I don’t know” is a common Trump locution after a joke.) It’s not totally clear whether Trump meant Clinton would be the target, or that he was suggesting shooting the judicial nominees or using arms in some other way to prevent them from taking a seat on the court.

Trump’s campaign immediately blasted out a statement that attempted to clarify his remarks. “It’s called the power of unification—2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won’t be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump,” said Trump adviser Jason Miller. Trump was clearly talking about a hypothetical time after Clinton had been elected and was selecting nominees, however.

Regardless of what was in Trump’s head when he made the comment, there is little doubt that legions of his fans will take this as a suggestion of violence—Second Amendment solutions to government overreach is a common formulation among Tea Partiers and radical pro-gun groups.

Last month, Ben Carson—who has endorsed Trump—said on Fox News, “They’re always saying you don’t need a high-powered weapon to hunt deer. The Constitution is not about deer hunting. It’s about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion.”

When she was campaigning for the senate in 2014, now-Senator Joni Ernst said at an NRA rally, “I have a beautiful little Smith & Wesson, 9 millimeter, and it goes with me virtually everywhere. But I do believe in the right to carry, and I believe in the right to defend myself and my family—whether it’s from an intruder, or whether it’s from the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important.”

In 2010, Nevada Senate candidate Sharron Angle caused a major controversy when she said, “If this Congress keeps going the way it is, people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies and saying my goodness what can we do to turn this country around? I’ll tell you the first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out.” LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Threatening violence against Democratic presidents is not new ground for many hard-right politicians either. Senator Jesse Helms famously said in 1994 that Bill Clinton “better have a bodyguard” if he were to visit any military bases in North Carolina. Earlier this year, Texas governor Greg Abbott tweeted that if Obama wanted “more gun control,” he should “COME AND TAKE IT,” along with an image of a cannon. Speaking about Obama at a Christian conference in June, Senator David Purdue prayed, “Let his days be few.” Following the shooting of police officers in Dallas last month, former Congressman Joe Walsh tweeted “This is now war. Watch out Obama.”

Even people close to Trump have been fairly explicit about assassinations. His former butler wrote on Facebook that Obama should be “hung from the portico” of the White House (actually, the “white mosque,” in his phrasing). A Trump advisor, Al Baldasaro, said last month that “Anyone that commits treason should be shot. I believe Hillary Clinton committed treason.” Trump gave Baldasaro a shout-out at a campaign stop earlier this week.

This long lineage of violent comments makes it irrelevant what Trump truly meant—it’s about what many of his supporters will hear, which is an amplification of the idea that guns should be used against a supposedly over-reaching or illegitimate government.

It’s frightening to recall that in 2012, when Trump briefly believed that Romney would win the popular vote but lose the electoral college tally, he tweeted a call for “revolution.” With his comments Tuesday, and recent assertions that the November election will be “rigged,” we are approaching an incredibly dangerous situation."

It took more than a dozen years for the lesson of The Nation’s editorial on Reagan's near-assassination—that stricter gun control would have possibly prevented the attack—to bear fruition, in the Brady Law, mandating background checks for certain gun purchases, dedicated to the Reagan assistant who was shot and seriously injured that day. James Brady died in 2012 of complications from the wound, and his death was deemed a homicide. Ad Policy

The most irrelevant comment we hard on the day of the shooting came from a spokesman for an anti-gun control group, who was quoted as saying that since Washington already had strict laws, the incident was proof that gun control doesn’t work. Gun control laws in Washington or New York City or Detroit can never work so long as handguns can be purchased at a pawn shop in one state and transported to another. Handgun controls won’t solve the problem, but they would begin to reduce the risks. Ironically, the one Federal agency that deals with the interstate arms traffic—the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms—is slated for a severe cutback in the 1982 budget. Opponents of gun control, like John Connally, who told a television interviewer that more “discipline” was needed, in the sense of swifter, sterner punishment of all criminals, ignore the irrational component in assassinations and, indeed, in most of the murders in this country. An available gun transforms violent emotions into deadly action.

Thanks to the heroic determination of high-school students, the gun-control movement is on the march in the United States. Companies around the country are distancing themselves from the NRA. Yet media giants like Amazon and Apple still purvey NRA propaganda; major financial companies like Visa and MasterCard keep facilitating gun sales; and the storied insurance company Lloyds of London persists in insuring the NRA and gun shows. Ad Policy

The immovability of these big targets makes clear the challenges of a consumer-boycott strategy against an industry historically at the heart of modern life. Arms manufacturing has been entangled with our financial system from the beginning, and excising it from the economy will not be easy.

Britain’s military engagements and colonial excursions in the 18th century helped drive industrialization. Military contracting fueled the development of metallurgical industries. In 1752, Birmingham boasted that “above Twenty thousand Hands” were employed “in useful Manufactures…greatly serviceable to the Government.” The town worked to quash any legislation threatening its booming firearms industry, convinced that injury to it would damage the entire region, throwing a “considerable…portion of its population” out of employment.

Britain’s biggest gun-making firm was owned by Samuel Galton Jr. Galton was a Quaker, and the Religious Society of Friends is a sect known for its pacifist commitments. In 1796, responding to concerns raised in his church, Galton defended his business by arguing that there was no industrial work he might do that did not in some way contribute to war. Indeed, fellow Quakers in town included families like the Lloyds, his iron suppliers, whose war profits laid the foundation of Lloyds Bank. Galton’s logic did not persuade the Quaker church; he was officially disowned. The church refused to receive “further Collection from him or to admit his attending our Meetings,” but he defiantly continued to attend the worship, and the Quaker Ackworth School and other Quaker charitable organizations continued to accept his donations. Meanwhile, as war with France went on, the Galton gun fortune skyrocketed. The family used this wealth to establish a bank in 1804. The Galton bank later merged with Midland, now part of HSBC. Related Article The Adults Have Failed, So Students Are Leading the Way George Zornick

Soon after, government-spawned innovation in firearms manufacturing again drove industrial revolution. After decades of patient investment, the US federal government enabled the production of firearms with interchangeable parts. The resulting “American System of Manufacture” was adopted in machine-tool, sewing-machine, and other industries. British gun makers followed suit, adding bicycles, cars, and other essential modern goods to their offerings. At the end of the 19th century, global arms sales were thriving. European and American arms companies obtained banking partners that gave loans to client states. Cartels formed as business alliances emerged to divide up world markets.

In the early 20th century, the French arms maker Paul Allard of Schneider-Creusot reminded critics that his factories had long been oriented toward the “whole industry of metallurgy and mechanical construction,” with only periodic focus on war matériel at the government’s behest. The science-fiction writer H.G. Wells likewise pointed out that the profits of arms trading accrue not only to arms makers but to “thousands of persons of all ranks of life,” “as lesser shareholders,” even when they are “quite innocent of any desire to slaughter their neighbours.” Moreover, he noted, arms manufacturers made other products, too. In 1935, a British Royal Commission argued that the line between military and civilian manufacturing was so blurry that it was impossible to say who was and who wasn’t making arms. Parts used in arms manufacturing often also had uses in other goods. Like Galton, the commissioners saw the entire economy as ineluctably involved with arms production, recognizing that “large numbers of people, of all classes…by reason of their employment, their business interests or by the holding of shares, may have a financial interest in war or the preparation for war.”

Despite the historic reality of the centrality of arms-making to the evolution of modern industry and finance, we often echo the Quaker church that scorned Galton and imagine arms makers as especially scandalous “merchants of death.” Andrew Undershaft in George Bernard Shaw’s 1907 play Major Barbara was the ultimate caricature of the malevolent arms maker. Today, we focus on the villainy of the NRA and the politicians in its pocket. This outlook shapes strategies like pressuring companies that partner with the NRA to cancel their discounts to NRA members. Current Issue View our current issue

The NRA certainly is villainous. But Galton had a point, too. The rest of us remain systemically implicated, even if we don’t buy or invest in firearms.

In 2007, Remington, a firearms maker central to America’s industrial history, was bought by Cerberus, a private-equity firm. After Sandy Hook, public-pension fund investors like the California State Teachers’ Retirement System pressured Cerberus to dump Remington. Failing to find a buyer, Cerberus moved the gun maker into a “special financial vehicle.” Meanwhile, it profited from booming gun sales—panic purchases in anticipation of new controls. Cerberus has earned nearly $20 million in advisory and other fees from Remington since 2007, apart from the more than $60 million return on equity in 2012.

Meanwhile Remington borrowed millions from Huntsville, Alabama, where it opened a plant on the understanding that the loan would be forgiven if the company brought enough jobs. Remington also borrowed money to buy out those who wanted to divest. Some of its debt is held in funds managed by JP MorganChase.

Remington has now filed for bankruptcy, and Cerberus will finally lose control of it. The bankruptcy proceedings presume that someone will buy Remington—possibly another gun maker like Sturm & Ruger. In the meantime, Remington is assuring employees and shareholders that its operations will go on as normal.

Its interim owners include JP Morgan Asset Management. Bank of America and Wells Fargo currently fund the revolving loan of about $200 million that allows Remington to borrow for operations.

Gun-control advocates speak of pressuring banks like JP MorganChase and Wells Fargo to refuse to allow their services to be used for firearms sales, but these banks are themselves deeply invested in the gun business. Moreover, thousands of employees; law, advertising, and insurance firms; materials and parts suppliers; and retailers remain implicated in Remington, too.

Meanwhile, the public at large remains an indirect patron of the very gun makers that it asks banks and companies to shun. Forty percent of firearms manufacturers’ profits in the United States come from government contracts, including military arms and law-enforcement arms bought by state, county, and municipal forces with our tax contributions. Through our support of armed policing and American military engagements abroad, we enable these purchases.

It is certainly a positive step that financial firms like Blackstone Group and BlackRock Inc. are culling gun companies from the portfolios of clients who do not wish to invest in them. But Galton’s question has been lost: What of all the other ways in which we remain complicit in firearms manufacture?

Divesting from firearms alone will not wash the blood from our hands. We must rethink our commitment to a mutually terrorized public and mutually terrorized system of “global security.” Galton may have been too easy on himself, but he was right that by focusing on his particular culpability, his accusers obscured the larger scandal of their civilization’s dependence on arms."

Virginia’s elections on Tuesday night were a stinging loss for the Republican Party. Governor-elect Ralph Northam won by the biggest margin for a Democratic gubernatorial candidate since 1985, and Democrats made massive and unexpected gains in the House of Delegates. Ad Policy

Election night was also very difficult for the National Rifle Association, which is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, and spent big bucks in an effort to defeat Northam and several other Democrats who ultimately won. The NRA poured over $2 million into races in Virginia, including a massive $750,000 advertising push in the last three weeks before the election.

The losses came up and down the ticket. Northam, Lieutenant Governor–elect Justin Fairfax, and Attorney General Mark Herring all faced NRA-backed candidates and won. In 13 competitive races where the Democratic candidate was endorsed by the pro–gun control group Giffords (until recently known as Americans for Responsible Solutions) and the Republican was backed by the NRA, the Giffords candidate was victorious in 12. The winner of the 13th race still hasn’t been declared, as Democrat Shelly Simonds and Republican David Yancey await a full vote tally. Among the winners was Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was fatally shot on the air as she reported for a local Virginia television station. His opponent was backed by the NRA.

Other gun-control groups like Moms Demand Action and Everytown also pushed hard for these pro–gun control Democrats—Everytown dumped $700,000 into Virginia races as election day drew near.

NRA candidates in very safe Republican districts still won, but that was to be expected. In short, the NRA got its clock cleaned everywhere that mattered.

Since the NRA frequently gets involved in competitive federal and state races nationwide, almost always on behalf of Republican candidates, naturally sometimes its candidates win and sometimes they lose. There can be a tendency to over-read these results—if a race didn’t meaningfully turn on gun control, it probably didn’t tell us much about gun politics. But that was clearly not the case in Virginia.

Northam, who boasted about his F rating from the NRA, protested outside NRA headquarters in Fairfax after the Las Vegas shooting that claimed 58 lives and injured 546 others. “I appreciate it when someone says, ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with you.’ But it’s time to take it a step further; we need to take action,” he said. Current Issue View our current issue

His running mates were equally aggressive in going after the NRA. “Each one of us is very proud of our F,” Fairfax said.

Mark Herring, who was reelected as attorney general Tuesday, had a particularly combative relationship with the NRA. Virginia had concealed-carry reciprocity agreements with 30 states until 2015 when Herring announced he was cutting the agreements with 25 of those states, citing permit policies that were too lax. This outraged the NRA and other gun-control groups, and ultimately Herring’s move was reversed by Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, who signed a bill that reinstated the agreements with those 25 states but instituted “voluntary” background checks at gun shows, along with heightened enforcement from state police. (Gun-control groups bashed McAuliffe for the move, and Herring refused to attend the bill’s signing.)

Voters understood that gun control was a big issue in the race. Seventeen percent of voters listed “gun policy” as their most important issue, which was second only to health care. Those voters split evenly between Northam and Gillespie, which cuts against the conventional wisdom that pro-gun voters tend to prioritize the issue to a much greater extent than people who favor gun control. “The narrowing of this enthusiasm gap portends greater losses for candidates that strictly adhere to the gun lobby’s agenda,” said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, in a post-election memo.

Legislators at the federal level noted the results too, like Senator Chris Murphy, one of the leading gun-control champions in the Senate:

Exit polls show top 2 issues for #Northam voters tonight were health care and guns. Say it again. Health care and GUNS. —Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 8, 2017

The story of the Virginia elections is that, while Gillespie outperformed several past statewide Republicans in conservative, rural areas, he got absolutely clobbered in Virginia’s suburbs. There were many reasons for this, but it tracks with the long-running belief by gun-control advocates that the issue plays big-time in suburban areas, particularly with women. Republicans seem to be catching on to this fact—when post–Las Vegas legislation to ban “bump stocks” was introduced in the House last month, it had 15 Republican co-sponsors, all of whom were from vulnerable districts, many of them in suburban areas. Gillespie boasted of his NRA endorsement, but didn’t actually release his responses to the NRA’s issue questionnaire.

There are some caveats to these results, namely that two high-profile mass shootings happened in the run-up to the election. Voters tend to react strongly to such shootings but then quickly lose interest in gun control, which they may not have had a chance to do between the Las Vegas shooting and Sunday’s attack in a church in Sutherland, Texas, which killed 26 people, and Tuesday’s voting. But, that said, every bit of data about Tuesday seems to be pointing in one direction: Pro-gun Republicans in anything but a safe district should be very worried."

The unfolding civil trial against Remington Arms Company over what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary school is rapidly approaching what could be a watershed moment in American gun politics: forcing a major arms manufacturer to disclose internal deliberations over how to manufacture and market assault weapons to the general public. And Remington is using every legal tool at its disposal to prevent that—even asking this week for a Connecticut judge to seal emerging evidence in the case. Ad Policy

The lawsuit, brought by some of the families and survivors from Sandy Hook, took several surprising turns this spring. First, a Connecticut judge refused to throw the case out, and later she ruled that the discovery process can begin. Legal experts didn’t give the case much chance of making it past an initial hearing, yet it has now lasted several months. They also didn’t anticipate the discovery phase beginning so quickly. Several legal scholars told The Nation earlier this year that discovery, if it ever came, was a long way off.

It’s still quite possible that the defendants—Remington Arms Company, which produced the Bushmaster XM-15 that Adam Lanza used at Sandy Hook to kill 26 people, along with Camfour, a middleman distributor and also a gun shop in East Windsor, Connecticut—will succeed in derailing the case, potentially by wielding the broad gunmaker immunity passed by Congress in 2006. The judge has not directly ruled yet on whether that immunity applies here.

But the discovery process is already underway. Lawyers for the Sandy Hook families told The Nation that for nearly a month they’ve been communicating with Remington about documents they would like turned over.

“We have a first set of requests. We’re looking for a broad range of information—financials, marketing documents, a lot of things related to the weapon and how it’s sold,” said Katie Mesner-Hage, one of the lawyers from Koskoff, Koskoff and Bieder who is working the Sandy Hook case.

The legal team is also scheduling depositions with Remington executives, in which they would have to testify under oath about the company’s practices when it comes to distributing the XM-15. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Once these documents are turned over and the depositions occur, they will be a matter of public record regardless of what happens with the case going forward. These revelations have the potential to shine new light on exactly what major arms companies believe about the lethality of assault weapons, and how they apply that knowledge during the mass-production and marketing process.

Remington, however, is determined to stop that information from ever becoming public. In Bridgeport Superior Court on Monday, the defense team raised the prospect of a protective order that would seal any discovery documents and keep them out of public view. They have until July 5 to file it.*

Companies facing civil suits of this nature commonly ask for protection of company information, but are generally only successful when they are seeking to protect genuine trade secrets or similar types of information. Mesner-Hage anticipates Remington will ask for a very broad protection order, covering almost everything that comes out in discovery, and that there will be subsequent legal tug-of-war over what will eventually become public.

The Sandy Hook families want as maximum sunlight into Remington’s activities. “There should be as much transparency as possible. This is not a case that should be conducted behind closed doors and with a lot of sealed documents,” said Mesner-Hage.

Meanwhile, several mass shootings have provided a grim backdrop to the ongoing legal case, most recently the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando—the worst yet in American history. The Sandy Hook families were in court for a scheduled hearing just over a week later.

“It was very surreal to have the horrific tragedy in Orlando happen just before we were set to argue in court,” said Mesner-Hage. “It hung over the proceedings to some extent, because how could it not.”

*This story has been updated to reflect the timing of the protective order."

Elena Kagan was confirmed Thursday as the 112th justice to serve on the Supreme Court bench, in a significant victory for the Obama administration and womens’ rights groups—and a significant defeat for the National Rifle Association. Ad Policy

Kagan was approved on a 63-37 vote, earning the support of fifty-six Democrats (all except Nebraska’s Ben Nelson), Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders, Connecticut Independent Joe Lieberman and five Republicans who had already announced their support for her: Lindsey Graham, the South Carolinian who cast the sole GOP vote for Kagan on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Richard Lugar of Indiana, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.

The Senate made history with its choice. As People For the American Way President Michael B. Keegan noted: “Thanks to today’s vote, the Supreme Court will have three female Justices for the first time in our nation’s history.""

National Organization for Women president Terry O’Neill was similarly enthused. ""NOW eagerly anticipates three brilliant women justices individually and collectively making their mark on a Supreme Court long dominated by men, while making decisions that greatly impact the lives of everyday people,"" said O’Neill. ""This is more than a symbolic, inspiring achievement for women—it will be a genuine victory for every woman and girl who benefits from Elena Kagan’s years of service on the high court.""

In addition to making history, however, the senators also sent a signal that was very much of the moment. And it had to do with their indepenence from a supposedly definitional special-interest group.

The NRA staked much of its reputation as a political powerhouse on an aggressive campaign to defeat Kagan, who earned the ire of the lobbying group after she expressed the view that several past rulings allowing for modest gun controls were ""settled law.""

But Senate voted, even members who had long been closely allied with the group rejected its counsel.

According to an analysis by Doug Pennington, a veteran watcher of Congressional voting on gun issues, nine senators with A ratings from the NRA voted to confirm Kagan: Montana Democrat Max Baucus, Alaskan Democrat Nick Begich, Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey, New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand; South Carolina Republican Graham, South Dakota Democrat Tim Johnson, Pennsylvania Democrat Arlen Specter, Montana Democrat Jon Tester and Virginia Democrat Mark Warner.

In addition, a number of senators with records as staunch defenders of 2nd amendment rights, such as Vermont Independent Sanders, Maine Republican Collins and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold were solid supporters of Kagan.

The Senate’s overwhelming vote on this nomination represents a second significant rejection of the NRA’s lobbying on High Court nominations in as many years, and a signal that Senate Democrats—and a number of Republicans—are willing to buck the group that likes to position itself as the thousand-pound gorilla of legislative lobbying in Washington.

That’s a big deal, not merely in the context of the Kagan vote but in the broader context of the role gun issues play in judicial nomination fights. Last year, the NRA went all out to block Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who like Kagan is a native of New York, a city that has struggled with gun violence.

Sotomayor was confirmed on a 68-31 vote.

Kagan’s margin was smaller but comparable and, as with Sotomayor, attracted significant bipartisan backing..

That’s important, not merely in the context of the Kagan vote but in the broader context of the role guns issues play in judicial nomination fights.

Kagan is not an anti-gun zealot. She’s expressed respect for the Second Amendment, which she interprets in a mainstream manner. But there is little question that, like the vast majority of Americans, she favors reasonable anticrime and antiviolence measures, some of which would allow for regulation of gun sales and distribution of weapons.

That was not acceptable to the National Rifle Association, the stealth representative of gun manufacturers in Washington. NRA lobbyists were unsettled by the prospect that a rational majority, with personal experience of the issues that arise when urban areas are flooded with cheap handguns, could emerge on the court.

So the group mounted a last-ditch effort to put roadblocks in the way of Kagan’s nomination, complete with fevered alerts urging members to call senators with appeals ""to OPPOSE and filibuster the Kagan nomination!""



The NRA reportedly employed what is considered to be its most powerful threat on the Hill—a suggestion that it will include the Kagan confirmation choice on the short list of votes that are used to determine the NRA’s legislative scorecard ratings.

Those ratings are a big deal for Republicans and many Democrats running in rural areas where a high grade from the NRA counts for something with voters—just as a low grade can count against an incumbent, no matter what the party. Remember that two decades ago, Vermont’s Sanders beat an Republican Congressman at least in part by highlighting the low NRA rating of the incumbent. And Wisconsin Feingold, who has made defenses of the Second Amendment central to his broader constitutional advocacy, always makes note of what even a conservative critic acknowledges are ""good ratings from the NRA—an important metric in a state bristling with deer rifles.""

Feingold has already backed Kagan as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that advanced her nomination to the full chamber, and Sanders is expected to do the same.

The NRA’s efforts to ""bully senators""—as Jill Pike of the Third Way think tank put it—were unlikely to gain traction with Feingold or Sanders. But the opposition so many of the the A-rated senators was significant.

When senators start saying ""no"" to doing the bidding of the gun manufacturers on these votes, and acknowledging as much, they strike a blow against special interests. And they remind us that, for all its money power and all its threats, the NRA is not calling the shots on High Court confirmations."

Seamus pointed his rainbow flag with the feather handle at his sisters and “pow-powed” them, calling out, “Yous are dead now, guys. I shot yous.” Ad Policy This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com.

Madeline and Rosena laughed and just kept on running, with Seamus at their heels. I hid my face in my hands. It wasn’t just that he was playing guns, but that he was using a Pride flag as his gun at a vigil to mourn those killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. My pacifist husband Patrick ran to redirect their activities, replacing the flag with a ball and glove and beginning a game of catch. Vigil organizers were taking turns reading the names of those killed into a microphone.

“… Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22

Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36

Luis S. Vielma, 22…”

Those three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol. He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack.

The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can’t speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers.

The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

And all over the country, since that fateful day that elicited the usual cries of “never again,” the killing continues: Alton Sterling and Philando Castille, by the police; Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Officer Brent Thompson and four Dallas Police officers, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Smith, Michael Krol, and Patrick Zamarripa, by a lone sniper, Micah Johnson, who himself was then killed by an armed police robot; three more police officers in Baton Rouge on July 17.

“… Montrell Jackson, 32

Matthew Gerald, 41

Brad Garafola, 45…”

And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive, I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren’t high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days.

“Stabbin’ My Bunny”: Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence

And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those “guns.” As a boy, Patrick wasn’t allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put “Stop War Toys” stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends’ houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like “protester at the Pentagon” than cops and robbers. I’ve been thinking recently about why toy guns didn’t have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood—were made to understand—what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger—the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble—had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger.

Our parents—our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists—made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest, my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called “free-fire zones” on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn’t point toy guns at each other. We didn’t pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe.

Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once—and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child’s play. It was serious business and was to be resisted.

As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don’t have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we’ve been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen) son, as he’s recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play?

When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it.

In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, “What are you doing?”

“Stabbin’ my bunny. I kilt her,” she responded matter-of-factly.

Seizing a “teaching moment” and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. “Now, your bunny is dead,” I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. “You know what happens when living things die, right? It’s forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.” Rosena and I then “buried” the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had “killed” that bunny, she could never play with it again.

About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn’t hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion.

Toys matter. We’ve put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We’ve bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we’ve accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted “this crap” out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances.

A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend’s dad had bought at Walmart. A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying “toy” was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice’s hands were still reportedly in his pockets.

Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice’s pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer’s quick trigger finger, racism, and her son’s blood.

I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice’s hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn’t have been that far from what regularly goes through my son’s head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands.

Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere

Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group. Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys “R” Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids.

I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys “R” Us displaying.

We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip.

What we found was not exactly what I expected—on many levels.

Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything—lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.)

I had finally found the Nerf “blasters,” but he wasn’t interested. “Let’s not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?”

I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKIIfor $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic “blasters” on display and marketed to kids “eight and up” seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don’t like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone—even a brain-hungry zombie—but as it turned out, I needn’t have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn’t in his wheelhouse.

Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word “gun” on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house, killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster, which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem, with “more distance, more ammo,” which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89.

By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven.

So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for “real” toy guns. No such luck. I didn’t find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn’t find an ersatz Sig Sauer either.

It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don’t seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com, where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99.

“Start Them Young”

The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys “R” Us outlet—just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and—more critically—the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we’re a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn’t keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio.

The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child’s initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns—even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers.

“Start Them Young,” a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for Thompson/Center Arms, about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: “[We’re] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters—the ultimate first gun. We’re targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.” In other words, kids are literally in their sights.

It’s a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market.

Can we be safe—any of us—in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores—from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers—had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in “economic activity” in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That’s the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths—police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: “Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence… the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.”

We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children’s play. We see violence solving problems on every screen—from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s maxim still applies: “One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.” Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it’s going off right now.

I don’t want to police my kids’ imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don’t have to. It says don’t interfere with your kid’s play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn’t real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression.

I get what they’re saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn’t real. The pow-pows don’t actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem.

We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids—particularly our boys—play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships.

I don’t want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don’t want them to get comfortable with killing either.

I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than “Pow, pow, yous are dead now!” And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people—and how much killing hurts us all."

The radical left, including the Black Panthers, also contributed to the rise of gun vigilante culture in the United States, a phenomenon that later shifted to the right. (AP.) Ad Policy

A lot of what I hope to be doing with this blog I fear might verge on pedantry. Too much of what we observe today on the right we act as if started the day before yesterday. Always, we need to set the clock back further—as a political necessity. We have to establish deeper provenances. Or else we just reinvent, and reinvent and reinvent the wheel.

Or, in this case, reinvent the assault rifle. Some of the best coverage and reflection on December 14—the day of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary—has come from the outstanding folks at Josh Marshall’s Talking Points Memo. And part of the mix over at TPM is its reprinting of e-mails from ordinary readers, offering marvelous worm’s-eye views and analyses of the issues of the day. Sometimes, however, the worm’s-eye view only views what the worm’s eye views. On December 15, as the nature of the fearsome arsenal took inside that first grade classroom—the Bushmaster XM-15, the 10mm Glock SF and 9mm SIG Sauer handgun—was becoming apparent, but before, I think, it had been established that the mother he stole the guns from before murdering her may have been a “full-on” prepper, arming for Armageddon, TPM printed this interesting e-mail from a reader identified as SS:

I was raised with guns. More to the point, my childhood was steeped in gun lore…. I bring this up to establish my bona-fides. The gun culture that we have today in the U.S. is not the gun culture, so to speak, that I remember from my youth. It’s too simple to say that it’s “sick”; it’s more accurately an absurd fetishization. I suppose that the American Gunfighter, in all of his avatars, is inescapably fetishistic, but (to my point) somewhere along the way—maybe in, uh, 1994?—we crossed over into Something Else…. I can’t remember seeing a semi-automatic weapon of any kind at a shooting range until the mid-1980s. Even through the early 1990s, I don’t remember the idea of “personal defense” being a decisive factor in gun ownership. The reverse is true today: I have college-educated friends—all of whom, interestingly, came to guns in their adult lives—for whom gun ownership is unquestionably (and irreducibly) an issue of personal defense. For whom the semi-automatic rifle or pistol—with its matte-black finish, laser site, flashlight mount, and other “tactical” accoutrements—effectively circumscribe what’s meant by the word “gun.” At least one of these friends has what some folks—e.g., my fiancee, along with most of my non-gun-owning friends—might regard as an obsessive fixation on guns; a kind of paraphilia that (in its appetite for all things tactical) seems not a little bit creepy. The “tactical” turn is what I want to flag here. It has what I take to be a very specific use-case, but it’s used—liberally—by gun owners outside of the military, outside of law enforcement, outside (if you’ll indulge me) of any conceivable reality-based community: these folks talk in terms of “tactical” weapons, “tactical” scenarios, “tactical applications,” and so on. It’s the lingua franca of gun shops, gun ranges, gun forums and gun-oriented YouTube videos. (My god, you should see what’s out there on YouTube!) Which begs my question: in precisely which “tactical” scenarios do all of these lunatics imagine that they’re going to use their matte-black, suppressor-fitted, flashlight-ready tactical weapons? They tend to speak of the “tactical” as if it were a fait accompli; as a kind of apodeictic fact: as something that everyone—their customers, interlocutors, fellow forum members, or YouTube viewers—experiences on a regular basis, in everyday life. They tend to speak of the tactical as reality.

An interesting perspective, and I don’t question the accuracy of SS’s observations about his own experience. I do want to argue, however, that the culture he’s talking about—the one in which ordinary folk fancy themselves gunslinging avengers, rehearsing for the inevitable “tactical” scenario to come—goes back much further. It goes back at least as far as 1967, a time when there were no YouTube videos to document it—in Detroit, for example, where, as I wrote in Nixonland, that year’s historic riots touched off preparations among blacks and whites both for something approaching a race war:

A local black nationalist minister, Albert Cleage, observed to a reporter that the shooting ranges were packed and the city was way behind in processing gun registrations. “So naturally, any black man who can get ahold of a gun is getting hold of it.” A flyer circulated in white neighborhoods: “Are YOU READY NOW to PREPARE YOURSELF for the NEXT ONE? Or will you be forced to stand helplessly by because you were UN-prepared to defend your home and neighborhood against bands of armed terrorists who will murder the men and rape the women?” At an outfit called Breakthrough…organized workshops in VFW and Knights of Columbus meeting halls with representatives of the National Rifle Association, who suggested each family stockpile two hundred rounds of ammunition.

Ah, yes, the NRA. More on that later, but for now—continuing from Nixonland:

The NRA, once a hobby club for sportsman, was becoming a new kind of organization altogether. Its magazine, American Rifleman, had a new column, “The Armed Citizen,” which ran glowing accounts of of vigilantes. Connecticut senator Thomas Dodd, a conservative, had a bill pending to limit the sale of firearms through the mail. It had once seemed uncontroversial. Now white and black would-be vigilantes agreed the Dodd bill was a prelude to the confiscation of all firearms. Guns & Ammo called the bills supporters “criminal-coddling do-gooders, borderline psychotics, as well as Communists and leftists who want to lead us into the one-world welfare state.”

Sound familiar, kiddies? There’s nothing new under the wingnut sun. In any event, one of those supporters was Massachusetts’ young junior senator, Edward Moore Kennedy, whom the NRA’s American Rifleman said was following the “Communist line” for trying to outlaw the method by which his brother’s assassin had obtained the murder weapon. The tactical turn was well on its way.

Much of this information comes from a 1968 Esquire article by Garry Willls that he expanded into a marvelous book of reportage, The Second Civil War: Arming for Armageddon, and from a contemporary Time article you can read here if you’re a subscriber; sadly for history buffs and students, Time’s archives used to be, but are no longer, free.)

A bit more water would have to flow under the bridge before the transformation of the NRA into a de facto organization by, of and for for aspirant vigilantes would become complete. One historical transformation that contributed: the tactical turn on the left—among white revolutionaries and black power militants—had to die out. It began in earnest in 1966, when Black Panthers began patrolling the streets of the Sunshine State with guns. As I put it in Nixonland:

Here was one of the things that made these young men remarkable: beneath their berets and leather jackets, behind their bandoliers, they were also naively earnest. They believed implicitly in the majesty of the law. Revolutionaries in an only-in-America kind of way, they perceived themselves as a fully functioning ghetto constabulatory, apparently suprised when the response of the police—whom they called an “army of occupation”—was to wish them dead. “What are you doing with the guns?” a patrolman would ask them, a little afraid. ‘What are you doing with your gun?” Huey Newton would shoot back, and pull out one of the law books he always carried with him as other stood by with cameras and tape recorders.

(Yes again: nothing new—except the cellphone technology—under the sun.)

Huey would step out of his car and snap a live round into his chamber: California law only outlawed the carrying of loaded weapons inside a motor vehicle.

Things shifted, of course, when the Panthers started patrolling rich white neighborhoods, including the one where a right-wing supporter of Ronald Reagan in the state assembly, Don Mulford, lived. When the assembly debated Mulford’s subsequent bill to ban the carrying of loaded firearms in public places, Panthers strolled onto the floor of the state assembly fully armed. The Mulford Act passed right quick after that—and, ironically, one of the nation’s first high-profile gun control laws was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan. (We’ll see how ironic in my next post.)

Another 1960s scene of left-wing vigilante culture to contemplate: the time a pretty female revolutionary, a former Quaker who had once won a Decency Award from the Kiwanis Club, testified at the Chicago Seven trial about her practice shooting an M1 semiautomatic rifle. Why? the prosecution asked. “After Chicago I changed from being a pacifist to the realization that we had to defend ourselves. A nonviolent revolution was impossible.” She spoke, in other words, of the tactical as reality.

That left-wing world, of course, is long past. And once the gun nuts were mostly on the right, however, their long march to Capitol Hill hegemony began. In my next post, I’ll explain that process, and introduce an antihero into the story, who got involved in this business long before a lot of us knew, a little bit under the radar—long before, that is to say, he became the fortieth president of the United States.

Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes was able to kill twelve people and injure fifty-eight more with an assault rifle in July. George Zornick argues that a few key gun control regulations could have prevented the tragedy."

I was all set to write a column about the paralysis of progressives around guns: how even the ghastliest school shootings rouse few of us to more than hand-wringing and despair. After each massacre, I was planning to say, we go through the motions, writing letters to the editor, making donations to gun-control groups and politicians who promise to fight to stem the tide, but, except for the most dedicated activists, our involvement is pretty small-bore and low-key. The Million Mom March was the last major national mobilization, and that was back in 2000. A majority of Americans support gun control, but the passion—and the money, and Congress—is with the National Rifle Association. Ad Policy

The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, aren’t having any of that. Survivors of a horrific rampage by Nikolas Cruz, a former fellow student who murdered 17 and wounded more than a dozen, they’re speaking out—screaming out—in a way we haven’t seen before, confronting the politicians who have failed them.

They’re all over TV. Twitter is exploding with their rage: “You are the President of the United States, and you have the audacity to put this on Russia as an excuse. I guess I should expect that from you,” one student tweeted at Donald Trump. Senior Emma Gonzalez may have made history with her blistering speech at a rally three days after the massacre: “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this—we call BS. They say tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS.”

Plans are afoot for marches: The Douglas students are organizing a “March for Our Lives” in Washington on March 24, and others may be in the works as well. Students at a high school in Boca Raton have already staged a walkout, and maybe you saw the coverage of the students who staged a die-in outside the White House. Meanwhile, wags are writing checks for “thoughts and prayers” to NRA-funded pols. Silly, but better than rolling your eyeballs and sighing.

Maybe the kids will save us in the end—and not a moment too soon. Because too many of us well-meaning liberal/progressive adults have been cowed by the gun lobby. We’ve resigned ourselves to quasi-defeat and accepted the NRA’s framing, the mythological sanctity of “gun rights.” So we speak of “responsible” gun owners. Proud rural folk taught to shoot by Granddad. “Commonsense” gun laws. Respect for the Second Amendment. We say, “We don’t want to take away anyone’s guns.” For progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand, deferring to the NRA was, at one time, not just a perceived political necessity but also a way of signaling respect for the values of (white) rural voters. Even saintly Paul Wellstone, longtime gun-control advocate, introduced a 1997 bill watering down a ban on guns for those convicted of domestic violence. Related Article Out of Bloodshed, Hope for Gun Control Gary Younge

Meanwhile, for the pro-gun crowd, it doesn’t seem to matter how many people die (over 35,000) or are injured (over 81,000) per year; or that you are vastly more likely to kill yourself or others if you have a gun in the house; or that, on average, one to two women are shot and killed each day by a past or present partner. Each atrocity is just another reason for more guns. Rush Limbaugh called just the other day for guns to be allowed in classrooms, while Education Secretary Betsy “Grizzly Bear” DeVos argued that arming teachers is an “option.” Because kids are never shot by accident when a gun falls out of a purse or pocket, and not one of the 3.6 million teachers in the land would ever use a gun to threaten a student.

The commentariat hasn’t always been much help, either. In the mainstream media, playing the pundit who takes weird and contorted “contrarian” positions is good for your career. A few years ago, libertarian writer Megan McArdle wrote a piece in The Daily Beast claiming that nothing much could be done about guns, so kids should be taught to rush the shooter: “If we drilled it into young people that the correct thing to do is for everyone to instantly run at the guy with the gun, these sorts of mass shootings would be less deadly, because even a guy with a very powerful weapon can be brought down by 8-12 unarmed bodies piling on him at once.” Let the kids handle it! McArdle, by the way, just got a column in The Washington Post.

In The New York Times, meanwhile, David Brooks worried, post-Parkland, that gun-control advocates don’t show enough “respect” to red-staters, while Ross Douthat tied himself in knots explaining why guns should be permitted but abortion banned. Douthat also defended the paranoid right-wing fantasy that guns let us resist the state “when it imposes illegitimately” (good luck with that!) and proposed to reduce gun violence by delaying the age at which citizens can buy AR-15s to 30 (for semiautomatic pistols, he suggests waiting until 25). It’s as though 64-year-old Stephen Paddock never killed 58 people in Las Vegas (and injured another 851) less than five months ago. It’s as though the vast majority of killings with guns, including mass murders, were not committed by grown-up men. Well, at least they’re not having abortions.

Enough with the craziness, and enough with the clever pundits and the quiet politicians and the defeatist citizenry, too. There’s no reason why anyone—of any age—needs to own an AR-15. In fact, maybe I shouldn’t say this, because we progressives seem to be all about winning the MAGA-hat-wearing white working class, but I don’t believe you have a right to own a gun, period. So show up for the gun-control marches and bring your friends. Follow the money—the NRA money—and work like heck to elect anti-gun candidates. The Douglas students have changed the conversation. It will take a whole lot of us to keep it going."

They want common-sense gun control, they want the assault-weapons ban to be reinstated, they want an end to the lies coming from the NRA. They want all these things, but most of all, they want their friends, classmates, and family members to stop dying. They want an end to the violence that has plagued schools, churches, movie theaters, and city streets, bringing agony in its wake. That’s why students across the country have been marching, walking out of school, and demanding change with new vigor since the shooting at Parkland, Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead in February.

The most recent action was April 20’s National School Walkout, on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School Massacre, which saw thousands of students, from Portland to Austin to Richmond, take to the streets to demand action on gun violence. Photographer Tracie Williams joined a walkout in New York City to hear from the students themselves why they are joining this growing movement. “The Polaroids took a few minutes to develop,” Williams said, “which really allowed me the time to engage with the students in a meaningful way.” Williams asked the students to reflect on how they’ve been affected by gun violence, and what they want to see in their future. She found their answers to be tinged with anger and fear, but also full of hope.

Samuel, 16

So last weekend I was in Crown Heights with a couple of friends in a deli when the door flew open and I heard pops in my left ear that shook me into sobriety. A guy in the deli said “man it’s poppin’ tonight!” That really made me think, for real gun violence and violence to end in general we need to do away with the system that facilitates it.

Vicky, 15

Schools shouldn’t be places where kids and teachers are filled with paranoia. It should be a safe space. And that’s why I’m here.

Aushna, 17

I’m here to show that I know what’s happening in the US and I CARE. I want to know what happens with gun control, considering it directly concerns me. Students and children are typically seen as a statistic when making decisions, but I wanna show that we are an educated generation!

Ethan, 15

This all just needs to stop. All the time I hear this on the news, from my mom, my friends. I wish that it could be easier to find a solution, but like many things in life, finding a solution to worldwide problems isn’t easy.

I am here because of the fact that I could have been in the same position as any other victim. And that I could potentially acquire a military-style weapon. There needs to be a change.

Here today because we live in a time where I feel unsafe, I feel scared, anxious, restless and fearful of entering public places.

Growing up in the Bronx, there have been times when I would be so scared to go outside because of the sounds of shots and screams coming from outside my window. That’s why I believe it’s so important, as young people, to use our voices for gun reform so that no child has to go through that.

Kennedy’s assassination drew to a close, Kenneth Mills Tucker, 19, sent a tweet letting the world know his plans for the night: “Out with the gang Dooney Wayne n Rell what’s going on tonight. My last weekend being a teenager.” It was to be Kenneth’s last weekend ever. Ad Policy This article is adapted from Gary Younge’s new book, Another Day in the Death of America.

Shortly after 3 am on November 23, a residential area of northwest Indianapolis crackled with gunfire from an automatic weapon, sending stray bullets through windows. By the time the police arrived, the scene looked like something from a David Lynch movie. A green 2002 Honda Accord had struck a utility pylon and flipped onto its roof. Of the four passengers, one had fled, two sat on a grass verge complaining of pain, and the last—Kenneth—lay motionless, having staggered about 100 feet from the car with a bullet in the left side of his torso. At 3:57 am, as the coroner noted, “Medical intervention was unsuccessful and the decedent was pronounced non-viable.”

November 23, 2013, came in the months between George Zimmerman’s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin, when the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag was coined, and Michael Brown’s fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, which was when the hashtag really took off. It was an unremarkable Saturday shortly before Thanksgiving—and as befits an unremarkable Saturday in America, 10 children and teens were shot dead. (On average, seven children are killed by guns in the United States each day, but weekends tend to be worse.)

This was the day I had picked at random to put a human face—a child’s face—on gun violence. Black, white, and Latino, over a 24-hour period, these children fell in barrios, suburbs, and rural areas; on stairwells, on street corners, and at sleepovers. All were boys: The youngest was 9 and the oldest was Kenneth, who was the second to be shot and the first to die. I spent 18 months looking for their families, friends, teachers, and coaches—anyone who knew them. By the time I completed the project, two things—beyond the personal stories—became clear.

The first was that every black parent I spoke to said that they had assumed this could happen to their son. (Of the 10 children who were killed that day, seven were black, two Latino, and one white; on an average day, five would have been white, four black, and one Latino.) “You wouldn’t really be doing your job as a parent here if you didn’t think it could happen,” one father in Newark told me. His son was shot dead on the evening of November 23. A mother in Dallas whose son was also shot that evening had assumed that her other son would be the one to get killed—but either way, she’d factored it in. In low-income communities of color, death stalks youth with relentless intent. Most of the teenagers I met who were friends of the deceased knew others who’d died; their Facebook pages and Twitter accounts are like online graveyards.

Doriane Miller, a Chicago-based primary-care physician, says that some of her patients on the South Side show symptoms of post-traumatic-stress disorder. A few years back, she started noticing a growing number of young patients presenting physical symptoms for which there was no obvious physical cause. The one thing many had in common were “RIP” tattoos, mourning friends who had been killed. But when she tried to raise it with them, they didn’t want to talk about it. “What are you going to do about it?” they’d say. “Nothing is going to change what’s happened.” Miller noted a fatalism in many of them, “a sense that this is the way it is in my life and in my community. There is a learned hopelessness around this. And so you suck it up, you man up, and you move on.”

Which brings us to the second thing that struck me while talking to these families about the 10 young deaths of November 23: When I posed an open-ended question to the victims’ parents about why they thought these tragedies kept happening, not a single one mentioned guns. When I asked a more leading question about what they specifically thought of guns, they would always be more forthcoming. Almost all of them saw the ubiquity of guns as a problem. But it did not necessarily follow that they saw getting rid of guns as a viable solution. To dwell on the innocence of “babes” and “angels” suggests there are less angelic, more deserving victims.

When the National Rifle Association held its annual convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2010, Judy Williams protested. When somebody gets shot dead in Charlotte, Williams knows about it. The organization she runs, Mothers of Murdered Offspring, has arranged vigils for murder victims for more than two decades. When MOMO started, the police would contact the group and let it know when a shooting had occurred. Now MOMO is such an institution in the city that the victims’ families usually go straight to them.

“I don’t think the Second Amendment means what they think it means,” Williams says. “You can dress it up and take it to church, but that don’t make it right that there should be no control.” If the NRA were coming back next year, I ask her, would she protest at the convention again? Williams pauses. “The reality of it is, they are not going to do away with guns in this country.… The fact is that they are so plentiful on the streets and people have them…. It’s ludicrous to think you can take guns out of people’s homes in this country.… It ain’t gonna happen.”

Having identified the problem, but without being able to envision any political remedy, Williams grudgingly understands the ubiquitous presence of guns as a banal fact of death in this country. Herein lies the central challenge for the national gun-control movement: It has rallied many good people who are doing good work, but it has failed to connect with the communities most keenly affected by gun violence. Indeed, the people who need it most—low-income communities of color—are the very ones we hear from least.

Segregation is a serious barrier to empathy. So when poor black and brown people are shot dead in areas deprived of resources, the media, the police, and a sizable portion of the political class are confirmed in their view that these are dysfunctional places where dysfunctional people live and die. It doesn’t challenge their worldview; it confirms it.

“If you’re a reader of The New York Times, then a child who is shot by a stray bullet during a gang shooting is not easy for you to imagine,” says Dan Kois, the culture editor of Slate, who in 2013 ran an online, crowdsourced death tally to record all the people who were shot daily. “Sandy Hook was easy for people to imagine.”

When there are mass shootings, the nation’s attention becomes concentrated on the issue. National gun-control advocates come to the fore and make the case for the kind of common-sense laws that would keep more Americans safe. But most people who are shot dead do not die in mass shootings—and most children and teens who are shot dead are not that young and not that white. Indeed, most people who are killed by a gun use one to kill themselves, and many of the remaining deaths come in the form of routine interpersonal violence. So the readers of The New York Times (and The Nation, for that matter) are going to have to broaden their imaginations if they’re going to mount an effective, sustainable challenge to the gun lobby.

* * * When you take these empathetic shortcuts, a lot of people get left out along the way.

Five months after Kenneth was shot, the NRA held its annual convention, this time in Indianapolis. In a cavernous exhibition hall showcasing the industry’s finest killing machines, scores of white men (few other demographics were present) aimed empty barrels into the middle distance and pondered their purchase. Elsewhere there were seminars on everything from “Wild Game Cooking: From Field to Table” to “The Men and Guns of D-Day.”

The NRA’s executive vice president and CEO, Wayne LaPierre, addressed a huge rally where he painted a dark picture of the hydra-headed threats enveloping the country, leaving no person safe and no place uncontaminated by suspicion. “We know, in the world that surrounds us, there are terrorists and home invaders and drug cartels and carjackers and knockout-gamers and rapers, haters, campus killers, airport killers, shopping-mall killers, road-rage killers, and killers who scheme to destroy our country with massive storms of violence against our power grids, or vicious waves of chemicals or disease that could collapse the society that sustains us all. I ask you: Do you trust this government to protect you? We are on our own.”

Whenever the NRA meets, protesters also gather to challenge the premise underpinning this dystopian vision: that guns make us safe. They don’t. The fact remains that the more likely you are to have a gun in the house, the more likely you are to be shot dead. Every other developed country has the same problems as the United States, to a greater or lesser degree: segregation, inequality, racism, citizens with mental-health problems. The one thing they don’t have is a huge arsenal of guns to throw on that tinder.

A few weeks before this particular NRA convention, then–New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had announced that he would spend $50 million developing a grassroots network of gun-control advocates that would bring together some of the main organizations campaigning on the issue, including Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, to form a group called Everytown for Gun Safety. The group’s press conference in Indianapolis on the day of the NRA’s convention was one of the first events it ever held.

I had hoped that I might find Kenneth’s friends or relatives, galvanized by his death, among the gun-control activists gathered that day. But looking around the room at the press conference, that seemed unlikely. In a city where one in four people is an African American and more than half the homicide victims are black, there were precious few black people among the protesters—save for a handful of women at the podium, all from other cities, who had lost their sons to gun violence. Indeed, despite Indianapolis having one of the highest homicide rates of any of the cities that I covered in my new book, Another Day in the Death of America, there didn’t seem to be anyone at the press conference who was from Indianapolis and had suffered from gun violence.

When I asked one of the organizers if I could talk to a local person, I was steered to a woman from Carmel, a wealthy nearby suburb. This woman, like many others in the room, had been spurred to action by Sandy Hook. “I have four little kids,” she told me. “When that happened, I couldn’t help thinking about my little kids in school. I’d been growing increasingly more concerned—every time a shooting happened, I thought, ‘Oh my God.’ But I didn’t really know how serious it was. Few circumstances are as great as a mom trying to protect her children.”

This emotional connection to Sandy Hook is easy to understand. The enduring image of that day—distraught children being escorted by a police officer in an orderly line, their faces contorted with panic and trauma—was searing. The sight of parents waiting anxiously to learn the fate of their kids and the pen portraits of fledgling lives so senselessly destroyed were harrowing.

And yet, if this is the connection on which the gun-control movement primarily depends, it will never achieve its potential, and it will prove a poor match for the apocalyptic narrative set out by LaPierre. To dwell on the innocence of “babes” and “angels,” as many gun-control activists did after Sandy Hook, implies that there are less innocent, less angelic victims out there more deserving of their fates.

The pursuit and promotion of the ideal “worthy” victim has long been a staple of social-justice campaigns. It can be effective at times, but it is always problematic. The argument’s center of gravity shifts from “This shouldn’t happen to anyone” to “This shouldn’t happen to people like this.” Sandy Hook may clarify the obscenity and the injustice of people being shot—but when you take these empathetic shortcuts, a lot of people get left out along the way.

Almost an hour after Kenneth was killed in Indianapolis, 17-year-old Stanley Taylor was killed in Charlotte following an altercation at a gas station. Mario Black, a school-behavior specialist, knew Stanley well: He’d been his teacher and, years earlier, had gone to school with Stanley’s mother. Just a couple months before the teen’s death, Black had set up the Million Youth March of Charlotte, after his own young cousin was shot. “We want to bring positive things to the community as it relates to people who are 13 to 25 years old,” he told me. “Because we always hear the negative. There’s always someone in that age group who’s getting gunned down here.”

He had plans to hold a huge family-day festival for the city’s youth and was seeking funding and support from churches and local leaders, but he was frustrated by the response. “The same people who are talking about it, won’t do anything about it,” he said. “We need donations. Everything we’re doing is coming out of our pockets. So we’re at a standstill.” The group’s first community give-back day—a family event with toys for the needy and barbers providing free haircuts—was dedicated to Stanley and his mother, Toshiba, who received a candle in his honor. When I met Black a year later, at the second give-back day, he was still struggling to get the idea off the ground. That day was dedicated to Ajewan Jones, one of Stanley’s best friends, who’d been shot dead six months after him. As I write, the streets of Charlotte are full of demonstrators protesting the police shooting of Keith Scott, and right-wing commentators are asking why no one in the black community cares about “black-on-black” violence.

Many of the kids who died during the 24 hours covered in my book were raised in tough circumstances and had messy lives. Moreover, communities of color are criminalized in a manner that makes “innocence” itself a notion that cannot simply be taken at face value. So long as the gun-control narrative stops with protecting innocents and babes, it’s difficult to see who will ever speak out for these kids.

Take Kenneth. More than two years after he died, two of the people in the car with him that night had warrants issued for their arrest in connection with a gang that trafficked guns and drugs in northern Indianapolis. We don’t know whether Kenneth was involved in that. We do know that eight months before he died, he was arrested for driving while black—or, more specifically, he was stopped for slowing down but “failing to come to a full and complete stop” while approaching a stop sign. The officer who pulled him over said he smelled marijuana, but could only find a pipe with marijuana residue in it, and so Kenneth was charged with “possession of paraphernalia.”

This is how large numbers of young people of color in the United States are caught up in the criminal-justice system—with a dragnet. It is also in no small part why their families fail to connect with the gun-control movement. “Sometimes, in the past, that has held organizations back,” says Julia Browder Eichorn, an African-American gun-control activist who lives in Columbus, Ohio. “To put someone out there who has had less than a stellar lifestyle—the opposition is going to tear that apart. They’re already calling our children, who have done nothing, ‘thugs.’ That’s a huge piece of why you don’t see more moms of color in this movement. Maybe they knew their kids were doing these things and they didn’t stop them. Maybe they just prayed nothing would happen to them. We have to stand with that mom who maybe didn’t make the best choice, or maybe she made the best choice that she could, but sadly her kid’s not here anymore.” Ready to Fight Back?

In the absence of that explicit solidarity, the national gun-control movement not only distances itself from the communities that would give its message and campaigns a sense of urgency, but can even appear to stand in opposition to them. When gun-control advocates emphasize the dangers of guns getting easily into the hands of “criminals”—as though the criminal-justice system is a neutral space—they move from gun control to social control: The central issue becomes not the gun, but the person wielding it.

None of the family members I spoke with raised the Second Amendment one way or the other. Almost all of them believed that guns were too readily available; none believed there was anything that could be done about it. Only one mother, according to her Facebook posts, had developed any real affinity with the gun-control movement. Otherwise, it was as though each death took place in helpless, hopeless isolation—a private, discrete tragedy complete unto itself. The broader context of race and poverty was clear to many. But when I told them of other families who had lost children that day, all seemed genuinely shocked that their grief overlapped in real time with that of others.

It’s as though they had lost a loved one in a war without any clear purpose, end, or enemy; a war they could do nothing about; a war that they long knew existed but from which they hoped by luck, judgment, discipline, and foresight they might be able to protect their kids; a war that is generally acknowledged in the abstract but rarely addressed in the concrete; a war that took their children but offered them no allies or community in their grief; a war they knew was taking place elsewhere, but experienced alone, as though it were happening only to them—when in fact it is happening to America. Every day.

Guns. In a country with more than 300 million of them, a country that’s recently been swept up in a round of protests over the endless killing sprees they permit, you’d think I might have had more experience with them. Ad Policy

As it happens, I’ve held a gun only once in my life. I even fired it. I was in perhaps 10th grade and enamored with an Eagle Scout who loved war reenactments. On weekends, he and his friends camped out, took off their watches to get into the spirit of the War of 1812, and dressed in homemade muslin underclothes and itchy uniforms. I was there just one weekend. Somehow my pacifist parents signed off on letting their daughter spend the day with war reenactors. Someone lent me a period gown, brown and itchy and ill-fitting. We women and girls spent an hour twisting black gunpowder into newspaper scraps. I joked that the newspaper was anachronistic—the previous week’s Baltimore Sun—but no one laughed.

A man came by with a long gun, an antique, resting on the shoulder of his jerkin to collect our “bullets” and he must have read the gun terror written on my face.

“Wanna give it a try?” he asked.

“Sure,” I said, stumbling to my feet, pushing my gown out of the way, and trying to act like I didn’t have broken-rifle patches, symbols of the pacifist War Resisters League, all over my real clothes. I felt a surge of adrenaline as I took the heavy weapon in my way-too-small hands. He showed me how to wrestle it into position, aim it, and fire. There were no bullets, just one of my twists of powder, but it made a terrifying noise. I shrieked and came close to dropping the weapon.

And there it was: the beginning, middle, and end of my love affair with guns—less than a minute long. Still, my hands seemed to tingle for the rest of the afternoon and the smell of gunpowder lingered in my hair for days.

Got Guns?

One in four Americans now owns a gun or lives in a household with guns. So how strange that, on that day in the late 1980s, I saw a real gun for the first and last time. I grew up in inner-city Baltimore. I’ve worked at soup kitchens and homeless shelters all over the East Coast and stayed at dozens of Catholic Worker Houses around the country—Providence, Camden, Syracuse, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles—every one in a “tough” neighborhood. I lived in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the mid-1990s, before you could get a $4 coffee or a zucchini scone on Van Brunt Street, before there was an Ikea or a Fairway in the neighborhood. All those tough communities, those places where President Trump imagines scenes of continual “American carnage,” and I’ve never again seen a gun. Current Issue View our current issue

Still, people obviously own them and use them in staggering numbers and in all sorts of destructive ways. Sensing that they’re widespread beyond my imagination, my husband and I have started asking the parents of our kids’ school friends if they own guns when we arrange play dates or sleepovers. We learned this from the father of a classmate of my 11-year-old stepdaughter Rosena. The dad called to make the arrangements for his son to come over after school. We talked logistics and food allergies and then he paused. “Now, I am sorry if this is intrusive,” he said, “but I do ask everyone: Do you keep guns in your house?” He sounded both uncomfortable and resolute.

I almost choked on my urge to say, “Don’t you know who I am?” In certain odd corners at least, my last name, Berrigan, is still synonymous with muscular pacifism and principled opposition to violence and weaponry of just about any kind, right up to the nuclear kind. But that dad probably didn’t even know my last name and it probably wouldn’t have meant a thing to him if he had. He just wanted to make sure his son was going to be safe and I was grateful that he asked—rather than just assuming, based on our Volvo-driving, thrift-shop-dressing, bumper-sticker-sporting lifestyle, that we didn’t.

“You know how kids are,” he said after I assured him that we were a gun-free household. “They’ll be into everything.”

And right he is. Kids are “into everything,” which is undoubtedly why so many of them end up with guns in their hands or bullets in their bodies.

“Do you question everyone about their guns?” I asked the dad. He replied that he did and, if they answered yes, then he’d ask whether those weapons were locked away, whether the ammunition was stored separately, and so on.

“Thank you so much. I think we need to start doing that too,” I said as our conversation was ending and indeed I have ever since.

It’s a subject worth raising, however awkward the conversation that follows may be, because 2 million kids in this country live in homes where guns are not stored safely and securely. So far this year, 59 kids have been hurt in gun accidents of one sort or another. On average, every 34 hours in our great nation a child is involved in an unintentional shooting incident, often with tragic consequences.

The National Rifle Association’s classic old argument, “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” takes on a far harsher edge when you’re talking about a 7-year-old accidentally killing his 9-year-old brother with a gun they found while playing in an empty neighboring house in Arboles, Colorado.

Two weeks after we learn this new parenting life skill in this oh-so-new century of ours, my husband Patrick is on the phone with a mom arranging a sleepover for Rosena. I hear him fumble his way through the gun question. From his responses, I assume the mom is acknowledging that they do have guns. Then there’s the sort of long, awkward silence that seems part and parcel of such conversations before Patrick finally says, “Well, okay, thanks for being so honest. I appreciate that.”

He hangs up and looks at me. “They do keep guns for hunting and protection, but they’re locked up and out of sight,” he tells me. “The mom says that the kids have never tried to get at the guns, but she understands the dangers.” (He had heard in her voice apology, embarrassment, and worry that the guns might mean no sleepover.)

I grimaced in a way that said: I don’t think Rosena should go, and he responded that he thought she should. The two of them then had a long conversation about what she should do and say if she sees a gun. She slept over and had a great time. A lesson in navigating difference, trusting our kid, and phew… no guns made an appearance. And we know more about our neighbors and our community.

Anything Can Be a Gun

My son Seamus, 5, received an Easter basket from a family friend. He was happy about the candy, of course, and immediately smitten with the stuffed bunny, but he was over the moon about what he called his new “carrot gun.” It wasn’t a toy gun at all, but a little basket that popped out a light ball when you pressed a button.

The idea was that you’d catch the ball, put it back in, and do it again. But that wasn’t the game my kids played. They promptly began popping it at each other. His little sister Madeline, four, was in tattle mode almost immediately. “Mom, Seamus is shooting me with his carrot gun!”

“Mom, Mom, Mom,” he responded quickly, “it’s a pretend play gun, not a real play gun. It’s okay.” He made popping noises with his mouth and held his hand as if he were grasping a genuine forbidden toy gun. It was an important distinction for him. He’d been a full-throated participant in the March for Our Lives in Boston on March 24, chanting with the rest of us “What do we want? Gun control! When do we want it? NOW!” for four hours straight.

At the march, he pointed out that all the police officers managing traffic and the flow of people were wearing guns on their belts.

“I see a gun, Mom,” he kept saying, or “That police officer has a gun, Mom.”

Repeatedly, he noticed the means to kill—and then four days after that huge outpouring of youth-led activism for gun security, Stephon Clark was indeed gunned down in his grandmother’s backyard in Sacramento, California. The police officers who shot him were looking for someone who had been breaking car windows in the neighborhood and they fired 20 shots into the dark in his direction. The independent autopsy found that he had been hit eight times, mostly in his back. Clark turned out to be holding only a cell phone, though the police evidently mistook it for a tool bar, which could have done them no harm from that distance, even if he had wielded it as a weapon.

Maybe the police saw a weapon the same way my 5-year-old son sees one. He can make a stick or just about anything else, including that little basket, into a “gun” and so evidently can the police. Police officers have killed black men and boys holding pipes, water hose nozzles, knives, and yes, toy guns, too.

Where Does the Violence Come From?

Parkland (17 killed, 14 wounded). Newtown (28 killed, 2 wounded). Columbine (15 killed, 21 injured). School shootings are now treated as a structural part of our lives. They have become a factor in school architecture, administrator training, city and state funding, and security plans. The expectation that something terrible will happen at school shapes the way that 3- and 4-year-olds are introduced to its culture. Part of their orientation now involves regular “shelter in place” and “secure-school” drills.

At my daughter’s preschool, the kids are told that they’re hiding from rabid raccoons, those animals standing in for marauding, disaffected white boys or men roaming the halls armed. As parents, we need to do more than blindly accept that these traumatic exercises are preparing our kids for the worst and helping them survive. Kids are vulnerable little beings and there are countless dangers out there, but they have a one-in-600 million chance of dying in a school shooting. We endanger them so much more by texting while driving them home from school.

After every episode of violence at a school—or in the adult world at a church, night club, concert, movie theater, or workplace like San Bernardino’s Inland Regional Center or the YouTube headquarters—there’s always a huge chorus of “why?” Pundits look at the shooter’s history, his (it’s almost always a guy) trauma, and whatever might be known about his mental health. They speculate on his (or, in the rare case of those YouTube shootings, her) political leanings, racial hatreds, and ethnic background. The search for whys can lead to hand wringing about hard-driving rock music or nihilistic video games or endemic bullying—all of which could indeed be factors in the drive to kill significant numbers of unsuspecting people—but never go far enough or deep enough.

Two questions are answered far too infrequently: Where do the guns come from? Where does violence come from?

Guns of all sizes and description are manufactured and sold in this country in remarkable numbers, far more than can be legally absorbed in our already gun-saturated land, so thousands of them move instead into the gray and black markets. Evidence of this trend shows up repeatedly in Mexico, where 70 percent of the weapons seized in crimes between 2009 and 2014 turned out to be made in El Norte. We have an estimated 300 million guns in this country, making us first by far in the world in gun ownership and some of them couldn’t conceivably be used for “hunting.” They are military-style weapons meant to tear human flesh and nothing but that—like the AR-15 that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz legally bought and used in his grim Parkland shooting spree.

This country, in other words, is a cornucopia of guns, which—honestly, folks—doesn’t have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment.

Where does the violence come from? I’ve already shared my inexperience with guns. Now, let me add to it my inexperience with violence. I don’t know what it’s like to have to react in a split second to or flee an advancing perpetrator. No one has ever come at me with a gun or a knife or a pipe, or anything else for that matter. And I count myself lucky for that. In a nation in which, in 2016 alone, 14,925 people were killed due to gun violence and another 22,938 used a gun to kill themselves, it’s a significant thing to be able to say.

And yet, I know that I’m the product of violence (as well as the urge, in my own family, to protest and stop it): the violence of white privilege, the violence of American colonialism, the violence of American superpowerdom on a global scale… and that’s no small thing. It’s a lot easier to blame active-shooter scenarios on poor mental-health screening than on growing up in a world layered with the threat of pervasive violence.

Power is about never having to say you’re sorry, never being held accountable. And that’s hardly just a matter of police officers shooting black men and boys; it’s about the way in which this country is insulated from international opprobrium by its trillion-dollar national security state, a military that doesn’t hesitate to divide the whole world into seven US “commands,” and a massive, planet-obliterating nuclear arsenal.

And don’t think that any of that’s just a reflection of Trumpian bombast and brutality either. That same sense of never having to say you’re sorry at a global level undergirded Barack Obama’s urbane dispassion, George Bush Junior’s silver spoon cluelessness, Bill Clinton’s folksy accessibility, George Bush Senior’s patrician poshness, Ronald Reagan’s aura of Hollywood charm, and Jimmy Carter’s Southern version of the same. We’re talking about weapons systems designed to rain down a magnitude of terror unimaginable to the Nikolas Cruzes, Dylann Roofs, and Adam Lanzas of the world.

And it doesn’t even make us safe! All that money, all that knowledge, all that power put into the designing and displaying of weapons of mass destruction and we remain remarkably vulnerable as a nation. After all, in schools, homes, offices, neighborhoods across the country, we are being killed by our kids, our friends, our lovers, our police officers, our crumbling roads and bridges, our derailing trains. And then, of course, there are all those guns. Guns meant to destroy. Guns beyond counting.

So what might actually make us safer? After all, people theoretically buy the kind of firepower you might otherwise use only in war and pledge allegiance to the US war machine in search of some chimera of safety. And yet, despite that classic NRA line—“The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun”—are we truly safer in a nation awash in such weaponry with so many scrambling in a state of incipient panic to buy yet more? Are my kids truly on the way to a better life as they practice cowering in their cubbies in darkened classrooms for fear of invading rabid “raccoons”?

Don’t you think that true security lies not in our arming ourselves to the teeth against other people—that is, in our disconnection from them—but in our connection to them, to the web of mutuality that has bound societies, small and large, for millennia? Don’t you think that we would be more secure and so much less terrified if we found ways to acknowledge and share our relative abundance to meet the needs of others? In a world awash in guns and fears, doesn’t our security have to involve trust and courage and always be (at best) a work in progress?

As for me, I’m tackling that work in progress in whatever ways I can—with my neighbors, my town, my husband, and most of all my children, educating them in the ways violence scars and all those weapons just increase our journey into hell, never delivering the security they promise."

Within a day of the massacre of men, women, and children in a Texas church, President Donald Trump made three claims. First, he maintained it wasn’t a guns problem. Second, he said the shooter was stopped by someone else with a gun. Third, he blamed mental illness. Together the statements made one thing very clear: There is no amount of violence or sympathetic victims that will ever shame today’s Republican Party to take action on guns. Ad Policy

The details are horrific. The details are always horrific. The shooter, a white male with a history of domestic violence, went in to First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, armed with an AR-15 style rifle. He opened fire. Victims included the 14-year-old daughter of the pastor, a 72-year-old, numerous young children, and a pregnant woman. One family hid in a bathroom, shots penetrating the walls. An 8-year-old ducked beneath a pew as his brother and two sisters were shot. After the killer had murdered 26 people, injured 20 more, and spread trauma throughout his community, he left the church. There he encountered at least one armed civilian, dropped his rifle, fled in his car, crashed, and seems to have shot himself in the head. A “good guy with a gun” did not stop the incident. The broken bodies lying in the church and the trauma of the survivors demonstrate clearly that the incident was not halted. Trump, unsurprisingly, claimed that “fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction.”

Trump’s comments on mental health are typical of Republican response to violence. He characterized the killer as a “very deranged individual” who has a “mental health problem at the highest level.” This was also his and Representative Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) response after the Las Vegas shooting. Republicans (and some Democrats) have been making comments like this for decades. On Monday in Japan, though, Trump added, “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country—as do other countries—but this isn’t a guns situation.”

That middle clause, “as do other countries,” is quite the tell. Trump regularly runs his mouth freely, revealing the subtext that lies beneath the usual GOP talking points. Trump isn’t wrong. Many countries have not adequately met the mental-health needs of its population. But linking acts of violence to people with mental health is gross stigmatization that belies the data. People with mental illness are vastly more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators of it. Related Article 4 Disabled People Dead in Another Week of Police Brutality David M. Perry

Still, let’s take Trump at his word here and agree that around the world other countries also have people with unmet mental-health needs. And yet among 171 nations of the world, the United States is the clear leader in mass shootings. It’s the guns. Of course it’s the guns.

Stigma is dangerous. When we spread the lie that mental illness leads to perpetrating mass murder, we push people to closet their conditions. Mental health, like all forms of health, requires maintenance and support. Secrecy just leads to vulnerability and self-harm. Even worse, the GOP, led by now-disgraced Representative Tim Murphy (R-PA), has frequently used high-profile incidents of violence to call for forced medication and easing the requirements for involuntary commitment. In other words, the GOP is more than willing to strip away liberties from people with disabilities in order to avoid talking about guns.

Just as we were processing the carnage in Texas, the news broke that Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo was crediting Stephen Paddock’s mass murder in Las Vegas on the killer’s becoming depressed after losing money. When white men kill, law enforcement, media, and elected officials seek out explanatory mental-health-based narratives to avoid talking about guns. Notice that the recent violence in New York generated no such talk, as the president and his lackeys quickly launched into anti-Islamic and anti-immigrant diatribes. This kind of prejudicial discourse is typical when people of color commit violence. Current Issue View our current issue

The emphasis on mental health is merely a craven deflection from the need to talk about guns. Our mental-health system needs a lot of help, though not to stop gun violence (only 3 to 5 percent of violent acts involve people with psychiatric disabilities, who otherwise make up about 18 percent of the population). The GOP spent the summer trying to defund community and medical-health supports in their attacks on health care.

Trump’s little slip, “as do other countries,” makes his agenda transparent. The problem is guns; Republicans know it; and they’re not going to do anything about it. The GOP has decided that the murder of children in church is a reasonable price to pay for the continued support of billionaire gun merchants and the NRA.

To stop, or even slightly slow the violence, we are going to have to elect different politicians."

In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, gun sales resumed a years-long sales slump that started before Barack Obama entered the White House. Stocks in all the major gun companies plummeted after the election, and sales have not come close to returning to Obama-era heights. Ad Policy

One way the gun industry has tried to revamp its image and boost sales is by presenting guns, particularly small handguns, as effective, common-sense tools for self-protection. Many gun manufacturers have shifted from heavily marketing military-style assault weapons to instead rolling out small handguns that are explicitly pitched as citizen self-defense weapons. This campaign has been aimed heavily at potential female customers—the National Rifle Association has a “NRA Women” program, which offers free training to “female gun enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels,” and on NRATV, there is a popular series called Armed & Fabulous. The NRA recently hired Dana Loesch as a spokesperson in an effort not to have only grizzled old men like Charlton Heston and Wayne LaPierre as the public faces of the group.

At the 2016 Republican National Convention, the NRA’s top lobbyist, Chris Cox, used his valuable prime-time speaking slot to drive this very pitch home. “Imagine a young mother at home with her baby, when a violent predator kicks the door in,” he said. “The police will do their best to get there quickly, but their average response time is 11 minutes. So the question is, should she be able to defend herself with a firearm in her own home? Of course.”

That view of guns—as a protection blanket for women—has never resembled reality, and a new study underscores how wrong it is. In 2015, women were over 100 times more likely to be murdered by a man with a gun than to use it to kill a man in self-defense.

The Violence Policy Center looked at FBI crime data from 2015, the most recent year available. It’s the first analysis of the 2015 data on female homicide victims. The study found there were 328 justifiable homicides committed by private citizens that year, and only 16 involved a woman killing a man with a gun. Conversely, there were 1,686 cases where a woman was murdered by a man with a gun. Those are only single-victim, single-offender incidents, and exclude mass shootings, so if anything it’s an undercount. (Domestic abuse that turns deadly can end up claiming many victims beyond the targeted woman, like the incident in Texas this month where a gunman showed up at his estranged wife’s house and killed her and eight other people who were attending a football party.)

Contrary to Cox’s formulation of a random, armed bad guy crashing through the living-room window, a vast majority of those 1,686 homicides were domestic in nature. Ninety-three percent of the female victims were murdered by a man they knew, and 64 percent were wives or “intimate acquaintances” of the man that killed them. (This does not include ex-girlfriends; the FBI does not break that down.)

Critics might point out that this study counts only justifiable homicides but not incidents where a woman may have otherwise used a gun to defend herself without killing the male attacker—either by non-fatally wounding him, or just waving the gun around. That’s a fair point, though on the flip side, this also doesn’t count the women who are non-fatally injured by men with guns, nor intimidated by them. Current Issue View our current issue

The study’s homicide-to-homicide comparison just buttresses a lot of social-science research that unambiguously states that the introduction of a firearm to a home only increases the chance someone will be killed, particularly a woman. A 1997 study in the Archives of Internal Medicine looked at women’s risk factors for violent death in their home, and found that the risk increased threefold when a gun was present inside the house. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that, not surprisingly, domestic incidents where a gun is used means it’s 12 times more likely that someone dies.

The high rate at which women are killed by guns is a uniquely American problem. In 25 high-income countries, America accounts for only 32 percent of the female population. But they are 84 percent of all female firearm homicide victims.

Sensible changes to the law could at least mitigate this violence, particularly since so much of it stems from domestic violence. But Republicans in Congress and the NRA have long opposed any such measures. In 2015, Senators Debbie Stabenow and Chuck Schumer introduced a measure that would, among other things, add “abusive dating partners, individuals under a court-imposed restraining order and convicted stalkers” to the list of people who cannot pass a federal background check for gun purchase. It did not become law. This year, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Representative Debbie Dingell introduced similar legislation in the Senate and House that would make people convicted of misdemeanor stalking crimes ineligible to purchase guns. Neither bill is expected to receive a vote."

Representative Elizabeth Esty’s blueprint for her first term in Congress changed as soon as Adam Lanza rampaged through Sandy Hook Elementary School. Elected five weeks earlier and not yet sworn in, she was suddenly thrust into a calamity that convulsed the nation. Ad Policy

Esty was already familiar with how outside events—shocking crimes in particular—could change a political career in unforeseen ways. As a freshman in the Connecticut Legislature in 2009, she voted to abolish the state’s death penalty. But as her first term unfolded, so did the trial of a man accused and then convicted of a brutal home invasion in her hometown of Cheshire. A woman and her young daughters were raped and murdered; they were apparently chosen at random by two career criminals.

The crime made international news and gripped the state, and Esty’s vote became an issue in her re-election campaign. M. Jodi Rell, the Republican governor at the time, vetoed the Legislature’s anti-capital-punishment bill and cited the Cheshire murders as the reason. A death-penalty verdict was handed down the same week as the election, and Esty lost her seat by two points.

But all of that was far from Esty’s mind on the morning of December 14, 2012, as she sat in a classroom at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Freshly elected to represent Connecticut’s Fifth Congressional District on a platform of bread-and-butter issues, Esty and some forty other incoming members of the House were receiving a training session on using social media.

Around 10 am, a Harvard staffer tapped her on the shoulder and said there’d been a school shooting in Connecticut. There was some initial confusion about exactly what had happened, and the staffer kept saying “Newton,” like the city outside of Boston, so Esty wasn’t sure even that the incident had occurred in her state. But it soon became clear that there had been an appalling number of deaths, and that it had happened in Newtown—right in her district.

“At that point, I just left the room, went to my hotel room, threw my things in a suitcase and drove straight to Newtown,” Esty told me over lunch there late this summer. The interview had been undramatic and upbeat to this point, but the tears began to well in her eyes. She described calling her mother and her minister on the two-hour drive home.

Esty had no staff and no experience representing the area in Congress, but she went directly to the command center at the firehouse adjacent to the school. Inside, some of her soon-to-be constituents were facing an agonizing wait as authorities methodically identified the twenty students and six teachers who had been killed by a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle. “Families were being notified one by one,” Esty said. “And I could hear them screaming in the other room.”

Soon, the whole world was there. “You could not walk two feet without hitting a national or international anchorperson. There were satellite dishes; there were gawkers. It was beyond horrific,” she said.

Once in Congress, Esty became a dogged proponent of tougher gun laws. She was named a vice chair of the Congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. She co-sponsored a raft of gun-violence prevention bills in the House, including the only gun-control measure to pass Congress after Newtown—a bill to provide $19.5 million to improve the federal background-check system, which passed this spring as an amendment to a Justice Department appropriations bill.

But twenty-one months after the shootings and with the midterm elections approaching, Esty is facing a situation that would have seemed absurd and even impossible in those days: her opponent, Mark Greenberg, opposes new federal gun laws.

Newtown was supposed to change everything—and for a moment, it appeared it had. Support inside Connecticut for stricter gun laws approached 60 percent in the months after the shooting. In April 2013, a package of reforms touted as the “toughest gun laws in the country” passed the Legislature with wide bipartisan support and was signed into law by Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy. But now, most polls show Malloy trailing his Republican opponent, Tom Foley, who opposes new gun laws. Foley won the GOP primary after receiving the backing of state gun-rights groups, defeating a fellow Republican and state senator who helped shepherd the post-Newtown gun laws. As for Greenberg, while he doesn’t crusade on the issue, he doesn’t hide his opposition to gun-law reform either—and while Esty is expected to hold her seat, she is one of twenty-five Democrats that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee considers at risk of an upset.

* * *

It certainly didn’t look like things would turn out this way. In the days after the shootings, almost everyone involved in the gun debate anticipated big changes. The National Rifle Association’s Wayne LaPierre may have blustered publicly against gun control, but as The New York Times later reported, the NRA’s top lobbyists were negotiating with the White House and Senate Democrats on background-check legislation under the assumption that it was inevitable. And the popular consensus was that tougher restrictions were on the way: FBI data showed that more guns were purchased on December 21, 2012, than on any preceding day, as people worried that it might be their last chance to buy whatever firearms they wanted.

But persistent misinformation and agitation by far-right members of Congress and gun groups even more rigid than the NRA slowly doomed the effort. Republicans who said they’d support background-check legislation started to waver, often citing bogus fears of a national gun registry that the bill explicitly forbade. The NRA began feeling the heat from groups like Gun Owners of America, which urged a no-compromise approach, and its lobbyists dropped out of the negotiations. By the time the bill reached the Senate floor, everybody knew it wouldn’t pass. And with no bipartisan Senate bill on his desk, House Speaker John Boehner was free to never talk about reform again.

The 2014 midterm elections reflect the same political indifference. In an election cycle with no overriding theme, gun control occupies a place somewhere alongside farm subsidies or the Export-Import Bank as an issue on the campaign trail. There are 435 House seats and thirty-six Senate seats being contested this fall, and aside from a few stray examples, it’s shocking how few candidates are talking about gun control. And most of the ones talking are opposed to reform: in West Virginia, for example, Republican Representative Shelley Moore Capito, who is running for the state’s open Senate seat against Democrat Natalie Tennant, took out a television ad proclaiming that “Obama tries to limit our rights to own a gun, and Tennant takes to the streets to campaign for him.”

Using Obama as a means to link Tennant to gun control is a curiously circuitous route; Tennant explicitly supports expanded background checks, which would seem a much more direct target. There are reasons, perhaps, for Moore Capito to tread lightly here: the Senate’s universal background-check legislation was famously co-sponsored by the state’s other US senator, Joe Manchin, who has remained relatively popular despite the millions of dollars in NRA ads targeting him during and after the Senate debate.

Does this mean that Tennant, for her part, is eager to engage on the issue? Not really. She makes her position on background checks clear on her website, but hasn’t made it a campaign issue.

This is the state of gun-control politics in 2014: candidates from both sides are approaching the issue with extreme caution. In Virginia, Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie makes only a passing mention of opposing gun control on his website. When the NRA blanketed Virginia with a pro-Gillespie mailer in late August, promising that the candidate would “strongly oppose and fight against [President Obama’s] anti-gun nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court,” area newspapers immediately speculated that the mailer “could have unintended consequences for Gillespie” as he seeks to win over moderate Virginia voters. But the incumbent, Senator Mark Warner, isn’t saying much about his vote for background checks either.

Indeed, it’s primarily outside groups that are inserting gun control into the midterm elections. The NRA and its gargantuan $250 million budget will surely be a big player once again, but Newtown spurred the creation of new (and well-funded) pro-reform groups. That’s the one bright spot in a political landscape that is otherwise frustrating for many activists and gun-violence victims: outside pro-reform groups are finally battling the previously unchallenged power of the NRA and learning how to target voters in more sophisticated ways. On the state level, there are bold ballot initiatives and signs of a real sea change on gun laws. And perhaps most important, what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School may have transformed a casual pro-gun-control constituency into a real political movement.

* * *

I met Pia Carusone at the Washington, DC, office of Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS), which was founded by former Representative Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, two months after the Sandy Hook shooting. Their office has fourteen staffers, mostly young people, and hopes to raise $20 million for the midterms. The conference room we sat in was covered with front-page articles about mass shootings from newspapers around the country. They all shared an eerie similarity: screaming headlines and pictures of people weeping or standing agape with hands over their mouths.

Carusone is the group’s senior advisor, and she acknowledged that candidates seemed loath to mention gun control this year. But that’s what she expected, she said: “This first cycle for us, and the first few years for us, we knew were going to be as much about educating the folks that are supporters of gun-violence prevention—educating them on how to talk about it, how to feel comfortable. Not just the elected officials, but the whole sort of infrastructure that stands behind those people: the media consultants, everybody.”

In the meantime, ARS is trying to figure out which voters should be targeted on the issue of gun control and how best to do it. Ninety percent of the public supports expanded background checks, but who among them would vote on that issue alone?

After sifting through the results of the 2013 statewide races in Virginia, Carusone thinks that ARS might have an answer: not only did independent women and non-college-educated women voters swing those contests; they were uniquely receptive to messages in favor of gun-law reform. (Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe, now the state’s governor, didn’t shy away from talking about gun control.) “For that group, it was a very big motivating issue,” Carusone said. And this could be big in the midterms: in the hotly contested state of North Carolina, for example, ARS found that almost 90 percent of suburban women favor background checks.

Accordingly, ARS has ramped up its outreach to women on specific issues like the links between guns, domestic abuse and violence against women. One of the group’s first ad buys, in the Arizona district that Giffords used to represent, features a mom whose daughter was shot dead “by a man with a criminal record.” The group has also been working to inform female voters that the gun lobby’s efforts to expand open-carry laws would allow weapons in libraries and daycare centers, among other places.

If this strategy of micro-targeting is successful in the midterms, ARS believes that it could lay the groundwork to make gun reform an even bigger issue in elections to come. “Let’s say [Colorado Senator] Mark Udall…doesn’t mention word one on gun safety,” Carusone said. “It would seem as though it didn’t really play a big factor. If I can show you that we moved a substantial amount of voters to the polls on behalf of him, on behalf of this issue—we could be the margin. If he wins by two points or something, and I could show you we moved two points, that would be a success for me.”

Other gun-law reform groups seem to be on the same page, if perhaps taking a more sledgehammer approach. Everytown for Gun Safety, an umbrella group that grew out of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns, took out a dramatic television ad in July targeting three Republican senators. In it, a man breaks into his ex-girlfriend’s house and points a gun at her head as she clutches a baby. A gunshot is heard as the screen cuts to black. The ad is tied to a Senate bill that would prevent domestic abusers from passing a background check for gun purchases. (Only spouses convicted of stalking are currently prohibited under federal law, not ex-boyfriends or domestic partners.)

The pro-reform strategy doesn’t always work—as is often the case with outside money, it can end up tainting the recipient. Bloomberg, through his Super PAC, wanted to make a splash in a local contest this summer and dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars into the Milwaukee County sheriff’s race. The controversial incumbent, David Clarke, had been running headline-grabbing ads advising residents to arm themselves instead of calling 911. Clarke won, and he quickly credited the backlash against big-city Bloomberg for the win: “He came in and thought he could spread a few hundred thousand dollars around to take a prized catch away,” Clarke declared on Fox News the morning after the election. “He didn’t understand the political climate on the ground here in Milwaukee County.”

But overall, there’s a real sense of optimism among the reformers, most of whom join a weekly conference call, hosted by Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, to plot strategy—a regular occurrence since at least the 2013 Senate debate. “I think we’re getting there. We’re in at the ground floor of this movement,” Carusone said. “We always knew it was gonna be a long, hard haul, but this is just not going to stop. That’s the cynical calculation the other side is making.”

* * *

An untold story of the post-Newtown debate over gun control is how much happened at the state level: while the national media deemed gun control impossible after Congress failed to act, eight states made significant or sweeping changes to gun laws, while only four states significantly weakened them, according to analysis by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Mark Follman at Mother Jones crunched the numbers and found that more than half of all Americans now live in a state with stronger gun control laws than existed before Newtown.

The 2014 midterms could bring about even more change. In Washington State, a ballot initiative to institute universal background checks is enjoying overwhelming support among voters. The campaign to pass the initiative has raised more than $7 million, including seven-figure donations from both Everytown and former Microsoft chair Bill Gates. A pro-gun group pushing another ballot initiative that would essentially negate any new background-check laws has raised only $1 million.

In Illinois, voters will decide on a nonbinding referendum calling for the state to expand background checks and to outlaw assault weapons. In Nevada, activists are gathering signatures to put a binding background-checks initiative on the ballot in 2016. This could become a crucial national focal point, since Nevada will be hotly contested by presidential candidates in both the primary and general elections that year.

Many people are getting involved outside the electoral and legislative arenas as well by joining a wide-ranging movement to keep guns out of public spaces. Chipotle, Target, Chili’s, Sonic and others have all agreed to ask customers not to bring guns into their stores. This movement counters a long-running NRA strategy of expanding the places that people can have guns by promoting open-carry laws. I met with Po Murray of the Newtown Action Alliance inside a Starbucks just up the road from the site of Sandy Hook Elementary School, which has since been demolished. Last year, local guns-rights groups planned to stage a pro-gun event there—but the Newtown Action Alliance persuaded Starbucks to shut down the store that day. Later, the group Moms Demand Action picked up the charge, and got Starbucks to ban guns in its locations nationwide.*

“There were many community members that were outraged about what might happen,” Murray said. He called the proposed pro-gun event “unbelievable—there are no words to describe the boldness of gun-rights groups.”

Ultimately, however, the biggest prospects for change reside in Washington, DC. About 32,000 annual gun deaths touch virtually every district in the country, and the capital city itself is intimately familiar with gun violence. Like some dystopian future of guns run amok, local authorities have installed sensors throughout the city that can pinpoint and triangulate frequent gunfire and direct police to its location. The Urban Institute looked at the reports that the system collected and found that 54 percent of the gunshots were within 1,000 feet of a school.

Still, Congress probably won’t act soon. A senior Senate aide told me that majority leader Harry Reid “strongly desires a first successful vote on the bill rather than a second unsuccessful defeat.” With the Democrats fighting just to hold on to the chamber, that makes it unlikely in the foreseeable future. And with the House very likely to stay Republican, it’s hard to imagine Speaker John Boehner feeling any pressure to act (though most observers agree that if he did bring a background-check bill to the floor, it would pass).

Esty, for her part, remains optimistic that she’ll return to the fight. Of all the donors who contributed through late July, every single one from Newtown gave to her campaign; not one donated to Greenberg, which is remarkable given how close her race was in 2012.

“I can’t afford to get discouraged or give up—that would be letting these folks down,” Esty told me. “And that would be letting the NRA win. That’s what they’ve always counted on. They’ve counted on people giving up and going home and not staying the course.”

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie answers a question during a campaign event in Manville, New Jersey, Monday, May 13, 2013. (AP Photo/Mel Evans) Ad Policy

On Friday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie refused to sign three closely watched gun control bills, including a ban on .50 caliber sniper rifles similar to one Christie himself called for earlier this year. Christie’s decision, announced late in the evening, indicates that his pivot from moderate governor to contestant in the GOP presidential primaries is underway, if after-hours and off the record.

Christie fully rejected the ban on .50 caliber rifles, five-foot-long snipers that can be loaded with palm-length cartridges designed to penetrate heavy armor a mile away; and that are, according to Christie, necessary for “recreational pastimes.” While Christie proposed outlawing the sale of these weapons in April, he wrote to the General Assembly that banning them outright would “serve only to confuse law-abiding gun owners with the threat of imprisonment.” In fact, the law would give gun owners a year in which to register, and then legally keep, any .50 calibers currently in their possession.

Christie carved up the two other bills and sent them back to the legislature with conditional vetoes. From a bill that supporters called a “national model” for overhauling how states conduct background checks and issue firearm permits, Christie cut provisions to digitally embed firearm permits in a gun owner’s driver’s license, to include private sales in the instant background check system and to require prospective gun owners to take a short safety course.

“None of the technology necessary for this system exists,” Christie said of the measure that would link firearm permits with state ID.

Christie also gutted a law requiring state officials to report data about lost and stolen firearms, along with those seized in association with a crime, to federal databases.

At a press conference today, gun control advocates criticized Christie for “put[ting] politics over safety” and for being “courageous for his place in the Republican Party, but not for the residents of New Jersey.” Even before the Sandy Hook shootings, 65 percent of New Jersey residents reported being “very concerned” about gun violence, and the same percentage put a higher priority on gun control than on maintaining an individual’s right to own a firearm. While Christie signed ten other gun-related measures into law last week, none were as crucial to advocates or as hotly contested within the pro-gun community as the bills he vetoed. Still, with his re-election approaching, Christie’s position in New Jersey is solid.

As my colleague George Zornick wrote earlier this month, it’s conservative Republicans nationwide to whom Christie will have to defend his record should he seek the presidential nomination in 2016, and a majority of these voters say they won’t vote for a candidate with whose gun policy they disagree. As governor of a state with some of the country’s strictest gun laws, Christie has already given the gun lobby plenty of fodder with which to attack him. So it isn’t clear that Friday’s vetoes will do much more to protect him from the far right than they will to damage his reputation as a straightforward and independent executive.

Speaking to the Republican National Committee the day before declining to sign the legislation, Christie offered a pre-emptive explanation for his gun control about-face: “I’m in this business to win,” he said. “I am going to do anything I need to do.”

There’s a joke that goes like this. A man walks into a bar in Georgia. Mistaking a man at the counter for the bartender, he asks him repeatedly for a shot. The man he’s asking finally turns to him and asks, “You sure you want it, man?” And the first man says, “Yeah, and make it a double.”

So the man at the counter raises his gun and shoots him twice.

There’s another joke that goes like this: since 2009, there have been, on average, two mass shootings in the United States every month (with mass shootings referring to the murder of four or more people by firearm in a single incident). According to the FBI, those shootings account for less than 1 percent of all firearm murders in the country.

Despite President Obama’s poor record on gun control, an area in which he has made little to no significant progress, his administration has been continuously charged with assaulting gun owners’ Second Amendment right to bear arms since he took office. Those accusations, though fictitious, have caused gun sales to skyrocket in recent years.

And, while the administration has done little to regulate gun use, the gun lobby and its supporters have pushed through a preponderance of legislation slackening those same regulations. Perhaps the most frightening of these efforts culminated on April 23, 2014, when Georgia Governor Nathan Deal signed the “Safe Carry Protection Act,” referred to by critics as the “guns everywhere bill.” The bill allows licensed gun owners in Georgia to bring firearms into a number of public buildings, including bars, churches and, at the discretion of individual districts, even schools.

The punch line for this joke is unclear. Maybe it’s the fear I often feel walking down the street at night, wondering which of the people walking past might suddenly draw a gun from a purse or coat pocket. Maybe it’s the fact that for the first—and hopefully last—time in my life, I woke up in my dorm bed two months ago to the sound of gunshots and then drifted back to sleep as a man died in front of Copabanana, less than a block away.

Maybe it’s the fact that soon, that fear won’t abate at all for Georgians walking into crowded, well-lit buildings, where a drunken debate or charged comment might translate into gunfire as suddenly as a confrontation in a dark alley. Maybe it’s the way the extreme, prejudiced opinions of certain citizens no longer abstractly threaten my liberty via their access to the voting booth but now more concretely threaten my life via their access to high-powered weapons.

Whatever the punch line is, I’m still waiting for it. Waiting for gun laws like this to start making sense, as yet another young man with a legally purchased firearm is carted off to prison or the cemetery, leaving behind him an unthinkable number of dead bodies and grieving families and gun rights advocates stepping forward to say, “It’s a shame, but crimes like this are unpreventable,” insisting that the only solution is to arm more people in hopes that next time someone will turn the gun on the shooter rather than another innocent.

I think the real punch line is our failure to grasp the simple truth that doing the same thing over and over will never produce a different result. Until we make a real move toward restricting firearm access, we’ll keep reading about these shootings in the morning news. We’ll continue crying over deaths we might have been able to prevent. We’ll continue fearing the next person to pick up a gun and punctuate his hatred and depression with a slug in the head of a coed, a secretary or a first grader.

The real punch line is that more than 11,000 people are murdered with a gun every year in the United States, and we have yet to close the loopholes that currently allow 40 percent of firearms to be sold without background checks.

I want to make it very clear: when I say gun control in this country is a joke, I don’t mean it’s funny.

It isn’t funny at all."

This past August, the Lafayette-based IND Monthly published a story about a 54-year-old man named Bill Winters, incarcerated at a medium-security prison in Epps, Louisiana. Winters, who is black, was arrested in June 2009, after he drunkenly entered an unlocked oncologist’s office on a Sunday morning, setting off a security alarm. When police arrived, he had rummaged through a desk drawer, and was in possession of a box of Gobstoppers candy. Winters was convicted of simple burglary a week before Thanksgiving, and given a seven-year prison sentence—hardly a slap on the wrist. But a few days later, the prosecutor in his case, Assistant District Attorney Alan Haney, sought additional punishment for Winters, under the state’s habitual offender law. Based on his record of nonviolent offenses, which went back to 1991 and ranged from cocaine possession to burglary, the trial court resentenced Winters to twelve years without any chance of parole. But Haney was still not satisfied. He appealed the ruling, arguing that the court had imposed an “illegally lenient sentence” and that the rightful punishment was life without the possibility of parole. Ad Policy

At a subsequent hearing, Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft estimated that Winters had been arrested more than twenty times, calling him a “career criminal who victimized a lot of citizens in our city.” But it seemed clear that he was more of a thorn in the side of law enforcement than a looming threat to society. His brothers, Dennis and James, testified that Winters had been homeless at the time of his offense and that he had a history of addiction; James had overcome his own drug problems and said that he would be willing to “take [Winters] in and work with him.” A former Lafayette police officer who had once worked at a correctional facility where Winters was held, said that although he did not know him well, Winters “didn’t cause problems” and had potential for rehabilitation. But this past summer, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision: “The state asserts that because of the defendant’s particular multiple offender status, the law mandates a minimum sentence of life in prison without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. We agree.”

Dennis Winters was incredulous when he heard the news about his brother. “What? This makes no sense,” he told IND Monthly. “I don’t understand what these people are trying to do. He’s not a violent person. He’s fragile. He wouldn’t hurt anybody, except maybe for himself. I just don’t get how they’re going to give him life for some Gobstopper candy.”

Today, Winters joins hundreds of Louisiana prisoners sent to die in prison after committing similarly nonviolent offenses, from drug possession to property crimes. The national numbers are tallied in a major new study released today by the American Civil Liberties Union, titled “A Living Death: Life without Parole For Nonviolent Offenses,” which documents scores of cases with echoes of Winters’s story. Across the country, defendants have been given life without parole for such crimes as having a crack pipe, “siphoning gasoline from a truck” and, in another Louisiana case, shoplifting a $159 jacket.

Tales of outsized sentencing for minor crimes may not surprise anyone familiar with the well-documented excesses of three-strikes sentencing in California, for example. But the ACLU’s report is the first to attempt to grasp the national numbers, specifically concerning nonviolent offenders sentenced to die behind bars. The report found 3,278 prisoners serving life without parole in 2012 for nonviolent crimes, of which 79 percent were for drug crimes. This is not the complete picture—Bill Winters himself is not among the prisoners covered—and crucially, only includes formal life-without-parole cases. It does not include life sentences where parole is a possibility—if largely only in theory, given the increasing reluctance of parole boards to free prisoners. It also does not include, say, 100-year sentences, or the kinds of stacked, decades-long sentences that are, in effect, permanent life sentences. “The number of people serving death-in-prison sentences after being convicted of nonviolent crimes is not known,” the report concludes, “but it is most certainly higher than the number of prisoners serving formal life-without-parole sentences for nonviolent crimes.”

Indeed, a report released earlier this year by the Sentencing Project found that one in nine prisoners in the US are serving a life sentence and that “those with parole-eligible life sentences are increasingly less likely to be released.” Including life with parole, the report estimated that “approximately 10,000 lifers have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.”

Determining what qualifies as “nonviolent” is similarly complicated. As the ACLU points out, “Although the term ‘violent crime’ brings to mind very serious offenses such as rape and murder, some jurisdictions define violent crime to include burglary, breaking and entering, manufacture or sale of controlled substances, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, or extortion.” In other words, the number of prisoners serving life without parole who are far from the “worst of the worst” is higher still.

* * *

Regardless of the exact numbers, and perhaps not surprisingly for the state known as the prison capital of the world, it is clear that Louisiana is home to a disproportionate number of these sentences. It also provides a dramatic illustration of the explosion of permanent life sentences over the past four decades: “In Louisiana, just 143 people were serving LWOP sentences in 1970,” the ACLU notes. “That number had increased to 4,637 by 2012.” The report found that Louisiana had the highest number of nonviolent offenders serving life without parole out of all the states: 429. Florida was a distant second, with 270. (Thanks to the drug war, federal prisoners accounted for the largest share at 2,074.)

Among the Louisiana prisoners highlighted in the report are Fate Vincent Winslow, who, while homeless, “acted as a go-between in the sale of two small bags of marijuana, worth $10 in total, to an undercover police officer;” Timothy Jackson, who stole a jacket from a department store in New Orleans, Paul Carter, convicted of “possession of a trace amount of heroin residue that was so minute it could not be weighed;” and Sylvester Mead, a Shreveport man who drunkenly threatened a police officer while seated, handcuffed, in the back of a patrol car.

Mead’s case, like Winters’s, shows the way in which prosecutors’ wishes consistently trump judicial power when it comes to sentencing people for such crimes. Not only did his trial judge oppose the initial charge of public intimidation, he made it repeatedly clear he opposed sending Mead to die in prison. Mead’s verbal offense “does not warrant, under any conscionable or constitutional basis, a life sentence,” he said. But Mead’s prosecutor appealed multiple times seeking a harsher sentence because of his old convictions. After his previous sentences were vacated by a higher court multiple times, Judge Leon L. Emanuel was bound by Louisiana’s mandatory sentencing statute to hand down a sentence of life without parole. “No matter how long this Court were to deliberate about this matter, it cannot fashion a legal result to explain that the life sentence without probation or suspension of sentence is unconstitutionally excessive,” he concluded.

Such statements from judges are not unusual, it turns out. “In case after case reviewed by the ACLU, the sentencing judge said on the record that he or she opposed the mandatory LWOP sentence as too severe but had no discretion to take individual circumstances into account or override the prosecutor’s charging decision,” the ACLU found. Mandatory sentencing schemes are certainly to blame—in Louisiana, they account for almost all—97.6 percent—of the surveyed nonviolent LWOP sentences. But while mandatory sentencing ties the hands of judges, such punishments do not impose themselves. Prosecutors have the power to seek or not seek them.

* * *

Bill Winters was not the first defendant to find himself in the crosshairs of Lafayette ADA Alan Haney. Indeed, in 2007, Haney created a “career criminal program,” as described by the local Daily Advertiser, to “identify repeat offenders all over Lafayette Parish.”

“We basically had to start this whole project from scratch,” he told the City-Parish Council in September 2010, according to the Advertiser. Thus far, he boasted, some forty-nine people had been sentenced as habitual offenders with the help of the initiative.

In the fall of 2009, the same year Winters was convicted for stealing Gobstoppers, a 29-year-old black man named Travis Bourda was convicted for possessing 130 grams of marijuana “with intent to distribute.” Writing to the ACLU, Bourda insists that no drugs were actually found in his posession and that his court-appointed lawyer “filed no motions, failed to investigate,” and “made no objections at trial.” His initial sentence of eight years was increased to fourteen after Haney filed habitual offender charges based on Bourda’s previous record, which included “carnal knowledge of a juvenile” when he was 19. Responding to Haney’s attempt to seek a sentence of life without parole for Bourda, the trial judge wrote: “I believe a life sentence under the circumstances…would be an unconstitutional sentence. I believe that fourteen years is more than enough considering the underlying charge was possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and that the amount of marijuana involved was not significant.”

But in 2011 the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed with Haney, vacating the fourteen-year sentence and imposing life without parole. Today, Bourda is serving his sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, famously known as Angola.

Angola prisoners were not allowed to receive visits or speak on the phone to the ACLU. But in response to the questionnaire sent out by attorney Jennifer Turner, who authored the report and corresponded with more than 600 prisoners, Bourda described himself as “the most miserable person there is.” He wrote that he was diagnosed as schizophrenic when he was 13 and that he hears voices that tell him to do things. In a separate, handwritten letter, he wrote to “share my thoughts about the Habitual Offender law,” which he describes as “the most unconstitutional law there is.”

“We paid our debts to society for the past crimes we committed,” Bourda wrote.” “…There is never any forgiveness once you have a record.” In his opinion, he added, “the prosecution is abusing his discretion on a certain race of people which we know to be black individuals.”

Whether or not prosecutorial discretion is to blame, Bourda’s observation about race is certainly supported by the numbers. The ACLU report shows, and Turner wrote to me in an e-mail, that “the racial disparity in life without parole sentencing for nonviolent crimes in Louisiana is staggering.” While the state would not provide figures according to race, the ACLU calculated that black prisoners “comprise 91.4 percent of the nonviolent LWOP prison population in Louisiana,” despite the fact that “Blacks make up only about one-third of the general population in the state.” Black defendants in Louisiana “were 23 times more likely than whites to be sentenced to LWOP for a nonviolent crime.”

There are many factors that could explain this. “The racial disparity can result from disparate treatment at every stage of the criminal justice system, including stops and searches, points of arrest, prosecutions and plea negotiations, trials, and sentencing,” Turner explains. She adds, “In Louisiana, it may also have to do with how prosecutors wield their enormous discretion in deciding whether to charge defendants as habitual offenders.”

I contacted Alan Haney’s office by phone and e-mail to discuss his Habitual Offender Division, but have not received a response. In the meantime, the ACLU report is only the most recent to cast a stark light on Louisiana’s sentencing excesses. While some recent reforms in the state have sought to mitigate some of Louisiana’s harshest sentencing statutes, they still preserve the power of the prosecutor to decide if and when to trigger mandatory sentences. In a report released by the Reason Foundation last month, which closely examines the state’s determinate sentencing laws and makes recommendations for reform, the authors found that a 2012 law signed by Governor Bobby Jindal to allow courts to waive mandatory minimums in some cases put all the power in prosecutors’ hands, giving prosecutors “much more power than they previously had.”

The ACLU also makes recommendations for reform. It calls on the states and federal government to get rid of laws that mandate or allow life without parole for nonviolent crimes, and exhorts state governors, as well as the Obama administration, to commute such disproportionate punishments. “Life without parole sentences for nonviolent offenses defy common sense,” it concludes, and “are grotesquely out of proportion to the conduct they seek to punish.”

In Bourda’s words, “I never committed a capital offense such as murder….I don’t deserve to be sentenced like a hard-core criminal.”

Law enforcement officials describe the United States as a one-stop shop for the guns sought by terrorists, mercenaries and international criminals of all stripes. And September 11 has not changed that in any significant way. In fact, Attorney General John Ashcroft has refused to permit the use of gun purchase records to track crimes, a practice that the FBI had previously used and that conceivably could help to identify terrorists. Nor did Ashcroft propose closing gun loopholes as part of the USA Patriot Act. The result of the lax US system, says McBride, is “an ongoing cycle” in which weapons bought here end up fueling violence abroad, and in which America is regarded as the firearms “shopping center for the world.”

Lobster Air and Gun Land

The story of a ragtag South Florida outfit called Lobster Air International illustrates just how easy US gun purchases can be. In the summer of 1998 Stephen Jorgensen began buying the first of what were eventually more than 800 MAK-90 semiautomatic rifles at a store called Gun Land in Kissimmee, Florida. He did not have a resale permit–known as a Federal Firearms License, or FFL–and he was not required to present one. But Jorgensen wasn’t stockpiling the guns for his personal use; he was taking them to Opa-Locka airport near Miami and loading them aboard a light airplane headed for airstrips in Venezuela and Colombia, via Haiti.

Jorgensen’s South American clients originally wanted AK-47s, but in the United States, the fully automatic AK-47 can be purchased from a dealer only with a Class 3 permit, which is difficult to obtain. The AK was modified in 1990 to get around the California Assault Weapons Ban–hence MAK-90, or “Modified AK 1990.” It is virtually identical to the AK-47 but costs only $200 to $300, compared with $1,000 to $3,000 for a Russian-made AK-47. It is exempt from the national Assault Weapons Ban, enacted after the California ban, because it has slight alterations that give it a hunting-rifle appearance. Jorgensen, a hefty man with an easygoing manner, says the distinction is absurd. “These weapons happened to be a loophole because they didn’t have a pistol grip on the stock. They had a thumbhole. How ridiculous!” The MAK-90 can use the same caliber bullet as the AK-47, and it can be converted to fully automatic with rudimentary mechanical skills; a number of websites offer kits and instructions.

The smuggling operation began when a lieutenant colonel of the Venezuelan Air Force asked Rafael Ceruelos if he knew anyone who could buy guns. Ceruelos, of Cuban origin, is a self-described import-export businessman who had already been doing business with the colonel, selling him aircraft parts through connections he had with an aircraft broker from Texas. Ceruelos speaks in a raspy voice, a more sophisticated version of Al Pacino’s gruff Tony Montana character from Scarface. He likes to use words like “friggin'” a lot. He says that he just wanted to keep his clients happy.

Ceruelos says the Texan hooked him up with Jorgensen, an old Vietnam War buddy in Tampa who could get weapons at a discount. In 1998 several meetings took place in Dallas, Miami and Caracas to orchestrate a deal, which included setting up Lobster Air to import lobsters to the United States from Haiti. According to Jorgensen, the Venezuelan colonel and the interests he represented put up the money to buy an Aero Commander aircraft. Jorgensen contracted boat operators to circle Haiti and collect lobsters from remote villages, but that part of the plan never went forward. Lobster Air was apparently not in the business of selling lobsters.

On January 3, 1999, US Customs agents, acting on what they thought was a drug tip, stopped the Aero Commander, bound for South America, on a runway at Opa-Locka. But there were no drugs; instead, the plane was loaded with seventy-eight disassembled MAK-90s inside blue gym bags, along with 9,000 rounds of ammunition. Customs and ATF sources now say that Lobster Air’s weapons were headed to Colombia’s FARC rebels, another group on the State Department’s terror list. But McBride, the retired ATF agent, says that “when guns are going into Colombia, there are a number of potential sources they could be going to, including the drug cartels, the various insurgency groups, paramilitary forces over there…. [It’s] very difficult to tell exactly where those guns were going to go, unless you were fortunate enough to get some confiscated and then have the traces run back.”

Jorgensen was detained and interrogated. Facing indictment on weapons and conspiracy charges, he quickly agreed to cooperate with what was now a US Customs-ATF investigation. Meanwhile, Ceruelos proceeded to concoct more business. Jorgensen, however, was recording their conversations for federal prosecutors. The Venezuelan customers needed 200,000 rounds of ammunition, so Ceruelos agreed that Jorgensen would buy the ammo at a local gun shop in 10,000-round increments, so as not to arouse suspicion. Jorgensen assured Ceruelos, “They don’t monitor buying the ammunition; you don’t sign, nobody knows you bought it. So that’s a fairly low risk.”

With the secret recordings in prosecutors’ hands, Jorgensen and Ceruelos were soon indicted–not for buying the guns, but for violating the Arms Export Control Act. Ceruelos served fifteen months and Jorgensen received only probation, thanks to his cooperation and what he describes as a “sterling military record.” It may be surprising to learn that buying hundreds of MAK-90s and thousands of rounds of ammunition that could supply US-designated terrorist organizations doesn’t raise any eyebrows. But there is simply no requirement for gun stores to report suspicious activity. If a customer buys more than one handgun in five days, the store must report the sales to ATF, but the MAK-90 comes with no such restriction. Nor does ammunition. Some gun-store owners say they voluntarily tip off ATF to suspicious buyers, usually after the sale is made and the money collected.

‘Bubba Did It’

When Gun Land’s owner, William Ben Woodall, answers the phone, he doesn’t use his real name. “Tell ’em Bubba did it,” he laughs. “Bubba” says there’s no limit to the number of guns that someone can buy in Florida. He says he’d probably call ATF if someone came in to buy hundreds of semiautomatic rifles, but that if the person “looked right and acted right” and passed the NICS test–the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which requires gun-shop owners to call ATF and check whether a client is a felon or is otherwise prohibited from buying guns–he’d have no problem. Such a purchase, he says, is ultimately a customer’s right. “Cars kill more people than guns,” he says.

Weapons sold over the counter can quickly find themselves bound by air for distant countries. Since September 11, 2001, Customs has stepped up its monitoring of outbound small aircraft, but such inspections are aimed more at stopping the delivery of components used in weapons of mass destruction, like triggering devices or plutonium, than at halting gun shipments. McBride says we should also be concerned about guns. Recalling a 1985 rampage by one guerrilla group, he says, “The M-19 raided and assaulted the Palace of Justice in Colombia, killing 115 people, eleven Supreme Court justices, and wiped out the Supreme Court of the country of Colombia. And these were guns that were subsequently traced back to the United States.”

McBride says South Florida investigators came to see a connection between purchases here and violence abroad. “We would see, all of a sudden, a rash of large gun purchases, a large quantity of gun purchases throughout South Florida. We would find that then, a month or two months later, we would see a coup take place in Haiti.” McBride adds that Florida is especially attractive to South and Central America, “because of our geographic location [and] the ease with which firearms can be secured here.”

Guns and the War on Terror

After September 11, Attorney General Ashcroft told the nation, “It’s our position at the Justice Department and the position of this Administration that we need to unleash every possible tool in the fight against terrorism, and to do so promptly.” The resulting USA Patriot Act includes broad changes in surveillance, information sharing and intelligence tools available to law enforcement. Although the “Patriot” part of the act’s title refers to “Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism,” the act contains no new provisions for the monitoring or control of firearms.

One tool became apparent in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks, when agents from ATF asked the FBI to cross-check a list of terrorist suspects against NICS records of approved gun purchasers. The records ATF wanted the FBI to examine were the normal background check records of potential gun purchasers, which are kept for ninety days. But when the FBI began its NICS checks, Attorney General Ashcroft and Justice Department officials stepped in and told the FBI it was out of bounds.

“This decision by the Attorney General was surprising in that he didn’t place officer safety and the security of the American people first,” says a former official at the Treasury Department, which oversees ATF. Kenneth James, recently appointed to the firearms committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, agrees. “If we have some form of identifying who of these terrorists may have had guns, that just makes our investigation and the people who are out there on the frontlines that much safer.”

Ashcroft defended his decision on legal grounds. “It’s my belief,” he said, “that the United States Congress specifically outlaws and bans the use of the NICS database–and that’s the use of approved purchase records–for weapons checks on possible terrorists or on anyone else.” But an internal Justice Department memo shows that Ashcroft’s own office of legal counsel believed otherwise and supported the longtime FBI practice of using NICS records in criminal investigations. “We see nothing in the NICS regulations,” the memo read, “that prohibits the FBI from deriving additional benefits from checking audit log records.”

Mathew Nosanchuk once worked for the Justice Department, where he became an expert on law enforcement’s use of NICS. He now works for the Violence Policy Center, a Washington-based gun-control group. Ashcroft, Nosanchuk says, is forcing the FBI and ATF to “conduct the post-September 11 investigation with one hand tied behind their backs.” Nosanchuk says Ashcroft’s stance “really underscores his allegiance to the agenda of the gun lobby.” The National Rifle Association’s position is that NICS “has serious flaws that must be corrected.”

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA and related pro-gun lobbyists contributed $48,900 to Ashcroft’s failed 2000 Senate re-election bid. Federal Election Commission filings indicate the NRA also spent $239,000 on independent TV and radio ads, billboards and bumper stickers supporting Ashcroft’s campaign. Later, the NRA Political Victory Fund spent more than $100,000 on an endorsement letter and $19,000 on bumper stickers at the time of Ashcroft’s Justice Department confirmation.

Law enforcement has increasingly found guns to be a critical source of evidence in its investigations of terrorists and other criminal groups. It was the suspects’ outdoor shooting activities that led to the October arrests of four alleged Al Qaeda trainees in Oregon and Michigan. As Ashcroft himself pointed out, members of the group “acquired various firearms and engaged in weapons training and physical training in preparation to fight a jihad.” Among the detainees swept up in the weeks after 9/11 were several members of Al-Fuqra, a domestic group suspected of at least seventeen firebombings and thirteen homicides in the United States. Three Al-Fuqra members were arrested and convicted of illegally buying assault rifles, pistols and AK-47 ammunition in rural Virginia. A prior weapons-violation warrant was used to detain last month’s Washington-area snipers until murder charges could be filed. (The Bushmaster rifle the snipers used is another modified weapon designed to avoid the Assault Weapons Ban.)

Even international criminals criticize America’s lax gun laws and say they inevitably lead to international trafficking. Conor Claxton, who was convicted of smuggling more than 100 guns from Florida to the Irish Republican Army in 1999, said the group did its shopping near Fort Lauderdale because “we don’t have gun shows in Ireland. You see things here like you never imagined.” Rafael Ceruelos, who has lived in Spain since serving time for his offenses, says, “The right to bear arms made sense 200 years ago but not now.” He adds, “As long as people can buy weapons in gun shops, there will be people from other countries who want to do business with them.”"

In a joint press conference with Mexico’s president Philippe Calderon, President Obama recently threw his support behind the Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and other Related Items, a long-stalled treaty often referred to by its Spanish acronym CIFTA.

“As President Calderon and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war,” said President Obama in Mexico City on the eve of the Summit of the Americas.

Thirty of the thirty-five members of the Organization of American States have ratified CIFTA since it was agreed upon in 1997. In an interview with Reuters Jonathan Winer, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who was the main negotiator of the treaty during the Clinton administration, said the treaty “is designed to help US law enforcement track abuses of firearms of criminals back to the last lawful sale so they can determine what went wrong. It is completely consistent with all US laws and does not ever impose a foreign law on a US person who has abided by US law.”

Although this treaty would do little to reform the domestic loopholes which allow countless guns onto our streets, CIFTA would at least signal to our allies in the OAS that we are serious about combating the drug violence that the US market both feeds and fuels.

Unfortunately, this small step towards tightening US gun control regulations is being stonewalled by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, in all likelihood because the National Rifle Association and other anti-gun control groups have lined up to oppose CIFTA, fearing that it could be a stepping-stone to more fundamental measures like Representative Bobby Rush’s comprehensive gun control bill. The tragedy is that CIFTA is so mild that even the NRA acknowledges that the bill “is not intended to restrict ‘lawful ownership and use’ of firearms,” but Reid needs real pushing for the legislation to succeed.

Most of the organizing around CIFTA to date has been staged by right-wing zealots unreasonably up in arms over this treaty. A Google search turns up scores of blog posts determined to raise alarms around the pending legislation with nary a progressive voice posting in favor of common sense and against unnecessary gun violence. But it’s time for those of us not in the thrall of the Second Amendment to offer vocal backing to this multilateral attempt to stop the flood of illegal weapons into Mexico and beyond.

1: THE BOMBINGS

The first bomb didn’t kill anyone. It was planted in the ground-floor parking lot beneath the Two Rivers Convention Center in downtown Grand Junction, Colorado—a dry, boom-and-bust mining town west of the Rockies where the snowcapped mountains give way to mesa and valley. In the morning the sun strikes gold on the sheer, striated walls of the sandstone cliffs that surround the Grand Valley, and in the evening the cliffs are ribboned with shifting periwinkle shadows. At 9 pm on Valentine’s Day, 1991, Dennis Lamb was leaving a vocational banquet for School District 51, crossing the Two Rivers parking lot, when an explosion blasted shrapnel into the back of his right calf. “I thought I’d been shot,” Lamb would recall. 1 Ad Policy

Three weeks later, on the morning of March 5, four members of the Gonzales family piled into the family van, parked outside their home in a neighborhood two miles northeast of downtown, to go to the mall. Twelve-year-old Maria Dolores Gonzales had stayed home from school with a headache, and her mother let her come along. When the van rolled forward, a bomb that had been hidden in the left rear wheel well exploded. Shrapnel rocketed through the vehicle’s carpeted floor and the plush back of Dolores’s seat, entering her back and instantly severing her aorta. When she failed to respond to her family’s panicked screams to get out of the van, they pulled her from the seat and blood pooled on the pavement. She died soon after.2

Three months later, Suzann and Henry Ruble had just finished dinner and were leaving the Feed Lot, a downtown restaurant just blocks from the Two Rivers Convention Center. “What is that thing over there?” Suzann asked, pointing to an object she thought looked like the pneumatic tubes drive-up banks used to have. “It looks kind of strange, don’t you think?” She drove over and Henry leaned out to pick it up. As he brought it up to his chest, Suzann recalled, “There was a big loud explosion. It lifted the truck and Henry dropped.” Ruble’s arms were blown off and his body mangled. He died instantly. Debris from this third and most powerful bomb was collected across the block.3

The next day, federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms descended on the town of roughly 30,000 to assist local investigators with what appeared to be a serial bomber. No one had taken credit, and the victims seemed chosen at random. The police were stymied, people were scared, and the pressure to find a culprit mounted. “We certainly don’t want to create hysteria or paranoia in the community,” a police lieutenant told the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel after warning people to check around their cars for bombs. “But we do want people to be aware that there is a person or persons out there with no regard for human life.”4

Investigators drew up a list of about 30 suspects, many of whom were known to local police to dabble in explosives—not an unusual hobby in a town of miners and ranchers. “People use dynamite. People work in the oil patch. People set bombs off for fun,” said Ellen Miller, a former correspondent for The Denver Post who covered the story. “I mean, seriously. People knew what pipe bombs were.” Then, in early July, police received a nervous call from a woman who worked at the Readmor bookstore on Main Street. A 28-year-old local man named Jimmy Genrich had asked them to order The Anarchist Cookbook, a manual that contains, among other things, instructions on how to make a pipe bomb. They refused to order the book and instead called the police, skyrocketing Genrich to the top of the list of suspects.5 Criminal Justice Prosecutors Keep Their Jobs by Putting People in Jail.

A covert detail was put on Genrich in mid-July, with two or more ATF agents following him around the clock. They sat in an unmarked car outside the boardinghouse where he lived alone on the top floor, sharing a bathroom with other residents, mostly single men; the house sat just over two blocks from the convention center. They followed him when he walked across the street, wending his way through a parking lot, down an alley, and into the back door of Suehiro’s, the Japanese restaurant on Main Street where he worked as a part-time dishwasher. They followed him when he left Suehiro’s at the end of his shift and walked to the Corral, a bar a few blocks away, where he drank hard and tried (and failed) to talk to girls. They followed him when he walked a few more blocks to the Cheers Lounge, where the girls danced for other men and wouldn’t talk to him. They followed him when he staggered back to his boardinghouse, drunk and angry, and they sat outside in the dark, all night, wakeful in case he should decide to go on one of his long nighttime walks. During the daylight hours, they saw his mother, a church organist named Sheila Greenlee, deliver his meals in a cooler.6 Jimmy Genrich, and thousands of others, have been imprisoned for decades because of untested “science.”

One morning in late July, local detective Bob Russell, a tall man with watchful blue eyes and military shoulders, showed up at the boardinghouse with two ATF agents. They wanted inside. Genrich cracked the door, got angry, and didn’t want to let them in. (Later he said Russell illegally put a foot in the door and wouldn’t allow him to close it, which Russell denied.) But he soon found himself sitting on his sagging brown couch talking to Russell, who stood over him while federal investigators looked through his belongings. Tucked under a radio on his dresser, they found a handwritten note scrawled on the back of an IRS envelope: “If I end up killing some stuck-up bitch don’t blame me. I’ve asked everybody I know for help, but no one listens…. I’ve tried making friends with these girls around here, but they just keep treating me like I’m not good enough to talk to. Valentine’s Day is coming and I still don’t have a sweetheart…. It’s been over a year now, and nobody has tried to help me yet. These girls still won’t even talk to me. Fuck you all. I’ll get even…. If I can’t be happy, I might as well kill one.”7 Current Issue View our current issue

They came back to the boardinghouse with a warrant and ransacked his room, as well as the home of his mother and his gentle, owl-eyed stepfather, Wallace Greenlee. They found no Anarchist Cookbook, no bomb-making instructions, and, despite thoroughly vacuuming carpets and furniture, no traces of gunpowder anywhere. All they came up with was a toolbox of electronics equipment, including some Buss-type stereo fuses like those in the bombs; a blue envelope with more handwritten notes in a similarly disturbing vein; and common household tools such as pliers and wire-strippers. They sent the tools to a forensic analyst in Maryland named John O’Neil. The hope was that if O’Neil could match marks made by Genrich’s tools to marks found on recovered bomb fragments, they would have the physical evidence they needed to arrest him. Meanwhile, federal agents started openly tailing Genrich everywhere he went, blue jackets with yellow ATF letters flapping like neon signage.8

By February 1992, nearly a year after the Valentine’s bomb, O’Neil said he had matched Genrich’s tools to all three bombs—plus an earlier, unexploded bomb from 1989, which had been found in the parking lot of the LaCourt Motor Lodge, right next door to the Two Rivers Convention Center. Investigators had used this bomb to figure out the other bombs’ unusual “signature” construction: a galvanized-steel pipe four to six inches long, covered at each end with distinctive “Coin”-brand metal caps, ignited by an internal motion-sensitive mercury switch that triggered a Buss-type fuse soldered to an Energizer Everlast battery. The district attorney, Steve ErkenBrack, convened the first grand jury that Grand Junction had seen in years, and Genrich was indicted on 10 counts, including multiple counts of first-degree murder. Grand Junction police chief Darold Sloan called it “the most comprehensive investigation in my 23 years in law enforcement.” All told, they spent more than $1 million. ErkenBrack is convinced they got the right guy. “The multiple bombings stopped,” he says, “as soon as we focused on Mr. Genrich and seized his tools.”9

During the trial, ErkenBrack and the trial judge, Nicholas Massaro, agreed that Genrich’s fate hung on the toolmarks, the only physical evidence that connected him to the bombs. In the early 1990s, few people challenged the foundations of forensic methods such as toolmark analysis. Since then, despite CSI-style portrayals of forensic analysts as crime-solving oracles, prominent scientists and criminal-justice experts have questioned many of the “pattern-matching” disciplines that rely on comparisons of bite marks, hairs, shoe prints, tire tracks, or fingerprints. These are different from, say, forensic DNA analysis, which relies on scientific principles like the known variations in the human genome. In contrast, pattern-matching examiners exercise an enormous amount of subjective judgment in determining what constitutes a match. In 2009 and 2016, major reports from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) blasted pattern-matching disciplines as barely science at all. Nonetheless, most of these forensic techniques are as widespread today as they were when Genrich was convicted.10

Calculating how many people might be incarcerated based on erroneous “matches” is notoriously difficult, but according to the Innocence Project, faulty forensic science was a factor in about half of all wrongful convictions in which the defendants were later exonerated by DNA testing. According to the National Registry of Exonerations, which looked at a larger set of cases that also included non-DNA exonerations and judged the factors differently, faulty forensics was a factor in 24 percent of wrongful convictions. One recent academic study, using its own methodology, found that faulty forensics was a factor in 34 percent of the wrongful convictions they examined. Many prosecutors and judges, however, insist there is no problem and that wrongful convictions are vanishingly rare. In 2007, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia cited a prosecutor claiming courts convict with an “error rate of 0.027 percent—or a success rate of 99.973 percent.” The prosecutor had divided the number of known exonerations over a 15-year period (a few hundred) by the total number of felony convictions in that period (15 million). It is wildly unlikely, however, that all wrongful convictions have been discovered. One academic study estimates that in capital cases—which receive far more post-conviction scrutiny than do other cases—one in 25 people set to be executed will have been wrongfully convicted. However you crunch the numbers, they are appallingly high, and could mean that thousands of people are behind bars partly because juries were swayed by unproven ”science.”11

Today, Genrich is 55 years old and has been in prison for nearly 25 years for crimes he says he didn’t commit. His latest appeal has been taken up by the Innocence Project, in the hopes of not only freeing Genrich, but getting the courts to recognize recent scientific challenges to forensic pattern-matching techniques that affect hundreds of thousands of people at all levels of the criminal-justice system. In our investigation, we comprehensively reviewed the literature on handheld toolmarks published in forensic trade journals, dug through past legal rulings, pored over nearly 7,000 pages of trial transcripts, and conducted dozens of interviews with prosecutors, defense attorneys, forensic practitioners, judges, academics, and scientists, from Grand Junction to the Department of Justice. What we found was a startling lack of scientific support for forensic pattern-matching techniques such as toolmark analysis; a legal system that has failed to separate nonsense from science even in capital cases; and a consensus among prosecutors all the way up to the attorney general’s office that scientifically dubious forensic techniques should be not only protected, but expanded. With Donald Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions at the helm of the DOJ, the nominal momentum for forensic-science reform spurred by the two major reports is slowing. Genrich’s case reveals a system that makes it nearly impossible to throw unproven forensic science out of courts and may be keeping thousands of innocent people behind bars.12

2: THE ORIGIN OF FORENSICS

On a bitterly cold Valentine’s Day in 1929, four men hired by Al Capone entered an unheated garage on Chicago’s North Side and ordered the seven men inside to line up against a brick wall. Two men in suits and two men dressed as police officers carrying Tommy guns unleashed a barrage of bullets into henchmen of the infamous Chicago mobster George “Bugs” Moran. The police were stymied until they raided Fred “Killer” Burke’s house and found guns they suspected might have been used in the massacre. Burke wouldn’t confess, and the guns were the best evidence linking him to the crime, so they sent the weapons to Calvin Goddard, a former physician and pioneer in the new field of “forensic ballistics” at one of the nation’s first crime laboratories. (His new method of matching bullet casings to guns had played a role in the controversial 1927 execution of Italian-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti.) Goddard fired “test” bullets from Burke’s guns and, using a “split-image” comparison microscope he had helped invent for the purpose, matched grooved marks left on the test bullets and casings to those on bullets and casings found at the crime scene.13

Goddard’s forensic ballistics is now known as “firearm and toolmark analysis,” and the field has since grown to include hundreds of examiners in crime labs nationwide. While making matches with household tools is less common, convictions have been secured in part based on marks left by knives, bolt cutters, bayonets, scissors, screwdrivers, pipe wrenches, or—as in Genrich’s case—pliers and wire-strippers. These marks are often harder to parse than those on bullets, because while all bullets fired from a gun follow the same path down the same metal barrel, toolmarks depend on multiple variable factors such as the angle and pressure with which a tool is applied to a surface, which may be hard or soft, spongy or brittle.14 “We don’t want to create hysteria but there is a person out there with no regard for human life.” — Grand Junction police lieutenant to the local newspaper

Firearm and toolmark analysis emerged out of a national push in the early 20th century to professionalize police investigative techniques at a moment when Americans were particularly enamored with science. Law enforcement borrowed terms from science, establishing crime “laboratories” staffed by forensic “scientists” who announced “theories” cloaked in their own specialized jargon. But forensic “science” focused on inventing clever ways to solve cases and win convictions; it was never about forming theories and testing them according to basic scientific standards. By adopting the trappings of science, the forensic disciplines co-opted its authority while abandoning its methods.15

Amid the swirl of new forensic techniques, the courts realized there had to be a gatekeeping mechanism to filter out quackery. In 1923, the DC Court of Appeals provided that mechanism in Frye v. United States. The judges rejected a doctor’s dubious claim that he could use a polygraph to detect when a person was lying from a rise in their blood pressure. In the ruling, the court said that in order for scientific evidence or expert testimony to be admitted, it must be offered by an experienced practitioner making inferences from a “well-recognized scientific principle” that has “general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.” In Frye, the judges deemed the scientists in the “particular field” relevant to polygraph use to include psychologists and physiologists—not just polygraph practitioners who would, presumably, be biased toward preserving the technique’s reputation. The effectiveness of Frye in keeping dubious science out of the courts depends on whom judges include in their definition of the “relevant scientific community.” But as the decades wore on, and the forensic disciplines gained influence, judges tended to restrict their definition of the “relevant scientific community” to the forensic examiners themselves. Judges began taking advice on what counted as good forensics from the very people who invented the techniques and made a living off of them.16

In the American criminal-justice system, where prosecutors regularly battle defense attorneys over what constitutes valid evidence, judges’ rulings on admissibility are the final word. Once a technique has made it into court and survived appeals, subsequent judges, most of whom have no scientific training and little ability to assess the scientific validity of a technique, will continue to allow it by citing precedent. Forensic examiners, in turn, cite precedent in order to claim that their techniques are reliable science. Prosecutors point to guilty verdicts as evidence that the science brought to court was sound. In this circular way, legal rulings—which never really vetted the science to begin with—substitute for scientific proof. This is Frye’s fatal flaw: Nowhere in this process is anyone required to provide empirical evidence that the techniques work as advertised. Frye aimed to keep pseudoscience out of the courts, but instead has helped create the perfect conditions to keep it in.17

3: THE TOOLMARK ANALYST

By the time Genrich went on trial, the high-profile case had so saturated the local news that it was moved to the town of Greeley, on the other side of the Rockies. Inside an imposing courtroom with walls built of rare Colorado white marble—the same white marble used for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the Lincoln Memorial—Genrich sat at the defense table waiting for a break in the day’s proceedings, when he would be allowed to play on the Game Boy that his public defender Roberta “Bert” Nieslanik brought him every day in her purse. He sat quietly next to co-counsel Greg Greer, who would occasionally reach out and place a hand gently on his arm. It was not clear to observers if Greer was comforting his client or subtly managing potential outbursts.18

Ten days into the grueling five-week trial, ATF toolmark examiner John O’Neil took the stand. When tools are manufactured, he explained to the jurors ensconced in the marble jury box, processes such as grinding and milling create unique microscopic traits that can be used to distinguish even mass-produced tools. “Microscopically,” O’Neil said, “we move from scratches to ridges and valleys. It becomes topography.”19

In the ATF lab outside Washington, DC, O’Neil had taken Genrich’s pliers and carefully scraped their open jaws across sheets of lead, copper, and aluminum to simulate the striated marks left behind when tightening a metal end cap. He had snipped pieces of copper wire similar to wires found in the debris swept up after the bombings. He then darkened the room and placed the samples side by side on his comparison microscope, overlaying the marks from his test cuts with the marks found on the debris. He would tilt the light source to the side, he said, to illuminate the “ridges and valleys,” to “follow the flow of that shadow line in and out of the striae.”20

In a dramatic video presentation—one of the first of its kind in the nation—he showed the jury exactly how he made his matches. The video started with a still frame: a split screen of the ends of two pieces of wire. On the right was the wire O’Neil had cut using Genrich’s red-handled needle-nose pliers. On the left was a scrap of insulated wire from the unexploded 1989 bomb found outside the LaCourt motel. Then the camera began to zoom in. “At 20 times its normal size,” O’Neil said, “you’re beginning to see some features of the topography…it has contours.” As it zoomed to 40, then to 80, he explained that he had to remove the light’s filter and bring its angle down “to see the shadows.” He pointed to two lines about a quarter of the way from the top of the screen that ran parallel to the cut. “And you simply find two lines similar to that in size and shape and follow them through and see if the rest of what you have falls in place.” He testified that this alignment was so improbable that Genrich’s tool must have cut the wire in the bomb, “to the exclusion of any other tool” in the world. He then proceeded to match Genrich’s wire-strippers to a wire found at the Valentine’s Day bomb site, and matched his yellow-handled slip-joint pliers to scratches on the distinctive “Coin”-brand end-cap fragments that had been found at the scene of the Feed Lot bombing and that had sliced through the aorta of Dolores Gonzales.21 “The bombings stopped as soon as we focused on Genrich.” — District Attorney Steve ErkenBrack

When Nieslanik first saw this evidence, she was concerned. “I thought it was going to be a science,” she says. Barely five feet tall, with a pixie cut and turquoise cowboy boots, she talks fast and rarely sits still. She is a tiny woman who takes up space. In preparation for trial, Nieslanik scoured the professional journals published by forensic practitioners to try and understand the technique. Nieslanik had majored in chemistry in college before switching to women’s studies, and she had worked as the chemistry and physics laboratory coordinator at Mesa College before going to law school, so she was familiar with basic scientific concepts such as experimental design and statistics. She understood that just because Genrich’s tool had made a particular mark, that did not prove it was the only tool that could make that mark. The wire-strippers and pliers in Genrich’s toolbox were incredibly common—Nieslanik said she owned a pair. So how could the examiner know that the marks were unique to this set of wire-strippers or that set of pliers?22

To her surprise, Nieslanik could find no scientific studies to back up the claims O’Neil was making. There was no standardized protocol to be followed. There were no criteria for how many points of similarity constituted a unique match. It seemed to be just O’Neil’s subjective judgment. Then Nieslanik discovered that O’Neil had not submitted most of his test cuts into evidence. (The judge, infuriated upon learning this, held O’Neil in contempt of court.) O’Neil had decided over 50 cuts “were of little or no value” because they didn’t match. “I thought, ‘They just cut and cut and cut until they get one that matches,’” Nieslanik says. She recalls turning to her co-counsel and saying, “Holy shit, this is not science. It’s just not science. It’s like voodoo.”23

Even though she was convinced the field was “voodoo,” Nieslanik followed legal protocol and requested an independent review of O’Neil’s work. “It’s a science that’s questionable,” she explains, “but you have to hire somebody that believes in it to advise you about it.” A team of two other toolmark examiners came to look over O’Neil’s work. By the time they arrived, he had already set up the evidence for them, marking his matches with blue dots, a practice that could bias any examiner’s analysis. But the other examiners only agreed with O’Neil’s match to the Valentine’s Day bomb. All the other marks, they said, were inconclusive.24

These conflicting results reinforced Nieslanik’s intuition that the technique was unreliable, so she decided on a risky tactic: not just to challenge O’Neil, but to question the premise of his entire field, one that had been accepted into court since the turn of the 20th century. She called up Don Searls, a math professor at the local university who was unfamiliar with toolmark analysis. Nieslanik sent him the few papers she could find describing the field. Searls, who consulted for aerospace and pharmaceutical companies on experimental design, including for a NASA Apollo mission, was shocked. He testified that the field of toolmark analysis “does not have a scientific basis” and could not provide “credible evidence.” He laid out how he would design a proper test, pointing out that several truly independent examiners—not ones who had blue dots arranged for them in advance—should test several tools of similar wear and tear, ideally without knowing which ones were the suspect’s.25

The prosecutor, ErkenBrack, countered with an analogy. “If I have a babysitter,” he said, “and I come home and somebody has been in the fudge and there’s a little tiny handprint on the plate, are you telling me that in order to be statistically valid, I need to get in four other three-year-olds to compare that handprint?” But ErkenBrack’s commonsense analogy is flawed in a way that gets at the heart of the issue. He would only have to distinguish between the 3-year-old’s hands and the babysitter’s hands. The problem for forensic pattern-matchers is much more difficult. Imagine trying to figure out which 3-year-old stole a cookie from a picnic table in a New York City park, where any toddler could have wandered by. O’Neil had to conclude that Genrich’s tools were the only ones in the world that could have made the marks.26

Claims like “to the exclusion of any other tool” need to be supported by scientific studies that answer two crucial questions. First, do tools leave unique marks? If this is true in principle, you’d need to test if the technique works in practice: How reliably can human examiners distinguish toolmarks under conditions that resemble casework? In other words, how often do they make errors?27

No human endeavor is perfect, yet many forensic examiners claim “zero” or near-zero error rates. In a widely cited 1984 paper in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, bite-mark examiners claimed a coincidental match would occur less than one in 10 quadrillion times. But when actually tested, even the most experienced examiners were wrong about one in six times, and in one study they struggled to distinguish a child’s bite mark from an adult’s. In 2009, the chief of the FBI Firearms-Toolmarks Unit wrote that a qualified examiner will “rarely if ever commit a false positive error (misidentification).” In practice, error rates for matching bullets to firearms can be dramatically higher: In 2008, the Detroit Police Department’s crime lab was shuttered when auditors found that its examiners made one error in every 10 cases. The head of the FBI’s fingerprint laboratory testified that its error rate was one in 11 million—because he knew of only one error in the FBI’s 11 million comparisons—but subsequent tests of fingerprint examiners show error rates ranging from one in 680 to one in 24.28 By adopting the trappings of science, the forensic disciplines co-opted science’s authority while abandoning its methods.

These overblown and largely imaginary numbers—and forensic testimony offered with the certainty O’Neil claimed—are dangerous, because they give a false sense of scientific precision to juries and contribute to wrongful convictions. When examiners testify that they can make a match “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty,” they are making what sounds like a statistical statement. Dr. Searls’s point was that they hadn’t done the studies required to back up such a statement, so there was no way for O’Neil to support his claims—the “match” was simply what he subjectively judged to be true. O’Neil, who is now retired and spends his time making rosaries, stands by his testimony as well as his decision to throw out the test cuts that didn’t match. “If I didn’t believe that I had found something, then I wouldn’t have testified to it.”29

But abstract arguments, while convincing to statisticians like Dr. Searls, do not have the same effect on juries as a video where they can see lines matching up. As deliberations started in the Genrich case, the jury was split 50/50 on the question of his guilt. They asked to see O’Neil’s video several times while deliberating. After an agonizing four days, they delivered the guilty verdict. “They all matched. It was a perfect match,” juror David Trujillo later told the local paper.30

4: “A FORENSIC COMMUNITY IN DISARRAY”

Over the past century, thanks to the 1923 Frye ruling putting judges in charge of evaluating science, dubious forensic techniques have proved devilishly difficult to expel from the courts. Consider bite-mark matching, which arose out of a single case in 1974, when Walter Edgar Marx was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Investigators had exhumed the body of the victim six weeks after she’d been buried, and three dentists matched a series of lacerations around her nose to a plaster cast of Marx’s bite. An appeals court acknowledged that there weren’t any scientific studies validating the technique, or showing that bite-mark examiners could reliably match a bite mark left on skin to a person’s teeth, but found the three dentists to have credible expertise matching dental remains from deceased people to patients’ dental records. The court inferred that looking at bite marks left in a cadaver’s skin was sufficiently similar. The judges seemed impressed by the methods, which included X-rays and 3-D models. In a final rebuke to science, the court ruled that not to allow the evidence would be to “sacrifice…common sense.” This case established the precedent for almost all subsequent rulings on bite-mark evidence, including the 1983 case of a Wisconsin man named Robert Lee Stinson, who was convicted in the rape and murder of a 63-year-old woman almost entirely on bite-mark evidence. Using a photograph of the victim’s body and a plaster cast of Stinson’s teeth, dentists testified that the marks matched “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.” The appeals court was convinced by the analysis: “the lateral incisor in the upper jaw was set back from the other teeth; all of the upper front teeth were flared; the lower right lateral incisor was worn to a pointed edge; the right incisor was set out from the other teeth on the lower jaw.” The dentists even compared Stinson’s bite to his twin brother’s. The judges concluded that the “bite-mark evidence in this case was sufficient to exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis of innocence,” upholding Stinson’s conviction.31

Twenty-three years later, DNA evidence exonerated Stinson. The 3-D models, the detailed descriptions of his incisors, the “moral certainty” of his guilt—everyone had been convinced. And everyone had been wrong. The scientific tide has since turned. Dentists have recanted their testimony and disavowed the method. The Texas Commission on Forensic Science called for a “moratorium” on bite-mark evidence. A study conducted by the president-elect of the American Board of Forensic Odontology revealed that 96 percent of the time, bite-mark examiners couldn’t unanimously agree on whether a bite mark came from a human, and the organization advised its members not to make identifications based on bite marks alone. And yet Stinson’s case still stands as precedent in Wisconsin courts, meaning other judges can cite it to admit bite-mark evidence. Its use is in decline, but there has never been a single ruling to exclude it.32

Shockingly, the Supreme Court didn’t weigh in on the admissibility of forensic evidence until 70 years after Frye, in 1993—about two months after Genrich was found guilty. The high court’s ruling mandated that judges allow only scientific evidence supported by testable claims, and that proponents of the evidence must be able to provide measures of how often examiners make mistakes. What’s now known as the Daubert standard is federal law and has been adopted by most states, but it has had little effect in criminal law because most judges still rely on precedent, assuming evidence was vetted in past cases. “Judges,” said Harry T. Edwards, chief judge for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, at a Harvard event last October, “believe that because we said it before, it must be right, and because these practitioners have been around for a long time, it must be right. In other words, history is the proof.” When it comes to booting flawed science out of criminal courts, “Daubert,” said Judge Edwards, “has largely been a failure.”33

In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences performed the most sweeping independent survey of the state of forensic science to date. It was a bombshell. “Much forensic evidence—including, for example, bitemarks and firearm and toolmark identifications—is introduced in criminal trials without any meaningful scientific validation, determination of error rates, or reliability testing to explain the limits of the discipline,” the report noted. Forensic examiners in pattern-matching disciplines, it concluded, had no scientific basis for making claims of certainty in court. Professional societies gave no guidelines for testimony. Labs had no standard accreditation or certification procedures. There had been little research on variability, reliability, or human bias. Judge Edwards, who co-chaired one of the report’s subcommittees, said at Harvard, “We found a forensic community in disarray.”34

While some in the forensic community dismissed the report, others embraced its recommendations, and for several years, a spirit of reform was in the air. The overall feeling was that more research was needed. “In forensic science,” says John Murdock, a preeminent former ATF firearm and toolmark examiner, “the research has been done by practitioners.” When we reached him by phone, Murdock was clearing his weekend schedule to participate in a large-scale study sent out by the FBI that required matching sets of fired bullets. He had also paid, out of pocket, to receive samples for a high-quality examiner proficiency test being conducted in the Netherlands using polymer replicas of bullets. He says this test is much more difficult than the relatively easy matching exams usually given by private companies. While these efforts are laudable, placing responsibility in the hands of working practitioners such as Murdock is not a feasible research strategy. Forensics lacks the infrastructure and the funding to support research. “It’s hard to create a research culture when you can’t afford research,” said Victor Weedn, a professor of forensic sciences at George Washington University and past president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. Many argue that the research shouldn’t be done by forensics examiners at all, but by academic scientists, who have university infrastructure and funding and can independently evaluate examiners’ claims.35 “Microscopically, we move from scratches to ridges and valleys. It becomes topography.” — toolmark examiner John O’Neil, testifying before Genrich’s jury in 1991

In 2013, the Department of Justice under President Obama established the National Commission on Forensic Science, an interdisciplinary advisory committee including forensic practitioners as well as prominent scientists and attorneys, as a way of “passing the torch in forensic reform from the National Academy of Sciences.” The commission met quarterly and made nonbinding recommendations to the DOJ, some of which were adopted, including a new code of professional conduct for laboratories and the recommendation to drop the phrase “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty” from examiner testimony—a dangerously misleading statement in the absence of empirical data. Grant funding for research was increased, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology established working groups for each forensic discipline to set standards for the field.36

Then, in 2016, Obama’s scientific advisory council, PCAST, comprising prominent scientists and experts in academia and industry, issued a follow-up report. The years of nominal reform had apparently had little substantive effect on getting unproven “science” out of the courts. “It has become increasingly clear in recent years that lack of rigor in the assessment of the scientific validity of forensic evidence is not just a hypothetical problem but a real and significant weakness in the judicial system,” the report concluded. One of PCAST’s most contentious conclusions was the lack of support for firearm and toolmark analysis. The council found a number of studies that “sought to estimate the accuracy of examiners’ conclusions” but said only one study that included 218 examiners was “appropriately-designed” according to basic scientific standards. Despite examiners’ claims of near-infallibility, that study found a false-match rate of one in 100. A vast body of research of widely varying quality suggests that matching bullets to guns may have a scientific basis, though examiners are nowhere near infallible. For a widespread technique like firearm analysis, the lack of empirical data for error rates was shocking.37

Because PCAST did not directly assess the skill of examiners who match marks from handheld tools like wire-strippers and pliers, we conducted our own review of the field and consulted with several leading toolmark examiners. We found a wealth of literature on the uniqueness of marks and the manufacturing process; a growing literature on quantifying the variability of striations; and results of examiner-proficiency tests. However, we found only a single study, from 2009, that tested toolmark examiners’ abilities in a controlled setting. The FBI tested eight of its own examiners analyzing marks left by screwdrivers. Promisingly, these eight examiners made no errors. But one small study, in which the researchers have a vested interest in the outcome, on one type of tool, is hardly a validation of the field, leaving the crucial question of error rates unanswered. Because firearms are a specialized type of tool, examiners point to firearms studies to support their work with handheld tools, but what seem like logical inferences don’t always hold up: Forensic dentists wrongly thought they could match bite marks because they could identify people from dental remains. Without empirical research, it’s difficult to say if handheld toolmark matching is more like firearms (i.e., needs more research) or more like bite marks (i.e., needs to be abandoned). Regardless, it’s wildly unlikely that examiners can make matches “to the exclusion of all other tools.”38

Rather than spurring a constructive debate about reform, PCAST dramatically widened a growing divide between mainstream academia and the forensic community. As defense attorneys reached for the reports to challenge forensic evidence in court, prosecutors rushed to defend one of their most powerful tools. Battle lines were drawn: Forensic examiners, law enforcement, and prosecutors gathered on one side, defense attorneys and mainstream scientists on the other. It was a perfect political storm.39

5: JIMMY GENRICH’S PAST

Sheila Greenlee wears a bright floral housedress at the dining-room table, smoothing her flyaway gray bob when she needs to gather her thoughts. She is prone to brief fits of giggling when her memory alights on places too painful to stay for long. A grand piano takes up most of the living room in the split-level home she shares with her husband, Wallace, the choir director at the Methodist church where she played the organ for so many years. Their modest house sits at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac on the southwest edge of town, just shy of the sheer-walled canyons of the Colorado National Monument. Sheila describes her son Jimmy as a shy young man who liked books and Nintendo video games. She also says he grew up poor and was abused as a child by his father, a violent drunk. Genrich had two brothers and one sister until his little brother Teddy had a swimming accident one Fourth of July. Genrich was 18 years old, and he was devastated by Teddy’s death.40

James Martinez, a childhood friend who grew up across the street and now owns a motorcycle- and car-repair shop, remembers Genrich as a nerdy kid who rarely spoke unless spoken to. “We were all scared of his father,” says Martinez. “I remember we’d be in his room, listening to AC/DC, and we’d all go out the window when his dad came home. Jimmy would protect his little brother, and get his ass kicked for it.”41

It seemed to Sheila, for a time, that her awkward son might be all right. After high school, Genrich moved to Phoenix to attend DeVry University, where he studied electronics (a fact made much of during the trial). When Martinez moved to Phoenix to work in a custom-hot-rod shop, Genrich was already there. “He had good grades. He was doing well. Where he fell into trouble might have been my fault.” Martinez shakes his head regretfully. “My best friends were all longhairs and bikers in bands.” He introduced the bikers to Genrich, who moved into a spare room in their rowdy house. “People thought he was weird,” says Martinez. “As he got older, he was still the nerd, but he turned into a man. He would say, ‘No woman will ever want me—I’m the ugliest guy in the room.’” His grades at DeVry plummeted and he struggled with a required English class, then eventually dropped out. He was drinking heavily and, Martinez says, picked up a meth habit from his biker housemates.42 “Holy shit, this is not science. It’s like voodoo.” — Genrich’s lawyer Roberta “Bert” Nieslanik on John O’Neil’s toolmark analysis

When investigators later questioned Martinez, he insisted he never saw Genrich making bombs. “I would have known,” he says. “He was living in my house. Jimmy was my friend, but he wasn’t that good of a friend where I would lie for him.”43

Genrich moved back to Grand Junction in July of 1989 and struggled to pull a life together. He worked various jobs, including a stint as a dishwasher at the Two Rivers Convention Center—a boss later described him as “the sole problem employee.” His boss at Suehiro’s, where he was also a dishwasher, told the Daily Sentinel he had a temper. “He would yell at me and leave. Then come back a few days later and say he’s sorry. I always gave him his job back because he’s a good person,” his boss said. “He’s very honest.”44

Genrich desperately wanted a girlfriend but was consumed by frustrations that girls wouldn’t “give him the time of day.” Sheila says he struggled with loneliness. “He craved it, and yet he didn’t want to be alone,” she says. “He used to say to me, ‘Mom, you have to help me find a girlfriend.’” Sheila and Wallace agree that he was increasingly “moody,” and he began to get into trouble for angry outbursts. They took him along on a car trip to Canada, to visit Sheila’s family, and he “threw rocks at cars because the people weren’t friendly.” Back in Grand Junction, Genrich was arrested for breaking the glass of an Albertsons exit door after he claimed employees snubbed him.45

On February 10, 1990, Sheila took her son to St. Mary’s hospital for an involuntary, 72-hour psychiatric evaluation. He had attempted suicide once before, as a teenager, when he swallowed a bottle of aspirin after a girl had rejected him. In an affidavit, later quoted by investigators in a search warrant, Sheila stated that her son “appears to be mentally ill and, as a result of such illness, appears to be a danger to himself or others.”46

There were more outbursts. In 1991, he furiously knocked books from shelves at the library after the librarians, he said, wouldn’t help him. At the Readmor bookstore, where his request for The Anarchist Cookbook made him the lead suspect, Genrich knocked books from shelves and spit on the windows. When asked why her son would want to order that book, Sheila sighs. “Knowing Jimmy, they were probably giving him a hard time.” Genrich later told an ATF agent he had tried to order it to “piss the lady off at the bookstore.”47

After the ATF started trailing him, Genrich met his future lawyer Bert Nieslanik by climbing the steps to the public defender’s office to ask if the agents were allowed to follow him. He complained about them to Nieslanik, to his mother, and to the agents themselves. He took to talking with the agents, sometimes getting into their car for an hour or more to vent his frustrations about his life and ask when they were going to start looking for the real bomber. One night, according to an ATF agent, Genrich came out of his boardinghouse and got into the car with a handful of photographs. “He had brought me pictures of some bookshelves…we were talking about the tools, and he was telling me about this woodworking project that he had…he asked if I wanted to come in and take a look at these pictures, and I declined that night, but he brought the pictures out. He showed me the pictures of bookshelves that he had made for his mom and, also, a postcard of Crazy Horse Monument, up in South Dakota, I believe.”48

Nieslanik says the attention from the ATF agents was a double-edged sword. Genrich had no one else to talk to, but having the feds follow him around made him a target for the town’s fears about the bombings—television-news cameras sometimes followed in the agents’ wake. One night, a man in the Corral attacked Genrich, bringing him to his knees. He was hurt and confused that the agents, who were there, did nothing to protect him. In July, ATF agent Larry Kresl took Genrich to lunch, then said he’d take him to the Job Services Center and help him find a job. Instead, Kresl took him to a room hung with grisly pictures of the victims’ bodies, and tried to elicit a confession. Genrich did not confess.49 “They all matched. It was a perfect match.” — David Trujillo, member of the jury that convicted Genrich, on the pattern-matching forensics

Four days later, agents followed him to Teddy’s grave and suggested Genrich commit suicide “so we can all go home.” After hearing of the agents’ behavior at trial, Judge Massaro said that “more repulsive governmental conduct, absent the infliction of actual harm, is difficult to imagine.”50

In August, a federal agent named Bill Frangis came to Sheila and Wallace’s home and told them the case against Genrich was “overwhelming.” Sheila agitatedly clasps and unclasps her hands on the dining-room table as she remembers. “If the locals got him,” she recalls Frangis telling her, “he would be put to death. But if the feds looked after him, he’d try to save him.” Sheila glances at Wallace, who regards her calmly. “He was charming,” she continues. “I made him tea. He acted like he was going to help us.” Frangis asked Sheila to wear a wire and try to get her son to confess. “I was stunned,” she says, “because I knew that he didn’t do it.” Once she heard about the death penalty, Sheila says, “I was terrified,” but she couldn’t bring herself to wear the wire. Wallace, sensing her agony, stepped in and offered to wear it. “It was just like, his life was in danger,” Wallace recalls in a soft voice. A few weeks later, the feds came back and taped a wire to Wallace’s chest. In a tearful conversation in the living room, while ATF agents sat outside in their car listening in, Sheila and Wallace told Genrich that they loved him, that they would love him no matter what, and that he just needed to tell them if he did it. Sheila says she was trying to save his life. “He looked at me and said, ‘Mom, do you believe I did that?’” Genrich did not confess.51

Before all this, Sheila says, “I believed in [law enforcement] wholeheartedly. I believed in them, A-one. Boy, has that changed. And I don’t say they’re all bad, by any means. But I can understand how they can twist things.”52

Martinez understands that Genrich comes off as “weird.” But, he insists, “He didn’t have a violent bone in his body. He never hurt anybody. He was the one getting hurt.” Martinez shakes his head. “He was like that puppy who’d been beat, and you look at him and their tail goes between their legs, and they’re hunched over. That was Jimmy. Intimidated, you know?” He is particularly skeptical they got the right guy because on April 14, 1989, when the unexploded bomb was found outside the LaCourt motel, Genrich had an ironclad alibi.53

6: REASONABLE DOUBT

One of the remarkable things about the Genrich case is that other than the toolmarks, it was built almost entirely on circumstantial evidence. There was no confession, no reliable eyewitness, no gunpowder, no DNA. Just an isolated, angry young man with a history of mental illness who made women uncomfortable and once asked about The Anarchist Cookbook, who lived in a messy 12-by-12 room with a toolbox and a pile of disturbing handwritten notes. If you believed this was the type of person to carry out a bombing, then the toolmark evidence confirmed what you already suspected to be true.54

But if you trusted the toolmarks, then you’d struggle to explain how O’Neil matched Genrich’s needle-nose pliers to a bomb he couldn’t have planted. On April 14, 1989, the day the unexploded bomb was discovered in the LaCourt motel parking lot, Genrich was 580 miles away, in Phoenix. Registers from Houle’s bookstore showed his handwritten entries recording stock being returned to publishers on the day the bomb was found. The store owner testified that Genrich had worked every day that week, including a six-and-a-half-hour shift on the day the bomb was found. Investigators scoured plane records and car-rental registries but could find no evidence he had left Arizona. The prosecution suggested the circular theory that Genrich could have had an accomplice who planted that bomb, because he couldn’t have set the bomb himself. There was, however, no evidence that pointed to an accomplice. It stretches the imagination to believe Genrich was the 1989 bomber and also to believe O’Neil’s toolmark analysis to be reliable.55

Laying out the evidence in the Genrich case in Polaroid shots provided to The Nation.

One of the key pieces of circumstantial evidence that convinced both the investigators and the jury was the unsettling handwritten notes. In his opening statement, ErkenBrack said, “Mr. Genrich was a very, very angry man, especially with women, but angry at everyone. You will hear Mr. Genrich said time and time again that he had a problem with women.” In the search-warrant affidavit, investigator Bob Russell writes that the Feed Lot bomb was placed near a car’s front right tire, and “this would be the side most ordinarily used by the female.” This logic falls apart a bit, however, when you consider that the Gonzales bomb was placed by a rear tire and the LaCourt motel bomb by the driver’s side. Judge Massaro noted that the bombs did not seem to have been placed in areas obviously frequented by women.56 “Judges believe that because we said it before, it must be right. History is the proof.” —Harry T. Edwards, chief judge for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals

And while the handwritten notes are undoubtedly disturbing, if looked at in a slightly different light, they don’t obviously point to a serial bomber. After Sheila had her son briefly committed, Genrich started seeing a therapist who encouraged him to write down his feelings instead of, as he told The Denver Post, “losing my temper.” According to Genrich, these were the notes the ATF agents found when they searched his home. “I don’t hate women, I really don’t…. I’d get drunk and pissed off, so I’d write it down instead of going out and getting into trouble,” he told the Post. The closest Genrich ever came to a confession was telling the ATF agents, “I’m not a bomber, but I should be a rapist.”57

When Nieslanik first met Genrich, she says, he “looked homeless, unkempt, agitated.” He had trouble making eye contact and seemed paranoid, but she says he wasn’t a bomber. “Cra-zy,” she singsongs, “but innocent.”58

Taken together, the circumstantial evidence against Genrich was ambiguous at best. He could have constructed the electrical circuit, but so could many other people in Grand Junction. He had Buss-type fuses in his toolbox, but no trace of gunpowder was ever found. The letters clearly threatened violence toward women, but the bombs seemed to target random strangers. He lived close to two of the bomb sites, and he was known to take long, meandering walks around town, but it would require steely nerve and a steady gait to carry a bomb with a hair-trigger switch two miles to the Gonzales home. Genrich asked for The Anarchist Cookbook after the bombings had already started. And if you read the book, you’d notice it does not include directions or a diagram that “describes precisely how you make the bombs that were used in this case,” as ErkenBrack claimed in court. Then there’s that ironclad alibi for the LaCourt motel bomb.59

So you’re left with toolmarks. The only match that all examiners agreed on was between a pair of Genrich’s red-handled wire-strippers and scratches left on a piece of baling wire found near the Valentine’s Day bomb. Baling wire, a farm fix-all as common as duct tape in Grand Junction, was not the type of wire included in the “signature bomb,” nor is it particularly well suited for a bomb circuit. In most cases that go to trial, there are multiple converging lines of evidence, but not in the case of Jimmy Genrich. If you believe O’Neil can trace shadow lines across a toolmark’s microscopic ridges and valleys until it all “falls in place,” then Genrich is guilty. But if you believe O’Neil had only to tilt the light just right to bring into view what he was seeking to find, then an innocent man may be in prison.60

7: PROSECUTORS AND NATIONAL REFORM

The 2009 NAS report that upended the nation’s confidence in long-trusted forensic techniques had an unlikely instigator: Jeff Sessions. In 2000, Sessions proposed a bill to increase funding for crime laboratories struggling with backlogs; the bill passed, but most of the money never materialized. Leaders in the forensics community lobbied until the Senate finally included $1.5 million in a 2005 appropriations bill to fund an NAS report “identifying the needs of the forensics community.” It was meant to provide the “basis for legislation” that a senator like Sessions could introduce again to secure more crime-lab funding.61

“He’s a former prosecutor,” says Erin Murphy, a professor of law at NYU and author of Inside the Cell: The Dark Side of Forensic DNA. “He was really interested in helping law enforcement basically use more forensics. He thought he was going to commission a study where they’d come back and say, ‘Well, we need 6,000 more bite-mark examiners and 400 more toolmark examiners.’ Instead, of course, they got the study they got, which basically said half of these sciences are garbage, the other half may have some basis but need more empirical work, there’s rampant overclaiming, there’s rampant bias. It was really a full-throated list of all of the problems in forensics.”62

Sessions rejected the study’s conclusions. “I don’t think we should suggest that those proven scientific principles that we’ve been using for decades are somehow uncertain,” he said in a Senate hearing after the report’s release.63 Attention from federal agents was a doubled-edged sword. Genrich had no one else to talk to, but being followed made him a target.

Prosecutors have a vested interest in resisting reform, because it could weaken one of their most powerful tools, threaten cases currently under way, and call past convictions into question. For years, the DOJ was aware that its hair-comparison examiners made mistakes, but the department did little to address the problem until a whistle-blower came forward in the early 1990s. During an eight-year review of 2,900 cases, the DOJ found several instances of potentially exculpatory evidence but only haphazardly notified defendants, if at all. This review remained secret until 2012, when The Washington Post broke the story that the department had never followed up on its mistakes. In 2015, the DOJ finally conceded that hair-comparison examiners gave flawed testimony in 96 percent of cases, including 33 of 35 death-penalty cases reviewed. Nine of those defendants had already been executed. One defendant served 28 years in prison before being exonerated by DNA testing. In court, the prosecution said it was a “one in 10 million” chance the hairs belonged to someone other than the defendant. One of the hairs turned out to be a dog’s.64

Trusting prosecutors to reform forensics presents a clear conflict of interest. Prosecutors at all levels work closely with forensic practitioners—some crime labs report directly to DA offices—and they see themselves as being on the same team. When that relationship is too cozy, unconscious cognitive bias can curdle casework (such as examiners unconsciously seeking evidence that confirms opinions held by law enforcement). While some communication between prosecutors and forensic practitioners may be necessary, practices designed to curb cognitive bias vary widely. Police departments frequently share crucial information about cases, so examiners know what their colleagues want them to find. Crime labs in at least a dozen states receive funding through court fees—but only when their analyses result in convictions. In the Genrich case, O’Neil was flown to Grand Junction to meet with prosecutors during the course of his analysis. ErkenBrack was even present in the lab for the retest. Prosecutors rely on examiners to solve crimes and win convictions.65

Still, prosecutors have a legal and ethical obligation not to present evidence they know isn’t true in court. Unfortunately, like judges, most prosecutors are not equipped to evaluate the scientific merit of forensic techniques, and even if they are acting in good faith, the incentives are all wrong. Prosecutors feel immense pressure to present forensic evidence to juries—many prosecutors believe juries can be reluctant to convict without it—a phenomenon dubbed “the CSI effect.” Bill Fitzpatrick, district attorney of New York’s Onondaga County and a past president of the National District Attorneys Association, says “people forget we are seekers of the truth,” but he has been a vocal opponent of efforts to limit forensic-expert testimony. “What are we going to say? ‘That fingerprint maybe came from that hand’? ‘That bullet maybe came from that gun’? No, we’d get no convictions.” Acknowledging the limitations of forensic techniques is perceived as opening the door to reasonable doubt.66

Scandals like the DOJ’s hair-comparison cover-up have shaken public confidence in forensic evidence and prosecutors’ willingness to own up to mistakes, yet many prosecutors maintain faith in a system shown repeatedly to fail. “There are many layers to protect the judicial process when we’re talking about scientific evidence,” says Mike Ramos, district attorney of San Bernardino County and another former president of the NDAA. “Every time I’ve used the scientific-based evidence, it has been tested. They do an analysis, and that’s brought before the jury—‘here’s how it was done, here’s how it was tested’—to make sure that it was based on a protocol that has been used, and has gone through the tests, through all of the layers.” In any case, this reasoning goes, the defense can challenge any claim in an evidentiary hearing, as well as cross-examine expert witnesses, and, in the end, there’s a jury to decide. “We still have a system in place that I believe works,” says Ramos. “The last thing we want to do is convict someone who’s innocent.”67

When asked if there were any conflicts of interest in prosecutorial agencies such as the DOJ overseeing forensic-science reform, Ramos said, “I don’t see a bias.”68

One of the NAS report’s first recommendations was that reform be independent of prosecutorial agencies. It suggested a new federal agency, the National Institute of Forensic Science, an independent body (a bit like the FDA) that would encourage empirical testing of forensic techniques before they enter the courts, establish mandatory lab accreditation and examiner certification, and standardize expert testimony. Judge Edwards, who co-chaired one of the NAS committees, said at the Harvard event last October, “One of our most important recommendations was not having forensic science reform in DOJ. Prosecution is not consistent with a culture of science. We unanimously viewed that DOJ had to be kept out of it.”69

The independent body suggested by the NAS was never created, and the DOJ has pushed back against independent reform. When Obama suggested PCAST look into forensic science, co-chair Eric Lander, a biologist at MIT and Harvard and leader of the Human Genome Project who also serves on the board of the Innocence Project, took the idea to the DOJ: “They had a fit,” he said at Harvard last October. “‘You realize this could jeopardize existing cases and past convictions?’” Reform that acknowledges long-standing problems with forensic evidence would, indeed, be deeply disruptive. It could mean that some people who have committed crimes would go free, but it would also mean that innocent people would be freed, and that serious flaws in the justice system could be corrected.70

When the report was issued, Attorney General Loretta Lynch disavowed its conclusions: “While we appreciate their contribution to the field of scientific inquiry,” she said, “the department will not be adopting the recommendations related to the admissibility of forensic science evidence.”71

Two months after being sworn in as attorney general, Sessions allowed the National Commission on Forensic Science to expire and suspended the ongoing review of examiner-testimony standards. A new Justice Department Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, established by executive order to “support law enforcement” and “restore public safety,” now oversees forensic science at the national level. Sessions has appointed a new senior adviser on forensics to lead an internal Forensic Science Working Group in conducting a “needs assessment of forensic science laboratories that examines workload, backlog, personnel and equipment needs of public crime laboratories,” as well as to “strengthen the foundations of forensic science.” In public statements, Sessions has returned to his rhetoric of the early 2000s: The purpose of forensic-science “reform” is to reduce crime-lab backlogs, and should be run by law enforcement and forensic practitioners. Prosecutors applauded Sessions’s move to put the DOJ back in charge.72

It’s still unclear how the DOJ will handle its newfound mandate, but Sessions’s pick to lead the internal Forensic Science Working Group offers a clue. Ted Hunt, a Missouri prosecutor, was a member of the now-defunct National Commission on Forensic Science, where he voted against many reform measures, including crime-lab oversight measures and scientific evaluations of forensic methods. Although the DOJ revived its review of expert-testimony standards last August, Hunt was also one of just two members of the NCFS to oppose dropping the misleading phrase “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty” from examiners’ testimony.73

Hunt has stayed out of the limelight since his appointment, but records we obtained from recent meetings are revealing. In a meeting of the federal judiciary’s Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence, Hunt blasted PCAST for its “narrow” definition of science and called PCAST’s insistence on empirical research methods “wrong and ill-advised.” At an October meeting at the National Academy of Sciences, he stated that “the jury is still out on bite marks,” inspiring at least two other participants to state firmly that “the jury is not out” on bite marks. Further, Hunt declared that how best to establish a method’s scientific validity amounts to a “difference of opinion.” At that point in the meeting, an MIT sociologist, Susan Silbey, felt compelled to speak up. She began reading out loud the requirements from PCAST’s report, such as having sufficient sample sizes and blinding subjects from the test. “PCAST is requesting basic scientific research methods. I teach scientific methodology every Friday at 9 am. This is what I teach in my class.”74

Both Hunt and the DOJ declined to comment on whether they support dropping the scientifically dubious phrase “to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty” from examiner testimony. When asked if he thought prosecutors might have reasons to resist reforms that soften the language of examiners’ claims in court, Hunt replied, “I can unequivocally say that I don’t know of any prosecutor who would consciously choose to offer unreliable evidence or rely on faulty statements of probative value—whether forensic or not. The prosecutor’s duty is to seek justice, not win convictions.” While internal discussions about reform are clearly ongoing, the prosecutorial community’s stance seems to be, basically: “trust us.”75

Judge Edwards, who helped write the 2009 NAS report and watched Silbey deliver her rebuke, took stock at the Harvard meeting. “Part of our worst fears have been realized…[the] DOJ is now the self-anointed leader of the forensic science reform. Which is a disaster.”76

8: THE FUTURE OF FORENSICS

When Genrich learned that his case was going to be taken up by the Innocence Project, he was thrilled. Unlike most of the cases the nonprofit takes on, there is no DNA evidence that could exonerate him (there rarely is in bombing cases). Instead, his new team of lawyers is arguing that the scientific consensus around toolmark evidence has changed. Leading scientists at the NAS and PCAST say toolmark matching has not yet proved to be a scientifically reliable method, and they agree that the kind of testimony O’Neil gave is scientifically indefensible. The Innocence Project argues that this constitutes “newly discovered evidence” and that Genrich deserves a new trial. Thirty-six prominent scientists, legal scholars, and forensics experts have signed an amicus brief in support.77

“The legal concept of newly discovered evidence including a change in science,” says Chris Fabricant of the Innocence Project, who is litigating Genrich’s case, “is in my view a no-brainer. It was presented to a jury as infallible, and today we know it’s not. There is an obligation—an ethical, a legal, and a moral obligation—to go back and correct the record where exaggerated claims may have led to a miscarriage of justice.” When Bert Nieslanik called up the statistician on a hunch that the science was flawed, she was a voice in the wilderness. There was no scientific consensus to support her. Fabricant says that “in a way, she was ahead of her time.”78

Genrich’s appeal is among the first of a new flurry of post-conviction challenges based on the lack of research to support the pattern-matching forensic disciplines. The Innocence Project has filed appeals challenging bite marks and shaken-baby syndrome and, just last December, filed an amicus brief in a Maryland firearm case. Yet only two states—California and Texas—have passed statutes stating that a change in scientific consensus alone can constitute “newly discovered evidence.” These special statutes were advanced because higher courts have proved skittish about granting new trials when the scientific evidence used to convict has since become controversial or even discredited. In one case, the California Supreme Court failed to grant the defendant a new trial even when the bite-mark examiner recanted his testimony over 10 years later. That maddening ruling spurred the new California law, and only after its passage did the court finally exonerate the wrongfully convicted man. In states without special statutes, such as Colorado, appeals face a much tougher uphill battle to create new precedent that could be used to keep scientifically flawed expert testimony out of courtrooms in the future.79

The rulings on cases such as Genrich’s will arrive at a critical moment for American criminal justice, which is on the cusp of an explosion of next-generation forensic techniques. Like so many other aspects of modern life, criminal justice is becoming automated. Artificial intelligence predicts criminal “hotspots” so police can be there at the ready. Software sold at $60,000 a pop to police departments helps them analyze minute amounts of DNA in complex mixtures from multiple people. The new field of digital forensics promises new techniques to parse large amounts of data. These technologies, by and large, are sold by for-profit companies, which means their algorithms are proprietary trade secrets. Their inner workings are invisible to lawyers mounting a defense. Juries will hardly be equipped to decide for themselves what weight to give a piece of sophisticated, impenetrable science presented as forensic evidence. Says Murphy, the NYU law professor, “Some of the bad habits of the first generation—the secrecy, the government bias, the overclaiming, the stretching without offering empirical support, the failure of judges to curb that behavior—that is going to be on steroids.”80 CRIMINAL JUSTICE Prosecutors Are Banding Together to Prevent Criminal-Justice Reform Jessica Pishko

Recently, a few intrepid judges have acknowledged that the problems with forensic science can’t be ignored any longer. In 2016, Judge Catherine Easterly, on the DC Court of Appeals, wrote in a robbery case involving a firearm, “As matters currently stand, a certainty statement regarding toolmark pattern matching has the same probative value as the vision of a psychic: it reflects nothing more than the individual’s foundationless faith in what he believes to be true.” Murphy, who signed on to the amicus brief supporting Genrich’s appeal, says favorable rulings like Judge Easterly’s could help change the legal landscape. “The more a court of high regard makes a ruling that says this is not a legitimate science, or this practice that stands in courtrooms across America…won’t stand in our state, people notice,” she says. “Lawyers making those arguments can say, ‘Look it’s not just me with my tinfoil hat, the Supreme Court of Colorado agrees.’”81

When Nieslanik, who is now retired, heard about the NAS and PCAST reports, her response was, “What took them so long?” Genrich has now been in prison for nearly a quarter century, and there is still a deeply troubling disconnect between what constitutes scientific proof and what is accepted as legal evidence. “We weren’t proving Jimmy’s innocence,” Nieslanik says. “We were really focused on ‘this isn’t a science.’ I can tell you from doing triple-digit jury trials, the jurors really want concrete evidence. Because it’s a very hard decision to make. And that’s why scientific evidence is so dangerous when it’s not a real science, because it is persuasive.”82

Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article did not clearly differentiate between the methods of the three exoneration studies described. The Innocence Project, the National Registry of Exonerations, and an academic study by Gould et al. each looked at different sets of cases and used different methods to determine whether faulty forensics was a factor in exonerations. The article also inaccurately described John Murdock’s employment and his participation in an FBI study. He formerly worked for ATF, not the FBI; he was working on a study sent out by the FBI, not a proficiency test. The text has been corrected."

Bigotry and national security have, sadly, close and old ties in American history. National-security concerns mixed with anti-Semitism delayed our acceptance of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. Racism combined with panic after Pearl Harbor led to the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans. This year, in the name of national security, we have allowed at least 117 people to die in the desert rather than welcome them across our southern border, and over the past decade have wrenched at least 2 million people from their families with a record-setting pace of deportation. Throughout our history, these kinds of inhumane policy choices have been sold with dehumanizing rhetoric about those we define as threats. Ad Policy

So while Donald Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States is shameful, it’s best understood as the extreme expression of a dangerous theme in American politics—one that has dominated the Republican primary. It’s in this context that 11 of the 13 GOP presidential candidates oppose allowing any Syrian refugees into the country at all. The two who think otherwise—Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz—would admit only the Christian ones. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whose standing in the polls has risen in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings, has said that even Syrian orphans under the age of 5 represent a potential danger and should be turned away.

More Americans put terrorism at the top of their concerns today than at any time since 9/11, according to a recent poll by The New York Times. There is no denying the threat posed by the Islamic State and those whom it inspires—a threat felt most acutely by Muslims in Syria and Iraq, we must stress. But as Robert Dear reminded us when he killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic just days before Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik murdered 14 in San Bernardino, extremist violence comes in many forms. According to a study by the New America Foundation, more Americans have been killed in domestic terrorist attacks by right-wing zealots than by jihadists since 9/11. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP!

What all of these attacks have in common is neither religion nor national identity, but weaponry. The terror that most urgently threatens our safety today is that of guns. Commentators are now debating what constitutes a “mass shooting.” One standard counts any incident in which four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire; by this measure, there have been 353 mass shootings in 350 days so far this year. Another counts only those incidents in which four or more people are killed; by this measure, there have been 22 mass shootings so far this year in the United States—a world-leading statistic. But whichever number you choose, it’s still too many, and it doesn’t even take into account the daily toll of individuals killed by gun violence. More than 400,000 people were killed by guns between the 9/11 attacks and 2013, the most recent year for which data are available. We are so awash in shooting deaths that these lost lives don’t even register as news.

The firearms industry’s defenders, posing as civil libertarians, have responded to growing calls for more gun control by peddling the idea that no amount of regulation will guarantee that killers can’t kill. This truism is hardly a reason to make mass murder easier. It’s no reason to allow the legal possession of high-capacity magazines designed to facilitate rapid, indiscriminate firing. It’s no argument against universal background checks as a basic provision for purchasing a deadly weapon, no justification for the fact that it’s easier to buy a gun than to cast a vote in some states.

Americans are rightly concerned about violence, whether that comes in the form of terrorist attacks or quotidian shootings. The Trumps of the world would like us to channel this fear into irrational bigotry; it would be better harnessed as outrage against the firearms industry’s grasp on our lawmakers. Until our political leaders find the courage to fight a war on guns, we will all live with the daily threat of gun terror."

Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association (NRA), has famously claimed that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.” Ad Policy

Much of today’s opposition to stronger gun safety regulations rests on the gun lobby’s Hobbesian vision of self-sufficient, heavily-armed citizens standing up to vicious thugs. This Die Hard argument is constantly parroted by politicians and conservative pundits. But the statistical reality is that for every justifiable homicide in the United States—for every lethal shooting in defense of life or property—guns are used to commit 34 murders and 78 suicides, and are the cause of two accidental deaths, according to an analysis of FBI data by The Washington Post.

LaPierre, a career lobbyist, has no clue what it’s like to use a firearm in anger. But The Nation spoke to several people who do—including combat veterans and former law enforcement officers—and who believe that the NRA’s heroic gunslinger mythology is a dangerous fantasy that bears little resemblance to reality. Retired Army Sergeant Rafael Noboa y Rivera, who led a combat team in Iraq, says that most soldiers only function effectively after they’ve been exposed to fire a number a times. “I think there’s this fantasy world of gunplay in the movies, but it doesn’t really happen that way,” he says. “When I heard gunfire [in Iraq], I didn’t immediately pick up my rifle and react. I first tried to ascertain where the shooting was coming from, where I was in relation to the gunfire and how far away it was. I think most untrained people are either going to freeze up, or just whip out their gun and start firing in that circumstance,” Noboa said. “I think they would absolutely panic.”

Those interviewed for this article agreed that the key distinction isn’t between “good guys” and “bad guys,” because intentions are less important than the rigorous—and continuous—training that it takes to effectively handle firearms in high-stress situations.

Dr. Pete Blair, an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas State University and director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center (ALERRT), has studied mass shooting incidents and trains law enforcement personnel to respond to active-shooter situations. The cops who go through his course conduct live-fire exercises using real firearms which are re-chambered to fire “soap rounds” that leave only welts when they hit. For every justifiable homicide in the US, guns are used to commit 34 murders and 78 suicides.

Blair’s trainees run through a number of real-world scenarios—“force on force training” that’s designed to “inoculate” officers against the problems people naturally encounter in high-stress situations. That stress response, says Blair, includes “tunnel vision, audio exclusion and time dilation,” and one would expect people who weren’t trained in these situations to “freeze up or not know what to do, and to have difficulty performing actions correctly.”

Weekend-long tactical training courses for civilians are growing in popularity. But these courses offer only a shadow of what’s required, says David Chipman, a former agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Chipman, who spent several years on the agency’s SWAT team, says, “Training for a potentially deadly encounter meant, at a minimum, qualifying four times a year throughout my 25-year career. And this wasn’t just shooting paper—it meant doing extensive tactical exercises. And when I was on the SWAT team we had to undergo monthly tactical training.”

Tactical officers typically receive training in “judgmental shooting,” which includes knowing when it’s prudent to hold their fire, and “blue-on-blue awareness,” which drills into them the importance of considering whether other cops are present, including officers who aren’t in uniform. They’re trained to overcome tunnel vision by looking not only at their target but also maintaining an awareness of who or what is behind it. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

“The notion that you have a seal of approval just because you’re not a criminal—that you walk into a gun store and you’re ready for game-day—is ridiculous,” says Chipman.

A case in Texas two weeks ago highlights the risks of civilians intervening in chaotic situations. Police say that as two carjackers struggled with the owner of a car at a gas station in northeast Houston, a witness decided to take action into his own hands. He fired several shots, but missed the perpetrators and shot the owner of the car in the head. He then picked up his shell casings and fled the scene. Police are still looking for the shooter.

The potential for that kind of outcome is why most police agencies strongly recommend that concealed carry holders only use their weapons as an absolute last resort, and not intervene in robberies or other crimes in which they’re not directly involved. David Chipman notes that even police officers are told that if they encounter a crime in progress while off-duty, “maybe the best thing to do at that time is not to take lethal action but instead try to be the best witness you can be.”

Not pulling a weapon is often the wisest course of action in active-shooter situations. While a number of conservatives declared that Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, the scene of a mass shooting last week, was a gun-free zone, the truth is that several concealed carry holders were present, and they wisely decided to leave their guns holstered. Veteran John Parker later explained to MSNBC, “We could have opened ourselves up to be potential targets ourselves, and not knowing where SWAT was… if we had our guns ready to shoot, they could think that we were bad guys.” “I think there’s this fantasy world of gunplay in the movies, but it doesn’t really happen that way.” —Retired Army Sargeant Rafael Noboa y Rivera

David Chipman says the Secret Service’s history is instructive. “Here’s an agency that has all the weaponry that they could ever need, all the training that they could ever need, and they’ve never fired a weapon in defense of a president during an assassination attempt. You’re trained to throw your body in front of the protectee, not to open fire. Just look at the picture taken immediately after Reagan was shot and count the guns in that photograph. They’re all being held by highly-trained experts and not one of them fired. They didn’t shoot [would-be assassin John] Hinckley. And that’s because you’re likely to do more harm than good in that situation.”

The gun lobby and some conservative politicians have seized on a “study” by Davi Barker, a conservative blogger, which purports to show that when a “good guy with a gun” is present during a mass shooting, an average of 2.5 people die, but in similar situations where nobody is armed, there are an average of 18 deaths.

It’s provided the basis for claims that gun-free zones are, in former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee’s words, “sitting duck zones.” But Barker later admitted that his methodology entailed analyzing “10 shootings I found listed on some timeline somewhere.… I honestly don’t even remember where.” And Pete Blair from Texas State notes that by definition, shootings with fewer than four casualties aren’t “mass shootings,” and incidents with as many as 18 casualties are exceedingly rare. Blair acknowledges the possibility that shooters may be more likely to seek out places they see as soft targets, like gun-free zones, but adds, “Trying to prove that is difficult to do.” A firearm makes a person almost twice as likely to become the victim of a homicide and three times more likely to commit suicide.

Blair co-authored a study for the FBI that looked at 185 mass shooting events over a 13-year period. It found that while around one-in-five were stopped by civilians before police arrived, in only one case was it done by a typical “good guy with a gun” (professionals—an off-duty cop and an armed security guard—used their guns to stop two others). In most cases Blair and his colleague studied, civilians ended a rampage by tackling the assailant.

None of this has prevented the gun manufacturers’ lobby from insisting that more guns make a society safer. And many Americans have come to believe it. According to the Pew Research Center, the share of gun owners who cite “protection” as “the main reason they own a gun” almost doubled between 1999 and 2013, from 26 percent to 48 percent.

But a large body of empirical evidence finds the opposite to be true. Last year, epidemiologists at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted an extensive analysis of data from 16 previous peer-reviewed studies, and found that having access to a firearm makes a person almost twice as likely to become the victim of a homicide and three times more likely to commit suicide. Previous research has shown that countries with higher rates of gun ownership also have higher rates of gun deaths and states with more guns have higher homicide rates. (The gun lobby’s side of the scholarly debate rests largely on the discredited and allegedly fraudulent work of economist John Lott.)

Rafael Noboa y Rivera scoffed at the idea, adding that he’s personally wary of “untrained yahoos” who “think they’re Wyatt Earp.”

“Despite what we see on TV, the presence of a firearm is a greater risk, especially in the hands of an untrained person,” says David Chipman, the former ATF agent. “Someone can always say, ‘If your mother is being raped by 5 people, wouldn’t you want her to have a gun?’ Well, OK, if you put it that way, I’d say yes, but that’s not a likely scenario. The question is: If you see someone running out of a gas station with a gun in their hand, do you want an untrained person jumping out and opening fire. For me, the answer is clearly ‘no.’”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada speaks to reporters following the Democratic policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) Ad Policy

In the wake of the horrific mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, support for re-banning assault weapons grew exponentially inside and outside of the Beltway. It's only natural when an AR-15 is used to slaughter twenty schoolchildren and six educators, only months after another was used to shoot seventy-one people inside a movie theater.

Yesterday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel—seen as recently as 2006 recruiting pro-gun Democrats to run in House races—said that Newtown was a “tipping point, a galvanization for action.” He’s now calling for an assault weapons ban, expanded background checks, and is ordering Chicago municipal pension funds to divest from all gun manufacturers.

Indeed, it was a tipping point. Five days after the shootings, President Obama stood in the White House briefing room and explicitly called for another assault weapons ban, and Vice President Joe Biden is expected to recommend one this week. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she’d introduce a strong bill in the Senate, and all the pieces looked to be in place.

But in the past twenty-four hours, there have been disturbing signs of pre-emptive surrender by key Democrats on the assault weapons ban.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told a PBS affiliate in Las Vegas that he didn’t think the assault weapons ban could pass the House, and thus he wanted would “focus” on what could. His comments echoed many pro-gun talking points about Hollywood and violent video games, and Reid openly tried to throw cold water on the gun-control movement:

“We have too much violence in our society, and it’s not just from guns. It’s from a lot of stuff. And I think we should take a look at TV, movies, video games and weapons. And I hope that everyone will just be careful and cautious. […] “Let’s just look at everything. I don’t think we need to point to anything now,” he said. “We need to be very cool and cautious. […] “I think that the American people want us to be very cautious what we do. I think they want us to do things that are logical, smart, and make the country safer, not just be doing things that get a headline in a newspaper.”

On Monday, Representative Mike Thompson—appointed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to head the House’s gun violence prevention task force—also signaled surrender on the assault weapons ban, according to Politico:

Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Democrats’ gun violence task force, said the magazine ban and universal registration requirement would be far more effective than an assault weapons ban without the political cost. “Probably the most recognizable thing you can say in this debate is ban assault weapons,” Thompson said. “But the other two issues” – forbidding high-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring universal registration for gun purchases – “those two things have more impact on making our neighborhoods safe than everything else combined. Anytime you try and prohibit what kind of gun people has it generates some concern.”

It’s not that Reid and Thompson are necessarily wrong in their political calculus—maybe an assault weapons ban can’t pass the House.

But publicly dooming the effort before it starts is self-enforcing, and repeats a Democratic proclivity that has frustrated progressives to no end: heading into negotiations and votes with a pre-compromised position.

Americans favor an assault weapons ban 58-39, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll released Monday. The president is about to stick his neck out and propose it, and then push for it in the weeks to come. Moreover, as Thompson and Reid both correctly noted, it’s the headline-grabbing issue here: rampages with assault weapons are what is driving the momentum on gun control.

Democrats would naturally be wise to push forward aggressively on the ban, as they have mostly done up to this point. If they fail, they fail. At least they’d likely be able to wrest more concessions from the GOP on background checks and high-capacity magazine bans during the legislative battle, and potentially force Republicans into a difficult vote where they would effectively be supporting military style weapons on the street.

Yet, it appears Reid and Thompson—absolutely key figures in the legislative battles in the Senate and House respectively—want to drop the assault weapons ban from the legislative agenda. It’s not yet clear that they will, but even signaling a lack of confidence is damaging to both the legislative prospects for meaningful gun control, and for public attitudes and activist motivation. And it’s not the debate demanded by what happened in Newtown.

In the wake of the mass shooting in suburban Virginia last week that left House majority whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and three others wounded, conservatives have been furiously waving the bloody shirt. With left-wing hate filling half the screen, Sean Hannity blamed Democrats, saying they “dehumanize Republicans and paint them as monsters.” Tucker Carlson claimed that “some on the hard left” support political violence because it “could lead to the dissolution of a country they despise.” Others have blamed seemingly anything even vaguely identified with liberalism for inciting the violence—from Madonna to MSNBC to Shakespeare in the Park. Ad Policy

This is all a truly remarkable example of projection. In the wake of the shooting, Erick Erickson wrote a piece titled, “The Violence is Only Getting Started,” as if three innocent people hadn’t been brutally murdered by white supremacists in two separate incidents in just the past month.

In the real world, since the end of the Vietnam era, the overwhelming majority of serious political violence—not counting vandalism or punches thrown at protests, but violence with lethal intent—has come from the fringes of the right. Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project says that “if you go back to the 1960s, you see all kinds of left-wing terrorism, but since then it’s been exceedingly rare.” She notes that eco- and animal-rights extremists caused extensive property damage in the 1990s, but didn’t target people.

Meanwhile, says Beirich, “right-wing domestic terrorism has been common throughout that period, going back to groups like to The Order, which assassinated [liberal talk-radio host] Alan Berg [in 1984] right through to today.” Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told NPR that “when you look at murders committed by domestic extremists in the United States of all types, right-wing extremists are responsible for about 74 percent of those murders.” The actual share is higher still, as violence committed by ultraconservative Islamic supremacists isn’t included in tallies of “right-wing extremism.”

A 2015 survey of law-enforcement agencies conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that the police rate antigovernment extremists as a greater threat than reactionary Islamists. The authors wrote that “right-wing violence appears consistently greater than violence by Muslim extremists in the United States since 9/11, according to multiple definitions in multiple datasets.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, “Sovereign Citizens”—fringe antigovernmentalists—launched 24 violent attacks from 2010 through 2014, mostly against law enforcement personnel. When Robert Dear shot and killed three people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015, it became the latest in a series of bloody attacks on abortion providers dating back to Roe v. Wade in 1973. In the 30 years that followed that landmark decision, providers and clinics were targeted in more than 300 acts of violence, including arson, bombings, and assassinations, according to a study by the Rand Corporation.

But while the extreme right has held a near-monopoly on political violence since the 1980s, conservatives and Republicans are no more likely to say that using force to achieve one’s political goals is justified than are liberals and Democrats. That’s the conclusion of a study conducted by Nathan Kalmoe, a professor of political communication at the University of Louisiana. In 2010, he asked respondents whether they agreed that various violent tactics were acceptable. Kalmoe found that less than 3 percent of the population strongly agreed that “sometimes the only way to stop bad government is with physical force,” or that “some of the problems citizens have with government could be fixed with a few well-aimed bullets.” He says that while “there were tiny [partisan] variations on these specific items,” they weren’t “statistically significant on average.”

Ideology alone isn’t a significant risk factor for violence. “There’s a much stronger factor of individual personality traits that predispose people to be more aggressive in their everyday lives,” Kalmoe says, “and we see that playing out with people who engage in political violence.” Mass shooters are often found to have had histories of domestic violence, and that was true for James Hodgkinson, the shooter who attacked the congressional baseball practice in Virginia. Kalmoe says, “we often see that violent individuals have a history of violence in their personal lives. People who are abusive, or who have run afoul of the law in other ways, are more likely to endorse violence.”

Political animosity is similarly bipartisan. According to Pew, roughly the same number of Republicans and Democrats—around half—say they feel anger and fear toward the opposing party.

Which raises an important question: If red and blue America fear and loathe one another equally, and a similar number believe that political violence is acceptable, then why is there so much more of it on the fringes of the right?

Part of the answer lies in a clear difference between right and left: For the past 40 years, Republicans, parroting the gun-rights movement, have actively promoted the idea that firearms are a vital bulwark against government tyranny.

.@Judgenap: Why do we have a Second Amendment? It’s not to shoot deer. It’s to shoot at the government when it becomes tyrannical! —Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 23, 2016

Call it the Minutemen theory of gun rights. While the Second Amendment was framed to protect government-organized militias at a time when we had a very small standing army, the right has promoted the idea that it’s “America’s first freedom,” integral to defending our other rights, since the 1960s.

It’s become ubiquitous, from the militia movement that arose in the 1980s and has seen a resurgence in recent years, to the armed standoffs at the Bundy Ranch and the Malheur National Wildlife refuge. It animated Timothy McVeigh to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, as well as the 2013 Los Angeles airport shooting spree, a 2014 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left two cops and one civilian dead and a number of less dramatic acts of violence.

The belief that democratic government rests on the Second Amendment has become widespread among Americans; one poll found that about two-thirds believe that “their constitutional right to own a gun was intended to ensure their freedom.” But Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of several books on the politics of guns, says that’s a modern idea. While “there’s a long tradition of some in America feeling deeply mistrustful of our government—and there have been incidents throughout our history where people took up arms against the government—the more specific idea that there’s a right to rebel, or that somehow you can keep the government under control by taking up weapons, found its first serious expression in a law review article published in 1960. And the idea really took hold among a subset of Americans and a subset of gun owners, who argue to this day that this was part of the purpose of the Second Amendment. They talk about the Minutemen and the Revolutionary War and the Declaration of Independence. The idea really took hold in the 1970s and 1980s when the NRA itself began to use this same kind of rhetoric.”

It’s also infused right-wing politics beyond the gun lobby. Watering the “tree of liberty” with the “blood of patriots and tyrants” is a common theme in Tea Party circles, where the Gadsden flag—don’t tread on me!—and loose talk of revolution blend seamlessly with mainstream anti-tax ideology and disdain for liberals. While a handful of Democrats competing in red states have run ads featuring them firing weapons, it’s become almost universal in Republican campaigns, where it not only marks a candidate’s opposition to gun-safety legislation but also signals that he or she is ready to wage war against the Washington establishment.

War as a metaphor for politics isn’t limited to the right, but it has become a constant in conservative discourse. “The first shots of the second American civil war have already been fired,” said Alex Jones earlier this month. “We are in a clear-cut cultural civil war,” according to Newt Gingrich. Pat Buchanan offered that we’re “approaching something of a civil war,” and said that it’s time for Trump to “burn down the Bastille.” “You ain’t got any idea of the war that’s raging outside the four walls of the church,” religious-right activist Dave Daubenmire told a crowd of antigay protesters last weekend. “Don’t you understand what’s going on? Don’t you know it’s a war? Don’t you know they want your children? Don’t you understand that those same people singing ‘Jesus loves you this I know’ want to kill us?” Then there’s the quasi-apocalyptic prepper mentality, which holds that we’re on the brink of social collapse so you’d better buy gold and stock up on ammo for when the shit inevitably hits the fan.

Nathan Kalmoe says that there’s “an important distinction to make between people who have more conventional views, versus people who have much more extreme views.” He thinks that, whether on the left or the right, those who are at least somewhat close to the mainstream “probably have a greater commitment to nonviolent approaches to politics and are socialized into nonviolent norms of how participation is supposed to work.” But on the right those lines have become blurred in recent years—Glenn Beck’s goldbuggery, the ravings of the “alt-right” and the Minutemen theory of gun rights have all become features of the larger conservative landscape, even if they’re not quite mainstream.

Kalmoe says that rhetoric alone “isn’t the main cause of political violence, but violent language and vilifying opponents can nudge people in ways that make them think and act more aggressively in politics.” He conducted an experiment that first measured subjects’ aggressive personality traits. Then he exposed them to two imaginary political ads, one that employed mildly violent political rhetoric and one that used neutral language, and he found that those subjects who had already displayed a penchant for aggressive behavior were far more likely to support political violence after being exposed to the violent rhetoric. So it’s not that violent rhetoric causes real-world violence so much as it can “make people who behave aggressively in real-life more likely to endorse violence against political leaders.”

Liberals believe that mature institutions and the separation of powers are what keep tyranny at bay, not an AR-15. If James Hodgkinson looked around himself and saw a president who acts as if he’s above the law and a Congress that’s working in the dark to strip away health insurance from millions of people to finance tax cuts for the wealthy but is unwilling to perform its oversight duties, and decided that he would stand up to tyranny with an assault rifle, he would have taken a theme that’s exceedingly common on the right to its bloody logical conclusion."

Race dominated the coverage of the 2014 shooting of John Crawford. Crawford was a young black man gunned down by white cops in a Beaverton Creek, Ohio, Walmart as he talked to his girlfriend on the phone while absentmindedly holding a BB gun he had grabbed from a store shelf. Ohio is an “open-carry” state where it’s perfectly legal to walk around with a loaded AR-15. Ad Policy

What got less attention is that less than two weeks before the shooting, the officer who shot Crawford had been trained to respond to “active shooter situations” by shooting first and asking questions later.

According to The Guardian, officer Sean Williams and his colleagues were “taught to keep in mind that ‘the suspect wants a body count’ and therefore officers should immediately engage a would-be gunman with ‘speed, surprise and aggressiveness.’” At that training, they were told to imagine that a crazed gunman was threatening their own relatives.

Dispatchers led Williams and his partner to believe that an active-shooter situation was underway. Store surveillance video showed that Crawford was shot and killed just seconds after police made contact with him, and probably had no idea what was happening. They followed their training, acting with speed, surprise, and aggressiveness.

Thanks in large part to pressure brought by Black Lives Matter activists, some police experts are calling for a complete overhaul in the way cops are trained, both as cadets and during the “in-service” training they receive over the course of their careers. There are no national standards for training police, and the amount and quality of their instruction varies from agency to agency. But a survey of 280 police departments conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), a Washington, DC–based think tank, found that American cops are given extensive preparation for using violence, and very little guidance on how to avoid it.

The median police recruit in the United States will receive 129 hours of instruction on defensive techniques and using his or her gun, baton, OC-spray, and Taser. That cadet will receive another 24 hours of scenario-based training, drilling on things like when to shoot or hold fire. The median trainee also gets 48 hours of instruction on constitutional law and his or her department’s use-of-force policies.

But that same future police officer will receive only eight hours of training in conflict de-escalation. And despite the fact that a quarter of the 838 citizens shot dead by police this year showed symptoms of mental-health issues, according to The Washington Post, the median cadet gets only eight hours of training in crisis intervention.

The study paints a similar picture with in-service training. A total of 59 percent of a cop’s time is spent on using their weapons or defending themselves. That’s more than four times as much time that he or she will spend on de-escalation and crisis intervention. Almost all of the agencies surveyed offer their cops continual training with firearms, but over a third offer zero in-service instruction on conflict de-escalation.

Chuck Wexler, PERF’s executive director, tells The Nation, “The reason that’s important and significant is that the way officers are trained makes them dependent on the strategies they’ve learned. So if they’ve spent a lot of time on firearms and what we call less-lethal weapons, to the detriment of de-escalation and crisis intervention, they’re much more likely to use a higher level of force than might be necessary.” The median police recruit gets only 8 hours of training in conflict de-escalation.

Wexler and his colleagues have studied policing in the United Kingdom, where most officers are unarmed. While he acknowledges that the environment in which those cops operate—American police not only shoot many more citizens than those in other Western democracies, they’re also a lot more likely to be shot—he says we can nonetheless gain some important insights from how they work.

“What we’ve learned in England and Scotland is the importance of communication, of engaging and slowing things down in certain circumstances,” says Wexler. “There are times when you get called to a situation where someone is obviously distraught or emotionally disturbed and they might have a knife or a stick or a rock, and that’s where we need to slow things down, maintain a safe distance and call in additional resources. And most importantly, we need to start at a lower level of force and begin to communicate.” He adds: “With a mentally ill person, the worst thing you can do is shove a gun in their face and start barking orders at them. It’s counterproductive.”

Wexler thinks our lightning-fast, high-tech culture is part of the problem. “Some of the officers coming out of police academies approach these situations asking themselves, ‘Which of my technologies can I use to get this person under control? Should I use a gun, or should I use a Taser or a baton or whatever.’ They’re not thinking, ‘What do I have here, what is the situation? How can I take this person who’s at a very high level of anxiety and try to bring them down to earth?’”

Mass shootings, which seem to be an everyday occurrence in the United States, heighten the tension between how police are trained and how they should ideally behave. Before the Columbine massacre, patrol officers were trained to secure the area around an active-shooter incident and call in specialized tactical officers—SWAT teams. Since then, cops have been taught to seek out and neutralize a suspected gunman. But as common as they seem, those mass shootings only represent a tiny fraction of police calls, and the training for those incidents runs counter to the training for scenarios cops encounter more frequently.

In August, PERF issued a report calling for a radical “re-engineering” of use-of-force training. It detailed how the instruction officers receive, the ways that their performances are evaluated, and the culture of American policing combine to undermine what might be considered best practices.

From a cadet’s first day at the police academy to a veteran cop’s daily briefings, it’s hammered into most officers’ heads that their first job is to get home safely every day. While police obviously need to protect themselves, the job requires some risk, and this constantly repeated message leads many officers to see citizens as threats—and to view themselves as “warriors” rather than “guardians” of their communities.

Police are taught to be assertive, establish their authority and immediately take control of a situation. Failing to get that done may be seen as a sign of weakness. Many agencies evaluate cops in part on how many calls they answer, which is another incentive to react to events quickly rather than taking stock of a situation and taking a step back when it’s appropriate to do so. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

Another example is the “21-foot rule.” It originated in a 1983 article in SWAT magazine arguing that a knife-wielding suspect could close a 20-foot gap in the time it takes for an average cop to draw his or her weapon, take aim and fire. According to PERF’s report, cops say “the 21-foot rule is a part of police culture, handed down informally from one officer to another, or mentioned in training, over the generations.” The author of the article, a Salt Lake City cop, urged his fellow officers to use defensive tactics to stay outside of that 21-foot zone, but police officials interviewed by PERF staffers say that over the years many cops took it to mean that there’s a 21-foot “kill zone” where deadly force is justified. “Instead of protecting officers’ safety,” reads the report, “the rule has been cited to justify the use of deadly force in incidents when other tactics might have allowed a resolution of the situation without deadly force.”

An institution’s culture isn’t easily moved, but training is a good place to start. In August, a number of prominent Black Lives Matter activists released a comprehensive set of policy proposals they called “Campaign Zero.” It calls for a laundry list of changes to how police are trained, with a new emphasis on avoiding implicit racial bias and improving cops’ relationships with the communities they serve. It also calls for officers to undergo extensive training in “crisis intervention, mediation, conflict resolution and rumor control.”

The good news is that with so much focus on policing, some departments are reexamining their use-of-force policies—and their training regimes—and talking openly about the distinction between turning out “warriors” and “guardians.”

Elk Grove, California Police Chief Robert Lehner told PERF, “The concept of police officers as warriors, whether we like it or not, has run through our profession, certainly for the almost 40 years I’ve been in it.… I think we need to confront this issue.” He says his department has stopped using firearms and use-of-force training programs designed by SWAT, “whose tactical perspective is necessarily different than routine patrol.”

A number of departments are now deploying psychiatric social workers along with specially trained officers when they get calls to deal with people suffering from mental illness.

After the killing of Eric Garner, the NYPD required all 35,000 of its cops to undergo a three-day in-service training program—it typically offers eight-hour sessions—that included a day of de-escalation tactics and techniques. Chief Matthew Pontillo explained, “We focus on the impact of high-emotion, high-stakes encounters and what that does to an officer’s stress level, what the flow of adrenaline does, what they can expect, and how they can mitigate against that. Unnecessary use of force is often tied to an officer’s adrenaline or anger, so you have to know how to control that.”

Some are reexamining their hiring practices in an attempt to weed out potentially bad cops from the start. Thomas Hongslo, chief of the Lenexa, Kansas police department, told PERF that his agency goes “to great lengths to ensure that we’re hiring people…who mix well with the community. We look for empathy, for compassion, and I think that goes to the guardian model of policing. We’ve had people come in who could do the job, but they were warriors, and they were in the job for a different reason.”

This kind of thinking won’t be evident on the streets overnight, and many of the country’s 18,000 police agencies are hunkered down in a defensive crouch rather than reexamining how they serve their communities. But with continued pressure, it might lead to a real paradigm shift down the road."

The first thing I noticed about all the folks at town halls and presidential events “caught” with loaded guns by the media over the past week was the suspiciously high percentage of former Ron Paul supporters among them. Both the guy in New Hampshire carrying a semiautomatic pistol and a sign referencing Thomas Jefferson (“It’s Time to Water the Tree of Liberty” by the blood of patriots and tyrants) and one of the demonstrators strapped with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle in Phoenix campaigned for Paul last year. William Kostric, the man packin’ in Portsmouth, appeared on Chris Matthews’s Hardball the next day; the Phoenix gunman had actually arranged in advance with local police and media to expect him, so his appearance was more of a stunt than anything else, a provocative demonstration of “gun rights” carried out in a legalistic, thoroughly Ron-Pauly way. Ad Policy

And whatever you think of Ron Paul and his remarkably enthusiastic fans, it’s hard to see them as a serious lynch mob (though they did chase Sean Hannity out of his restaurant and through the New Hampshire night during the primaries, chanting “Fox Lies!”). They may be nothing more than reckless provocateurs, as Rick Sanchez’s interview with the Viper Militia-linked blogger who helped arrange the Arizona stunt shows:

Their real interest is in political theater. They even have an almost Yippie-ish sense of humor about it. If anything, their wet dream would be to go to an Obama rally, see someone else pull a gun, and then shoot that person to stop an assassination, thereby proving the necessity of the Second Amendment and becoming an overnight hero to millions.

That, and getting a few minutes airtime on Hardball or CNN.

In fact, these guys and most of the dozens of other Americans who’ve been bringing guns to public meetings about healthcare reform are really just responding to a media-wide casting call for crazies that went out after an angry woman accosted Republican Representative Mike Castle at a June 30 town hall in Delaware, demanding to see Barack Obama’s birth certificate. It took a few days for television to grasp the potential political impact of that snippet of Flip camera video, but once they did, it and similar scenes of Americans Gone Wild have become almost daily features on cable.

Clearly, the idea is to suggest that there’s a veritable Whiskey Rebellion brewing out in the heartland, one mightily provoked by Obama’s plan to extend health insurance to every citizen. It doesn’t matter that the Birthers have been dismissed, derided and thoroughly disproved. In fact, much of the opposition to healthcare reform has long since moved on from that obviously hopeless argument–the real point is they’ve united dispirited conservatives and captured television’s attention away from the beautiful Obamas in favor of angry, ill-informed and terrified white people.

Think of it as our nation’s Dirty Harry moment–bringing a gun to a political debate is equivalent to saying, “So do ya, punk?” It’s an intimidating gesture, a warning to politicians that they must heed the vehemence on the right. And it both frightens and dissuades progressives, discouraging their participation in the debate. But you don’t get more votes just because you pull the lever on the machine harder. Like a cowboy shooting off his six-gun in the night, these people want to start a stampede, but so far they’re all hat and no cattle. Politics, like stand-up, is about timing, and after six weeks of escalating (but still relatively tiny) demonstrations by increasingly wacko people, there has in fact been very little violence and no gunplay at all. This thing is fading like the Birthers down to the hard-core, Cheneyesque extreme.

Now, I’m not saying we can forget that Timothy McVeigh was wearing one of those “The Tree of Liberty Must be Watered” T-shirts the day he blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Weaponizing the debate over healthcare is terrifically dangerous. Politically, though, it’s a very risky bluff for the GOP. Because the minute one of these guys fires his gun in anger at a town hall, wounding or killing a congressperson or another demonstrator, the political dynamic will shift completely.

So call them on it, again and again. Nominating Barack Obama in the first place was calling Republicans out on their sotto voce racist Southern Strategy, the dog-whistle politics that allowed suburban moderates to vote with overt racists without acknowledging they were doing so. Pulling the trigger would be worse than shouting the word that rhymes with it: remember, this is a television show.

And anyway, with just forty votes in the Senate, Dirty Harry needs to reload."

The US military has reopened a criminal investigation into some of the most serious accusations of war crimes against US forces in Afghanistan since 2001. As The New York Times reported last week, the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command will again investigate allegations that a Special Forces team was involved in the murders of at least 17 civilians in Afghanistan in 2012 and 2013. The question now is why the investigation has dragged on for so long—and whether there has at any point been a coverup by members of the military. Ad Policy

Even amidst a war that has been marked by repeated human rights abuses committed by US and Afghan soldiers (and, to an even greater extent, by the Taliban), the Nerkh killings stand out. Unlike cases of deranged soldiers’ acting without their superiors’ knowledge or consent—such as the Panjwai massacre in 2012, where SSgt. Robert Bales massacred 16 civilians in one night in their homes, or the Arghandab “kill team,” where a small group of soldiers murdered unarmed Afghans and cut off their body parts as trophies in 2010—the crimes in Nerkh were allegedly committed by an elite military unit in the course of its campaign against local insurgents. Moreover, the incidents were repeatedly investigated by the US military command in Afghanistan, which exonerated the team, until findings by the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross pushed it to belatedly request a criminal inquiry in July 2013. ""The murders of Afghan civilians in Nerkh were allegedly committed by an elite US military unit.""

As I revealed in my 2013 investigation of the killings for Rolling Stone, the unit in question is Operational Detachment Alpha 3124, a unit of the Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group, which was deployed to Nerkh District of Wardak Province between the fall of 2012 and March 2013. ODA 3124 was eventually forced out by President Hamid Karzai in response to repeated demonstrations by locals, who claimed that the Special Forces team had murdered, tortured, and disappeared local residents. After the team left the area, locals discovered human remains buried outside the base, which they said belonged to 10 missing men who had been arrested by the Americans.

Not long afterward, a video surfaced of one of ODA 3124’s Afghan interpreters beating Sayid Mohammad, one of the disappeared ten. The interpreter, named Zikria, was later arrested in May 2013, by Afghanistan’s intelligence service. To date, the only public statement he’s given was when I visited him in September 2013 in Kabul’s notorious Pul-e-Charki prison. Though he was known under his nom de guerre, Zikria Kandahari, he told me his real name was Zikria Noorzai, which he had tattooed on his arm in green ink.

From the start, Zikria’s relationship to the US military has been a matter of contention and speculation. For example, the Times has repeated claims by Afghan officials that Zikria was an American citizen, that he and the other interpreters had used the cover of a mine-clearing charity, and that a CIA paramilitary unit was involved.

In fact, Zikria and two other interpreters who worked for ODA 3124 in Nerkh told me that they had been hired and paid directly by the Special Forces team. (A US military spokesperson told me that he was an “unpaid interpreter” who was not on contract at the time of the incidents.) All of them had served multiple times with the Special Forces, and Zikria said it was his third stint with ODA 3124, whose team sergeant knew him from previous deployments and had requested him this time. He also denied being a US citizen.

In our interview and in his statements to Afghan investigators, Zikria had refused responsibility for the killings, and instead blamed specific members of the Special Forces. He did admit to beating Sayid Mohammad. “A few days before my friend had been hurt by an IED so I got emotional, I started punching and kicking him,” he told me. “I brought him back to the base in my truck and the ODA said okay, you’re done.” He said he handed over Mohammad to the Green Berets, and that he later saw his corpse in a body bag. ""The way the killings happened showed that a single interpreter couldn’t have done them on his own.”

Regardless of Zikria’s culpability in the incidents—and multiple people told me they saw him torture and kill residents of Nerkh—he remains the only person who has been convicted in connection with the deaths and forced disappearances in Nerkh. Moreover, his case appears to have been handled by Afghan authorities in a way intended to deflect further investigation. According to both him and his lawyer, Zikria was convicted of treason—an ironic charge, given that he was working for the US Army—and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, a conviction that was upheld by Afghanistan’s Supreme Court in August 2014. According to a family member, Zikria was moved in recent months to the Parwan Detention Facility at Bagram Air Field, which was transferred fully to Afghan control in December 2014.

“The decisions were not fair, because the courts couldn’t provide any evidence to prove the involvement of Zikria in the killing,” Najla Raheel, his lawyer, said. “Even the [Afghan intelligence service] has said that the Americans were involved in the killing, because it was the Americans who commanded Zikria…. I think the way the killings happened showed that a single interpreter couldn’t have done them on his own.”

Who, then, is responsible for the Nerkh killings? In my 2013 story, which unearthed new eyewitness testimony and photographic evidence, I reviewed the allegations in detail, and drew the following conclusions. For nine out of 10 of the disappeared men, there was overwhelming evidence from witnesses—in many cases, an entire village in broad daylight—that they were initially taken by the US military. A number of locals also claimed to have experienced torture in custody and witnessed summary executions by the Special Forces and their translators. They identified specific individuals they said were responsible from photo arrays that I constructed, which used pictures from ODA 3124 team members and interpreters’ public Facebook profiles, mixed with photos of random Special Forces soldiers and Afghans pulled from Google Images.

Taken individually, the abuses they recount are so extreme as to be hard to believe, but in aggregate they form a consistent and credible pattern. This was also the conclusion of the UN and ICRC investigations into the killings, whose full findings were provided to the US military but never made public, though the UN summarized its findings in a July 2013 report. Similar allegations were also reported by Reuters and the Times.

In several instances, the individuals attempted to report their allegations to the US military. While I was in Nerkh in 2013, I learned of a man named Qandi who had been arrested by the Special Forces and was still being held at the main detention center in Bagram. Qandi was eventually released on October 12, 2013, and spoke to me about his experiences in an interview last week.

Though Qandi said he was around 55 years old, he looked much older. He used to ride a bicycle to work before his arrest, he said. Now he walked in halting, frail steps and had a tremor in his left hand. Qandi, who worked as a cashier at the Wardak office of the Ministry of Information and Culture, was arrested at his house in early November 2012 by US soldiers and their Afghan interpreters. He said was taken to the Special Forces base in Nerkh and held there for 45 days, where he was accused of working with the insurgents. He claimed he was tortured into making false confessions by American soldiers and their Afghan interpreters, including Zikria, and that they subjected him to beatings, shocks with a taser, mock drownings, as well as sexual abuse. “They kicked me in the testicles and then tied my penis with a plastic rope,” he said. “It was tied for eight days, and I was suffering very badly from pains in my belly and bladder.”

He also claimed to have witnessed Sayid Mohammad and other prisoners being beaten to death in the presence of American soldiers. “Only once, they took me to a tent for treatment,” he said. “When they took me there, they brought Sayid Mohammad there and they killed him in front of me by beating him, and when he died the soldiers pushed me to the ground onto his blood.” (On May 21, 2013, the Times reported that Sayed Mohammad’s body had been found buried outside the base.)

Qandi said that he and other prisoners were treated by an Afghan woman who spoke English with the American soldiers and seemed to be working for them. One day, he was cleaned up, given a fresh change of clothes, and then transferred to Bagram by helicopter. There, he was assigned detainee number 5794. He said he was given proper medical care and not abused, and told both his US interrogators in Bagram and the ICRC that he had been tortured and had witnessed murders by the Special Forces in Nerkh. ""They killed him in front of me by beating him; when he died the soldiers pushed me to the ground onto his blood.""

* * *

If allegations such as Qandi’s are true, how could a small unit like ODA 3124 have carried out such extensive crimes over an extended period without their superiors being aware, even as witnesses turned up in Bagram?

According to the US military, allegations of wrongdoing by the Special Forces in Nerkh were first reported up the chain of command in November 2012. As pressure from the Afghan government mounted over the following four months, the US military conducted three separate investigations into the allegations, all of which exonerated its soldiers of any wrongdoing. During this period, at least five individuals were detained by US forces in Nerkh and then subsequently disappeared.

The third investigation, carried out jointly with the Afghan government and completed in March 2013, was led by a senior officer, Brig. Gen. Michael L. Howard. I have since spoken to several US and Afghan officials who were familiar with the investigation and told me that Howard seemed more intent on clearing US soldiers than on getting to the bottom of the allegations. According to a senior Afghan officer at the Ministry of Defense who was privy to the investigation’s reports, the investigation team visited the Special Forces team in Nerkh, who flatly denied having any of the missing people in custody, or knowing anything about their fate—and the US military shifted blame onto Zikria, who had by then had fled the area, and would not be captured by Afghan intelligence for another two months. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!

At the time of Brig. Gen. Howard’s investigation, Qandi was in custody at Bagram prison, where he said he told US military interrogators about the torture he had suffered and murders he had witnessed in Nerkh. And during that same period, Zikria was still in touch with members of ODA 3124, according to his own admission and publicly viewable Facebook messages.

Yet, like the previous two investigations, Howard’s cleared the US military of any wrongdoing. “The inquiries found no reliable evidence to substantiate misconduct by ISAF or US forces relating to the detainees or reported deaths in Nerkh,” Col. Jane Crichton, a US military spokesperson, told me in October 2013.

How could three US military investigations have failed to find the evidence that was unearthed not only by reporters such as myself but by the UN and ICRC? At best, it represents staggering incompetence. At worse, it raises the possibility that US military officials may have deliberately suppressed or ignored information that would have led to a more timely criminal investigation.

In any case, on July 17, 2013, almost four months after ODA 3124 left Nerkh, the US commander in Afghanistan, General Joseph Dunford, notified the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command (CID) about new and “unresolved allegations” in the ICRC and UN reports, according to the military. This triggered a criminal investigation by the CID, one that would operate independently but whose findings would ultimately be forwarded to back to the military command for a decision about whether or not to prosecute.

The criminal investigation got off to a seemingly slow start. None of the witnesses that I interviewed prior to publishing my story in November 2013 had ever been contacted by the US military. According to a former UN official directly familiar with the CID investigation, it wasn’t until late December 2013 that military investigators began interviewing witnesses from Nerkh, via video calls conducted at a UN compound.

Those interviews were concluded in early 2014, the former UN official said. That August, the investigation was complete and “pending case review,” according to CID. “During the case review process, information and leads were identified that demand further investigation,” Christopher Grey, a CID spokesperson, said. He declined to comment on the specific reasons for reopening the investigation. “We are fully committed to investigating the allegations until we are confident that we have exhausted all leads and pertinent information before closing the investigation.”

* * * How could three US military investigations fail to find the evidence unearthed by reporters, the UN, and ICRC?

The constant shuffle of investigations casts doubt on whether justice will ever be done in the Nerkh killings, and is consistent with the US military’s terrible track record of investigating allegations of war crimes against its own members in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In August 2014, Amnesty International published a damning report on the US military justice system in Afghanistan. It investigated 10 cases where there was “credible evidence of unlawful killings of civilians” by international military operations—including the Nerkh incidents—that involved at least 140 civilian deaths, 50 of them children. None of the cases have led to prosecutions of US service members. In nine of them, none of the witnesses had been interviewed by military investigators.

Giving the lack of transparency and a fully independent prosecution in the US military justice system, it is perhaps not surprising when the military fails to hold itself to account. Pointing to the system’s “structural flaws,” Amnesty noted that:

“It is, in significant ways, a system of self-policing. Yet troops have scant incentive to report possible violations up the chain of command, and many reasons not to. Commanders, too, have little reason to push investigations forward, particularly in cases in which the commander’s own conduct or judgment might be called into question.”

The report also brings up the military’s struggle to stem sexual assault in its ranks, which raises a striking point: If the military’s justice system has failed American servicewomen who have been sexually assaulted—as has been amply documented in the press and by Congress—then what hope do Afghans have when they are the victims of war crimes?

“There is no sign of justice for us here in Afghanistan,” said Neamatullah, whose two brothers were arrested by US forces during the Amarkhel raid on November 20, 2012, and subsequently disappeared. Months later, he had identified human remains buried outside the base as his brothers’, based on their clothing. “You’re the ones who made Zikria what he was. He was nobody without you.”"

“The sovereign is he who decides on the exception,” said conservative thinker Carl Schmitt in 1922, meaning that a nation’s leader can defy the law to serve the greater good. Though Schmitt’s service as Nazi Germany’s chief jurist and his unwavering support for Hitler from the night of the long knives to Kristallnacht and beyond damaged his reputation for decades, today his ideas have achieved unimagined influence. They have, in fact, shaped the neo-conservative view of presidential power that has become broadly bipartisan since 9/11. Indeed, Schmitt has influenced American politics directly through his intellectual protégé Leo Strauss who, as an émigré professor at the University of Chicago, trained Bush administration architects of the Iraq war Paul Wolfowitz and Abram Shulsky.

All that should be impressive enough for a discredited, long dead authoritarian thinker. But Schmitt’s dictum also became a philosophical foundation for the exercise of American global power in the quarter century that followed the end of the Cold War. Washington, more than any other power, created the modern international community of laws and treaties, yet it now reserves the right to defy those same laws with impunity. A sovereign ruler should, said Schmitt, discard laws in times of national emergency. So the United States, as the planet’s last superpower or, in Schmitt’s terms, its global sovereign, has in these years repeatedly ignored international law, following instead its own unwritten rules of the road for the exercise of world power.

Just as Schmitt’s sovereign preferred to rule in a state of endless exception without a constitution for his Reich, so Washington is now well into the second decade of an endless War on Terror that seems the sum of its exceptions to international law: endless incarceration, extrajudicial killing, pervasive surveillance, drone strikes in defiance of national boundaries, torture on demand, and immunity for all of the above on the grounds of state secrecy. Yet these many American exceptions are just surface manifestations of the ever-expanding clandestine dimension of the American state. Created at the cost of more than a trillion dollars since 9/11, the purpose of this vast apparatus is to control a covert domain that is fast becoming the main arena for geopolitical contestation in the twenty-first century.

This should be (but seldom is considered) a jarring, disconcerting path for a country that, more than any other, nurtured the idea of, and wrote the rules for, an international community of nations governed by the rule of law. At the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899, the U.S. delegate, Andrew Dickson White, the founder of Cornell University, pushed for the creation of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and persuaded Andrew Carnegie to build the monumental Peace Palace at The Hague as its home. At the Second Hague Conference in 1907, Secretary of State Elihu Root urged that future international conflicts be resolved by a court of professional jurists, an idea realized when the Permanent Court of International Justice was established in 1920.

After World War II, the U.S. used its triumph to help create the United Nations, push for the adoption of its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and ratify the Geneva Conventions for humanitarian treatment in war. If you throw in other American-backed initiatives like the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, and the World Bank, you pretty much have the entire infrastructure of what we now casually call “the international community.”

Breaking the Rules

Not only did the U.S. play a crucial role in writing the new rules for that community, but it almost immediately began breaking them. After all, despite the rise of the other superpower, the Soviet Union, Washington was by then the world sovereign and so could decide which should be the exceptions to its own rules, particularly to the foundational principle for all this global governance: sovereignty. As it struggled to dominate the hundred new nations that started appearing right after the war, each one invested with an inviolable sovereignty, Washington needed a new means of projecting power beyond conventional diplomacy or military force. As a result, CIA covert operations became its way of intervening within a new world order where you couldn’t or at least shouldn’t intervene openly.

All of the exceptions that really matter spring from America’s decision to join what former spy John Le Carré called that “squalid procession of vain fools, traitors… sadists, and drunkards,” and embrace espionage in a big way after World War II. Until the creation of the CIA in 1947, the United States had been an innocent abroad in the world of intelligence. When General John J. Pershing led two million American troops to Europe during World War I, the U.S. had the only army on either side of the battle lines without an intelligence service. Even though Washington built a substantial security apparatus during that war, it was quickly scaled back by Republican conservatives during the 1920s. For decades, the impulse to cut or constrain such secret agencies remained robustly bipartisan, as when President Harry Truman abolished the CIA’s predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), right after World War II or when President Jimmy Carter fired 800 CIA covert operatives after the Vietnam War.

Yet by fits and starts, the covert domain inside the U.S. government has grown stealthily from the early twentieth century to this moment. It began with the formation of the FBI in 1908 and Military Intelligence in 1917. The Central Intelligence Agency followed after World War II along with most of the alphabet agencies that make up the present U.S. Intelligence Community, including the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and last but hardly least, in 2004, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Make no mistake: there is a clear correlation between state secrecy and the rule of law—as one grows, the other surely shrinks.

World Sovereign

America’s irrevocable entry into this covert netherworld came when President Truman deployed his new CIA to contain Soviet subversion in Europe. This was a continent then thick with spies of every stripe: failed fascists, aspirant communists, and everything in between. Introduced to spycraft by its British “cousins,” the CIA soon mastered it in part by establishing sub rosa ties to networks of ex-Nazi spies, Italian fascist operatives, and dozens of continental secret services.

As the world’s new sovereign, Washington used the CIA to enforce its chosen exceptions to the international rule of law, particularly to the core principle of sovereignty. During his two terms, President Dwight Eisenhowerauthorized 104 covert operations on four continents, focused largely on controlling the many new nations then emerging from centuries of colonialism. Eisenhower’s exceptions included blatant transgressions of national sovereignty such as turning northern Burma into an unwilling springboard for abortive invasions of China, arming regional revolts to partition Indonesia, and overthrowing elected governments in Guatemala and Iran. By the time Eisenhower left office in 1961, covert ops had acquired such a powerful mystique in Washington that President John F. Kennedy would authorize 163 of them in the three years that preceded his assassination.

As a senior CIA official posted to the Near East in the early 1950s put it, the Agency then saw every Muslim leader who was not pro-American as “a target legally authorized by statute for CIA political action.” Applied on a global scale and not just to Muslims, this policy helped produce a distinct “reverse wave” in the global trend towards democracy from 1958 to 1975, as coups—most of them U.S.-sanctioned—allowed military men to seize power in more than three-dozen nations, representing a quarter of the world’s sovereign states.

The White House’s “exceptions” also produced a deeply contradictory U.S. attitude toward torture from the early years of the Cold War onward. Publicly, Washington’s opposition to torture was manifest in its advocacy of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the Geneva Conventions in 1949. Simultaneously and secretly, however, the CIA began developing ingenious new torture techniques in contravention of those same international conventions. After a decade of mind-control research, the CIAactually codified its new method of psychological torture in a secret instructional handbook, the “KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation” manual, which it then disseminated within the U.S. Intelligence Community and to allied security services worldwide.

Much of the torture that became synonymous with the era of authoritarian rule in Asia and Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s seems to have originated in U.S. training programs that provided sophisticated techniques, up-to-date equipment, and moral legitimacy for the practice. From 1962 to 1974, the CIA worked through the Office of Public Safety (OPS), a division of the U.S. Agency for International Development that sent American police advisers to developing nations. Established by President Kennedy in 1962, in just six years OPS grew into a global anti-communist operation with over 400 U.S. police advisers. By 1971, it had trained more than a million policemen in 47 nations, including 85,000 in South Vietnam and 100,000 in Brazil.

Concealed within this larger OPS effort, CIA interrogation training became synonymous with serious human rights abuses, particularly in Iran, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Brazil, and Uruguay. Amnesty Internationaldocumented widespread torture, usually by local police, in 24 of the 49 nations that had hosted OPS police-training teams. In tracking torturers across the globe, Amnesty seemed to be following the trail of CIA training programs. Significantly, torture began to recede when America again turned resolutely against the practice at the end of the Cold War.

The War on Terror

Although the CIA’s authority for assassination, covert intervention, surveillance, and torture was curtailed at the close of the Cold War, the terror attacks of September 2001 sparked an unprecedented expansion in the scale of the intelligence community and a corresponding resurgence in executive exceptions. The War on Terror’s voracious appetite for information produced, in its first decade, what the Washington Post branded a veritable “fourth branch” of the U.S. federal government with 854,000 vetted security officials, 263 security organizations, over 3,000 private and public intelligence agencies, and 33 new security complexes—all pumping out a total of 50,000 classified intelligence reports annually by 2010.

By that time, one of the newest members of the Intelligence Community, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, already had 16,000 employees, a $5 billion budget, and a massive nearly $2 billion headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Maryland—all aimed at coordinating the flood of surveillance data pouring in from drones, U-2 spy planes, Google Earth, and orbiting satellites.

According to documents whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked to theWashington Post, the U.S. spent $500 billion on its intelligence agencies in the dozen years after the 9/11 attacks, including annual appropriations in 2012 of $11 billion for the National Security Agency (NSA) and $15 billion for the CIA. If we add the $790 billion expended on the Department of Homeland Security to that $500 billion for overseas intelligence, then Washington had spent nearly $1.3 trillion to build a secret state-within-the-state of absolutely unprecedented size and power.

As this secret state swelled, the world’s sovereign decided that some extraordinary exceptions to civil liberties at home and sovereignty abroad were in order. The most glaring came with the CIA’s now-notorious renewed use of torture on suspected terrorists and its setting up of its own global network of private prisons, or “black sites,” beyond the reach of any court or legal authority. Along with piracy and slavery, the abolition of torture had long been a signature issue when it came to the international rule of law. So strong was this principle that the U.N. General Assembly voted unanimously in 1984 to adopt the Convention Against Torture. When it came to ratifying it, however, Washington dithered on the subject until the end of the Cold War when it finally resumed its advocacy of international justice, participating in the World Conference on Human Rights at Vienna in 1993 and, a year later, ratifying the U.N. Convention Against Torture.

Even then, the sovereign decided to reserve some exceptions for his country alone. Only a year after President Bill Clinton signed the U.N. Convention, CIA agents started snatching terror suspects in the Balkans, some of them Egyptian nationals, and sending them to Cairo, where a torture-friendly autocracy could do whatever it wanted to them in its prisons. Former CIA director George Tenet later testified that, in the years before 9/11, the CIA shipped some 70 individuals to foreign countries without formal extradition—a process dubbed “extraordinary rendition” that had been explicitly banned under Article 3 of the U.N. Convention.

Right after his public address to a shaken nation on September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush gave his staff wide-ranging secret orders to use torture, adding (in a vernacular version of Schmitt’s dictum),“I don’t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.” In this spirit, the White House authorized the CIA to develop that global matrix of secret prisons, as well as an armada of planes for spiriting kidnapped terror suspects to them, and a network of allies who could help seize those suspects from sovereign states and levitate them into a supranational gulag of eight agency black sites from Thailand to Poland or into the crown jewel of the system, Guantánamo, thus eluding laws and treaties that remained grounded in territorially based concepts of sovereignty.

Once the CIA closed the black sites in 2008-2009, its collaborators in this global gulag began to feel the force of law for their crimes against humanity. Under pressure from the Council of Europe, Poland started an ongoing criminal investigation in 2008 into its security officers who had facilitated the CIA’s secret prison in the country’s northeast. In September 2012, Italy’s supreme court confirmed the convictions of 22 CIA agents for the illegal rendition of Egyptian exile Abu Omar from Milan to Cairo, and ordered a trial for Italy’s military intelligence chief on charges that sentenced him to 10 years in prison. In 2012, Scotland Yard opened a criminal investigation into MI6 agents who rendered Libyan dissidents to Colonel Gaddafi’s prisons for torture, and two years later the Court of Appeal allowed some of those Libyans to file a civil suit against MI6 for kidnapping and torture.

But not the CIA. Even after the Senate’s 2014 Torture Report documented the Agency’s abusive tortures in painstaking detail, there was no move for either criminal or civil sanctions against those who had ordered torture or those who had carried it out. In a strong editorial on December 21, 2014, the New York Times asked “whether the nation will stand by and allow the perpetrators of torture to have perpetual immunity.” The answer, of course, was yes.Immunity for hirelings is one of the sovereign’s most important exceptions.

As President Bush finished his second term in 2008, an inquiry by the International Commission of Jurists found that the CIA’s mobilization of allied security agencies worldwide had done serious damage to the international rule of law. “The executive… should under no circumstance invoke a situation of crisis to deprive victims of human rights violations… of their… access to justice,” the Commission recommended after documenting the degradation of civil liberties in some 40 countries. “State secrecy and similar restrictions must not impede the right to an effective remedy for human rights violations.”

The Bush years also brought Washington’s most blatant repudiation of the rule of law. Once the newly established International Criminal Court (ICC) convened at The Hague in 2002, the Bush White House “un-signed” or “de-signed” the U.N. agreement creating the court and then mounted a sustained diplomatic effort to immunize U.S. military operations from its writ. This was an extraordinary abdication for the nation that had breathed the concept of an international tribunal into being.

The Sovereign’s Unbounded Domains

While Presidents Eisenhower and Bush decided on exceptions that violated national boundaries and international treaties, President Obama is exercising his exceptional prerogatives in the unbounded domains of aerospace and cyberspace.

Both are new, unregulated realms of military conflict beyond the rubric of international law and Washington believes it can use them as Archimedean levers for global dominion. Just as Britain once ruled from the seas and postwar America exercised its global reach via airpower, so Washington now sees aerospace and cyberspace as special realms for domination in the twenty-first century.

Under Obama, drones have grown from a tactical Band-Aid in Afghanistan into a strategic weapon for the exercise of global power. From 2009 to 2015, the CIA and the U.S. Air Force deployed a drone armada of over 200 Predators and Reapers, launching 413 strikes in Pakistan alone, killing as many as 3,800 people. Every Tuesday inside the White House Situation Room, as the New York Times reported in 2012, President Obama reviews a CIA drone “kill list” and stares at the faces of those who are targeted for possible assassination from the air. He then decides, without any legal procedure, who will live and who will die, even in the case of American citizens. Unlike other world leaders, this sovereign applies the ultimate exception across the Greater Middle East, parts of Africa, and elsewhere if he chooses.

This lethal success is the cutting edge of a top-secret Pentagon project that will, by 2020, deploy a triple-canopy space “shield” from stratosphere to exosphere, patrolled by Global Hawk and X-37B drones armed with agile missiles.

As Washington seeks to police a restless globe from sky and space, the world might well ask: How high is any nation’s sovereignty? After the successive failures of the Paris flight conference of 1910, the Hague Rules of Aerial Warfare of 1923, and Geneva’s Protocol I of 1977 to establish the extent of sovereign airspace or restrain aerial warfare, some puckish Pentagon lawyer might reply: only as high as you can enforce it.

President Obama has also adopted the NSA’s vast surveillance system as a permanent weapon for the exercise of global power. At the broadest level, such surveillance complements Obama’s overall defense strategy, announced in 2012, of cutting conventional forces while preserving U.S. global power through a capacity for “a combined arms campaign across all domains: land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace.” In addition, it should be no surprise that, having pioneered the war-making possibilities of cyberspace, the president did not hesitate to launch the first cyberwar in history against Iran.

By the end of Obama’s first term, the NSA could sweep up billions of messages worldwide through its agile surveillance architecture. This included hundreds of access points for penetration of the Worldwide Web’s fiber optic cables; ancillary intercepts through special protocols and “backdoor” software flaws; supercomputers to crack the encryption of this digital torrent; and a massive data farm in Bluffdale, Utah, built at a cost of $2 billion to store yottabytes of purloined data.

Even after angry Silicon Valley executives protested that the NSA’s “backdoor” software surveillance threatened their multi-trillion-dollar industry, Obama called the combination of Internet information and supercomputers “a powerful tool.” He insisted that, as “the world’s only superpower,” the United States “cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies.” In other words, the sovereign cannot sanction any exceptions to his panoply of exceptions.

Revelations from Edward Snowden’s cache of leaked documents in late 2013 indicate that the NSA has conducted surveillance of leaders in some 122 nations worldwide, 35 of them closely, including Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, former Mexican president Felipe Calderón, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After her forceful protest, Obama agreed to exempt Merkel’s phone from future NSA surveillance, but reserved the right, as he put it, to continue to “gather information about the intentions of governments… around the world.” The sovereign declined to say which world leaders might be exempted from his omniscient gaze.

Can there be any question that, in the decades to come, Washington will continue to violate national sovereignty through old-style covert as well as open interventions, even as it insists on rejecting any international conventions that restrain its use of aerospace or cyberspace for unchecked force projection, anywhere, anytime? Extant laws or conventions that in any way check this power will be violated when the sovereign so decides. These are now the unwritten rules of the road for our planet. They represent the real American exceptionalism."

I remember very clearly the first rape victim I ever met. It was in the autumn of 1992 in a small town near Zagreb. She was a Muslim from Kozarac, in Bosnia. After a few months in a detention camp, she came with a group of refugees to Zagreb. Selma (not her real name) was in her mid-thirties, with short brown hair and a blue eyes. Ad Policy

She told me her story in a low voice, almost in a whisper. She was in her house with her two children and her mother when a group of Serbian paramilitary soldiers entered her yard. They said they were looking for arms, but there were no arms in her house. They were after something else.

Angrily, one man grabbed her and pushed her in her bedroom. Then the others joined him, too. “Then they did it to me.” Selma simply said, looking down at her hands, ” I could not face my children for a long while afterwards…. I was washing and washing and washing, but their smell did not go away. Imagine, they did it to me in my own marital bed,” she said.

I detected a trace of despair in her words. She did not cry, not any longer. But she felt ashamed and the shame stayed with her; she had to learn to live with it, as did her husband.

On June 20, the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution classifying rape as a weapon of war. Human rights groups hailed the vote as historic, but it is no legal remedy. Though raped women were recently legally recognized as victims of war in parts of the Bosnian federation that protection does not extend to Republika Srpska.

While working on my book, They Would Never Hurt a Fly, about Balkan war criminals on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia in The Hague, I came across the “Foca case.” In 1992, Dragoljub Kunarac, Radomir Kovac and Zoran Vukovic, three Serbs in the Bosnian city of Foca, imprisoned young Muslim girls, tortured them, kept them as sexual slaves and raped them. But the men did not really understand why they were being tried.

One of them defended himself by saying: “But I could have killed them!” From his own prospective, he actually saved their lives. Rape? What kind of crime this is compared with killing people?

This case is important because on February 22, 2001, Florence Mumbal the International Criminal Tribunal judge from Zambia, found them guilty. The three were the first men in European legal history to be sentenced for crimes against humanity–torture, slavery, outrages upon human dignity and the mass rape of the Bosnian Muslim women.

This sentence recognized that sexual violence is an extremely effective weapon of ethnic cleansing. It not only shames violated women, but also humiliates their men, who cannot protect them. Sexual violence destroys the whole community because the stigma stays with them, not forgotten, not forgiven.

At the trial of the three defendants in the Foca case, was one particular witness, the mother of a 12-year-old girl taken prisoner by Radomir Kovac, who raped her and then sold her to a Montenegrin soldier for 100 euros. The girl was never seen again. Her mother came to confront the perpetrator and to witness against him. But when she took the stand, no words came out of her. Just a sound, the unbearable howl of a mortally wounded dog.

The UN Security Council resolution on rape will not bring this woman’s daughter back. But it is nonetheless historic because, finally, sexual violence is recognized as a weapon, and can be punished. No longer can a man defend himself by saying that he could have killed a women he had “only” raped. We know now, as we knew even before the passage of this resolution, that rape is a kind of slow murder."

Before “Bikini” became the name of a piece of female attire, it was the name of an atoll, part of the 1,156 islands and islets making up what is now the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). In 2010, at RMI’s request, Bikini was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List because of its historic importance as the site of twenty-three nuclear tests conducted by the United States between 1946 and 1958. There were sixty-seven US tests in the Marshall Islands altogether. Ad Policy

Now RMI has invoked the aid of another UN agency: the International Court of Justice in The Hague (not to be confused with the International Criminal Court). Last April, in an extraordinary and commendable act of chutzpah, RMI sued all nine states currently possessing nuclear weapons—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, France, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea—accusing them of violating their duty to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of those horrific weapons.

The theory of the case is based on three distinct but overlapping principles. Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, each party “undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.” The 1996 advisory opinion of the ICJ in the nuclear weapons case asserted that “there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.” The addition of the words “and bring to a conclusion” was important and made clear that just negotiating, without reaching a specific objective, was not enough. Customary international law also supports the legal obligation to eliminate nuclear weapons.

In some ways the NPT obligation, being treaty based, is the strongest arrow in RMI’s bow. But there is a small problem: four of the accused states (India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea) are not members of the NPT. The obligation proclaimed by the ICJ and that flowing from customary international law are applicable to every country in the world. But there is another problem: of the nine accused states, only three—India, Pakistan and the UK—are subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ. (The United States, which was a great promoter of the ICJ in its early years, renounced compulsory jurisdiction in 1985 while the case involving military and paramilitary operations against Nicaragua was pending).

RMI has asked the other six states to submit voluntarily to the court’s jurisdiction, but it remains to be seen whether any of them will do so. In the three cases actually pending, India and Pakistan have advised the court that they intend to file objections, and the UK is expected to follow suit. At this point it is not known exactly what the objections are or will be, but it stands to reason that the court will have to be satisfied that there is a genuine legal dispute between the plaintiff state and the defendants in order to proceed. In this respect RMI can argue that, as a member of the international community, it has the right and duty to enforce an obligation of fundamental and universal importance. It can also argue that, given the planetary consequences of a nuclear war, it can be adversely affected by such a war, no matter where it takes place.

The latter argument is not as farfetched as it may seem. Last December, the government of Austria sponsored the third of three conferences in two years on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. Each was attended by about 125 to 150 governments and was largely ignored by the mainstream media. The Summary of Findings of the Vienna Conference included the following paragraph:

The impact of a nuclear weapon detonation, irrespective of the cause, would not be constrained by national borders and could have regional and even global consequences, causing destruction, death and displacement as well as profound and long-term damage to the environment, climate, human health and well-being, socioeconomic development, social order and could even threaten the survival of humankind.

RMI is represented at the ICJ by Tony deBrum, the country’s foreign minister, and Phon van den Biesen, a Dutch lawyer experienced in ICJ litigation. They are backed by a team of international law experts who are taking the cases very seriously. A substantial number of civil society organizations are supporting the cases, including the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy in New York and the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation in Santa Barbara.

One effect of the RMI initiative is to throw a spotlight on the policies of the nuclear weapons states, which claim to be committed to a nuclear weapons–free world while showing not the slightest willingness to reach that goal. Reduction, which can go on forever, is fundamentally different from elimination, which reaches an end point. The legal obligation to conclude negotiations for complete nuclear disarmament is not met by shrinking a nation’s nuclear arsenal from 600 to 300 weapons, as France has done, nor by the agreement between the United States and Russia to reduce the stockpile of deployed long-range nuclear warheads each to 1,550 by 2018, as was done in the New START Treaty negotiated in 2010. One might add that the deterioration of relations between these two countries has made further reductions unlikely for the foreseeable future—not to mention the fact that, according to a projection by the Monterey Institute, the United States plans to spend about $1 trillion over the next three decades to modernize its nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles.

The Marshall Islands initiative may be a long shot, but it is not a fool’s errand. It is a cri de coeur by a people who, like the hibakusha of Japan, have experienced the barbarism of nuclear weapons on their own bodies and their own lands. It comes at a time when the members of the NPT, at the upcoming quinquennial review conference, may at long last decide to take concrete measures toward nuclear disarmament, or face the possibility of seeing the treaty disintegrate. Many civil society organizations will do their utmost to bring about the former. It also comes at a time when too many policy-makers, having lived so long with nuclear weapons, are beginning to regard them as just another kind of weapon, instead of the uniquely atrocious one that it is. To them, the Marshall Islanders are saying what the nuclear scientist Joseph Rotblat said to whoever was willing to listen when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995: “Remember your humanity.”

Obama’s Prague vision of a nuclear weapons–free world has faded. It’s time to endorse Tony deBrum’s.

Yesterday, Gary Samore, president of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), published a column on the website of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), arguing that even if talks between the P5+1 and Iran collapse, “Iran’s ability to produce nuclear weapons in the near term is severely constrained by political and technical factors.” Ad Policy

But Samore seems not to have contacted his office with that sensible sounding message. “It’s time to come down like a ton of bricks on this regime,” Gabriel Pedreira, communications director of UANI, told The Algemeiner, a US Jewish news outlet, on the same day. “We want an economic blockade if real change doesn’t come about. We haven’t seen a single concession from the Iranians, nor has even one centrifuge been destroyed,” said Pedreira.

That’s not what Samore, Pedreira’s boss, wrote. “Despite the impasse over the scale and scope of Iran’s enrichment program, the negotiators have made progress on several other issues, such as converting the Fordow enrichment facility to a research and development facility and converting the Arak heavy water research reactor to produce less plutonium,” said Samore.

And as for Pedreira’s argument that an “economic blockade” would be helpful? Samore acknowledged that a new interim agreement, presumably to be considered if the P5+1 and Iran are unable to meet the November 24 deadline for a comprehensive agreement, would be “resisted by some in Iran” if it is perceived that “it gives away too much nuclear capability without getting enough sanctions relief in return.”

In other words, an “economic blockade,” as Pedreira puts it, would give Iran’s hardliners ammunition to oppose a new interim agreement, which might be exactly what UANI wants.

The organization expressed “disappointment” with the November 2013 Joint Plan of Action, complaining that the agreement “provides disproportionate sanctions relief to Iran,” and has consistently opposed rollback of sanctions as part of an interim deal.

Indeed, both Mark Wallace, UANI’s CEO, and UANI’s mysterious benefactor, billionaire Thomas Kaplan, have expressed more hardline views than Samore, who served in the Obama administration as the president’s Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction until last year.

But the divergence between Samore’s column, in which he is ID’d with his Belfer Center affiliation instead of UANI, and UANI’s contradictory statements the same day, raises questions about how much leadership Samore is offering to the organization and whether his role is more than purely ceremonial. Either way, Samore should probably phone his (UANI) office."

In 1934, the National Rifle Association’s lobbyist testified in front of the House Ways and Means Committee about President Franklin Roosevelt’s National Firearms Act. “I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons,” the lobbyist said. “I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.”

The NRA testified, under oath, in favor of the nation’s first federal gun control bill.

Eighty years later, the organization believes not only in “the general practice of carrying weapons” but also, as Ronald Reagan once wrote, that the Second Amendment “appears to leave little if any leeway for the gun control advocate.”

The NRA’s dramatic turnabout, and its decades-long campaign to change American hearts, minds and gun laws, is the subject of Michael Waldman’s compelling new book, The Second Amendment: A Biography. Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Law and Justice at the New York University School of Law, explains that the authors of the Second Amendment never intended to create an “unregulated individual right to a gun” and explores why, today, we think they did. Published three days before the rampage in Isla Vista, California, that killed six and wounded thirteen, the book shows how we got to this moment of routine gun violence—and offers a way out.

After George W. Bush’s tough talk about the “axis of evil” unnerved allies–and forced the Administration to dispense assurances it was not about to go halfcocked after Iran, Iraq and North Korea–the White House has once again supplied the international community reason for the jitters, thanks to its new Nuclear Posture Review. The classified report, first revealed by The Los Angeles Times and then front-paged by The New York Times, is the Pentagon’s master plan for developing and deploying nuclear weapons. The document, which lists contingencies in which nuclear arms might be used, notes that the United States might have to resort to nuclear weapons during “an Iraqi attack on Israel, or its neighbors, or a North Korean attack on South Korea or a military confrontation over the status of Taiwan.” (The latter, of course, would be a confrontation with China.) The report also states, “Iran, Syria and Libya are among the countries that could be involved in immediate, potential or unexpected contingencies” that would require “nuclear strike capabilities,” and it states that the United States could launch a nuclear assault to destroy stocks of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological and chemical arms.

The report certainly will not bolster Bush’s image abroad, for it will cause people to wonder if–shades of Ronald Reagan!–this administration is planning for winnable nuclear wars against nations that do not possess nuclear weapons. This leak will also probably cause headaches for Vice President Dick Cheney when he travels to the Middle East this week. He’ll want to talk war on terrorism, and the heads of state might be more interested in his ideas about targeting nuclear weapons in their neighborhood. The report is also the latest step in what seems to be a Bush administration campaign to undermine a key foundation of the international nuclear nonproliferation order.

The prospect of using–or preparing to use–nuclear weapons against nations that do not possess them has long been a delicate matter. Nobody expects the Pentagon not to plan for the horrific possibility of nuclear war with another nuclear-armed state. But since 1978 the United States has tried to reassure the world that (more or less) it would not launch nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear-weapon nation. The point of this declaration was to encourage non-nuclear states to sign and abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Washington would have a difficult time pressing other nations to forego nuclear weapons, if it reserved the right to blast these countries with its own nuclear arsenal.

This US position–known as “negative security assurances” in arms-control parlance–came with loopholes. Here’s how Secretary of State Warren Christopher described it in 1995: the United States “will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons except in case of an invasion or any other attack on the United States, its territories, its armed forces or other troops, its allies, or on a state towards which it has a security commitment, carried out or sustained by such a non-nuclear-weapon state in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon state.” That is, if a non-nuclear state that has signed the NPT finds itself in an armed conflict with the United States on its own (without being in league with a nuclear-weapon state), then the United States could not hurl nuclear bombs at it.

Now for the rub: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and North Korea have each signed the NPT. Which means that in a mano-a-mano war against, say, Iraq, U.S. war-managers could not go nuclear.

This policy restriction has been a sore point for conservatives for years. Several weeks before the Nuclear Posture Review earned headlines, John Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, took a significant, but little-noticed, swipe at negative security assurances. In an interview with Arms Control Today magazine, Bolton, for years a right-wing opponent of many arms treaties, was asked if Warren Christopher’s 1995 statement remained the policy of the Bush administration. Bolton replied, “I don’t think we’re of the view that this kind of approach is necessarily the most productive.” He noted that the administration’s emphasis was not “on the rhetorical” but on “the actual change in our military posture,” which would be “embodied in the outcome of the Nuclear Posture Review.”

The interviewers from Arms Control Today pressed him, asking, “So, right now, the Bush administration would not make a commitment to non-nuclear-weapon states…that it would not use nuclear weapons?” Bolton answered: “I don’t think we have any intention of using nuclear weapons in circumstances that I can foresee in the days ahead of us. The point is that the kind of rhetorical approach that you are describing doesn’t seem to me to be terribly helpful in analyzing what our security needs may be in the real world, and what we are doing, instead of chit-chatting is making changes in our force structures.” (Making changes? You bet.)

In his responses, Bolton did not acknowledge the role of negative security assurances in the NPT process. It was as if he believed such statements were nothing more than conversational niceties. Which might be true from the perspective of other nations. But if these nations are going to be encouraged by such statements from Washington, then these declarations have great value.

Bolton is the Bush administration’s key person–its soul–on arms control issues, and his remarks seemed to mark an abrupt turn-about in a long-standing policy on a highly sensitive topic. But the administration tried to dance its way out of the corner. Shortly after the interview, during the daily briefing of State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, a reporter asked Boucher to explain Bolton’s comments and wondered, “Are you now prepared to nuke un-nuked countries?” Boucher claimed “Bolton was reiterating…a policy that the United States government has had since the 1970s.” This was exactly wrong. Bolton had dismissed that policy. Then Boucher repeated the statement that Christopher had issued in 1995. So policy reversed was unreversed.

But maybe not. Boucher added a caveat, noting that the U.S. “will do whatever is necessary to deter the use of weapons of mass destruction against the United States, its allies, and its interests.” He asserted that “those kind of statements have been made repeatedly since the 1970s,” and he quoted a 1996 remark from then-Defense Secretary William Perry, who said that if the United States was attacked by chemical weapons, “we could have a devastating response without the use of nuclear weapons, but we would not forswear that possibility.”

In covering for Bolton and claiming nothing had changed, Boucher appeared to have stretched the weapons-of-mass-destruction loophole. He was not only saying, as Perry did, that nuclear weapons could be used in retaliation after a chemical weapons attack against the United States; he was warning that nuclear arms might be used preemptively to prevent such an attack. And that is indeed the policy contained in the new Nuclear Posture Review. If the United States has (or says it has) reason to believe a non-nuclear-weapon state is amassing biological weapons for use against the United States, then that country qualifies for the nuclear hit list.

Bolton, despite Boucher’s spin, was indeed speaking for an administration that does not see merit in declaring we-won’t-nuke-the-un-nuked in order to enhance nonproliferation efforts. As Bush’s disregard of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty demonstrated, this crowd is drawn more to unilateral force decisions than to multilateral nonproliferation endeavors. The more worrisome portions of the Nuclear Posture review may only be what-ifs. But in nuclear diplomacy, what-ifs and words do count. The Bush administration’s new weapon plan is a shot against the nations he has rhetorically targeted but also a strike against governments and diplomats that take nuclear nonproliferation seriously."

In Oslo on December 10, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) and was accepted on behalf of the Campaign by its executive director, Beatrice Fihn, and by Setsuko Thurlow, an ICAN campaigner and survivor of the 1945 Hiroshima bombing. Both spoke for the thousands of campaigners in over 400 organizations and more than 100 countries around the world who succeeded this fall in working with friendly governments to move a majority of states at the United Nations to adopt a treaty to prohibit to ban nuclear weapons, making their possession, use, or threat of use unlawful. Ad Policy

The ceremony opened with a piercing fanfare by four trumpeters, their horns hung with crimson banners, from a stone balcony high up in the sunlit-filled, mosaic-covered Oslo City Hall over a distinguished crowd below that included a former Peace Prize laureate; ambassadors and other government officials, including the prime minister of Norway and the mayor of Hiroshima; movie stars and rock stars; as well as several hundred grassroots ICAN campaigners from every corner of the globe. As the trumpets sounded, the king and queen of Norway and the crown prince and princess strode down the red-carpeted aisle, followed by members of the Nobel Committee and the two ICAN speakers.

It has been just 10 years since ICAN first launched its astonishing campaign to ban nuclear weapons, just as chemical and biological weapons have been banned as well as land mines and cluster bombs. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has now closed a legal gap in the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that only requires “good faith efforts for nuclear disarmament” by the then-five existing nuclear weapons states—the United States, Russia, UK, France, China. ICAN organized a series of three major conferences in Norway, Mexico, and Austria together with government leaders, scientists, lawyers, and other experts, including representatives from the International Red Cross, a critical actor in this journey to ban the bomb. It was the International Red Cross who contributed a unique statement about the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons in 2000 that changed the global conversation about these devastating instruments of mass destruction.

Instead of nuclear weapons’ being described in abstract terms, with references to strategic security needs and deterrence policies, a conversation dominated by the nuclear-weapons states and by US nuclear allies in NATO, as well as Japan, Australia, and South Korea (none of whom support the new treaty), there has been a shift in how nuclear weapons are discussed. There is a a growing realization that these military and security concepts fail to acknowledge the catastrophic humanitarian consequences that would result from any use of a nuclear weapon. The new conversation was given a great boost by the Vatican, which participated in the UN negotiations and held a subsequent nuclear-disarmament conference this month to discuss its newly announced policy change from one that supported the concept of “deterrence” for the use of nuclear weapons in “self-defense” to a new policy declaring that nuclear weapons must never be used under any circumstances.

Despite the nearly 50-year-old NPT promise by the nuclear-weapons states for nuclear disarmament, ICAN Executive Director Fihn, in her acceptance speech, reminded us that “at dozens of locations around the world—in missile silos buried in our earth, on submarines navigating through our oceans, and aboard planes flying high in our sky—lie 15,000 objects of humankind’s destruction,” adding that “it is insanity to allow ourselves to be ruled by these weapons.”

Fihn went on to note that critics of ICAN’s success in closing the legal gap in the NPT with the new ban treaty describe its campaigners as “the irrational ones, idealists with no grounding in reality. That the nuclear-armed states will never give up their weapons.”

But we represent the only rational choice. We represent those who refuse to accept nuclear weapons as a fixture in our world, those who refuse to have their fates bound up in a few lines of launch code. Ours is the only reality that is possible. The alternative is unthinkable. The story of nuclear weapons will have an ending, and it is up to us what that ending will be. Will it be the end of nuclear weapons, or will it be the end of us? One of these things will happen. The only rational course of action is to cease living under the conditions where our mutual destruction is only one impulsive tantrum away. Current Issue View our current issue

Fihn also exclaimed, to enthusiastic applause, “Man—not woman!—made nuclear weapons to control others, but instead we are controlled.”

They made us false promises. That by making the consequences of using these weapons so unthinkable it would make any conflict unpalatable. That it would keep us free from war. But far from preventing war, these weapons brought us to the brink multiple times throughout the Cold War. And in this century, these weapons continue to escalate us towards war and conflict. In Iraq, in Iran, in Kashmir, in North Korea. Their existence propels others to join the nuclear race. They don’t keep us safe, they cause conflict…. But they are just weapons. They are just tools. And just as they were created by geopolitical context, they can just as easily be destroyed by placing them in a humanitarian context. That is the task ICAN has set.

Fihn called on all nations and each of the nine nuclear weapons states individually to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, saying,

The United States, choose freedom over fear.

Russia, choose disarmament over destruction.

Britain, choose the rule of law over oppression.

France, choose human rights over terror.

China, choose reason over irrationality.

India, choose sense over senselessness.

Pakistan, choose logic over Armageddon.

Israel, choose common sense over obliteration.

North Korea, choose wisdom over ruin.

She also asked the nations “who believe they are sheltered under the umbrella of nuclear weapons, will you be complicit in your own destruction and the destruction of others in your name?” And she called on all citizens to “Stand with us and demand your government side with humanity and sign this treaty,” noting that “no nations today boast of being a chemical weapons states” or “argue that it is acceptable, in extreme circumstances, to use sarin nerve agent” or “to unleash on its enemy the plague or polio. That is because international norms have been set, perceptions have been changed. And now, at last, we have an unequivocal norm against nuclear weapons.”

Setsuko Thurlow, an ICAN campaigner who survived the bombing of Hiroshima as a 13-year-old, spoke next, bearing witness to the excruciating pain and terror she saw all around her as she escaped from the rubble she was buried under in the bomb’s aftermath, where so many of her schoolmates died and where so many of her family were lost as well. She reminded us that “in the weeks, months and years that followed, many thousands more would die, often in random and mysterious ways, from the delayed effects of radiation to this day, radiation is killing survivors.”

She acknowledged the suffering and willingness to bear witness not only of the Hibakusha, as Japanese refer to the survivors of the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also of others who suffered from the nuclear age, including peoples “whose lands and seas were irradiated, whose bodies were experimented upon, whose cultures were forever disrupted” in places with “long-forgotten names” like Mururoa, Ekker, Semipalatinsk, Maralinga, Bikini.

Through our agony and the sheer struggle to survive—and to rebuild our lives from the ashes—we hibakusha became convinced that we must warn the world about these apocalyptic weapons. Time and again, we shared our testimonies. But still some refused to see Hiroshima and Nagasaki as atrocities—as war crimes. They accepted the propaganda that these were “good bombs” that had ended a “just war.” It was this myth that led to the disastrous nuclear-arms race—a race that continues to this day. Nine nations still threaten to incinerate entire cities, to destroy life on earth, to make our beautiful world uninhabitable for future generations. The development of nuclear weapons signifies not a country’s elevation to greatness but its descent to the darkest depths of depravity. These weapons are not a necessary evil; they are the ultimate evil.

Thurlow went on to say:

On the seventh of July this year, I was overwhelmed with joy when a great majority of the world’s nations voted to adopt the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Having witnessed humanity at its worst, I witnessed, that day, humanity at its best. We hibakusha had been waiting for the ban for seventy-two years. Let this be the beginning of the end of nuclear weapons. All responsible leaders will sign this treaty. And history will judge harshly those who reject it. No longer shall their abstract theories mask the genocidal reality of their practices. No longer shall “deterrence” be viewed as anything but a deterrent to disarmament. No longer shall we live under a mushroom cloud of fear. To the officials of nuclear-armed nations—and to their accomplices under the so-called “nuclear umbrella”—I say this: Listen to our testimony. Heed our warning. And know that your actions are consequential. You are each an integral part of a system of violence that is endangering humankind. Let us all be alert to the banality of evil.

Both speakers received standing ovations for their moving addresses and calls to action, and, with a room filled with hundreds of grassroots campaigners, the thunderous applause for the speakers was noted to be highly unusual for a Nobel award ceremony. The legal requirement for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to enter into force and to be binding on its signatories is that it must be ratified by 50 nations. To date, 56 countries have signed the treaty and four nations have ratified it in their legislatures.

There is a Parliamentary Pledge there that you can use to enroll your member of Congress or Parliament in calling for your nation to support the ban treaty. In the nuclear-weapons states and in the US nuclear alliance with NATO states and Australia, South Korea, and Japan in the Pacific—the “nuclear umbrella” states—grassroots efforts are under way to begin the stigmatization of their nuclear weapons and policies with a divestment campaign from nuclear-weapons manufacturers, since the treaty prohibits any “assistance” for nuclear weapons.

There have been demonstrations in Buchel, Germany, where activists have read the new treaty aloud to military personnel at a military base where US nuclear weapons are kept. Four other NATO countries also have US nuclear weapons on their bases—Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Turkey. This activity is banned under the treaty’s prohibition on any “possession” of nuclear weapons. See the new treaty here."

On Saturday morning, people in Hawaii awoke to emergency alerts on their phones. ballistic missile threat inbound to hawaii. seek immediate shelter. this is not a drill. Ad Policy

There was no incoming missile. But it took the authorities 38 minutes to send another message alerting people that it was a false alarm. Before that, people were relying on Twitter for information. Some hid in their bathrooms, some went to public spaces, others just huddled where they were. Families called each other to say goodbye.

Those 38 minutes of terror reflect only a tiny fraction of the emotional trauma caused by nuclear weapons. These weapons have a legacy of anguish, pain, and suffering. From the horror experienced by the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, to the torment of those whose lands and waters nuclear weapons were tested upon in the ensuing decades, to the fear of the entire world held in the grip of possible nuclear annihilation, these weapons have scarred our global community. They will scar us further if we allow this situation to continue—until they kill us.

The sentiment expressed by many Hawaiians in the days following was that they had no idea where to go or what to do. They were not prepared for nuclear war. How could they be? There really is no way to prepare for a nuclear blast, nor for the radioactive fallout. Shelters, iodine pills, or duck-and-cover routines can only get you so far. If multiple nuclear weapons are exchanged, all of the preparation could can dream of would not be sufficient.

We are also not emotionally prepared. From the 1950s to the ’80s, the threat of nuclear war was part of our cultural experience. Films, books, and television programs exposed the risks and the possible consequences of the nuclear arms race. Activism against the bomb was at an all-time high: In 1982, 1 million people marched in Central Park to demand nuclear disarmament. Today, most people rarely think about nuclear weapons. With “fire and fury” back in the headlines, this may be changing, but we are still largely in collective denial about the risks.

We have been taught that these weapons are not meant to be used. We are taught that they protect us from conflict, war, and further nuclear proliferation. This lethal myth is based on the premise that in order to maintain international peace and security, we need certain countries to wield the capacity to slaughter civilians, incinerate cities, and destroy the entire planet. We believe that nuclear war will never happen, that nuclear weapons prevent it.

But many of us—including the majority of the world’s governments—understand that the only way to prevent nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons. The alert in Hawaii could have prompted a nuclear war. So could a tweet from a president with a bruised ego. And so could any number of things. As then–UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in 2013, “There are no right hands for wrong weapons.” Current Issue View our current issue

It is in this spirit that 122 governments voted to adopt a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons on July 7, 2017. While the nuclear-armed states currently oppose it, this treaty offers an alternative to nuclear war.

It prohibits the use, threat of use, and possession of nuclear weapons, and sets out a process by which states with such weapons can join and eliminate their arsenals. Significantly, it recognizes that any use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to international humanitarian law. It puts nuclear weapons on the same legal footing as the other weapons of mass destruction (biological and chemical). The treaty makes no attempt to justify the possession or use of these weapons and makes no arguments in favor of deterrence doctrines. Nuclear weapons have been granted an exception for far too long. The 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was supposed to lead to disarmament: The nuclear-armed states agreed to eliminate their arsenals in exchange for the rest of the world agreeing never to develop them. But while proliferation has been limited, the nuclear-armed have failed to deliver on their disarmament commitments. Some have reduced the size of their arsenals only to invest billions of dollars into modernizing them. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons takes a new approach: outlawing these weapons for everyone, under all circumstances.

What happened in Hawaii should spur us to action to eliminate this threat once and for all. We must not wait for a real incoming missile to blast apart a beloved city, to incinerate our—or anyone else’s—families and friends. We should use this moment as a wake-up call.

Disarmament will not be easy. But what is more of a hassle: engaging in the work of eliminating nuclear weapons, or losing entire cities, continents, the planet?"

Throughout history, war has brought death not only in battle but also from starvation and disease. In pre-industrial conflicts, marching armies trampled crops, seized food supplies, pressed young farmhands into military service and starved out cities under siege. Large groups of soldiers, traveling over great distances and living together cheek-by-jowl in makeshift and unhygienic conditions, spread epidemics, causing further suffering. In the Thirty Years’ War, from 1618 to 1648, up to a third of the population of Germany is estimated to have died from this deadly combination of causes. World War I was the first international conflict in which more troops were killed by enemy action than by disease. In the same conflict, more than half a million Germans died from malnutrition as a result of an Allied blockade of Germany’s overseas food supplies. Epidemics have rarely been a weapon of war, one reason being that they have a habit of spreading without regard to which side their victims are fighting for. But starving out the enemy always has. Ad Policy World War II and the Battle for Food. By Lizzie Collingham. Penguin Press. 634 pp. $36. Food Fights by Richard J. Evans

The combatant nations of World War I learned through logistical error and terrible suffering the importance of securing adequate food supplies in a prolonged armed conflict. Not least as a result of this experience, as Lizzie Collingham shows in her superb new study The Taste of War, these same nations went to considerable lengths to keep their armies and civilian populations alive and well fed during World War II. For Germany and in particular its leader, Adolf Hitler, the memory of mass malnutrition and starvation during the earlier conflict was an ever-present trauma. From early in his political life, Hitler wanted to conquer “living-space” for Germany in Eastern Europe and draw on the huge grain resources of Ukraine to feed the German armed forces. The Nazis had no intention of repeating the mistake of World War I, when rationing was introduced too late to save the situation. Indeed, although Collingham claims that rationing was introduced in Germany in August 1939, it had already been in place for two years before that. Already by the mid-1930s, military and arms industry conscription, the requisitioning of huge tracts of agricultural land for military purposes and the imposition of foreign exchange controls to curb food imports had led to a dramatic fall in food pro-

duction and a concomitant rise in food prices. In 1936 prices were frozen, and on January 1, 1937, rationing was introduced for butter, margarine and fat; consumption of coffee and citrus fruit was restricted early in 1939. The German economy was on a war footing long before the war began.

Hitler managed to keep people at home in Germany reasonably well fed until the later stages of the war. Collingham reckons that around 40 percent of the bread and meat eaten by the armed forces and civilians in the Reich was produced in the occupied territories or by laborers deported from these countries to work on German farms. Her claim that “in Germany the population only began to experience hunger after May 1945,” however, rests on too easy an acceptance of postwar memories, when many Germans blamed the Allied occupation for failing to feed the German population. Food supplies in Germany had already begun to break down in the fall of 1944, as the armed forces lost control over Eastern Europe with the westward advance of the Red Army, and road and rail communications within Germany were being severely disrupted by Allied bombing. The Nazi regime cut domestic bread rations from 12,450 grams in May 1944 to 9,700 in August, 8,900 in December, and 3,600 in April 1945. The meat ration was reduced from 1,900 grams to 550 over the same period. Nobody could live on what they were officially allowed to buy; a huge black market, run by escaped foreign workers, emerged, with gangs engaged in regular shootouts with the Gestapo. The incidence of diseases like tuberculosis, boosted by malnutrition and debilitation, rose sharply in 1944. And indeed, Collingham concedes that there were “worsening food shortages in Germany’s cities until, in the last months before the Allied victory, the supply system broke down.”

If food shortages were bad in Germany, they were catastrophic in Eastern Europe. Germany, as Collingham notes, “exported wartime hunger to the countries it occupied.” Beginning with a “hunger plan” hatched by the leading civil servant in the Food Ministry, Herbert Backe, and expanding in scope and ambition into the “General Plan for the East,” devised at the behest of SS chief Heinrich Himmler, Nazi food policy envisaged the deliberate starvation of between 30 and 45 million Slavs (Collingham’s claim of 100 million seems exaggerated), its effects to be accelerated by denying them access to medical care. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, cities like Kharkov, bombed and blasted by air attacks and house-to-house fighting, were left without basic facilities such as water, sewerage, gas and electricity. The infrastructure was destroyed. The occupying German forces banned civilians from entering or leaving the city. The retreating Soviet forces had already implemented a scorched-earth policy, denying the incoming Germans food by burning or ruining all the warehouses stockpiled with grain, corn, flour and vegetables. Half the population was evacuated; those who remained were condemned by the Soviets as traitors. “There are no stores,” wrote a contemporary living in the city, “no markets, no shops of any kind…. The town is void of eatables like a desert.” By the end of 1942 a third of the remaining 450,000 inhabitants were dead, almost all of them from starvation. In Leningrad (present-day St. Petersburg), besieged for more than two years by German forces under orders to starve the city out rather than take it by storm, with all the heavy military losses that would imply, at least a million people died of starvation, and there were widespread reports of people eating dead bodies in their desperation to stay alive.

• • •

The mass murder of “useless eaters” began as early as September 1939, as the invading Germans crammed Poland’s Jews into unsanitary and overcrowded ghettos, where they were forced to live on what were literally starvation rations. In the Warsaw ghetto one observer saw only “nightmare figures, ghosts of former human beings” suffering from “emaciation and sickliness.” Desperate inhabitants fought over scraps, losing all human dignity. Thousands died every week; altogether as many as 100,000 starved to death, according to Collingham, though many of the dead had in fact succumbed to diseases such as typhus that were a consequence more of lack of public hygiene than lack of food. Worse was to come. Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union was followed by massive victories and the capture of millions of prisoners of war, who were herded into makeshift enclosures in the open and left to starve to death. Cases of cannibalism were reported here too. Collingham says that 2.35 million died, but this is an underestimate: the generally agreed-on figure is as high as 3.3 million.

The invasion and war in general had an enormous impact on the Soviet Union. Collingham estimates that a third of all people worldwide who died during the war lived in the Soviet Union. Fully 15 percent of the Soviet population did not survive the war—eighty-five people for every Briton or American dead. Around 9 million Red Army combatants were killed, a reflection, among other things, of Stalin’s callous disregard for life as he forced his generals time and again to throw their troops into the fray. In Moscow in 1942, after the German assault had been turned back, it was said that “the sight of men and women falling dead of starvation on [the] streets became too commonplace to attract crowds.” The disruption of communications caused by the German invasion meant that troop rations, meager at the best of times, could be interrupted for days on end. Red Army soldiers became expert foragers, digging up crops, stealing peasants’ honey and potatoes, requisitioning animals and killing them to eat. Some would make a stew of boiled nettles or pine needles to ward off scurvy.

Not only peasants but also town-dwellers suffered. The entire economy was geared ruthlessly to war production. Civilian production virtually collapsed. This happened not least because everything, including food production and distribution, was entirely state-run. Nevertheless, the regime squeezed the agricultural sector into supplying not only the armed forces but also munitions and armaments workers and their families with food, above all with bread, handed out in factories rather than in distribution centers to ensure it went to sustain the war production effort directly by feeding the workers first. People marginal to war production—the elderly, the sick, the disabled, the very young—were denied the basics of existence and died. Overall perhaps as many as 3 million Soviet citizens perished from starvation during the war, though this figure is difficult to square with Collingham’s claim that the total number of civilian dead in the Soviet Union was as high as 20 million.

The United States, worried about the Soviets’ ability to survive under such conditions, shipped huge quantities of food under the lend-lease agreement. An American officer who accompanied one shipment was shocked by the sight of groups of “starved wretches” who gathered on the quayside where shipments were being unloaded to scoop up and eat on the spot “raw meat, scraps or steaming chicken guts thrown out with the [American] ships’ galley garbage.” But however bad life may have been under the Soviet regime, it was far worse under German occupation. Death awaited Red Army soldiers who surrendered, so they fought on. Hunger did not destroy morale. The Soviet Union was “fighting on empty” but it continued to fight, ultimately all the way to victory. The German submarine fleet’s attempt to stop American supplies from reaching the northern seaports of the Soviet Union scored some successes, but ultimately it succumbed to the Allied convoy system, the superiority, in the end, of Allied intelligence and decrypting ability, and the inadequacies of the U-boat fleet. And the situation slowly improved: by 1943 the Soviet Union was receiving more lend-lease food than Britain.

• • •

Yet it was not just the Germans who used food as a weapon and tried to deny it to their enemies. The drive for self-sufficiency bolstered by the capture of food-producing areas abroad was part of Japanese military thinking as well. Manchuria, already occupied in the 1930s, was seen as ripe for settlement by Japanese farmers, coercing the existing Chinese and Korean peasants into selling their land cheaply. But the settlement plan was not a success, and Japan’s heavy reliance on imported food meant that when the war in the East began at the end of 1941, supplies were quickly cut off by the Allies, just as conscription and a drastic fall in the deep-sea fishing catch caused a fall in domestic Japanese agricultural output.

Japanese forces abroad depended almost entirely on food supplies from the occupied areas. But just as the harshness of German occupation policy in Europe alienated food producers and caused a fall in production, so too the Japanese massacres of Chinese farmers, particularly in the rice-growing areas of Malaya, combined with the conscription of farm labor for road and railway building and the imposition of a huge indemnity on the Chinese population in southern Burma, left the remaining peasants unwilling to work and determined to hide their produce from the conquerors.

Compounding the disaster, the Japanese tried to introduce regional self-sufficiency in an area where food supplies depended crucially on inter-regional trade. The American blockade established in 1943 administered the coup de grâce to the Asian rice trade, with American submarines sinking increasing quantities of Japanese shipping. Malnutrition became starvation; starvation became famine. In Manila the price of rice increased tenfold between 1941 and the middle of 1943; by the end of 1944 it was forty times more; by the middle of 1945 it had increased fourfold again. Chaos and mismanagement were more to blame for this situation than any deliberate policy of starvation on the part of the Japanese. But like the Germans, the Japanese prioritized their own survival over that of those they ruled.

Collingham explains that the Japanese high command began the war in the belief that the “Japanese army [could]…continue fighting without food, if they had strong morale.” But hunger often saps morale and undermines the fighting spirit, as the Japanese troops were to discover; and in the Asian theater of war, there was no threat of annihilation by the enemy to keep them going, as there was for the Red Army in Europe. As Collingham notes, “During the course of its war with China and America the Japanese military went from being one of the best-fed armed forces in the world to a state of miserable starvation.” Over the decades nutritional experts had devised an innovative and highly effective dietary regime involving non-Japanese food as well as the basic staple of rice (mixed with barley to provide vitamin B). But the disruptive effects of the war with China and then the American blockade forced a halving of the military food ration; and this was still twice as much as the food ration allowed to Japanese civilians.

As American submarines disrupted supply lines, Japanese soldiers on the Pacific islands were particularly badly affected, with 15,000 starving to death on Guadalcanal alone. The survivors who surrendered were emaciated, suffering from scurvy, “thin as thread,” as their commander noted. Ninety percent of the 158,000 Japanese troops in New Guinea died of starvation and tropical diseases, and there were widespread reports that they were killing and eating some of the prisoners they took. In the Philippines 400,000 out of nearly half a million Japanese troops starved to death. The American blockade proved a highly effective weapon. On the other side of the globe, the Germans harbored hopes that similar measures would be able to starve out the British. The story of the Battle of the Atlantic, when German submarines sought to cut off supply lines from North America to the United Kingdom, has been told many times, but usually from the naval angle; Collingham gives it a fresh look by focusing on what the ships carried rather than on how they got their cargo across the ocean. More than half the calories consumed by the British were contained in imported food, but administrative confusion, a prewar depression in the shipbuilding industry and the diversion of the fastest merchant ships to war uses such as carrying troops all created severe bottlenecks in the food supply within two years of the outbreak of the war, if not earlier.

By the winter of 1942–43, the U-boat menace had aggravated the situation. Around 860,000 tons of shipping were lost in November 1942 alone, amounting to 9 percent of food shipments to Britain. Further problems were caused by the diversion of resources to supply the Allied landings in North Africa. “The country never realized how nearly we were brought to disaster by the submarine peril,” noted the wartime Minister of Food Lord Woolton in his memoirs. Yet improvisation usually got food to the right places when supplies failed to arrive. The British did not starve.

It was a different story across the far-flung territories of Britain’s overseas empire. The Middle East Supply Centre successfully reorganized trade and agriculture in the region to ensure that people continued to be fed despite the arrival of large numbers of British troops. Similar efforts were not undertaken elsewhere, however. In the absence of rationing or price controls such as had been imposed in Britain, rising demand caused by the need to buy up supplies for British troops fueled inflation, which soon put many foodstuffs out of reach of the poor in parts of the empire. Food supplies were cut off by wartime activity—some African colonies, for example, had depended heavily on imported rice from Burma and other British territories in the Far East, now no longer available because of the Japanese invasion of those countries. A drought in East Africa made things worse and famine ensued, spreading beyond British territories to claim 300,000 lives in Rwanda alone. Isolated island territories such as Mauritius were particularly vulnerable, and their inhabitants began to suffer severe malnutrition.

• • •

Worst of all was the situation in Bengal. The complacent and inefficient colonial administration in India did nothing to curb inflation, speculation and hoarding, even when Burma fell to the Japanese, depriving the subcontinent of 15 percent of its rice supply. Provincial governments in India reacted by banning the export of food to other provinces, strangling the machinery of trade in food in what one food controller called an outbreak of “insane provincial protectionism.” The winter rice harvest of 1942 failed because of a fungal disease that spread rapidly in unusually warm and humid weather. No measures were taken to impose rationing or force hoarders to disgorge supplies, for fear of provoking political dissent in the economic elites who were benefiting financially from the situation.

Churchill ordered a 60 percent cut in military and civilian shipping to the Indian Ocean, commenting that Indians should not take food supplies that could be used by the mother country. Thus Britain as well as Germany exported food shortages to its empire. Even if this was not, as with Germany, the product of a deliberate policy of starvation, the result was much the same: famine victims poured into Calcutta in the summer of 1943, a vast, slow, dispirited noiseless army of apathetic skeletons, as one observer described them. As many as 3 million people may have died from starvation and from diseases, such as cholera, associated with the movements of large numbers of people across the country.

The government imposed strict censorship to stop news of the famine from spreading, and it was only when Viscount Wavell was appointed viceroy of India in September 1943 that decisive action was taken. Worried about morale among the Indian troops charged with the recapture of Burma, Wavell overrode the disastrous policy of regional protectionism and introduced an effective system of rationing and distribution. Even so, Wavell had to overcome considerable resistance from Churchill and the government in London. Surprisingly, perhaps, the memory of the famine played almost no part in the Congress Party’s demand for Indian independence after the war; most of its leaders were in prison and did not witness the severity of the disaster. And the Indian elites who backed independence had been partly responsible for the famine themselves, as they had occupied prominent positions in provincial administrations during the war, above all in Bengal, where the famine was concentrated.

Meanwhile, other parts of the British Empire were mobilized to increase food production for the war effort. Australia doubled the amount of land devoted to vegetable farming and supplied vast quantities of dried and canned foodstuffs to the American forces in the Pacific. The United States itself had such enormous surpluses of food that it was able to provide a rich diet to the Pacific islands when it won them back from the Japanese. “We fed the Japanese,” one Tuvaluan islander put it; “the Americans fed us.” GIs, sailors and marines poured into the islands, spending liberally and fueling a rapid rise in prosperity. Yet as the conflict subsided, there was hunger everywhere, especially in the defeated nations. By the end of the war, indeed, food production in Europe had fallen to 36 percent of its prewar levels.

The desperate situation in the Soviet Union was made worse by the failure of the harvest in 1946. A year later perhaps 2 million Soviet citizens had died from starvation and associated diseases. In many places rationing remained in place well into the 1950s. The Americans viewed deprivation in Germany as a punishment for the crimes of Nazism, and stopped food relief from entering the country until they realized that a discontented and depressed population might become nostalgic about Hitler or could succumb to the lure of communism, as Stalin, even at the cost of his own population’s survival, sought to gain support in satellite states and the Soviet zone of occupied Germany by pouring in food. Only gradually, as the world economy recovered and then began to boom, did the situation improve.

Examining in detail the role played by food in the greatest of all political conflicts, the Second World War, was a brilliant idea on Collingham’s part. The Taste of War is breathtaking in its breadth and scope, global in coverage and yet anchored in detailed research. Despite the inevitable mistakes and inaccuracies of detail, which should be corrected in the paperback reprint, this is a book that anyone interested in the role played by control of food supplies in the war will want to read. Much of the material is fresh and compelling, and many of the individual vignettes, anecdotes and quotations are heartrendingly moving in their depiction of the immensity of the suffering many people had to endure.

Yet by looking everywhere for the impact of the “battle for food,” Collingham’s book has an inbuilt tendency to downplay other aspects of the conflict. Often this involves picking out one side in a controversial area simply because it supports the argument that food supplies were of crucial historical importance. For example, the sharp acceleration of Germany’s mass murder of Jews in the late spring and early summer of 1942 was justified by some German officials as necessary because of the critical position of food supplies to the German forces and civilian population at the time. Yet it is possible that the officials were simply providing what seemed to them to be a convenient military rationalization for an ideologically motivated policy. After all, there is evidence that senior SS officers had already decided in the autumn of 1941 that Europe’s Jews were to be taken to the east: the first large-scale gassing facilities began to be constructed in October and November of that year; the Wannsee Conference, held early in 1942 after several weeks’ postponement, already envisaged the ultimate extermination of the world’s Jews. All this was driven by the paranoid belief of the Nazi leadership that Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin were puppets of an international Jewish conspiracy against Germany that had to be stopped at any price.

It would be unfortunate if readers took away from this impressive book only the belief that the battle for food “shaped the events of World War II,” to quote the promotional copy, or that “access to food drove both Nazi Germany and imperial Japan to occupation.” Other, more significant factors were involved; the food supplies of Eastern Europe, for instance, were important to the Nazis principally as a way of securing Germany for the greater struggle with the United States that lay ahead. The Taste of War is a book, then, that has to be read in conjunction with other histories of the war; it views the conflict from one angle only, and the war needs to be seen in the round."

In addition to highlighting the embarrassing degree to which the American media are seduced by displays of American military might, their rush to embrace President Trump’s decision to launch a military attack against Syria on April 6 has also crowded out dissenting voices from the administration’s claim that it was the government of Bashar al-Assad that was responsible for the chemical-weapons attack in Khan Sheikhun, which killed over 80 people and injured hundreds. Ad Policy

By firing 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air base in Syria, and killing five Syrian soldiers and nine civilians in the process, President Trump was able to transform himself in the eyes of the media from an object of derision into, in the words of erstwhile Trump critic Elliot Abrams, “Leader of the Free World.”

Dissent from what amounts to a new party line has been noticeably absent. As the investigative journalist Robert Parry recently observed, “All the Important People who appeared on the TV shows or who were quoted in the mainstream media trusted the images provided by Al Qaeda–related propagandists and ignored documented prior cases in which the Syrian rebels staged chemical weapons incidents to implicate the Assad government.”

Former British ambassador to Syria Peter Ford told the BBC last week that he seriously doubted that Assad was the culprit. “Assad,” said Ford, “may be cruel, brutal but he’s not mad. It defies belief that he would bring this all on his head for no military advantage.” Ford said he believes the accusations against Syria are “simply not plausible.”

And so, on what evidence and intelligence was Trump’s decision based upon?

On April 11, the White House released a declassified four-page report meant to prove its case against Assad and serve as a belated justification for the Tomahawk attack on Syria’s Shayrat air base.

The report, which was authored not by US intelligence agencies but by the White House under the supervision of national-security adviser H.R. McMaster, says that “The United States is confident that the Syrian regime conducted a chemical weapons attack, using the nerve agent sarin, against its own people in the town of Khan Shaykhun in southern Idlib Province on April 4, 2017.”

The report relies on “open source” videos for proof of its claim that a “chemical munition landed not on a facility filled with weapons,” as the Russians and Syrians have claimed, “but in the middle of a street in the northern section of Khan Shaykhun. Commercial satellite imagery of that site from April 6, after the allegation, shows a crater in the road that corresponds to the open source video.”

Yet the administration’s report has come under withering scrutiny from Dr. Theodore Postol, a professor emeritus of science, technology, and national-security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who once served as a scientific adviser to the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon.

Postol’s exhaustive critique of the White House report notes that “The only undisputable facts stated in the White House report is the claim that a chemical attack using nerve agent occurred in Khan Shaykhun, Syria.” And yet, according to Postol, “the report contains absolutely no evidence that this attack was the result of a munition being dropped from an aircraft. In fact, the report contains absolutely no evidence that would indicate who was the perpetrator of this atrocity.”

Postol writes that “The only source the document cites as evidence that the attack was by the Syrian government is the crater it claims to have identified on a road in the North of Khan Shaykhun.” Yet his analysis of the photographs of the crater provided by the White House “clearly indicates that the munition was almost certainly placed on the ground with an external detonating explosive on top of it that crushed the container so as to disperse the alleged load of sarin.”

And so, “In order to cover up the lack of intelligence to supporting the president’s action, the National Security Council produced a fraudulent intelligence report.” Postol concludes that the “report is completely undermined by a significant body of video evidence taken after the alleged sarin attack and before the US cruise missile attack that unambiguously shows the claims in the WHR [White House Report] could not possibly be true.”

The Nation spoke to Postol over the weekend.

“What I think is now crystal clear,” he said, “is that the White House report was fabricated and it certainly did not follow the procedures it claimed to employ.”

“My best guess at the moment is that this was an extremely clumsy and ill-conceived attempt to cover up the fact that Trump attacked Syria without any intelligence evidence that Syria was in fact the perpetrator of the attack…. It may be,” he continued, “that the White House staff was worried that this could eventually come out—a reckless president acting without regard to the nation’s security, risking an inadvertent escalation and confrontation with Russia, and a breakdown in cooperation with Russia that would cripple our efforts to defeat the Islamic State.”

“If that is not an impeachable offense,” Postol told The Nation, “then I do not know what is.”

It is entirely possible, of course, that dissenting voices like Postol’s and Ambassador Ford’s may ultimately be proved wrong, and that Assad was indeed behind the chemical-weapons attack.

Indeed, if it is true, as CNN reported on April 13, that the “US military and intelligence community has intercepted communications featuring Syrian military and chemical experts talking about preparations for the sarin attack in Idlib,” then that would be hard, if not impossible, to explain away. Meanwhile, US officials are not backing away from their claim that there is “no doubt” that the Syrian government ordered the attack.

But at this early stage, questions such as those posed by Postol and Ford should be aired by the US media, not ignored. And, given that the US intelligence community has seemingly kept its distance from the administration’s claims, a serious investigation into what exactly took place is all the more necessary.

Robert Parry writes, “it remains a mystery why this intelligence assessment is not coming directly from President Trump’s intelligence chiefs as is normally the case, either with an official Intelligence Estimate or a report issued by the Director of National Intelligence.”

Philip Giraldi, a former CIA case officer and Army intelligence officer, told radio host Scott Horton on April 6 that he was “hearing from sources on the ground in the Middle East, people who are intimately familiar with the intelligence that is available, who are saying the essential narrative we are hearing about the Syrians and Russians using chemical weapons is a sham.” Ready to Fight Back?

Giraldi also noted that “people in the both the agency [CIA] and in the military who are aware of the intelligence are freaking out about this because essentially Trump completely misrepresented” what had taken place in Khan Sheikhun. Giraldi reports that his sources in the military and the intelligence community “are astonished by how this is being played by the administration and by the US media.”

Given the seriousness of the questions raised by Giraldi, one can’t help but wonder if the administration’s motives for launching the missile strike were motivated by considerations other than those which they have aired thus far. What exactly was the rush? The findings of an investigation into the attack by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is expected to be released in only two weeks’ time.

In the meantime, according to a report from the April 5 meeting of the UN Security Council, the UN’s high representative for disarmament affairs, Kim Won-soo, informed the council that “the information on the reported 4 April use of chemical weapons in Khan Shaykhun, in Syria’s Idlib Governorate, was still coming in.” The high representative could also not confirm who carried out the attack, though both sides of the six-year-long Syrian war have been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons.

Yet, in spite of all this, Trump, perhaps sensing political advantage, rushed to execute a unilateral and illegal military response. The fact that he did so raises serious questions about his judgment, as well as the judgment of all the pundits who applauded him.

But perhaps the enthusiasm that greeted Trump’s missile strike was misplaced. Ambassador Ford warns that “Trump has just given the jihadis a thousand reasons to stage fake flag operations, seeing how successful and how easy it is with a gullible media to provoke the West into intemperate reactions.”

It hardly needs saying that highlighting these dissenting voices is not tantamount to excusing Assad’s heinous human-rights record or his previous attacks, which have killed countless innocent Syrians. Rather, it is to draw attention to the failure of the US media, which have once again abdicated their responsibilities by ignoring the serious questions and allegations raised by Postol, Giraldi, and Ford about the White House’s intelligence relating to the chemical-weapons attack in Syria."

Yesterday, an outspoken white atheist murdered three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We don’t yet know for sure whether this was a hate crime or whether the killer, Craig Stephen Hicks, had some other motivation; police have said the crime may have grown out of a dispute over parking. We do know that had Hicks been a Muslim and his victims atheists, few would be waiting for all the facts to come in before declaring him a terrorist. We know that there would be the usual calls for other Muslims to condemn the killings, coupled with the usual failure to take note of the many Muslims who did. And we know that demands for Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins to distance themselves from Hicks are largely facetious, because no one really blames them. Violence perpetrated by Muslims is almost always seen as part of a global conspiracy, whereas white men like Hicks are usually seen as isolated psychopaths. Ad Policy

There is, of course, some truth there. An organized jihadist movement exists; an organized cadre of terroristic atheists does not. Yet in the United States, Islamophobia has been a consistent motivator of violence. Hicks’s killing of Yusor Mohammad, her husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, should not be treated like a man-bites-dog story, a reversal of the usual pattern of terrorism. After all, Muslims in the United States are more often the victims of ideological violence than the perpetrators of it.

According to the latest FBI statistics, there were more than 160 anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2013. Mosques and Islamic centers have been firebombed and vandalized; seven mosques were attacked during Ramadan alone in 2012. Several Muslims, or people thought to be Muslim, have been murdered or viciously attacked. In 2010, a white college student and self-described patriot tried to slash the throat of Bangladeshi cab driver Ahmed Sharif. The white supremacist who slaughtered six people in a Sikh temple in 2012 may have thought he was targeting Muslims. So, apparently, did Erika Menendez, the homeless New Yorker who pushed a man named Sunando Sen in front of a subway train that same year.

In most cases, the perpetrators have been disaffected, disaffiliated losers rather than part of any movement, but they’ve picked up broader currents of hatred and conspiracy theorizing. (The same can be said of some lone-wolf Muslim terrorists like Man Haron Monis, the fraudster and criminal who took hostages in Sydney last year, or the Tsarnaev brothers, who bombed the Boston marathon in 2013.) We don’t yet know if Hicks was driven by lonely fanaticism, but if he was, he’s not as much of an anomaly as he might at first appear. Explicitly atheist violence is unusual, but Hicks still fits the profile of the most common type of American terrorist: a white man with a weapon and a grudge."

The Donetsk Whodunnit: Ukraine and Russia Blame at Each Other for Shooting Down Malaysian Jet

Soon after the horrific news began circulating that a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 had crashed in eastern Ukraine, both the Kiev forces and pro-Russian rebels fighting there agreed that the plane had been shot down. But explanations of who shot it down—and why—immediately began diverging wildly in what has become the latest battle in the information war that has been waged between Ukraine and Russia since protests began in Kiev in November. The 295 people killed in the crash could not temper the politicized finger-pointing. Ad Policy

American and Ukrainian authorities said the plane had been hit by a surface-to-air missile, and speculation immediately centered on the Buk (otherwise called a “Gadfly”) missile launcher that Kiev said the rebels had used to shoot it down. Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the Ukrainian interior minister, wrote on his Facebook account shortly after the crash that “terrorists shot down a passenger plane with a Buk missile that Putin kindly gave to them.… The cynicism of Putin and his terrorists knows no bounds!” He called on the United States and Europe to “help us with everything you can.”

For his part, Vladimir Putin refrained from saying who might have shot down the plane in a segment broadcast on Russian television, but noted that Ukraine “bears responsibility” for the downing of an airliner on its territory.

The rebels immediately began denying their involvement and blaming the Ukrainian military. On Twitter and in interviews, Alexander Borodai, the Muscovite who heads the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, maintained that the rebels did not have weapons capable of hitting an airplane at the height Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was traveling, above 32,000 feet.

“It was shot down by the Ukrainian military. I think this is a deliberate provocation,” Borodai said, using the term that both sides have employed to explain many murky incidents over the four months of fighting in eastern Ukraine.

But the rebels by their own admission do have these missiles, as Russian news agencies reported at the end of June. The Donetsk People’s Republic Twitter account even posted a photo of the missiles at the time. A correspondent in eastern Ukraine for Russian state-controlled channel Rossiya-24 later reported that the militia does possess Buk launchers, but that they’re “all undergoing repair.”

Pundits in the Western media quickly joined Gerashchenko in claiming that Moscow had provided the pro-Russian militia with the advanced missile launchers. The Ukrainian representative to the United Nations went further, promising to “present the evidence of Russian military involvement into the Boeing crash.” But Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said allegations of Russian involvement “stupidity,” and the rebels had said in June that they captured the Buk missiles from a Ukrainian air-defense base near the village of Oleksiivka.

The Ukrainian intelligence service released an intercepted recording it said showed Russian rebels admitting to downing the plane, but dismayed that it had turned out to be a civilian flight. Similarly, a deleted post on a social network page that has published statements by the rebels’ military leader, Muscovite Igor Strelkov, praised the downing of the plane, also under the assumption it was a military flight.

Meanwhile, increasingly wild versions of events began to appear. Representatives of the neighboring Lugansk People’s Republic told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that unnamed witnesses had seen a Ukrainian fighter jet attack the Boeing 777.

Russian defence analyst Igor Korotchenko, editor of the National Defence journal, said on Rossiya 24 and RIA Novosti it was “obvious” that MH17 had been accidentally shot down by poorly trained Ukrainian government forces while checking the battle readiness of a Buk missile launcher. But Western military experts on CBS News and elsewhere argued that taking down the plane with a Buk would require extensive training and a careful shot.

RT and other Russian media began quoting a confidential source at Russian Aviation arguing that Ukrainian forces had been trying to down Russia’s presidential plane, which he or she said had passed through a certain airspace near Warsaw shortly after the Malaysian airliner had.

Among Twitter accounts supporting the rebellion in Ukraine, it was common knowledge Ukrainian forces had shot down the airliner, only their goal had been to draw Western forces into the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Rossiya 24 hinted at a similar conclusion when in between segments on the downed Boeing 777 it broadcast a recap of Siberia Airlines Flight 1812, which the Ukrainian military admitted to accidentally shooting down over the Black Sea in 2001.

Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst and columnist for the independent Novaya Gazeta, said the fact that the rebels had shot down a Ukrainian military An-26 transport aircraft on Monday at about 20,000 feet—one of three military aircraft they downed this week—proved that they had acquired more powerful weaponry.

“The most plausible explanation is, of course, it was the rebels with Russian help, or Russian volunteers on the side of the rebels,” who shot down Malaysia Airlines flight 17, Felgenhauer said. “That’s more plausible than all other shit being circulated.”"

While you were lighting your candles to Selena’s memory this morning to mark the 20th anniversary of her death, it probably did not occur to you that The Nation, in that memorable spring of sadness and sorrow, might have had something to add to the national outpouring of grief and commemoration. Well, think again, because we did. The issue of May 29, 1995, carried an essay, “Selena Aside,” by Mexican-American writer Ana Castillo. The not-so-veiled dig at Kurt Cobain was perhaps gratuitous, but if the editor of The Almanac were to be honest with himself and readers, he would have to admit that the soundtrack to the film Selena was a standard in his CD wallet (ask your parents) long before he knew about Nirvana or had even considered that teen spirit might have a distinctive smell. Ad Policy

For an instant…the time it takes to witness a meteorite streak across the sky—if you’re lucky, if you have the presence of mind to look up at that instant—a talented and vibrant, ambitious and hard-working young performer enchanted her public and gave us the gifts of her many talents. But perhaps her greatest gift was the hope her example gave to thousands of young people who adored her and emulated her style. Unlike the male rock star who, having killed himself, gave his fans a taste of ultimate fatalism, Selena’s life, not death, offered joy to so many who admired her—from field workers to the urban unemployed, poor brown and countless others who elsewise may have given over to despair. Because of her example and because of the ground she broke, although exoticized, relegated to subculture status, perceived as foreign in the country of her birth yet sticking stubbornly to the language of her heart, I am certain that the void she has left will be filled with a new Selena. And we will welcome her. We need her. As all past great civilizations—Greek and Maya alike—adored their self-styled gods and goddesses, their nobility (gods and nobility often being one and the same), we will adore our new Selena, as much or even more than the one that just passed. We won’t, one hopes, dethrone the next one so quickly, so rudely, picking off and disposing of our heroes, our all-too-human deities, like lint off our coat sleeves. Next time, perhaps we won’t feel our craving for our very own homemade goddess’s immortality so urgently that we love her to death.

After defending such clients as Sacco and Vanzetti and Charles Ponzi (yes, that Ponzi), my paternal grandfather, a lawyer and Jewish Italophile, published in 1930 a slim book, Italy and Your Senses, which is not, as the title suggests, a poetic tribute to Italian art, topography or people but rather a valentine to Benito Mussolini, whom he considered the resurrection and the light. I mention this to show that while my grandfather’s infatuation with Mussolini was extreme, he was not alone. Italy’s fascist prime minister was one of the country’s great tourist attractions in the Roaring Twenties, for Mussolini was a charismatic showman–after all, he liked to pose, à la Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, without his shirt. No matter that his political philosophy was hollow at the core, as Frances Stonor Saunders points out in her superb new book, The Woman Who Shot Mussolini, or that between 1922 and 1943 Il Duce sent at least a million people to an early grave. He remained, for a very long time, the darling statesman of the conservative press and the fashionable fascists of Europe, although they conceded that he might be a bit hasty and brutal. Still and all, according to the British ambassador to Italy, Mussolini was ""like any other gentleman."" The King of England decorated him with the Order of the Bath, and Austen Chamberlain, the British foreign secretary (whose half brother was Neville, future prime minister and champion of the Munich accord), considered Mussolini a sincere, charming patriot, and certainly preferable to any other ""Italian."" Sure he was a dictator, the foreign secretary admitted, but one simply could not ""apply British standards to un-British conditions."" As Saunders acidly comments, Chamberlain’s remark ""contained all the narrowness and smugness of an imperial conceit."" Not so the epigraph in Saunders’s new book: ""There is such a thing as a moral atmosphere."" Those are the words of Violet Gibson, who happens to be the woman who shot Il Duce in 1926, although she only nicked his nose. Indeed, a moral atmosphere pervades Saunders’s often poignant tale of the Irishwoman, labeled mad, who possessed both gumption and a pistol, which she tried to use to change the course of history. Yet there is nothing tendentious about The Woman Who Shot Mussolini; rather, its wit and modesty, especially on the question of why Gibson did what she did, make the book a beguiling detective story and, as such, a meditation on the limits of biography. How much can we know about another person? In the fall of 1924, Violet Gibson arrived in Rome carrying a revolver. She intended, or so it seems, to kill the Pope–even though, born into a prominent Protestant household in 1876, Gibson had converted to Catholicism at 26. But she also deplored what she considered the pontiff’s Faustian pact with fascism, for Gibson’s Italy was the land of Fra Angelico, not of thugs dressed in black. And just the preceding spring Giacomo Matteotti, leader of the United Socialist Party, had been abducted, brutally beaten and then stabbed to death; his body was taken to the outskirts of Rome, sexually assaulted and then tossed into a ditch. The crime outraged Italians and much of the world; yet Mussolini suavely denied having anything to do with the assassination, although it was widely accepted that the murderers had acted on his behalf. Gibson took lodgings in the convent of Our Lady of Lourdes but spent most of her time visiting the Colosseum and Trastevere, on the west side of the Tiber, to help poor people, as she later told her Mother Superior. Trastevere was also known as a watering hole for Catholic dissidents, and it was later suspected that Gibson might have been trafficking in radical politics. A member of the Anglo-Irish elite who had been presented as a debutante at the court of Queen Victoria, Gibson was the daughter of Lord and Lady Ashbourne. Her father, the conservative lord chancellor of Ireland, had drafted the Land Purchase Act of 1885 so that Irish tenants could acquire land on favorable terms. It wasn’t exactly home rule. The lord chancellor’s son Willie, Violet’s eldest brother, would have none of it. A nationalist, a liberal and a Catholic, just unlike his father, Willie in turn influenced the young Violet in her conversion to a Christian socialism that owed much to George Tyrrell, an Irish Jesuit theologian, and Ernesto Buonaiuti, both of them modernists committed to social reform and compassion above and beyond papal autocracy. Yet a restless Violet Gibson fit the profile of the neurasthenic, that handy catch-all nervous disorder usually associated with unfulfilled women. (Virginia Woolf is a strong presence in Saunders’s book, although it’s a stretch to compare Woolf’s madness with Gibson’s.) In her youth, Gibson had briefly flirted with Christian Science, theosophy and the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Relatively affluent, she shuttled between London and Europe. During World War I she became a pacifist, though whatever political activism she may have undertaken was interrupted by a series of illnesses: Paget’s disease, a subsequent mastectomy, appendicitis and peritonitis. Then in 1915 Gibson met John O’Fallon Pope, an American Jesuit at Oxford who preached the need to demonstrate a love of Jesus through action, not words. That seems, in retrospect, to have set her on the royal road to Rome. Still, she was unwell, and after the sudden death of her brother Victor in 1922, Violet suffered what seems to have been her first breakdown. In 1923 she attacked her housekeeper’s daughter with a knife, though she insisted she had been acting on behalf of ""God and his Church."" Violet Gibson subsequently landed in Rome, where in the convent she tried to shoot herself in the heart. Never a good aim, the bullet lodged in her shoulder bone. ""I wanted to die for the glory of God,"" she confided to a friend, but having failed she needed to find another way to serve him. Saunders speculates that the signing of the Locarno Pact with France, Germany, Britain and Belgium later that year, with its refusal to stand against Italian fascism, may have prompted Gibson to set her sights on Mussolini instead of herself (again) or the Pope. Thus it was on what Saunders calls ""a normal Fascist morning,"" April 7, 1926, that the 50-year-old Violet Gibson, wearing a shiny old black dress, carried a revolver wrapped in a black veil to the Campidoglio, where she shot Benito Mussolini at point-blank range. Gibson said she did it to glorify God. ""A strange God, this,"" dryly comments Saunders, ""who tells Violet Gibson to shoot Mussolini and then instructs the bullet not to kill him."" God notwithstanding, did Gibson act alone? If not, who were her accomplices? The Italian police, after her suicide attempt, had confiscated the revolver she had brought from England. How had she contrived to find another? Was she, like Willie, involved in Irish revolutionary politics? How to explain the balance in her bank account, which exceeded the annual income she received from her father’s estate? Was she insane or feigning madness in order to avoid punishment? And, as Saunders puts it, can someone ""who pretends to be mad claim to be sane?"" The prime investigator of the Gibson case was chief superintendent Epifanio Pennetta, a methodical man without an overt political agenda but one on whom much was lost. Though he could not imagine that Gibson had no help, by assuming she acted lucidly he at least dignified her more than the British Foreign Office, which thought her nuts. Yet Pennetta was unquestionably handicapped by his inability to speak English; he could not communicate with Gibson or read her few papers and her notebook, should he have wanted to understand her state of mind, which apparently did not much concern him. Fortunately, Gibson’s inner life interests Saunders, who nonetheless refuses to reduce it to facile formulations and thus confronts the central biographical paradox so succinctly stated by Emily Dickinson: ""Biography first convinces us of the fleeing of the Biographied."" The more we pursue the lives of others, the more they slip away, private, mysterious, elusive. As Saunders acknowledges, ""We see, but we see across an impassable distance, another human being, passing from one room to another."" Plus, in the case of Violet Gibson, even the public record of her life is obscure. Before she cocked her pistol at the Campidoglio on that ""normal Fascist morning,"" she left no trail of canceled checks, newspaper articles, photographs, personal letters, diaries or discarded lovers, all the detritus out of which a life is recomposed. And after the shooting and subsequent investigation, she receded into history, a mere footnote, if that, in the annals of Italian fascism, where she is typically dismissed as a demented Irish spinster. Unruffled by the scant historical documentation, Saunders places unknowingness at the center of her book, and it’s a wise unknowingness comfortable with seeing through a glass darkly. ""By any definition,"" she notes, Violet must be considered mad, at least some of the time, but this does not mean that the whole of her life should be rewritten to fit this conclusion. She was attached to the idea of sacrifice and martyrdom, but this cannot be solely ascribed to religious mania. In the political world around her (to which she paid deep attention), this notion acquired elevated status in the passion narratives of Giacomo Matteotti, the priests George Tyrrell and Ernesto Buonaiuti, the Irish republicans who took part and died in the 1916 Easter Rising. In the summer of 1926, more certain of diagnosis than Saunders, the Italian psychiatrists questioning her reached their verdict: chronic paranoia. This helped the British Foreign Office strike a deal; Gibson would be certified insane so she could avoid a full trial. (The defense: no one in her right mind would want to kill Mussolini.) Her passport impounded, she would be delivered to the British authorities and, without her consent, confined in a madhouse for the rest of her life."

How do you beat a sitting vice president in a presidential nomination contest? There’s no established game plan, because no one’s ever done it. It’s the sort of history Bill Bradley is aiming to make by challenging Al Gore. As his campaign has received positive reviews–mostly because of his fundraising prowess–Bradley has been pressing his case with his personal tale: Small-town Missouri boy becomes basketball hero becomes cerebral senator. (Gore has “been in federal government all his life,” Bradley jeers.) Bradley’s policy thrusts have been few; he promises more come fall. He has twice tried to strike in bold fashion. In June he proposed an antigun package that included measures surpassing those discussed in Congress, such as registration of all handguns. In July he delivered an impassioned speech at the National Press Club decrying big money in politics. But boasting tougher positions than Gore on lobbyists, guns and money won’t be enough to wrest the Democratic Party from Gore. How’s he going to win over traditional Democratic voters–unionists, African-Americans, enviros, pro-choice advocates, Clinton loyalists? Ad Policy

There are few, if any, major Democratic constituencies where Bradley starts with an advantage. Among African-Americans–20 to 25 percent of the Democratic primary electorate–Gore is quite popular, according to polls. In a recent survey conducted by David Bositis, a senior analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, 69 percent of black respondents held a favorable impression of the Vice President; only 17 percent held an unfavorable one. Bradley registered favorably with 41 percent and unfavorably with 11 percent. “Bradley has no better record from the point of view of the black community than Gore does,” Bositis observes, “and due to his association with Bill Clinton, Gore is seen as having a better policy.” Bradley’s speeches declaring race the paramount issue in America do not resonate, Bositis says. “Bradley has done nothing except talk. And what is he best known for in his years in the Senate? The 1986 tax reform. I liked [Reagan Treasury Secretary turned Chief of Staff] Don Regan’s plan better than Bradley’s. Neither was populist, but Bradley’s made Regan’s plan worse from an income-distribution point of view.”

Sentiment in the Congressional Black Caucus is with Gore, according to caucus members’ aides. “I’ve talked to people within the caucus about Bradley’s race speech,” says one, “and no one thinks much of it.” Jesse Jackson, who has made no endorsement, is widely judged by Jackson-watchers to be leaning toward Gore.

Bradley is having difficulty vying with Gore for institutional labor support. During the years they overlapped in the Senate, Gore rated slightly higher on the AFL-CIO’s scorecard (88 to 84 percent). Both support free trade in a manner that irritates unions. “When Bradley was in the Senate, he was Mr. Free Trade, and the industrial unions hated him,” says a labor lawyer who witnessed clashes between Bradley and union officials. “There’s not enough of a difference between Gore and Bradley for labor leaders to turn against Gore. Many of them think they already have a relationship with Gore.”

In February Bradley spoke before leaders of the AFL-CIO. “He missed an opportunity,” says Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union. “He did not make a clear and convincing case for what he believed in, what he would do if he were President and how he could win.” In May Bradley addressed an SEIU gathering and left a better impression. He emphasized that he’d been a union rep when he played basketball, and he discussed issues important to labor. “He made our members realize there was going to be a competitive primary,” Stern notes. Yet Gore, according to Stern, talked more than Bradley about policy and issues of interest to the union members. “It’s enormously hard to imagine at the [union] leadership level a Bradley endorsement,” Stern adds. “The interesting question is whether Bradley will connect with union members. Will his proposals in the fall seem significantly different from Gore’s?”

The debate among union honchos has not been Gore versus Bradley but when to endorse Gore. Some ask why not now? Others–especially the industrial trade unions that dislike the Clinton/Gore trade policies–are not yet ready to swallow that hard. “Bill Bradley is not a factor here,” notes an AFL-CIO official. “I’ve heard no one express any deep interest in Bradley.” Gore has pocketed several labor endorsements. The Communications Workers of America and the International Association of Firefighters declared their support. So did the Iowa chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. (Gerald McEntee, the president of AFSCME, is a die-hard Clinton/Gore booster.) The United Automobile Workers chapter in Iowa also endorsed Gore, but the national headquarters revoked the endorsement. (Bradley backers cited this as a positive omen, but the UAW leaders acted from concern that their prerogative had been usurped.) Most of the opposition within the AFL-CIO to an early endorsement of Gore is tactical, with union leaders arguing that the federation should hold out for a bone or two from the Clinton/Gore Administration in return for their seal of approval. That hasn’t stopped Bradley aides from hailing the delay in the AFL-CIO endorsement as proof that Bradley’s on the move.

Mark Smith, the president of the Iowa AFL-CIO, maintains that there are progressive unionists yearning for an alternative to Gore: “But I don’t see Bradley providing that at this point.” Referring to the closing of a major Sara Lee plant in Iowa–a move that will toss 625 people out of work–Smith exclaims with disgust, “Neither of them are dealing with this question.”

Eric Hauser, Bradley’s press secretary, argues that Bradley can be competitive within the labor and African-American communities. Why? Bradley has spent “a lot of time” talking with the SEIU, Hauser says, and African-Americans realize that race is “an essential issue for Bradley.” But, he adds, “we’re not trying to segment voting blocs. We’re trying to run on a higher level.”

Bradley’s record on choice and the environment is so close to Gore’s that he has no special claim in appealing to Democrats on those terms. “This Administration has been so supportive of reproductive rights,” says Julie Burton, executive director of Voters for Choice, “that you will find most pro-choice leaders unwilling to go against the status quo. But should Bradley win the nomination, the pro-choice community would not be unhappy.” Environmental advocates recall that Bradley had a very green voting record in the Senate, but they are not likely to flock to him over Gore. “We understand who the Vice President is, and he understands who we are,” says a senior environmental lobbyist. “You’re not going to attack a sitting vice president who’s done more for you than any other vice president. There won’t be a fight in the environmental community over this.”

In this pre-pre-season of presidential politics, Bradley may be faring best among Democratic activists and players worried about Gore’s chances in a matchup with George W. Bush. “Gore looks like a loser, so I’m helping Bill Bradley,” explains a prominent Democratic fundraiser. “But the Democratic primary electorate is still very much for Gore. For now Bradley is getting support from outside that group.”

Will Bradley, in the end, rely on the electability argument (he has a better shot at Bush than Gore) and his I’m-a-fuller-person-than-Gore sales pitch? Or might he take a shot at stirring up Democratic voters on the basis of policy differences with Gore? “There is a huge void that Bill can fill,” says Senator Paul Wellstone, who has endorsed Bradley. “Right now, Bill’s doing a lot of connecting with people, getting support less on issues and more on people liking him. Post-Labor Day, the question will be, how strong will he come out on mobilizing issues? Guns and campaign reform are not enough. I expect to see him take strong stands on kids and education, urban policy, healthcare and the right to organize.”

To succeed, Bradley will have to do an end run around the leaders of the traditional Democratic constituencies and the party itself–blow past them the way Gary Hart surprised former Vice President Walter Mondale in the early phases of the 1984 Democratic primary. Given Gore’s anticipated strength in the South and the fact that one-fifth of the convention delegates will be so-called superdelegates–elected officials and party leaders presumably loyal to Gore–Bradley will need a lot of force (votes, that is) to overcome the institutional obstacles. Mondale, it should be noted, did recover sufficiently to beat back the Hart threat–and Mondale was an out-of-office, uncharismatic number two to a failed President less popular than Bill Clinton. To have a prayer, Bradley–a wonkish, less-than-dynamic Democrat of mixed ideologies–is going to have to become an insurgent candidate, in style or substance, of historic caliber."

Charles Guiteau was unhappy with the way the civil service treated him, so he shot President Garfield. Ad Policy

It is very seldom that an event of any kind is accepted by the public as a lesson or source of instruction on any definite point to the degree to which the attempt on Presi-dent Garfield’s life has been. Hardly any one who has spoken or written about it has confined himself to a simple expression of horror or sympathy. Nearly every one finds a moral in it, and the moral is that our system of appointment to office must be changed. We do not think we have taken up a newspaper during the last ten days which has not in some manner made the crime the product of ‘the spoils system.” There has hardly been an allusion to it in the pulpit which has not pointed to the spoils system as the fons et origo mali. In fact, the crime seems to have acted on public opinion very like a spark n a powder-magazine. It has fallen on a mass of popular indignation all ready to explode. It did not, we now plainly see, find the public ignorant or indifferent regarding the abuses of the civil service. The attempt on the President’s life has not been treated as proof that there is something grievously wrong with our mode of appointing to office, because it is nothing of the kind. A crazy fellow might conceive himself aggrieved by the working of the best conceivable mode of appointment to office, and proceed to avenge himself by assassination. He might, for instance, think himself unjustly dismissed for gross incom-petency or misconduct, or he might think that promotion had been withheld from him which he had fairly earned, or that in a competitive examination he had been unjustly marked. The act of a madman or a weak-minded man never proves anything except that the man is mad or weak-minded.

Guiteau’s offence has, therefore, not, been accepted as evidence of something which people doubted or did not know, but as a striking and dreadful illustration of the wroking of an evil of which they had known for a long time. The extraordinary unanimity of the expressions of opinion about the origin of the crime, and the wideness of the area over which they have been uttered, and the almost complete absence of any counter opinion, show very clearly how small and uninfluential that portion of the public which is inter-ested in the perpetuation of the spoils system really is. Nobody, so far as our observa-tion has gone, has come forward in its defence. No man or newspaper has ventured to deny the connection of Guiteau’s crime with the system. All the other inferences from it have been a good deal gainsaid; but nobody has risen up to maintain that as “it was the best civil service on this planet,” it was absurd to condemn it because a man who had unsuccessfully tried to enter it had sought to avenge himself by an attempt on the Presi-dent’s life. Nor has any one come forward and declared that, inasmuch as it is “as good as the civil service of any European country,” Guiteau’s crime no more suggested the need of alteration in it than in that of Great Britain or France. Nor do any of the philoso-phers who used to declare that the spoils system was a useful, original, and purely American system, peculiarly adapted to the needs of a democratic country, now pro-claim that it would be as silly to propose changing it because a disappointed office-seeker had tried to murder the President, as it would be to propose abolishing universal suffrage because there were occasional frauds at the elections. These various classes of defenders of the spoils system undoubtedly exist: we have heard from them fre-quently within the last five years through one channel or another; but they are now si-lent. Not one of them has lifted up his voice to protest against the gross perversion of the popular indignation which must to them certainly seem involved in the use now made of Guiteau’s crime by the civil-service reformers.

This shows two things: one is that they are conscious of their numerical weakness, and the other is that, though they love the spoils system as much as ever, they will never venture to defend it before an aroused and attentive public. Their speeches and articles on its behalf are all addressed to a public which they suppose to be apathetic or indif-ferent.

If we are right in assuming that Guiteau’s crime has satisfied the American people not that the civil service needs reforming — for that they knew already — but that something must now be done to reform it, the question, “what they are going to do about it,” is one that must by this time be suggesting itself to thousands. It is hardly possible that the ex-citement about the President’s condition will be allowed to die out without doing some-thing toward turning away the attention of the whole class to which Guiteau belongs — the class of shiftless, crackbrained adventurers — from the public service as a means of livelihood. It ought to be so organized and administered that the Guiteaus, when “down on their luck,” or “clean broke,” would no more think of a Government office as a last re-source than of the pastorate of an up-town church. But no such change will be effected in it — no change of any kind will be effected in it — if the people content themselves with dolorous denunciation. We must have action that will result in legislation. Those, then, who are most impressed by the bearing of the Washington tragedy on the question of civil-service reform should, now that their minds are beginning to be relieved of anxiety about the President’s condition, make action of some sort an expression of their thank-fulness for his recovery. To prepare for action they must ask themselves what they seek; and when they have found out, they ought to seek it with all their might.

Two bills were introduced into the last Congress dealing with the whole question of ap-pointments and removals from office and promotions in office, and with the assess-ments of officeholders. They were carefully drawn. No objection, so far as we know, has been made to their constitutionality or to their practicability. In fact, they have not been opposed by anybody in Congress, but they will never be passed as long as Congress-men do not believe that the public wants them passed. Probably ninety-nine hundredths of those who during the past six weeks have been inveighing against the spoils system have no knowledge whatever either of this or of any other attempt to abolish the spoils system, and have never sought, and are not now seeking, any information on the sub-ject. Had these rules been in force during the last year President Garfield would during the last four months have had all his time for the real duties of his office, as would the members of his Cabinet. The rows within the party about offices would never have oc-curred. There would have been no “Stalwarts” or “Half-Breeds,” and no Guiteau. There would have been no deadlock at Albany. There would have been no Platt and no Conk-ling such as we now see them. There would have been none of the scandal and dis-grace which the crime of July a has brought on popular government, The popular inter-est which has ever since the inauguration been mainly centred on a series of degrading personal quarrels would have been bestowed on the score of questions of the highest national interest which are now vainly awaiting solution.

The Fund for Mrs. Garfield

The profound sympathy universally felt for the President and his family makes any criti-cism of a movement to give that feeling a substantial expression seem at the first blush a little ungracious. Nevertheless, the suggestions as to the proposed fund for the benefit of Mrs. Garfield made in the letter, from a prominent member of the Chamber of Com-merce, published in the Evening Post last Saturday, contain food for reflection on the part of the gentlemen engaged in promoting the subscription. As the writer says:

“Every man of generous feeling has had his emotions gratefully quickened by the movement started in the Chamber to raise a liberal fund to be given to the wife and chil-dren of the President of the United States under the impending danger which threatens them, and no one wishes to say a word that may tend to repress so benevolent a pur-pose.”

But the movement, which appeared a natural and spontaneous outburst as long as the chances seemed to be that the President would die, begins to wear a somewhat differ-ent aspect now that his recovery has become probable. The correspondent suggests an objection to the proposed fund, derived from the constitutional prohibition of any in-crease of the President’s salary during the period for which he was elected, and the de-nial to him of all right to receive “any other emolument from the United States or any of them.” He points out that it was the intention of these clauses to secure the President from all sinister exterior influence (and, we may add, from the suspicion of any such in-fluence), and asks whether we may not, under the effect of the generous impulse in-spired by the calamity, and by the suffering of the President and his family, be in danger of violating at least the spirit of this law. He suggests that a private agreement ought to have been made between the donors of the money that, in case of a fatal termination, the proposed sum should be given to the family of the President, and that this intention might have been communicated to him “without giving names that could embarrass him in the future, or impair his official or personal independence.” But even this, he thinks, “might give the President serious trouble hereafter, and prove a curse rather than a blessing.”

It is, in fact, clear that the President’s recovery will make his relation to the fund a very peculiar and delicate one, and on many accounts it is for his interest and that of the pub-lic that this should be frankly discussed by the press in advance. In the event of the President’s death the whole matter would become one exclusively of taste and senti-ment. If Congress should neglect to make a suitable provision for the President’s widow, there can he no doubt that a call for a popular subscription would he heartily responded to; and even if it should not neglect to do this, the question of making her a substantial gift, which, in our opinion, could not be too large, would he one entirely between the do-nors and herself. No public interests of any kind would be affected. The differences be-tween this and the case of the President’s recovery have seemed so obvious to one or two of the subscribers that they have made their subscriptions conditional upon his death. In case of his recovery it will, of course, be very difficult to distinguish between a gilt to the President and a gift to the President’s wife. The plan of putting the money in trust does not remove this difficulty. A substantial addition to the resources of the one is practically a substantial addition to the resources of the other.

The change in its form from a private to a national subscription can have little or no ef-fect upon this. It necessarily remains, as it originated, a fund set on foot by a number of well-known capitalists. That these gentlemen are simply animated by a generous sym-pathy does not alter this fact it is just this association that renders it the duty of the President’s friends to point out the inferences that will be drawn from it hereafter. Among the subscribers are men interested in the promotion by legislation at Washington of pri-vate enterprises of all sorts. This legislation must come before the President for ap-proval or disapproval, and it is of the utmost importance not merely that he should be subject to no private bias in favor of the promoters of such enterprises, but that he should not he open to any suspicion of such bias. The general sympathy with him in his present critical condition should not blind us to the fact that his acts will hereafter be criticised with all the fierceness and ingenuity that party spirit can supply, and that the acceptance of money by his wife at the hands of men who are knocking every year at the doors of Congress for favors will be a handle for his enemies which they will not ne-glect to use. Human nature being what it is, no matter how high the reputation of a President for integrity may he, it is impossible to prove to the satisfaction of one who doubts it that his signature or veto of a bill is unaffected by the recollection of a pecuni-ary benefit derived from its promoters and it is this impossibility which made all the Presidents who had occupied the White House down to General Grant’s time so sensi-tive on the subject of gifts. It is safe to say that the admirers and well-wishers of the President will do well to proceed very cautiously in the matter. While they can afford to disregard all criticism of their own motives in starting the subscription, they certainly cannot afford to disregard the criticisms to which the scheme, if carried out, is sure to subject the President. If he recovers, the necessity and duty of making a pecuniary pro-vision for his family will not seem so obvious as it did when he appeared to be lying at the point of death, and the objections to such a provision by means of a fund such as is now proposed will seem every day more clear and distinct. It would be a very serious embarrassment to him."

Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Ad Policy

Hundreds stood in silence at the steps of the county courthouse while Christian Carter, a recent high-school graduate and organizer of his school’s walkout for gun violence, read from a poem by Antwon Rose, the 17-year-old black teenager who earlier that week was shot in the back by police as he ran away from them, unarmed. This story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words. For more Student Nation, check out our archive.

“I am confused and afraid / I wonder what path I will take / I hear that there’s only two ways out / I see mothers bury their sons / I want my mom to never feel that pain,” he read, and the crowd let out a collective groan. “I am confused and afraid.”

Shortly after responding to a shooting the night of June 19, East Pittsburgh police spotted a car they say resembled one seen leaving the scene with bullet holes in its rear windows. When police pulled the car over to conduct a traffic stop, Antwon and another young man ran from the car. An East Pittsburgh police officer shot Antwon three times in the back as he ran away unarmed, as a harrowing video taken by a witness showed. The officer responsible for the shooting, recently identified as Officer Michael Rosfeld, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Police later determined the car carrying Antwon prior to his death was a jitney, or informal cab, and had no involvement in the prior shooting.

The rally’s organizers—which, among several, included Youth Power Collective, a group launched by the organizers of Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts high school’s walkouts to protest gun violence—called for an open investigation into the circumstances that led to Antwon’s death. The speakers made frequent reference to the history of gun violence and police violence in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

Summer Lee, Democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, reminded the crowd that five other students in the Woodland Hills School District have lost their lives to gun violence since September 2017. Attorney Joel Sansone, who in 2014 represented 18-year-old Jordan Miles after three undercover police officers wrongfully arrested him as he walked to his grandmother’s house, beating him until his face was swollen and bruised, reminded those who had gathered about the long-running epidemic of police violence in the city.

“It was almost 20 years ago that I stood by the coffin of a 12-year-old black boy named Michael Ellerbe. Not far from here, they shot that boy in the back. He was unarmed. All he had in his pocket was a piece of candy,” he said. “I’ve been in this struggle for 35 years. There was no crowd for Michael Ellerbe. There was no crowd for Jordan Miles. You people are here because you know what’s happening,… I’ve been waiting 35 years for you people,” Sansone told the crowd. “Where have you been?” Current Issue View our current issue

The night before, hundreds of protesters had shut down Braddock Avenue, the street in front of the police station in Pittsburgh East, where Rose had been shot. By 7 pm, all traffic on the street had stopped. Confused motorists exited their cars to observe the growing numbers accumulating at the intersection, where the protesters made speeches and led chants. They stayed long into the evening, even after the rain began to pour. “Minorities, and not just black people, but minorities feel like the police are the biggest terrorist group in the nation,” Taylor Williams, 23, told The Nation. “It feels like we back in the 1800s, and we modern day slaves.”

A volunteer trauma response team led by Rev. Paul Abernathy in partnership with the Allegheny County Health Department provided “psychological first aid,” to the members of the impromptu protest. “In the aftermath of gun violence, our communities are held hostage to their own fears, the uncertainty, certainly the wounds that run very deep,” he said. “[It’s] not just one incident, but another chapter in a very long, sad story”

At the rally the following afternoon, where Rose’s poem was read, activists called on Pittsburghers to vote District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. out of office. “This is a referendum on District Attorney Stephen Zappala,” Jasiri X of 1Hood Media told the crowd, calling him to account for failing to bring charges against police officers accused of using excessive force in the past, and charging the unarmed black survivors of police violence instead.

In 2012, Zappala declined to press charges against three police officers accused of brutally beating Jordan Miles in 2010, while Miles’s charges, later dismissed by a judge, included resisting arrest and aggravated assault.

Similarly, Zappala did not charge the police officers responsible for shooting and paralyzing unarmed black man Leon Ford during a 2012 traffic stop, but did charge Ford with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, escape, and resisting arrest. Ford was acquitted of the aggravated assault charges, and Zappala ultimately dropped the others.

The organizers also called for a county-wide civilian police oversight board, citing the vast bureaucratic complications and loopholes that come with the county’s 130 self-governing municipalities.

The demographics of registered voters have impacted the legal system, activists pointed out. “I had a jury of all white people,” said Leon Ford, who addressed the crowd in an emotional speech. “A jury pool of over 100 people and zero African Americans. Some people told me it was a conspiracy. When I asked them if they were registered to vote, they said no. So how you gonna be on my jury pool if you ain’t registered to vote?”

The mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh’s Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, had stood in the rain at the protest the night before. “I knew the young man. He actually appeared in my campaign commercial.

Magdiel Sanchez, a 35-year-old Latino man, was sitting on his porch in Oklahoma City on Tuesday night as two law-enforcement officers approached his house. He got up and walked toward them, when, according to news reports and a statement, the officers noticed he was holding a metal pipe. They started giving him “verbal commands” to lie down, then one fired his Taser and the other shot him in the chest with his sidearm. Sanchez died. Officers later claimed not to have heard neighbors shouting that Sanchez was deaf and couldn’t hear their commands. Ad Policy

The police were there because allegedly Sanchez’s father had been in a hit-and-run (injuring property, not people, if the accusations are true). Sanchez carried the pipe, neighbors said, to ward off dogs. He was deaf and reportedly developmentally disabled. In a statement, the ACLU said, “Magdiel Sanchez was shot at his own home, without having committed any crime, and in front of neighbors who knew he was deaf trying to communicate to the police that what they were about to do was wrong.”

Sanchez is far from the first deaf or disabled person to be killed or brutalized by police. It happens almost every day. According to The Washington Post, police have shot 165 people in mental-health crisis in the first 263 days this year (and 715 total). When you add people like Sanchez and individuals with invisible, undiagnosed, or unrevealed disabilities, the numbers start to get much higher. In a white paper I co-wrote in 2016 for the Ruderman Family Foundation, I noted that disability-rights advocates routinely argue that a third to a half of all people killed by police are disabled. Most of those people, especially in cases where police clearly misused lethal force, turn out to also be marginalized by race, class, gender orientation, or other factors that intensify vulnerability.

Sanchez is actually the second high-profile killing of a disabled person just this week (and the fourth probable case, with Eric Alvarez, possibly in mental-health crisis, killed on a Los Angeles highway, and naval officer Nicholas Perkins killed outside his home in Washington after he would not put down a long gun). Georgia Tech campus police killed Scout Schultz, a trans and intersex activist who had been expressing suicidal thoughts. They had called 911 to report themselves as a person with a knife and possibly a gun. After police shot and killed Schultz, the officers found only a closed Leatherman multi-tool. The specifics of each case matter. Each victim’s life deserves to be mourned. Most cases are more like the Perkins situation than the Sanchez one. Still, when it comes to body count, this was a pretty typical week. Related Article Disability-Rights Activists Are the Real Heroes of the Health-Care Fight John Nichols

I first wrote about disability and policing for The Nation in 2013. I’m not sure anything has improved since then. The people who have been working on this the longest, people like the lawyer Talila Lewis and the organization HEARD and artist and activist Leroy Moore, remain unfunded, even as organizations pour money into trainings for cops. But police don’t need training to choose not to shoot folks like Sanchez. They just have to stop treating noncompliance as a justification for escalation.

Another story of police force and disability, thankfully not involving a fatality, made news this week. The abuse of Connor Leibel, a white, autistic teenager, perfectly demonstrates the ways that escalation in the face of noncompliance puts disabled people in danger every time they encounter the cops. In fact, what I call the cult of compliance puts everyone in danger, if not equally.

Leibel was walking down the sidewalk in an affluent part of Buckeye, Arizona. He first appears on the body cam video as he’s shaking a string in a mild rhythmic motion with his left hand. Officer David Grossman of the Buckeye police department, steps out of the car and approaches the boy, asking him what he’s doing. “I’m stimming,” he says. “I stim with a string.” Within a few minutes, Grossman has Leibel down on the ground, cuffed. “I’m OK, I’m OK,” the boy says to himself, but eventually starts to scream. Later, other officers would arrive, find Leibel’s caregiver nearby, and restore order. Leibel suffered bruises and abrasions. Grossman, reportedly a DUI recognition expert, has claimed in his report that he thought the boy was on drugs. Buckeye Police did not respond to requests for comment. Current Issue View our current issue

I took this video particularly personally. My son, a 10-year-old with Down syndrome, also likes to shake things as he stims. His hands are often wrapped around plastic “Mardi Gras” beads, shaking in a kind of circular motion. It’s mesmerizing to watch. He has a pattern that moves the beads from a spin to a drop straight down and then into a slight circle. It’s not typical behavior, but it’s quintessential to my son’s identity. It should not be criminalized.

I reached out to Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. Via e-mail, she told me that stimming is normal. “If you’ve ever tapped your fingers against a counter while you were waiting, congratulations, you’ve stimmed. Autistic people tend to stim more often and more intensely. Stimming helps us process the sensory input we’re gathering, stay calm and grounded in an overwhelming universe, and express joy, distress, or whatever we might be feeling.”

Bascom notes that stimming is often treated as aberrant or undesirable behavior by authority figures—not just police, but also teachers and parents. “That said, and this is important,” she continued, this case is not about lack of awareness regarding autism. “Regardless of why he was stimming, this young man should never have been approached at all. ‘Bouncing around’ isn’t a crime. Being autistic in public isn’t a crime. There was absolutely no justification for this young man to be stopped, and obviously no reason for him to have been restrained or slammed to the ground.”

Alex S. Vitale, author of The End of Policing, agrees. He told me that, beyond the issues of disability and policing, “This all starts as a self-directed search for drugs. And since drugs are conceived of [as] automatically dangerous and illegal, the police approach people as dangerous and a threat to be controlled. As soon as the young person said, ‘I’m fine,’ that should have been the end of it.” Both he and Bascom, as well as numerous other experts I consulted from the disability-rights and police-reform movements emphasized that this is not a matter of lacking training, but rather the criminalization of any behavior deemed abnormal or undesirable.

Back to Sanchez, we see similar patterns of police conduct, this time with horrible, lethal, consequences. Sara Nović‏, who identifies as Deaf and is an assistant professor of creative writing at Stockton University, told me via e-mail that the killing emerged from a “perfect storm of communication anxiety for many d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing people.” It’s hard to talk to strangers, especially when the stakes are high. It was also dark. She notes, “Even the most skilled deaf communicators/lipreaders struggle in the dark. It is only natural that Sanchez would try to get closer so he could see what was going on, especially because he’d had no involvement in the traffic incident they were investigating. He was sitting on his porch minding his own business; he’d done nothing wrong.” But he didn’t—couldn’t—comply with orders, so a police officer killed him.

So what do we do? When incidents like these happen, departments and some advocates often focus on two deeply troubling solutions: training and registries. Both are based on the idea that police just don’t recognize disability when they see it, or don’t know what to do if they recognize it. Instead, we need to reframe policing, decriminalize noncompliance, and remove police from as many situations as possible.

In abstract, training is a fine thing. Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training was developed in the 1980s in Memphis and has now spread around the country. I’ve sat through many hours of CIT training in states such as Texas, Maryland, and Illinois. The quality of instruction varies, but the curriculum is constant: Hours spent describing disabilities, what it’s like to be disabled, and then some (actually pretty good) role-playing exercises. Many states have implemented developmental-disability specific training, including (as noted in The New York Times), autism programs. It’s good for police to know what a mental-health crisis is, that autistic people might not look you in the eye, and how to find resources.

At the same time, trainings send the message that the problem is behavior in cases related to disability, rather than core issues related to quick escalation. If a person with autism shouldn’t be brutalized for shaking a string, neither should a drug user. If a deaf person shouldn’t be shot for not hearing commands, neither should a person wearing ear buds. These trainings are also not free, and every dollar spent on policing could be spent elsewhere. A year ago, the Department of Health and Human Services gave Chicago a million dollars to address trauma in the communities. The city spent most of it on police training, not on the communities.

The second suggestion, registries of disabled people, is even more concerning. There have long been advocates for making lists of disabled people to give police more information, but people should not have to hand their names to the police to be guaranteed basic civil rights. Most recently, an app called Vitals has been making news. It allows police to read personal data off an chip that one can wear. “It’s the Mutant Registration Act,” said Rebecca Cokley, former executive director of the National Council on Disability, referring to a bill from the comic series X-Men that required individuals with super powers to lodge their identities with the government.

Instead of training police to grant people they recognize as disabled specific rights, victims like Leibel and Sanchez demonstrate the need for police to operate with a baseline of presumption of compliance. When significant threats emerge, as does tragically happen, officers will need to respond. But when Sanchez walked forward, surely the officers could have stepped back. When the autistic boy was shaking his string, the officer could have just decided not to cuff a child, even if he didn’t recognize the word “stimming.” There are so many ways to improve the situation without asking for specialized training.

At least four disabled people died at the hands of police this week. One previous case of unjustified police violence came to light. Except for the brief media attention of the Sanchez and Leibel cases, that’s a pretty normal week. It’s unlikely anyone will be held accountable, except possibly in the situation where Leibel, a white teenager in an affluent neighborhood, was brutalized. There, the combination of powerful video, a compelling victim, widespread coverage, and a good lawyer might help. In the other cases, the multiply marginalized status of the victims plus the lethality of the encounter will make accountability difficult, if not impossible. And then next week, alas, the same types of stories will play out again, and more people will die."

Kill the Messenger, a movie starring Jeremy Renner, just opened, about the life and death of Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Gary Webb, who committed suicide in 2004. Webb came late to the Iran/Contra scandal, long after most of the mainstream media had moved on. In 1996, he wrote a three-part series for the San Jose Mercury News, “Dark Alliance,” that exposed the distribution network, which included the Nicaraguan Contras, responsible for supplying the cocaine that helped kick off South Central Los Angeles’s crack epidemic. Ad Policy

The allegations were not new. Earlier, in the 1980s, Robert Parry and Brian Barger reported on the story for AP, which was picked up by then freshman Senator John Kerry, who in 1988 released an extensively documented committee report showing the ways the Contras, backed by Ronald Reagan’s White House, were turning Central America into a transshipment point for Colombian cocaine, using the drug revenue to fund their war on the Sandinistas. Webb’s report specifically looked at what happened to cocaine once it entered the United States.

Rather than follow up on Webb’s findings—and on Kerry’s and Parry’s earlier investigation—The New York Times, The Washington Post and, especially, the Los Angeles Times went after Webb, destroying his reputation and driving him out of the profession and into a suicidal depression.

I haven’t seen Kill the Messenger yet, but there’s no doubt that it sides with Webb. That seems to have unsettled David Carr, the media critic for The New York Times. Last week, in an anguished, deeply ambivalent assessment of Webb’s legacy, Carr admitted that the thrust of what Webb wrote about “really happened,” making passing reference to Kerry’s “little-noticed 1988 Senate subcommittee report.” Carr tentatively suggests that perhaps journalists should have better spent their energy reporting the larger story, rather than relentlessly fact-checking Webb. At the same time, though, he presented the campaign that ultimately drove Webb to his death as a “he-said-she-said-who-can-ultimately-say?” matter of interpretation, given ample space to Webb’s tormentors, like Tim Golden, who wielded the hatchet for The New York Times, and the odious Jerry Ceppos, the executive editor of the San Jose Mercury News who, faced with unrelenting pressure from the big boys in NY, LA and Washington, betrayed Webb.

Such is the state of media criticism that Carr could make notice of Kerry’s “little-noticed” Senate report without pointing out the obvious: it was “little-noticed” because newspapers, like his, little noticed it. Alexander Cockburn, Carr isn’t. Maybe he was trying for understated irony. As many of Webb’s defenders have noted, if journalists had put half the passion into following up the implications of that report that they put to discrediting Webb, we’d know a lot more about the darkest side of America’s national security state. Peter Kornbluh: “If the major media had devoted the same energy and ink to investigating the contra drug scandal in the 1980s as they did attacking the Mercury News in 1996, Gary Webb might never have had his scoop.”

Carr’s worst offense against Webb—other than not mentioning that Webb had won a Pulitzer Prize, for his work with a team of reporters investigation the 1989 San Francisco earthquake—is that he blames Webb himself for his downfall: “Mr. Webb was open to attack in part because of the lurid presentation of the story and his willingness to draw causality based on very thin sourcing and evidence. He wrote past what he knew.”

No. Webb was open to attack because the Los Angeles Times alone assigned seventeen reporters to leverage the inherent mysteries of the national security state to cast doubt on Webb. As Nick Schou, author of the book, Kill the Messenger, on which the movie is based, writes, “Much of the [Los Angeles] Times’ attack was clever misdirection, but it ruined Webb’s reputation: In particular, the L.A. Times attacked a claim that Webb never made: that the CIA had intentionally addicted African-Americans to crack.”

Webb won’t be vindicated by the movie Kill the Messenger because he has already been vindicated by serious nonfiction reporters, like Schou and others. And by history itself. Webb was documenting one aspect of the blowback that we all have been living with from Iran/Contra, which is really just shorthand for Reagan’s broader set of Central American policies. Central America was the place the national security state got its groove back after Vietnam, and the repercussions are ongoing: among them, the rise of Salvadoran and Honduran transnational gangs, the drug war, which has turned the Colombian-Central American-Mexican corridor into a war zone, the 2009 Honduran coup, and this summer’s exodus of Central American child refugees.

Did Webb write “past what he knew”? Of course he did. He was writing about the covert activities of the rogue National Security Council and CIA and their shadowy relations with drug runners! As John Kerry complained in 1998, after being allowed to read a classified CIA investigation, launched as a result of Webb’s reporting: “Some of us in Congress at the time, in 1985, 1986, were calling for a serious investigation of the charges, and C.I.A. officials did not join in that effort…. There was a significant amount of stonewalling. I’m afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld.” “Scant proof,” sniffed Golden, in his New York Times take-down of Webb.

Webb provides a fascinating account of his “hours-long conversations with editors that bordered on the surreal” in an essay titled “The Mighty Wurlitzer Plays On,” in which they relentlessly presented him with unprovable hypotheticals: “’How do we know for sure that these drug dealers were the first big ring to start selling crack in South Central?’ editor Jonathan Krim pressed me during one such confab…. ‘Isn’t it possible there might have been someone else and they never got caught and no one ever knew about them? In that case, your story would be wrong.’ I had to take a deep breath to keep from shouting. ‘If you’re asking me whether I accounted for people who might never have existed, the answer is no,’ I said.”

Schou writes that because “Webb shot himself in the head twice—the first bullet simply went through his cheek—many falsely believe the CIA killed him.” Webb was apparently depressed that he couldn’t get a job that paid enough to let him keep his house.

But staring too long into the abyss that is Iran/Contra is bad for one’s mental health. The artist Mark Lombardi drew constellation-like renderings of the paramilitary and para-financial scandals, scandals that have increased in frequency with the spread of neoliberalism. These include Iran/Contra, BCCI and Harken Energy, Savings and Loan, many of them involving the Bush family. Lombardi too killed himself, in 2000.

It is easy to fall down the rabbit hole, or into a James Ellroy novel, trying to draw the connections. Iran/Contra is like the Da Vinci Code of the national security state, and reading any one paragraph of the Kerry Committee Report can send minds reeling:

In a June 26, 1987 closed session of the Subcommittee, Milian Rodriguez testified that in a meeting arranged by Miami private detective Raoul Diaz with Felix Rodriguez, he (Milian) offered to provide drug money to the Contras. Milian Rodriguez stated that Felix accepted the offer and $10 million in such assistance was subsequently provided the Contras through a system of secret couriers.

Félix Rodríguez is, of course, the Cuban exile CIA agent who hunted down Che Guevara in Bolivia. The relationship of narcotics and covert ops goes back at least to the Opium Wars of the nineteenth century, but a key moment in the Cold War history of that relationship took place with the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which broadcast the Cuban drug mafia throughout all of the Americas, allying their interests with anti-Castro counterrevolutionaries and CIA spooks. That alliance mutated and metastasized, infecting different places at different times, including Colombia, Bolivia, Panama, Honduras and South Central Los Angeles.

Inevitably, the reporting of Webb and the art of Lombardi raise the specter of conspiracy. But conspiracy theorists, in their worst, most compulsive form, are obsessed with proving the detail, establishing the single link, after which everything will make sense. Webb and Lombardi, in contrast, stepped back to see the bigger picture and consider the moral meaning of the connections they were making."

Last week, Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the US State Department, was asked if she had comment on “Israeli soldiers at checkpoints targeting Palestinian soccer players.” She said, “I haven’t seen that. Obviously, we spoke to our concerns [about checkpoint violence] again, in the same Human Rights Report about certain actions and behavior…. I will check that out.” Ad Policy

“Checking out” what is happening to Palestinian soccer players would be well advised, and not only for Ms. Psaki. Last week, I received what could best be described as an overwhelmingly hostile response to my article on a recent shooting by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) of two youth soccer players, and how this could affect the extremely perilous position Israel finds itself in the international soccer federation, FIFA. My piece went through the Palestinian Football Association’s very underreported push to get Israel removed from FIFA. Their appeal has been gaining support and will be raised formally at FIFA’s meeting in Brazil. The second part of my article centered around the aforementioned recent shooting of two young soccer players in their feet outside of an IDF checkpoint. The IDF claimed that the two young men had a bomb, something that they deny. My article aimed to show that this incident, alongside the jailing, injuring and killing of prominent members of the Palestinian national soccer team would have the effect of adding fuel to the movement to have Israel removed from FIFA.

I expected to get the typical barrage of hate mail from the usual suspects: the darkest corners of the Internet that believe on principle that Palestinian life is cheap if not entirely without value. At most, these e-mails are as nettlesome as spam.

The part of the response that was truly jarring however was the numerous private queries I received from prominent members of the media. I am choosing to keep their identities private because their correspondence to me was private and I will respect that. The queries contained no curiosity about Israel’s possible expulsion from FIFA. They all instead openly doubted that the shooting of the two young men had even taken place. Was I sure this really happened? When I pointed to my initial sources, the response by numerous people was, “Do you have any sources that are not Palestinian?” One person, writing for a major sports website, sent me numerous queries that I did not respond to, and then when the facts of the shooting appeared in the Israeli paper Haaretz, said to me, “Forget previous queries. I see news of the shooting on Haaretz. Never mind.” The assumption of mendacity affixed to Palestinian sources spoke volumes.

The other part of my story that people accused of being untrue was my theory that members of the Palestinian soccer community are being targeted for violence by the Israeli state. This was described to me as “laughable,” “ridiculous,” and one even said that they would reach out to The Nation directly to agitate for dismissal.

Yes it is certainly true that I don’t have a document signed by Benjamin Netanyahu calling for a systematic attack on the Palestinian national team. What I do have are names: real people, with real families, whose lives and deaths are testament to a story that needs to be told.

There was Ayman Alkurd. He was a 34-year-old member of the Palestinian national soccer team. Alkurd was killed during the 2009 Operation Cast Lead when a missile was sent into his home in Gaza. There was Wajeh Moshtahe, another national team member. He was killed in his home during Operation Cast Lead as well. He was only 24. There was Shadi Sbakhe, another national team member who suffered the same fate. All three, in fact, died within seventy-two hours of one another. They reminded many, at the time of their deaths, of Tariq Al Quto, described by the BBC as “a talented midfielder,” who was killed by the IDF in 2004.

Then there are the imprisoned. We can start with Omar Abu Rios, the former starting goalkeeper for the national team. He was arrested at age 23 for allegedly being part of an attack on Israeli troops at the Amari Palestinian refugee camp near Ramallah. He was, according to Chairman of the Palestinian Football Association Jibril al-Rajoub, “arrested at work and taken to an unknown location.” Rajoub appealed directly to FIFA chief Sepp Blatter on Rios’s behalf, saying that his arrest “was in total disregard of all agreements signed by the Israeli side and in direct violation to the simplest right of our players.”

There was also Muhammad Nimr, a top 23-year-old striker and national team member, who had his house destroyed by the IDF and was then jailed without charges being filed. Nimr’s story echoed that of another striker, Zakaria Issa, who had been jailed for sixteen years before being released in 2013 when he was struck with terminal cancer.

Then there was Mahmoud Sarsak. Sarsak was a defender on the national team who was arrested and jailed without charges while trying to cross a checkpoint in order to join his teammates. His plight became an international cause when the Palestinian national team member went on a three-month hunger strike while being held in an Israeli prison. He was released in July 2012. As he said at a meeting in England upon his release, “Israel actively attempts to stop sportsmen and women competing, and there are a large number of athletes in prison…. Since 2008 we have seen Israel detain a number of sportsmen who were arrested under the administrative detention laws—meaning no charges need be brought. They never have to go to trial.”

This is reality for the Palestinian national team: four dead by Israeli munitions and—at least—three jailed in Israeli prisons without trial over the last decade. I have no idea whether people will see this as constituting a “targeting” of the Palestinian soccer players. I do believe that it is our job as sports journalists to ask the questions. There can be no doubt that we would press for more information if those killed and jailed were members of the Spanish national team, the German national team, the Brazilian national team or, heaven forfend, the US national team. Israel’s future in FIFA should depend on its answering these questions, but they only get answered if they are asked.

Yes, it is understandable why looking to FIFA for any kind of moral guidance is laughable. The locations of the next two World Cups, Russia and Qatar, contain enough human rights violations to keep Amnesty International busy until the next century. But attacks on athletes themselves need to be, pardon the expression, a red line for all international sporting bodies: a red line no country should be allowed to cross."

Newly-minted New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is engaged in a political and ideological charm offensive — moving left from the centrist (and in some cases Republican-lite) position she occupied as a member of the House.

Gillbrand, who was a National Rifle Association ally during her term as a representative from upstate New York, is now saying she will work with New York Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, a potential 2010 Democratic primary foe, to pass gun-control legislation.

And, under pressure from Latino legislators, the senator who was appointed last week by New York Governor David Paterson to fill Hillary Clinton’s vacant seat has begun to moderate anti-immigrants stances that led the newspaper El Diario to editorialize: “If Gov. David Paterson wanted to deliver a slap to immigrant New Yorkers, he effectively did so with his appointment yesterday of Representative Kirsten Gillibrand.”

It seems that Gillibrand, concerned about the threat of a Democratic primary challenge and the potential loss of progressive support in a fall race, is showing some willingness to move away from her Blue Dog Democrats stances.

Labor unions, which will be key to Gillibrand’s success or failure, should seek some clear commitments now on trade policy.

As a member of the House, Gillibrand voted with the Bush administration for trade legislation and amendments that were harmful to workers, farmers, the environment and communities in the U.S. and countries with which it trades.

For instance, in 2007, in one of her first trade votes as a member of the House, Gillibrand backed the Peru free trade agreement that was ardently backed by the Bush White House. She did so despite the fact that her more responsible Democratic colleagues — including upstate New York members such as Maurice Hinchey and Louise Slaughter — argued and voted against it.

Speaking of free trade agreements along the lines promoted by the Clinton and Bush administrations, Hinchey has said, “Because they hold our trading partners to much lower standards than are required in the United States, FTAs cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs and erode the bargaining power of our workers.”

Of the Peru agreement, in particular, Oregon Congressman David Wu said, “I regret that I cannot vote for this bill tonight because it does not put human rights on an equal footing with environmental and labor protections.”

In urging a “no” vote on the Peru plan, Michigan Congressman Dale Kildee said, “I appeal especially to my fellow Democrats not to turn their backs on those American workers who suffer from the export of their jobs. They want a paycheck, not an unemployment check.”

Gillibrand rejected that appeal as a member of the House.

She needs to be pressed, now, to make a clear commitment to oppose trade deals that disregard human rights, worker rights and the best interests of communities in the U.S. and abroad. And the labor unions that the new senator will soon be asking for endorsements ought not tender them until they are certain Senator Gillibrand will cast more responsible trade vote than did Congresswoman Gillibrand."

The mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando raised a pressing question—why are civilians so easily able to purchase military-style weapons capable of immense destruction? The public is rightly horrified at the killing power Mateen wielded. At one point he fired 24 shots in nine seconds, and took 49 lives in a remarkably short period of time. Some survivors had calves and forearms blown off entirely by Mateen’s assault rifle. Polls show support for an assault weapon ban ticked up 13 percent after the shooting, with a majority of Americans (57 percent) now supporting one. Ad Policy

Hillary Clinton is speaking to this issue—on Monday, she once again called for the reinstitution of a federal ban on the sale of assault weapons, telling CBS This Morning, “We’ve got to keep weapons of war off our streets.”

In Washington, however, Clinton is standing nearly alone. There will be no imminent movement on assault weapons in Congress, and none of the major gun control groups that have been ascendant since Newtown even have a position on an assault weapons ban.

Senate Democrats did score a rare victory in the gun control fight late Wednesday, after Republicans in the chamber agreed to a vote on two pieces of gun-control legislation following a 14-hour filibuster launched by Senator Chris Murphy. Though the situation is still fluid, as of Thursday morning Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is prepared to allow votes on two bills: one that would deny gun sales to people who are or have been on the terror watch list, and another that would expand federal background checks for gun purchases to online sales and gun shows.

The prospects of the latter bill passing are almost nil (similar legislation couldn’t even clear 60 votes right after Newtown, when Democrats held the chamber), and then it’s not clear the bill targeting suspected terrorists will pass either. This might please civil libertarians, who have well-founded concerns about that legislation.

If Democrats also wanted to push on assault weapons, there are bills at the ready. Representative David Cicilline filed a bill in January, co-sponsored by 125 of his colleagues, that would institute an assault weapons ban. Democratic leadership in the House won’t press for a vote, however. Minority whip Steny Hoyer told The Hill that while a ban on assault weapons was the “surest” way to have prevented what happened in Orlando, “We also know that that legislation is going nowhere.” LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Speaker Paul Ryan surely wouldn’t allow a vote on Cicilline’s legislation, but Democrats could make an issue of it if they chose. They could file for a discharge petition, for example, a parliamentary procedure that allows for the body to force a vote if enough people sign on. A petition on the assault-weapons ban likely wouldn’t get enough signatures to force a vote, but at the least it would put members on the record for or against assault weapons.

According to a congressional source close to the talks, many House Democrats were actively discussing a discharge petition this week. But it doesn’t appear that it will happen.

In the upper chamber, Senator Dianne Feinstein has repeatedly introduced legislation that would ban assault weapons. It received a vote after Newtown, but failed. Senate Democrats The Washington Post earlier this week they may revive that bill, though there are no specific plans so far.

Hoyer is not wrong that an assault weapons ban would go “nowhere” (though neither will legislation closing the gun-show loophole). But lawmakers have an understandable tendency to work towards only the most immediately achievable goals.

That’s not generally true of outside pressure groups—and yet, none of the major pro–gun control organizations are joining Clinton’s call either. None of the three most politically active groups—the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Americans for Responsible Solutions, founded by former Representative Gabby Giffords, nor Everytown for Gun Safety, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s organization—even have an official position on whether assault weapons should be banned.

A spokesman for the Brady Campaign told The Nation the group believes “the single greatest opportunity” to cut gun deaths in half by 2025 “is by taking sensible steps to keep all guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, terrorists, felons, and dangerously mentally ill people by closing the terror gap, expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales, and shutting down the ‘bad apple’ gun dealers.” He added that the Brady Campaign does “value the important conversations taking place about keeping weapons of war off our streets.”

Similarly, representatives for Everytown for Gun Safety, which figures to be a major player in the 2016 television ad wars on gun control, confirmed to The Nation that the organization “take[s] no position on types of firearms.” Kate Folmar, the group’s deputy communications director, added, “It’s important to note that despite the focus on [assault weapons] after major events, they are not used in the majority of mass shootings and not in the big picture of gun violence in America. Handguns are the problem.”

Folmar is right on both counts, though, as she added, assault rifles “put the ‘mass’ in mass shootings.” They are not used in the majority of shootings where four or more people are shot at once, but they are the hallmark of headline-grabbing mass shootings like Orlando, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Columbine.

Assault weapons are also a huge financial boon to the larger gun industry. Gun sales were actually in a decades-long decline until somewhat recently, due to the declining popularity of hunting and an aging population of gun owners. Between 1980 and 2000, the US population grew 24 percent while small domestic arms production fell 33 percent.

The industry turned this around by pressing for concealed carry laws, aggressively marketing guns to young consumers—and by ramping up the production of assault weapons and marketing them as ultra-cool products that the average consumer can own to be just like police or members of the military. (This campaign is aided by the apocalyptic language increasingly used by both the NRA and now Donald Trump painting guns as necessary instruments in future combat against terrorists, illegal immigrants, and criminals.)

As Shooting Wire put it in 2008, after several years of expanded sales of assault weapons, “if you’re a company with a strong line of high-capacity pistols and AR-style rifles, you’re doing land office business. If you’re heavily dependent on hunting, you are hurting.”

That makes assault weapons a very useful pressure point for taking on the entire gun industry, not to mention a useful preventive measure against spree killings with double-digit casualties. (These events also boost overall gun sales, it should be noted.)

But for now at least, it appears Clinton will be a lonely voice pushing to ban assault weapons among the institutional gun control movement."

Cleveland—The National Rifle Association sent its top lobbyist, Chris Cox, onto the stage at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night. Keeping with the theme of the proceedings—scary people are coming to kill you—Cox told a little parable: Ad Policy

Imagine a young mother at home with her baby, when a violent predator kicks the door in. He’s a three-time loser who was released from prison early because some politician wanted to show their compassion. What’s she going to do? She’ll dial 911, and pray. The police will do their best to get their quickly, but their average response time is 11 minutes. So the question is, should she be able to defend herself with a firearm in her own home? Of course. Friends, that question is on the ballot in November.

Nothing Hillary Clinton is proposing, or conceivably would propose, would prevent that woman from legally purchasing a gun. But that aside, Cox’s tale was a huge backfire that eviscerated the NRA’s case for more gun ownership and looser laws.

This hypothetical violent predator, after having committed three crimes, could still easily purchase a gun today if he knows how to use Craigslist or find a local gun show. That’s because Republicans in Congress, backed by the NRA’s aggressive lobbying efforts, defeated a legislative package in 2013 that would have expanded universal background checks to online and person-to-person sales. Cox clumsily tried to avoid this point by not actually saying this “three-time loser” was armed, even though it would have made a better story. But it would have further underlined his accidental pro–gun control argument.

Moreover, public-health researchers have reached an inescapable conclusion: More guns means more women die. Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to die from being shot than women in other high-income countries.

The chance of anyone being murdered in a random home invasion like the one Cox depicts are one in several million. It’s vastly more likely this predator would have been the woman’s husband or boyfriend. From 2001 to 2012, 6,410 women were murdered by an intimate partner with a gun, which is more than all US the combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan during those years combined. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

Cox’s intended message was that if the woman had a firearm, she could fend off this attacker. But the self-defense function of women who have guns has never been demonstrated by social science, and research shows the mere presence of a gun during a domestic incident makes murder 500 percent more likely.

The NRA has actively blocked several fixes that would make it harder for domestic abusers to get weapons. Federal laws keep abusive husbands from passing a firearm background check, but doesn’t do the same for abusive dating partners. More women are killed by boyfriends or dating partners than husbands. Republicans, at the urging of the NRA, have blocked changes to federal law.

Cox actually performed a public service by raising the issue of women who are killed by firearms. He just had exactly the wrong plan for fixing it."

Mysterious sniper attacks began occurring all around the Washington, DC, metro area on this day in 2002, a development which, after the attacks of the previous September and the subsequent (though entirely unrelated) scare, scared the daylights out of everybody. They turned out to be the work of a man named John Allen Muhammad and his young accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, whose ultimate goal was the establishment of a terrorist training camp for African-American orphan boys on the Canadian border. The real consequence, however, besides the murders, was the further blurring of the lines between the police and the military, as Patricia Williams wrote in this column from a month after the attacks began, “Home on the Range.” Ad Policy

On other fronts, a sniper is on the rampage in Washington, a tortured ghost for whom the war on terror seems not to be enough. The FBI calls in Army reconnaissance planes to try to find him. This is touted as a fair response under the circumstances, but in the process we Americans quietly witness the ultimate conflation of army and police. Given the reorganization of police power over the past year, it seems almost anticlimactic, reasonable, desirable. And given the urgency of current events, we seem to have abandoned all thought of other, less constraining alternatives. Who needs gun control, goes the popular logic, when we can have the gloriously panoptic control of the military aerially surveilling suburban shopping malls? And, hey, is it really so different from those surveillance cameras the Giuliani administration installed all over Manhattan?… Sometimes things get so crazy that people simply cannot hear through the mass panic of the moment. As we ride out the heightened troubles of these times, as our domestic fears become conflated with international terror, let us work hard not to fall back on the models that have betrayed us so often, of cowboys, of careless verbiage and of blind faith in the culture of guns.

For years, the National Rifle Association has pressed candidates for local and national offices to answer questions about gun control policy. The highly publicized results, which help form a candidate’s often sacred “NRA rating,” not only affect races in the short term but help shape policy long after as politicians are hemmed into a particular position on guns before even taking office. Ad Policy

Now, a leading pro-gun control group is launching a counter-effort: Everytown for Gun Safety, funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will soon present federal candidates in the 2014 midterms with a ten-part questionnaire about gun control policy. Bloomberg has committed to spending $50 million on the midterms, and the questionnaire is a good starting point for evaluating where candidates stand.

In many cases, this is the first time these candidates will be asked in detail about gun control policy. Among the questions, which you can read in full here:

Does the candidate support closing the gun show loophole?

What about loopholes that allow people to buy guns online without a criminal background check?

Does the candidate support increased penalties for straw purchases and gun trafficking?

Should the size of ammunition clips be restricted? (There is no baseline given).

Some of the questions are traps, in a sense, for candidates who normally hew close to the NRA line and oppose any restrictions on gun rights whatsoever. For example, one question asks if the candidate supports laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who have been convicted of stalking or of abusing a dating partner. (Current federal law only prohibits gun ownership by people convicted of spousal abuse, but not domestic violence more generally.) Any sensible answer to the question would be yes, and a “no” answer is a campaign ad waiting to happen.

Other questions are clearly designed to build political support among potential members of the next Congress for things like expanded background checks or even smaller-bore policy items like increased funding for the federal background check database.

But there is one curious omission, especially for a group whose name is supposed to recall the horror of the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut: no question asks about an assault weapons ban. There was notable state-level action around restricting assault weapons after Newtown, but congressional Democrats dropped this from last spring’s major gun control legislation. Apparently Everytown for Gun Safety isn’t too interested in pushing Congress forward on this issue."
