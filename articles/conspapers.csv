Here’s what they passed.

The legislation passed 20-18 and included new gun restrictions, but also made allowances for teachers to carry guns on school premises.

The bill places an age restriction of 21 years from 18 on the purchase of rifles, and also implements a waiting period for the same weapons. While gun rights advocates didn’t like that provision, gun control advocates didn’t like that teachers would be allowed to carry guns in schools, even though that part of the bill was weakened for passage.

“Do I think this bill goes far enough? No! No, I don’t!” said Democratic Senator Lauren Book, who advocated for a ban on AR-15 rifles.

“My community was rocked. My school children were murdered in their classrooms,” she said. “I cannot live with a choice to put party politics above an opportunity to get something done that inches us closer to the place I believe we should be as a state. This is the first step in saying never again.”

CBS News listed other provisions in the bill the Florida Senate passed:

In addition to the gun restrictions and arming some school personnel, it would create new mental health programs for schools, improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies, create a task force to look at mistakes made during mass shootings nationally and then make recommendations on how to continue to improve law, and establish an anonymous tip line where students and others can report threats to schools.

The bill now goes to the Florida state House of Representatives for consideration.

Here’s a local news report on the debate and gun bill:"
blaze1,blaze,"['Chris Enloe', 'Weekend Editor']",2018-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/03/gun-company-that-sells-ar-15-has-perfect-response-to-dicks-sporting-goods-new-firearm-policy,"A South Carolina-based firearm company issued the perfect response to Dick’s Sporting Good’s decision this week to alter its firearms sale policy.

Dick’s announced Wednesday it was ending the sale of “assault-style weapons” in all its stores nationwide. In addition, the company said it would end the sale of high-capacity magazines and stop selling long guns to anyone under 21.

What happened?

Palmetto State Armory, which is based in Columbia, South Carolina, issued a statement to WCBD-TV on Thursday condemning Dick’s for its decision, while injecting truth into the conversation about firearms and “assault rifles.”

What the firearms company really took issue with was Dick’s apparent firearms ignorance. The sporting good’s retain chain said it was banning the sale of “assault-style weapons.” In reality, the firearms the company plans to stop selling are AR-15 rifles and other similar firearms, which are not “assault weapons.”

AR-15 rifles and firearms like them are semi-automatic — meaning only one bullet is fired with each pull of the trigger — while actual assault rifles, which are used in the military, are fully-automatic, meaning it will continue to fire with just one depress of the trigger.

Still, Palmetto State said they support Dick’s right via capitalism to make the decision it did. In the end, the company hopes politicians and business leaders can come together in civil discussion to find a solution to America’s gun violence problem.

Whatever your religious beliefs may be, that much is without dispute. In time, humans formed complex societies to take advantage of the benefits of living in groups. With larger populations, it’s easier to hunt, domesticate animals, and farm. As competing groups began fighting with one another over access to resources, including land and animals, it became necessary to form what we think of today as fortified towns and cities, along with armies to wage wars. This, of course, required people appointing rulers and investing them with tremendous amounts of power and wealth. And over time, very few people could call themselves truly free.

It is natural and in keeping with much of human history for people to trade their liberties for security, so it’s quite understandable why so many today are clamoring to bargain away their Second Amendment rights in the hope of preventing another school shooting like the tragic one that recently occurred in Parkland, Florida.

In a post-modern world, where truth is deemed to be subjective and concepts like “right” and wrong” are taboo, it’s not surprising that in a time of crisis, people are running toward those who are promising they can make the horror, death, and devastation go away. People are so thirsty for answers, they’d drink the sand if the all-powerful government told them it was water. And while pundits of all political persuasions, myself included, debate the importance (or dangers, depending on your views) of firearms, the larger, more obvious problem remains curiously out of reach: The reason hundreds of people are being murdered in the streets of Chicago, 17 children were murdered in Parkland, and thousands of others are killed each year (mostly by people who illegally possess guns) is that our souls are desperately corrupt, sick, immoral and, as Christians often say, “fallen.”

It’s not surprising to see non-Christians roll their eyes when such an observation is made. The popular, widely available view in today’s America is that people are generally good, kind, and interested in helping one another, and if greedy, self-serving, gun-toting hicks were to get out of the way of the government, we could finally solve all the world’s problems with universal health care schemes and far-reaching gun bans. Put your faith in the government, they say, and all will be well.

This view makes sense if one believes government is his or her highest authority, but an increasing number of Christians are beginning to put their faith in government, too, always believing we’re just one more law away from a near-perfect society. At best, this is a sign of Christian ignorance. At worst, it’s heresy.

The Bible couldn’t be clearer when it comes to the state of man: “None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one. … Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known.” (Romans 3:10-12, 3:15-17)

Elsewhere, Paul the Apostle refers to humans as “slaves to sin,” and describes in heart-wrenching detail how “nothing good lives” in him, “for I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep on doing the evil I do not want to do. And if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.” (Romans 7:18-20)

Paul’s remedy for a sick, utterly hopeless heart isn’t gun control, taxes, another welfare program, or anything of the kind; it’s faith. Through faith, hearts are born anew, the lame walk and the dead live forever. Or, as Jesus put plainly, “with God, all things are possible.” (Matthew 19:26)

If you think Christianity is rubbish, then all this sounds like utter nonsense. But if your heart has been transformed by the power of God, then there’s no excuse for believing man can solve the ills of the world apart from God, because God has plainly said it’s impossible.

I don’t think it’s an accident that the birth of the American nation followed shortly after the Great Awakening of the early to mid-18th century. It was then that pastors such as George Whitefield traveled some 5,000 miles preaching on more than 350 occasions to crowds of thousands about the necessity of God and humans’ broken nature. Some estimate Whitefield delivered his message to almost one-quarter of all Americans in less than two years.

Following such a massive revival, the colonists were readier than ever to tell the monarchs of Europe that a free, independent, and Godly people don’t need a centralized authority to keep them safe or to solve their problems. In fact, they would have been better equipped than ever to make the case that no authority save God alone could achieve such a feat.

Contrast that generation with our own. Without God, who can we turn to for “salvation,” the definition of which shifts from day to day, hour to hour? No one except the only authority in our lives powerful enough to promise peace: government.

The more I study history, the more convinced I’ve become that there is no long-term hope for freedom in a Godless country. In the end, people will always choose to trade away their liberty for the illusion of security. How quickly we’d drink the sand for the momentary peace that comes with believing that, despite all reason, it might quench our thirst.

We don’t need government to stop mass shootings. We don’t need Democrats or Republicans. We don’t need bump-stock bans or age restrictions. How completely foolish we are for believing people like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer or even Donald Trump can fix what the Scriptures say are a fundamentally spiritual problem.

No, we don’t need more government. We need new hearts. We need a new Great Awakening. We need God."
blaze3,blaze,"['Chris Enloe', 'Weekend Editor']",2018-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/03/new-analysis-on-gun-control-shows-increased-gun-restrictions-have-very-minimal-desirable-effects,"A new analysis of thousands of gun control studies found that firearm restrictions had minimal, in any, effects on decreasing violent crime, homicides, suicides and unintentional deaths.

Democrats routinely argue that strict gun control regulations would lower rates of gun violence.

What did the study find?

The RAND corporation, which conducted the extensive study, found that only 63 percent of gun control studies testing specific firearm restrictions found a desirable outcome, such as reductions in homicides, suicides and other violent crime.

RAND analyzed thousands of gun control studies over the course of two years and spent more than $1 million on the study. They sought to determine how gun policies “affect outcomes, such as suicide rates and hunting participation” — and the results couldn’t have been more unequivocal.

“Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn’t find any evidence,” Andrew Morral, a behavioral scantiest who lead the study, told NPR.

For example, the analysis found that policies targeting mass shootings, hunting and recreation, defensive gun use and officer-involved shootings were “inconclusive, at best.”

Meanwhile, the study found relatively strong evidence that “child-access prevention laws” — such as laws that force gun owners to store firearms under lock and key in a household with minors — likely decreased suicides, unintentional deaths and violent crime. In addition, the study found relatively minor evidence to correlate stand-your-ground and concealed carry laws with increased deaths and violent crime.

In addition to analyzing thousands of studies, RAND interviewed 95 firearm policy experts, both Republican and Democratic. In general, the experts agreed that reducing suicides, homicides and deaths should be the primary factor when considering gun restrictions, while privacy concerns, preventing mass shootings and recreational use are secondary.

Morral said the expert reaction was a surprise.

“I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values — or that it’s a values problem, in any case. But that’s not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order,” he told NPR. “Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts. And the facts are sparse.”

Are increased firearm restrictions on the horizon?

Maybe. In the wake of the Parkland school shooting, millions are rallying for tighter restrictions on firearms, arguing more restrictions will thwart the next mass shooting.

And while the science proves that isn’t true, some restrictions, such as a bump-stock ban or raising the minimum age for long gun purchases, seem almost inevitable."
blaze4,blaze,"['Sarah Taylor', 'Staff Writer']",2018-03-05 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/05/membership-interest-in-gun-rights-groups-soar-in-the-weeks-after-the-florida-high-school-shooting,"Membership, as well as interest in learning information about joining gun organizations — such as the National Rifle Association and other grassroots organizations — has increased dramatically in the weeks after the deadly Parkland, Florida school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

What are the details?

According a Friday Time article, many pro-gun and pro-Second Amendment groups saw surges in membership in and interest after the school shooting, which left at least 17 dead and injured many more.

Patrick Parsons, head of Georgia Gun Owners — which is a local independent gun rights org — said, “As soon as anti-gun attacks started coming in on Twitter, Facebook, and in the media, we began to hear from people who didn’t even own guns who wanted to join up or contribute out of solidarity in defense of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.”

Parsons told Time that the group’s membership — which hovered around 13,000 — gained 1,000 new members in just two weeks following the deadly shooting.

Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights, said that the association, which reportedly has over 4 million members and supporters, may have grown over 30 percent over the last week alone.

The outlet also reported that the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, an org which boasts a membership of approximately 29,000, received nearly 200 applications in the last seven days. According to Time, this is atypical, as the Connecticut Citizens Defense League generally receives approximately 15-20 applications for week.

What else?

Cleta Mitchell, a former Oklahoma state lawmaker who was on the NRA’s board from 2002 to 2013, addressed the companies who opted to sever ties with the NRA following the Florida school shooting in an email to Time.

“There is no one. NO ONE. Who joins the NRA for a discount on a rental car,” Mitchell told Time. “You can rest assured that the NRA will not lose a single member as a result of this.”

“If anything,” she added, “it should spur people to join the NRA as a means of demonstrating that we who believe in the Second Amendment will not be bullied by these left wing multi-billion dollar corporations.”

The Daily Mail on Sunday also reported that despite calls from both Democrats and Republicans to tighten gun laws, as well as the many boycotts of the NRA, searches for NRA membership on the Internet increased dramatically since the shooting.

According to the outlet, the search term “NRA memberships” is reportedly up 4,900 percent since Feb. 14, the day of the Marjory Stoneman shooting.

The NRA has at least 5 million members, but has yet to release any current membership numbers at the time of this writing.

TheBlaze reached out to the NRA for comment on whether they, too, received a large uptick in memberships in the weeks following the deadly school shooting, but the organization did not immediately return a request for comment."

Most Americans blame the shooting on failures by the local, state and federal governments, according to a Rasmussen Reports study. The study was done in response to the Valentine’s Day shooting that left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Fifty-four percent of Americans surveyed believe the shooting could have been avoided if government agencies responded to reports of warning signs from the killer. Additionally, 33 percent blamed a lack of adequate gun control and 11 percent cited other factors, according to the survey.

On the issue of gun control, 41 percent of those surveyed said stricter gun control laws would be the most effective approach to reduce mass murders. Just as many — 40 percent — said treating mental health issues would be the most effective approach.

What about Republicans vs. Democrats?

Results were also broken down along party lines. The survey showed Republicans were more likely than Democrats to blame the government.

Seventy-five percent of Republicans and 55 percent of adults not affiliated with either major political party believe that government failure is more likely to have led to the shooting than not enough gun control.

In contrast, just 36 percent of Democrats said the government is culpable. Fifty percent of Democrats said insufficient gun control is the primary problem.

What did parents say?

Interestingly, 61 percent of parents with school-age children believe the government is more responsible for the shooting than guns. Just 23 percent blamed a lack of adequate gun control.

Of those surveyed, 90 percent said they have been watching news reports about the Florida shooting “somewhat closely,” while 53 percent reported watching the reports “very closely.”

Other findings:

Thirty-two percent believe FBI Director Christopher Wray should resign or be fired because the agency failed to pursue tips prior to the shooter opening fire at the school.

Middle-aged voters are the most likely to view the government as more to blame.

That is also true of married adults and those with children in the home, compared to those who are not married and have no children living with them.

Only 26 percent said the federal government can be trusted to do the right thing at least most of the time.

Rasmussen Reports conducted the survey of 1,000 American adults on Feb. 25 through 26. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points, along with a 95 percent level of confidence, the firm stated. The study was completed via national telephone and online surveys."
blaze6,blaze,['Justin Haskins'],2018-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/26/commentary-on-gun-control-trump-sounds-more-like-obama-every-day,"In the wake of the tragic school shooting in Florida, President Donald Trump met with victims of school shootings and their family members. To say the “listening session” was emotional and captivating is a gross understatement. Something clearly has to be done about school shootings and gun violence in general, but the question of what policy provisions will help to solve these problems remains a serious and important point of contention.

Pro-liberty conservatives have long argued heaping additional regulations on legal gun owners, who, statistically speaking, very rarely harm other people, is a violation of their liberty and Second Amendment rights. Liberals, never letting a good crisis go to waste, have called for many weapons to be banned, enhanced background checks, and other gun-limiting provisions, which they say are necessary to keep people from harm. Many moderates fall somewhere in the middle.

Perhaps the most interesting and disturbing — at least, from the perspective of someone who supports gun rights — development in the debate is President Trump’s sudden transformation from being a defender of the Second Amendment to calling for harsh restrictions reminiscent of past policy proposals by former President Barack Obama, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and other left-wing politicians. On Feb. 22, Trump tweeted, “I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue — I hope!”

Coming from a Republican president who received significant backing from the National Rifle Association, this is truly remarkable and shocking — especially when one considers that Obama called for some of these same restrictions in the past. In other cases, not even Obama was willing to go as far as Trump is suggesting now.

Comprehensive background checks

Let’s begin with “Comprehensive Background Checks, with an emphasis on Mental Health.” Although Trump didn’t elaborate on exactly what constitutes a “Comprehensive Background Check,” gun advocacy groups have argued for decades such a program would present grave risks to gun owners.

For starters, who decides what factors will make someone ineligible to own a weapon? Obviously, we don’t want people who are truly mentally deranged to purchase weapons, but when Democrats inevitably come into power again, what would stop them from establishing far-reaching “risk factors” that make it exceptionally difficult to purchase a firearm? Or making the background-check system so burdensome and expensive that most Americans won’t have the time or money to fulfill every requirement?

And what “Mental Health” problems would prohibit a person from purchasing a gun? If someone sees a psychiatrist once in his or her life, would that be enough to prevent the purchase of a weapon? If an individual suffered from depression a decade ago, would that prevent him or her from passing a background check?

Many women who have been victims of sexual assault or domestic violence buy guns to protect themselves, but many of them have also had to seek help from mental health care providers because of the trauma they have endured. Would they be able to purchase a gun? What about soldiers returning home from war, many of whom see mental health specialists to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder?

It’s worth remembering that in 2016 President Obama called for expanding background checks, a move congressional Republicans vigorously opposed. Now that a Republican president is seeking to undermine gun owners’ rights, will Congress suddenly change its tune?

Background checks are important for helping to prevent future gun-related violence, but a federal background check system could easily be politicized and abused. It would be far too easy for future left-wing Congresses or bureaucratic agencies to implement regulations that would make background checks a tool for effectively eliminating Second Amendment rights. For that reason alone, Trump’s proposal should be rejected.

A much better model would be for states to voluntarily share background information with one another, creating a state-controlled network that could be used by gun shops when selling weapons.

Raising the age limit to 21

Now consider Trump’s call to raise the limit for purchasing a weapon to 21 years old. (Trump would later clarify that his ban would only apply to certain kinds of rifles.) This outrageous proposal seeks to tell American adults, who are guaranteed the “right to bear arms,” that they can’t buy many kinds of weapons until they are 21. How can this be construed in any other way than an infringement on their inalienable right to purchase a weapon? This is an overtly unconstitutional act — unless we are to understand that citizens under the age of 21 are not adults. And if that’s the case, then there is a rather large list of other activities we allow 20-year-olds to engage in because they are treated as adults.

For instance, under Trump’s proposal, American citizens would be able to vote, consume tobacco, amass huge amounts of debt, be tried as an adult in criminal courts, purchase a home, serve in war, or get married years before they could buy many kinds of weapons. This is totally absurd. Trump’s plan would mean some Americans could buy a home but not be able to protect it. Similarly, a person could vote for candidates in elections who have the power to send the country to war and destroy the world with nuclear weapons but not be deemed responsible enough to own a gun. A person could kill terrorists in Afghanistan with high-grade assault weapons, but not own a less powerful rifle at home.

As far as I can tell, Obama never called for increasing the legal age limit required to purchase semi-automatic weapons, or any other guns, for that matter. His administration did, however, defend in court existing federal law that prohibits gun shops from selling handguns to citizens under the age of 21.

Bump stocks

President Trump also called for a ban on the sale of bump stocks, a gun add-on that helps shooters fire weapons more rapidly. While a reasonable argument could be made that bump stocks effectively turn some weapons into machine guns, which are illegal in most circumstances, and thus should be banned, there is virtually no evidence at all that bump stocks are causing significant problems in the United States. This is a solution in search of a problem. And, most importantly, the logic used to ban bump stocks is virtually the same logic one could use to ban any semi-automatic weapon, or weapons in general: They’re too dangerous.

Interestingly, the Obama administration actually approved the sale of bump stocks, which means if Trump’s bump stock ban is implemented, it would go even further than the Obama administration did on this issue.

Yes, guns can be dangerous, but so are many other activities. There are more than 88,000 alcohol-related deaths every year, and alcohol doesn’t save any lives at all, making it far more dangerous than guns. More than 2.6 million Americans are killed, injured, or disabled from road crashes annually, including 8,000 Americans aged 16 to 20. Should we change the driving limit to 21 as well?

The solution

The answer to our mass shooting problem isn’t to punish gun owners who are following the law and forcing Americans everywhere to hide in locked classrooms, completely unprotected, in the hopes that law enforcement will soon arrive and do its job properly. The solution is to empower citizens to have greater access to guns so that they can defend themselves when law enforcement is present or refuses to act as it should, which is precisely what happened recently in Florida.

Some argue arming citizens is dangerous and that it won’t save any lives, but the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming. As I noted in an article in November, “Some researchers estimate there are more than 2 million defensive gun uses in the United States every year. On the lowest end of the spectrum, the National Crime Victimization Survey claims there are more than 67,000 instances in which guns are used to defend life or property annually.”

This means at the very least, tens of thousands of people (or their property) are defended every single year. Why not add public schools to the list?"

Democrats mostly argue for increased gun control measures, while Second Amendment advocates mostly oppose any new restrictions.

The debate usually dies quickly after a shooting, but it has remained strong over the last week. Now, even President Donald Trump is reportedly considering new restrictions on firearms.

No. 1: Raising the purchase age for certain firearms

Axios reported Wednesday that Trump has privately discussed supporting a measure that would raise the purchase age for semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21.

Currently, any 18-year-old who is lawfully able to purchase and possess a firearm can purchase a rifle or shotgun, including the controversial AR-15. Federal law requires a citizen to be 21 before purchasing a handgun.

According to the Washington Post, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Tuesday the option is “on the table for us to discuss.”

What’s not clear is if Trump would advocate for new age restrictions at the federal level or if he would encourage state legislators to make the change.

No. 2: Increased background checks

On Tuesday, Trump tweeted his support for “strengthening” the background check system.

Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2018

Currently, federal law stipulates that any person purchasing a weapon from a federally licensed firearms dealer must have their background checked through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which takes just minutes. The system merely checks a person’s legal eligibility to purchase a firearm and no mental health evaluation occurs.

However, for private transactions in most states, which are a small share of all gun sales, no background check is required for long guns or handguns. Still, many states like North Carolina require a pistol permit or concealed carry license for private handgun transactions.

It’s not clear what improvements would be made to the NICS system.

No. 3: Ban bump stocks

A bump stock is an inexpensive device that helps a shooter fire a standard semi-automatic rifle more rapidly, which makes the firearm behave more like a fully-automatic weapon. A bump stock was reportedly used in the Las Vegas massacre last year. The devices don’t actually make semi-automatic rifles fully-automatic, but they use recoil to increase the rate at which the trigger is pulled.

Trump said at the White House on Tuesday that he has instructed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pursue legislation that outlaws the devices.

“We cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make a difference,” Trump said, according to the New York Times.

Why is this time different?

America has seen more than a dozen tragic mass shootings over the last few years and little has been done to prevent the next one. But this time appears to be different.

Most people are split over what to actually do and whether or not increased gun restrictions would prevent the next mass shooting remains to be seen. But the difference this time appears to lie with the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, who have been very outspoken about the need for gun control since the shooting.

Their dialogue has even sparked a CNN town hall, which will include the Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch.

Even Trump, seems to agree with the kids’ sentiment. “We have to do something. We’ve got kids dying,” he reportedly said during a private meeting on guns, according to Axios."

Want a new firearm? You can pay for it and pass the background check in a day but you have to wait 10 days to physically obtain the weapon. Looking at a new pistol? Better make sure it has a safety on it, otherwise it isn’t “California legal.”

California Assemblywoman Shannon Grove (R-Bakersfield) recently introduced AB 2229, which would allow law-abiding citizens with a concealed carry permit, a valid certificate of eligibility or those who already own a registered firearm to pick up their newly purchased gun without having to wait the customary 10 days. Currently, the only time a firearm does not have to go through the 10-day waiting period is if the firearm is being transferred from one family member to another, like when my dad transferred a pistol to me.

And yes, even the private sale of a firearm requires a 10-day waiting period. As it is, most private sales have to be completed at a gun store. The paperwork is filled out at the gun store and the store holds onto the firearm for the 10-day period before the new owner is able to possess it. It doesn’t matter if they already own and operate a firearm or if they have a concealed carry weapons permit. They are treated as though they have never purchased a firearm before.

According to the Firearms Policy Coalition, “AB 2229 stems from a decision made by the U.S. District Court in Silvester v. Harris, a case litigated by The Calguns Foundation.” The case was heard in Fresno in late 2011, where the plaintiff claimed – and successfully argued – the 10-day waiting period violates the Second Amendment. Although the State of California acknowledges this, they continue to deny law-abiding citizens their Constitutionally protected rights by demanding they wait the 10 days.

Assemblywoman Grove’s proposed legislation, if passed, would be a huge victory for gun owners across the nation.

If California, one of the strictest states on gun possession and concealed carry, passed AB 2229, it would mean other states would have to reevaluate their stance on firearms. If those states with strict gun laws fail to reevaluate their take on the Second Amendment, chances are, gun owners – and the National Rifle Association – will challenge them in a court of law. By precedent, gun owners would win.

Although gun control advocates will argue the 10-day waiting period makes little difference in the grand scheme of things, their attitude is misguided. Think about it. Yes, the 10-day waiting period makes sense if you’re purchasing a firearm for the first time. You should be heavily vetted. You should undergo scrutiny because a weapon has the power to harm and even kill someone. You shouldn’t have to undergo the same stipulation time and time again if you already possess a firearm and have a clean background.

Assemblywoman Grove’s proposed legislation makes sense from a logical point of view. Why should we, the law-abiding citizen, have to jump through hoops? It has been statistically proven that those who break the law, especially gun laws, are criminals. If they want to possess a weapon, they’re going to find a way to get their hands on one. Chances are, they aren’t going through the legal channels to obtain the weapon. Why place scrutiny on the average person instead of the criminal?

It’s refreshing to know a legislator from my home state is working to protect the rights of its citizens, although those rights are Constitutionally guaranteed. I truly hope this piece of legislation makes its way through the legislative process without being squashed by gun control advocates.

The debate rages after any publicized gun crime, and almost always circles back to two talking points. Gun control advocates say people shouldn’t be able to have “military-grade” weapons, while Second Amendment supporters say a gun didn’t kill the victims — a person did.

One Illinois firearms instructor sought to prove his point in a video that’s now gone viral. That instructor, Mike Brown, also a former criminal justice professor in Chicago, in just four minutes completely dismantles the theory that guns should be banned or heavily restricted because someone uses them to commit mass murder.

Brown placed two handguns — one semi-automatic and one revolver — and a Sig MPX, which is technically a pistol, but he had the stock pulled back for shoulder use, in front of him on a table, loaded each gun, chambered a bullet and then he waited.

“Here you have all three loaded firearms … here we go,” he says in the video. For the next 10 seconds, Brown stares at the firearms and looks back at the camera several times, then he shakes his head because the guns didn’t fire.

“Maybe if we try the drill instructor approach, maybe we might get a different outcome,” he says next, before yelling at the firearms like a Marine Corps drill instructor screams at new recruits. However, the guns still didn’t fire.

Finally, Brown tried the “humoristic approach,” where he whispered to the firearms and instructed them to discharge. Still, the firearms didn’t discharge any rounds.

He ended the video with a short monologue:"
blaze12,blaze,['Cole Ellenbogen'],2014-06-25 10:00:53-04:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/scouts-in-control-youth-and-firearm-safety,"A group of Boy Scouts was rescued early Father’s Day from a Canyon in Arizona, largely because they were prepared with all the necessary supplies and survival training.

As an Eagle Scout, this success story makes me proud of my brothers in scouting who were able to save others– and themselves– by using skills learned from the Boy Scouts.

But I’m not surprised. The Boy Scouts of America estimates that one in every 100 scouts will use his training to save his own life– and another one in 100 to save someone else’s. There have been over 100 million scouts since the program started here in the United States in 1910, so that’s two million lives saved because of Boy Scout training.

But this training goes beyond first aid and emergency preparedness. The BSA also offers and encourages firearm safety training.

When I was 12, I took up rifle shooting under the close supervision of a BSA shooting sports instructor. Before I even saw a gun for the first time, I went through rigorous safety training. I learned to always point the gun down-range and never at another person. Before I even pulled the trigger, I ha” a healthy respect for how powerful a rifle was and knew how to use it safely.

According to his classmates, the young gunman in the recent Reynolds High School shooting in Oregon was obsessed with firearms. Though what this young man did was unfathomable to many, it does not make him a “right wing extremist,” or “pro-gun radical.” This kind of unhealthy behavior comes from lackof proper exposure to firearms, not the respectful use of them.

While there are exceptions to every rule, learning about shooting sports didn’t cause my brothers in scouting and me to obsess over guns, quite the opposite: The more I practiced with a rifle in a responsible environment, the less fascinating the rifle itself became. To a safety-conscious marksman, a firearm is no more unusual or frightening than a kitchen knife or a drill, which are all useful tools that can hurt you if you use them improperly.

By training young men in gun safety, the BSA isn’t doing anything radical either; young students had been educated about gun use for decades up until the mid 1970’s. It wasn’t uncommon for high schools to have gun clubs, with shooting teams often meeting — and practicing — on school property.

During this time, in New York City, students rode the subway with rifles slung across their backs, leaving their firearms in their lockers once they arrived at school. New York State hosted a statewide annual riflery championship for the 80 or so school districts that had competitive rifle teams.

Yet regular student firearm use did not lead to increased gun violence. In the entire decade of the 1960’s, when shooting sports for young men and women reached their height of popularity, there were but 17 total school gun-related incidents. Three of those incidents were accidents, and another entailed police firing on student protestors. That’s 17 out of every school and university in America, over the span of 10 years. Compare that to 31 gun-related incidents in the first six months of 2014.

Statistically, schools were actually safer when there were more guns around. Again, I’m not surprised because after the BSA safety training, pointing a firearm at another person is almost unthinkable to me. That’s exactly the state of mind that you want to instill in young men and women, and the Boy Scouts are one of the few groups that have maintained their high standards of gun safety and education.

And education is key, because guns aren’t going anywhere. Even if there were an outright ban, firearms would still be smuggled into the country, of course, by those who want to make money and those who care little about gun safety — or the law, for that matter.

Just look at the United Kingdom, which enforces a near total ban on guns: there are still gun related deaths in the country, meaning that people are ignoring the laws and or smuggling guns through the UK’s easily enforceable borders. If smugglers can get across the English Channel, then they can certainly get across our border.

For more than 40 years, we’ve been trying to reduce gun violence by regulating firearms sales and ownership, yet gun-related incidents have not declined. Is it so extreme to suggest, then, that regulation isn’t working? Treating guns as taboo objects only piques the interest of the kind of person considering violence against their peers. That’s exactly what we should be trying to avoid. Schools had the right idea with gun clubs, because they treated guns like another piece of equipment that you use with caution.

Alas, I seriously doubt that high school gun clubs and shooting sports teams will ever regain popularity, let alone public approval. But it is important for us to recognize that those groups actually did a huge public service by educating young Americans about gun safety, something the BSA did from the outset. That’s why it’s even more important that we support the efforts of groups like the BSA who continue to do so.

I admit, my situation is rare: The first time I was ever exposed to guns was in a safe, realistic setting. I shot a rifle before I even played a video game involving shooting. That’s exactly my point: BSA style rifle training should be encouraged, because it promotes a safe attitude, and a stable mindset.

It’s not about legislation controlling our guns; it’s about us learning to control ourselves.

… and this?

One is a clip and one is a magazine. Yes, they are different, non-interchangeable terms. Although, do a quick search of recent news covering the gun control debate and you’ll see how often the term “clip” specifically is used incorrectly. Like here, here and here just to point out a few instances.

TheBlaze spoke with Brandon Webb, the president of SOFREP media and a former Navy SEAL, about the difference between these two firearm components and why it’s important to be clear with your terminology.

“It’s common for people to get the two mixed up,” Webb said. “If you hear someone talking about clips … you know they don’t know the difference.

“No one uses clips anymore.”

A clip describes cartridges held together with a strip until they are loaded into a firearm.

A magazine on the other hand is is a container that holds the cartridges. Sometimes magazines themselves are loaded with cartridges by clips. On most firearms a magazine is detachable and replaceable.

Or as Jan Libourel for Montgomery Citizens for a Safer Maryland explained in the “Handgunner’s Glossary“:

A [clip is a] device for holding cartridges together, usually to facilitate loading. Widely used as a synonym for “magazine” (although most firearm authorities consider this substandard usage). Technically, a magazine has a feeding spring, a clip does not.

This video is also very helpful showing off clips vs. magazines (and showing how magazines can be loaded by clips or a firearm directly loaded by a clip:

Even with the subtle differences though, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a clip as “a device to hold cartridges for charging the magazines of some rifles” and “also : a magazine from which ammunition is fed into the chamber of a firearm.”

Still, Webb said it is like comparing apples to oranges. Although most people would know what you’re talking about if you use the term interchangeably, as this YouTube user put it,”many will judge you as someone who doesn’t know much about firearms if you call them ‘clips.'”

As Webb said, “if you are going to talk about guns, let’s know what we’re talking about.”

blaze17,blaze,"['Sarah Taylor', 'Staff Writer']",2018-01-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/01/03/pennsylvania-state-police-urge-gun-owners-to-give-up-firearms-to-get-medical-marijuana,"If you’re a gun-owning Pennsylvania resident, the Pennsylvania State Police are urging you to turn in your firearms if you are seeking medical marijuana cards.

Sorry, what?

A statement from the Pennsylvania State Police’s website is receiving a lot of local attention over what appears to be an erroneous statement concerning state and federal law.

The statement reads:

“It is unlawful for you to keep possession of any firearms which you owned or had in your possession prior to obtaining a medical marijuana card, and you should consult an attorney about the best way to dispose of your firearms.”

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, state police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski suggested seeking legal counsel if a citizen possesses firearms before seeking and receiving medical marijuana.

“It’s unlawful to keep possession of firearms obtained prior to registering,” Tarkowski said.

“The Pennsylvania State Police is not in the business of offering legal advice, but it might be a good idea to contact an attorney about how best to dispose of their firearms,” Tarkowski suggested.

Criminal defense attorney Patrick Nightingale told KDKA-TV on Monday that the suggestions being pushed by the state police disturb him.

“It disturbs me greatly to see the Pennsylvania State Police put on their website references to federal law while ignoring the fact that it is legal under Pennsylvania law,” Nightingale said.

“Firearms are woven into the fabric of our country,” Nightingale added. “It’s the second most important right in the Bill of Rights.”

Here’s the catch

According to Pennsylvania state law, the use of medical marijuana is legal, and not a hindrance to owning a firearm. However, according to the state police website, Pennsylvania’s legalization of medical marijuana is not federally recognized.

According to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) and 27 C.F.R. § 478.32(a)(3), possession of a medical marijuana card and the use of medical marijuana determines that a citizen is an “unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.”

Federal law prohibits an “unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance” from purchasing, acquiring, or possessing a firearm.

In short, federal law says it is illegal for a citizen to attempt the purchase of a firearm if they are a medical marijuana cardholder.

This isn’t new information: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has held the position since 2011 that no one in possession of a medical marijuana card may also legally own a firearm.

Generally speaking, state police cannot enforce federal law unless a statute gives them express permission to do so. Pennsylvania law is somewhat ambiguous on this point, allowing the PSP make arrests “for all violations of the law,” without specifying whether this includes federal law.

If marijuana is considered a controlled substance — much like opioids — then one might wonder why are opioid users permitted to own firearms.

Attorney Andrew Sacks, co-chair of the Pennsylvania Bar Association’s Medical Marijuana and Hemp Law Committee, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette the same thing.

“It’s hypocritical,” Sacks said. “You can be an opioid addict, or buy a bottle of rum, drink it and go to a store and buy one. But a person who is registered as a medical marijuana patient in Pennsylvania, and has a very small dosage of THC, can’t own a gun to protect themselves or hunt.”"
blaze18,blaze,['Oliver Darcy'],2013-09-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/09/17/this-is-why-most-military-personnel-are-disarmed-on-military-bases-and-its-not-clintons-fault,"Monday’s deadly shooting at the Washington Navy Yard has renewed interest in why most military personnel are forbidden from carrying firearms on military bases. In the aftermath, some have pointed fingers at former President Bill Clinton, but is he really to blame?

Not according to what we found.

The question of why military members aren’t armed on base garnered attention back in November 2009 when Army Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire at Ft. Hood and killed 13 people. He was sentenced to death on August 28. Now, nearly four years later, many are asking the same question.

So what’s the answer? It appears this “gun-free zone” type policy can actually be traced back to Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5210.56, signed into effect in February 1992 by Donald J. Atwood, deputy secretary of defense under President George H.W. Bush.

The controversial directive states that “it is DoD Policy” to “limit and control the carrying of firearms by DoD military and civilian personnel.”

“The authorization to carry firearms shall be issued only to qualified personnel when there is a reasonable expectation that life or DoD assets will be jeopardized if firearms are not carried,” it says.

The policy, however, adds, “DoD personnel regularly engaged in law enforcement or security duties shall be armed.” A former member of the Air Force, with experience in base security, thus, told the Washington Post that he would guess there were “no more than a couple of dozen weapons on the Navy Yard.”

It appears DoD Directive 5210.56 was reissued in April 2011 by Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III.

Some outlets are citing Army Regulation 190-14, a policy implemented in 1993 that changed policy regarding carrying firearms on the Army’s military bases, to cast blame on Clinton.

However, that policy specifically notes part of its purpose is aimed at implementing “applicable portions of Department of Defense Directive 5210.56,” which, as previously stated, was put into effect by Bush Sr.’s deputy secretary of defense:

Further, DoD spokesman Mark Wright told TheBlaze Army Regulation 190-14 would not apply to other bases under different branches of the military, including the site of Monday’s shooting, Washington Navy Yard.

“No, it would not apply,” he said Tuesday afternoon.

Steven Bucci, a military expert for The Heritage Foundation who served 28 years in the Army and retired in 2005 with the rank of colonel, also told TheBlaze Tuesday afternoon that Clinton is not to blame.

“I think you are barking up the wrong tree if you are looking to put blame on someone for disarming the military,” said Bucci, when asked if Clinton was responsible. “I think that’s kind of a bogus story.”

“We have never had our soldiers walking around with weapons all the time, other than in combat zones,” he added, noting only Military Police have had that authority.

TheBlaze reached out to members of both the Senate and House Armed Services Committee to see if the policy will be revisited in light of Monday’s shooting. At the time of publication, no one was available for comment.

“We’re looking up different guns,” said Khloe. “Different what?” replied Kim.

“Different guns. She [Kendall] just feels like really unsafe. Like, she says she has like literally a different stalker outside of her house every few days.

—

In making its case that the popular AR-15 is a “common element in mass shootings,” the New York Times, citing the owner of a gun engineering company, reported the semi-automatic rifle can fire eight rounds per second.

Because the rifle is semi-automatic, meaning each round requires a single pull of the trigger, the claim was immediately called into question. The claim was attributed to Sam Andrews, the owner of Tier One Weapons Systems.

A message left seeking clarification from Andrews was not immediately returned.

“The reason it’s so popular…is that if you bring a handgun to a fight where there’s an AR-15 you’re going to lose. And it doesn’t matter if you’re a 240-pound man like me or a 90-pound girl,” Andrews said, according to the Times.

Olympian shooter Amanda Furrer estimated she could only fire at a rate of roughly three rounds per second with “any accuracy” — and she shoots guns for a living.

She told TheBlaze she has “never seen” any shooter fire at a rate of 8 rounds per second.

When we asked Casey Betzold, president of Snake River Shooting Products, to respond to the assertion an AR-15 can fire eight rounds per second, he responded “Yeah… it doesn’t.”

“Not even with Jerry Miculek finger speed,” he added.

He’s right about that.

As Business Insider’s Oliver Darcy, who was first to fact-check the claim, pointed out, famous competition shooter Jerry Miculek Jr. was only about to fire off five rounds in one second using the AR-15 — and he’s considered by many to be the world’s fastest shooter.

Kuntzman claimed he wanted to “better understand the firepower of military-style assault weapons and, hopefully, explain their appeal to gun lovers” in the aftermath of the deadly Orlando terrorist attack that left 49 people dead and dozens injured.

The writer recalled shooting the popular firearm being “horrifying, menacing and very very loud.”

Kuntzman said he has shot “pistols” before, but he was horrified of the AR-15’s “explosion of firepower,” which he called “humbling and deafening (even with ear protection).”

“The recoil bruised my shoulder,” he added. “The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary case of PTSD. For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.”

Watch below:

Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old terrorist who opened fire at a popular gay nightclub in Orlando, didn’t use an AR-15 in the shooting, despite what has been widely reported. Police said Mateen used a different semi-automatic rifle, a Sig Sauer MCX carbine.

Reactions to the video, uploaded on Dec. 10, so far have run the gamut, with some supporting the activist and others criticizing him due to the perceived spike in threats to police officers recently.

The men behind the JacksonCopBlock and TacticalPatriot YouTube channels are apparently seen entering the Jackson Police Department with intentions of interacting with law enforcement. One of the men is seen openly carrying an AR-15 rifle and wearing an apparent bulletproof vest with “Jackson Cop Block” printed on the back.

“I’d like to file a FOIA request,” one of the men says in the video.

A woman at the front desk is seen asking the men where they came from, suggesting police had received calls about individuals carrying rifles. She appeared to want to determine if the calls were about them so officers weren’t dispatched for no reason.

The man behind the camera refused to reveal his previous location, telling her, “We came from our place of origin to here.”

Police officials informed the men that the FOIA office would not open until 12:30 in the afternoon. So, the activists left and planned to return then. Watch part one of the video:

After looking for some “witnesses” to the police-involved shooting of the pit bull, the men returned to the police station to file a FOIA request.

An officer is seen on video asking one of the men, “I don’t know who you are — do you have ID on you, sir?”

“I don’t answer questions,” he is heard responding.

After an officer snaps a photo of them the activists then travel upstairs to the FOIA office and file their request without incident. Officers did not attempt to detain or disarm either of the men, according to what’s seen in the video footage.

Due to the content of the video, one would assume the FOIA request had to do with the shooting of the dog. Watch part two of the video below:

You can read some of the reactions to the video in the video’s comments section here.

The Nov. 28 police-involved shooting of the pit bull by Jackson police is currently under investigation, MLive.com reports.

Jackson Police Lt. Christopher Simpson said two officers “found themselves inside an apartment” during their search for a suspect and a dog “aggressively” approached them, causing them to open fire and kill the animal. The officers will remain on active duty during the investigation, he added.

Note: We’ve updated the city to reflect that the incident occurred in Jackson, Michigan."
blaze24,blaze,['Becket Adams'],2013-06-24 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/06/24/the-reason-you-may-regret-having-bought-that-ar-15-earlier-this-year,"Gun enthusiasts who rushed to purchase AR-15s at the height of Congress’s recent debate over gun control may soon regret having spent so much money.

It appears that the market for the popular rifle has bottomed out.

The average price of an AR-15 has in recent weeks returned to the $800-$1,050 range, down from its all-time high of $2,500 (averaged), according to the gun blog The Truth About Guns.

“After the gun control scare earlier this year, demand for AR-15 rifles went through the roof. People were maxing out their credit cards on fears that America’s favorite firearm was about to be banned by the powers that be,” writes Nick Leghorn, the testing and reviews editor for the blog.

“This cleared the entire available stock of guns, and made manufacturers ramp up to meet demand.

“It was good times for manufacturers, but now the AR-15 bubble has burst and things are looking downright depressing for manufacturers,” he adds.

And it appears the supply of AR-15s, once feared by many to have run dry, is flowing again. Below is a photo Leghorn snapped recently while in a Cabela’s sporting goods store:

“By now, everyone who ‘needed’ an AR-15 has found one. Even if they emptied their bank accounts to do it, they have their rifle,” the report continues.

“But with sales slowing down, the price of an AR-15 is cratering. People are no longer willing to buy at the inflated panic-level prices, and dealers are starting to discount the guns in order to clear their shelves,” it adds.

And although this news may come as a bit of a headache for those who maxed out their credit cards a few months ago, those who held out for lower prices are in luck. Coupled with increased manufacturing and dwindling demand, now is a great time to buy an AR-15.

“[Y]ou have the pick of the litter when it comes to guns,” Legorn writes.

However, there is still a problem: ammo.

“[A]mmunition is still scarce,” he adds. “It’s on the shelves, but stores haven’t lifted their ‘one box per person’ limit yet. So while you can buy a gun, you still can’t feed it. And God help you if you need some .22lr.”

Features that make Black Rain Ordnance’s new rifles compliant with New York’s guns laws include: No pistol grip, a non-threaded muzzle fixed stock, 10-round low capacity approved magazine and a Lo-Pro gas block “without the evil bayonet lug.”

“We are proud to be an all American Company that produces true Made in the U.S.A. products,” the company told TheBlaze in an email.

And if Black Rain’s move to create rifles that comply with New York’s new guns laws, which have been described as some of the “nation’s toughest,” sounds familiar, it should: They’re not the only company to move in this direction, and stories of such guns have been popping up since May 2013.

In fact, several New York-based gun shops have, for example, offered to replace the grip on non-complaint rifles so that they’re square with state’s laws.

“The modified gun still fires at the same rate and with the same power; the shooter just holds it slightly differently,” the Guardian reported. “These modified weapons do not have to be registered with the state.”

One gun maker in Rochester, N.Y., Just Right Carbines, manufactures modified semi-automatic rifles that comply with the New York’s Safe Act, which was signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in January 2013.

Just Right Carbines’ general manger, Anthony Testa, told the Guardian that they were given verbal opinions by New York authorities indicating that their products complied with the law.

The Safe Act, which was the result of the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., that claimed the life of 27 people, bans the sale of so-called “assault weapons” and requires that everyone who already owns a rifle categorized as such to register them with the state by 15 April 2014.

The Safe Act singles out add-on features, including bayonet mounts, grenade launchers and, of course, “protruding pistol grips.”

Another New York company, H&H Firearms, has been working on modifying its semi-automatic rifles to meet state law.

“It’s basically an AR-15 without the features,” a lawyer representing H&H Firearms told the Times Union.

“People are champing at the bit” for a legal version of the popular rifle, said the company’s manager Justin Reickart, adding that the modified rifles look “like a paintball gun.”

But rather than shrink back, the NRA tapped retired Navy SEAL Dom Raso to offer a different perspective on the mega-popular AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. (Despite initial reports, Mateen used a Sig Sauer MCX, another semi-automatic rifle, in the attack.)

In a video released just three days after the attack, Raso declared that liberal politicians like presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton continually minimize the threat of radical Islam after terror attacks like Orlando and instead use the carnage to bring up gun control and gun bans (all while under the protection of guards armed with AR-15s and other firearms).

And Raso came out swinging, directing his ire to “every political hack pretending you know an AR-15 from a double-barreled shotgun in the wake of the Orlando terror attack: Stop talking.”

“Every word not only exposes your ignorance but your utter contempt for ordinary Americans trying to survive in an age of terror you won’t fully recognize,” he continued.

Having served as a SEAL for 12 years, Raso lauded the AR-15 as a “commonsense choice” for gun buyers to keep families and neighborhoods safer.

“I guarantee if the Founding Fathers had known this gun would have been invented, they wouldn’t have rewritten the Second Amendment, they would have fortified it in stone,” Raso noted. “Because they knew the only way for us to stay free was by having whatever guns the bad guys have. This firearm gives average people the advantage they so desperately need and deserve to protect their life, liberty and happiness.”

Raso also took to task Fox News’ Gretchen Carlson, who wondered on air after the Orlando terror attack if we need AR-15s to “hunt and kill deer” and to “protect our families.”

Noting Carlson’s support for most Second Amendment issues, on this matter Raso said she “does not understand what she’s talking about. The Second Amendment has nothing to do with hunting.”

Raso wrapped up his argument by saying law enforcement officials armed with AR-15s ended the recent terror attacks on U.S. soil, as well as in France and Belgium. Which prompted him to wonder why Clinton believes the answer “is to ban the very gun that stops terror attacks.”

“Why would you want to ban the gun that you pray for police to show up with?” Raso asked.

That’s what Glenn Beck said on his morning radio show Thursday as he discussed AR-15s. But why? Is an AR-15 not an assault rifle? Does the “AR” in AR-15 not stand for “assault rifle”?

It doesn’t. In fact, it doesn’t mean “automatic rifle” either, as many might think. AR actually stands for ArmaLite rifle, which is the company that first developed it in the 1950s.

It seems that there is a lot of confusion as to the difference between military rifles and those designed for civilian ownership, especially because of the language often used to describe the latter. The most popular terms to describe the weapons at the center of the recent gun control debate are “military-style” and “assault.” These words have long been used to to describe civilian firearms like the AR-15, but some consider it an inappropriate association that is deliberately being made to “demonize” the guns.

As Beck radio producer Stu Burguiere put it on the show Thursday, “they are targeting these weapons because they think the public is confused enough that they can get away with it — and they are.”

With what seems to be little understanding or agreement on the definition of what constitutes an assault rifle and the difference between civilian and military arms, TheBlaze went searching.

Military vs. Civilian Rifles — What’s the Difference?

For the purpose of this article, we’ll focus on AR-15s since it is what CBS calls “the most popular rifle in America” and one often designated an “assault” rifle. An AR-15 is the civilian equivalent to the military’s M-16. So what’s the difference?

Kelly Alwood, a firearms trainer and consultant, told TheBlaze the only difference is that one is fully automatic and the other is semi-automatic. It’s a small yet simultaneously big distinction. Firearms for use by the military are able to shoot continuously with one pull of the trigger, machine-gun style. Civilian firearms, on the other hand, only allow one shot per trigger pull.

Chris Parrett, a firearms enthusiast, pointed out that modifying a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic one is not only highly illegal with extreme penalties but also no easy feat.

What Constitutes an ‘Assault’ Rifle?

Merriam-Webster Dictonary defines “assault rifle” as “any of various automatic or semiautomatic rifles with large capacity magazines designed for military use.” The keywords here are “designed for military use.”

If that definition doesn’t quite cut it for you, here’s how David Kopel (via the Washington Examiner) describes it in an article in the “Journal of Contemporary Law” based on a definition from the Department of Defense (emphasis added):

As the United States Defense Department’s Defense Intelligence Agency book Small Arms Identification and Operation Guide explains, “assault rifles” are “short, compact, selective-fire weapons that fire a cartridge intermediate in power between submachine gun and rifle cartridges.”[21] In other words, assault rifles are battlefield rifles which can fire automatically.[22] Weapons capable of fully automatic fire, including assault rifles, have been regulated heavily in the United States since the National Firearms Act of 1934.[23] Taking possession of such weapons requires paying a $200 federal transfer tax and submitting to an FBI background check, including ten-print fingerprints.[24] Many civilians have purchased semiautomatic-only rifles that look like military assault rifles. These civilian rifles are, unlike actual assault rifles, incapable of automatic fire.

Based on these two definitions, since AR-15 is designed for civilian use, it therefore doesn’t fit with the definition of an “assault” weapon. This then begs the question why the association is being made in the first place.

“It was the Left who needed a term to call them,” Beck said on radio Thursday. “They are trying to make you think …’an AR-15, nobody needs that.’ An AR-15 is just a rifle, unless it has a fully automatic switch on it and then it becomes a machine gun — and you can’t buy that.”

(Editor’s note: machine guns, or automatic weapons, are reserved for the military but they can be purchased for a relatively high cost after a very lengthy background check and licensing procedure. See David Kopel’s definition we included above.)

“It’s a way to demonize something for a political agenda and misconstrue [the guns] and the public on the Second Amendment,” Alwood said.

Alwood, who the day he spoke with TheBlaze was traveling around helping police departments with their rifles, pointed out that all arguments for further gun control regulations or bans seem to go back the question “what would you possibly need this for?” Or rather, why would someone need the civilian equivalent to a military firearm?

Alwood said many gun control advocates would tie this question to hunting. In other words, why would a hunter need such a firearm? As the governor of New York Andrew Coumo said his State of the State address this week, “no one hunts with an assault rifle.” To which Alwood would respond, 1) there are practical applications in hunting with a so-called assault rifle and, 2) “the Second Amendment wasn’t designed for hunting,” an association which he thinks started being made in the 1980s.

“We need these rifles because the government has them,” Alwood explained.

He stopped there to say he realizes this is where gun enthusiasts and riflemen are made out to seem like anti-government “whack jobs” by the media, but that’s just not true.

“I don’t want people to think of me as anti-government. Most gun owners are not anti-government,” Alwood said.

He added that the Founding Fathers drafted the Second Amendment with protection of the citizens and their freedoms in mind.

“[Without the Second Amendment] there is no way to resist the government, voiding all other amendments,” Alwood said. “Why should [the government] continue to give you your freedom of speech if there is no one to stop them. It’s the only safeguard we have to protect us from a tyrannical government. …Look at all countries in trouble with dictators, they have absolute gun bans.”

The conservative publication Townhall recently called out two countries with a similar sentiment to this in mind:

Neither the Venezuelan nor Chinese governments have particularly good track records when it comes to human rights. By maintaining a government monopoly on guns, both can ensure that further abuses are carried out with less protests from the citizenry. Overall, it is sad to see two dictatorial governments making it easier to abuse their citizens as they please while also squelching the possibility for resistance.

(AP) — A suburban Portland pastor who won an AR-15 rifle in a raffle and then said he gave it a gun-owning friend for safekeeping will not be prosecuted for transferring the weapon without conducting a background check, authorities said.

Officials were investigating whether Rev. Jeremy Lucas may have violated a recent state law that makes transferring a gun without a background check illegal, even if the arrangement is between private parties and no money changes hands.

But investigators uncovered no evidence that Lucas, 45, actually transferred the gun and never determined the name of the gun-owning friend, Clackamas County District Attorney John S. Foote said in a letter to the Oregon State Police.

The letter was written on Sept. 9 and made public Thursday by state police.

Lucas declined to speak with investigators, state police said in a statement.

“Without the transferee in this case, I don’t think we could ever have a prosecutable case,” Foote wrote.

Lucas, a pastor at Christ Church Episcopal Parish in the affluent suburb of Lake Oswego about 10 miles south of Portland, said in interviews this summer that he spent about $3,000 in discretionary church funds to buy as many rifle raffle tickets as he could for a softball league fundraiser.

When he won, he passed a background check to take possession of the weapon.

He told The Washington Post in July that after he won the rifle, he gave it to a friend for temporary safe-keeping.

But a state law passed last year makes transferring a gun without a background check illegal, even if the arrangement is between private parties and no money changes hands.

The Oregon Firearms Federation, which lobbied against passage of the law, pointed out Lucas’s potential law violation to the Oregon State Police, the Lake Oswego Police Department and 30 state lawmakers.

Kevin Starrett, the group’s executive director, said Friday he was not surprised that authorities did not charge Lucas.

“Of course they would not prosecute, because it would illuminate the lunacy of this law,” he said. “It’s theater. It’s farce.”

Comments Lucas made to the newspaper about the transfer of the gun were “insufficient to prove that it happened,” Foote wrote.

Lucas could not be reached to comment Friday at the parish offices, which were closed for the day.

There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment sent to a general parish account."
blaze29,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2016-06-14 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/06/14/despite-what-youve-heard-the-orlando-terrorist-did-not-use-an-ar-15-in-attack,"Several news outlets have identified the weapon used in the Orlando terrorist attack as an AR-15 rifle.

“AR-15 Rifle Used in Orlando Massacre Has Bloody Pedigree,” an NBC News headline reads.

“Orlando Shooting Puts Spotlight on AR-15 Rifle,” Newsweek declared.

The Washington Post offered the headline: “The history of the AR-15, the weapon that had a hand in the United States’ worst mass shooting.”

However, it turns out the Islamic State-supporting killer didn’t actually use an AR-15 to carry out the insidious at a gay nightclub that left 49 people dead and dozens more injured.

The terrorist was actually armed with a Sig Sauer MCX carbine. Bearing Arms’ Bob Owens has more details about the firearm and how it relates to an AR-15:

The rifle used by the Islamist terrorist in Orlando was instead a Sig Sauer MCX carbine, a modular, multi-caliber (able to swap to different calibers, including 5.56 NATO, 300 BLK, and 7.62×39) rifle system that sometimes utilizes STANAG magazines common to more than 60 different firearms, but otherwise has no major parts that interface with AR-15s in any way, shape or form.

So how did the weapon become erroneously classified as an AR-15?

It appears that Orlando Police Chief John Mina initially described the weapon as an “AR-15-style assault rifle” and media outlets ran with the classification, several dropping “style” from the description.

The AR-15 is one of the most popular rifles in the U.S. and is regularly demonized by gun control advocates as a “weapon of war.” The semi-automatic rifle is also routinely confused as being a “machine gun” or fully automatic.

John Carney (D) said Friday that he is proposing a statewide ban on the sale of “assault weapons” in the wake of the deadly Florida high school shooting, which killed 17 people and injured many more on Feb. 14.

What did Carney say?

Carney explained that, in addition to other statewide gun safety measures in the works, his team will “work closely with lawmakers to craft legislation that would prohibit the sale of assault-style rifles” in the state.

“As we have seen in Las Vegas, Parkland, and in many other horrific incidents across our country, military-style weapons can be used to carry out catastrophic acts of violence,” Carney noted. “They have no place on the streets of our neighborhoods.”

According to spokesman Jonathan Starkey, Carney is not aiming to ban “military-style” guns that have already been legally purchased, but instead has aims to prevent any more of these weapons from being purchased from local gun shops, according to Delaware Online.

“President [Donald] Trump and members of Congress have the authority to take responsible action nationally to reduce the toll of gun violence across our country,” Starkey added, according to the Washington Post. “Governor Carney believes they should act but won’t wait to do what is within our power here in Delaware to make our state safer.”

Delaware Online reported that Carney’s definitions of the terms “assault-style rifles” and “military-style weapons” — terms that were used interchangeably in his statement — were not clear.

In response to Carney’s announcement, House Republican Leader Danny Short released the following statement:

Whenever there is a horrendous event involving firearms and a large loss of life, there is a knee-jerk reaction to do something, anything, to fight the horror and pain. That is an understandable human response, but it is a poor way to make meaningful public policy. We had a federal ban on assault weapons between 1994 and 2004. It proved ineffective. One of the problems then, as now, is defining an “assault weapon.” True assault weapons — rifles capable of fully automatic fire — are already illegal for most Americans to own and have been for decades. What the governor apparently means by the provocative term is any semi-automatic rifle resembling a military weapon, like the AR-15 rifle used in the recent Florida tragedy. According to the National Rifle Association, Americans own about five million AR-15s alone. Millions more semi-automatic rifles of other types are also owned by Americans — the vast majority of which will never be employed in any crime. Such rifles are ubiquitous. It also needs to be stressed that violent crime in our nation has dropped dramatically. According to the Pew Research Center (using FBI data) the violent crime rate in the U.S. has fallen by 48% between 1993 and 2016. Passing laws to restrict the basic firearms ownership rights, guaranteed by both our federal and state constitutions, is not the answer to reducing the anomalous incidents of mass violence perpetrated by a few deranged individuals. I, and my caucus colleagues, generally support a ban on the sale and use of so-called bump-stocks and trigger-crank devices. And, in lieu of HB 302 (the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act), we support enactment of House Bill 285, which will create procedures for making sure firearms do not find their way into the hands of dangerous people, while protecting due process and avoiding the creation of barriers to treat those suffering from mental illnesses. In contrast to HB 302, HB 285 has bipartisan support and is far more comprehensive in its approach. The proposed assault weapon sales ban is a misguided effort that will only serve to further politically polarize Delawareans with no hope of making any real impact on the desired goal of reducing isolated incidents of mass violence. I instead urge the governor to work in a non-partisan fashion with all the members of the 149th General Assembly to create rational laws that will actually make a difference.

Are there any other state officials looking into doing something similar?"
blaze31,blaze,['Wayne Allyn Root'],2015-07-27 09:59:44-04:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/donald-trumps-mouth-is-a-nuclear-weapon,"The biased, clueless liberal mainstream media are in shock and awe. They have no idea why so many Americans love Donald Trump. But the answer is so simple and clear. Just ask any conservative.

Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air. Donald Trump is the answer to what ails America – simply because he kills two birds with one stone.

America has two big problems. America is under attack by a vicious one-two combination. America has been ruined by two parties. And Donald Trump’s mouth solves both problems. Donald Trump’s mouth is a nuclear weapon.

[sharequote align=”center”]America is being lost because the GOP is bringing knives to a gunfight.[/sharequote]

Democrats clearly hate American exceptionalism, capitalism, entrepreneurship, and Judeo-Christian values. They hate business owners (see “You didn’t build that”) and appear to blame American patriotism, white people, business owners and Christians for every problem in the world today.

The Democrat Party is riddled with socialists, Marxists and communists hell bent on “fundamentally changing America.”

The Democrat Party is filled with frauds (see President Barack Obama, Jonathan Gruber and the lies used to sell Obamacare); traitors (see Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry and the new Iran nuclear treaty); thieves and conmen (see the scandal involving $2 billion donated to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state); reckless wasters of taxpayer money (see Obama’s Kenya trip that cost us over $50 million dollars for one day in a country that offers America NOTHING ); and outright criminals (see Hillary’s upcoming criminal investigation and Obama’s use of the IRS to target, persecute and even attempt to imprison political opponents and critics).

But the GOP may be worse.

If there’s anything worse than evil, it’s cowardice in the face of evil. The GOP leadership is riddled with cowards, wimps and naïve, feckless, country club powder puffs who have no clue how to fight back against the Democrats ruining America and destroying our children’s future with debt. Yes, Democrats are the bad guys. But Republicans are standing by helplessly, scared and petrified, allowing it to happen.

I suspect many of the Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. are either being bribed or blackmailed. Exhibit A is Supreme Court Justice Roberts, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. These guys are all either bought and paid for; or someone is holding a gun to their heads (along with a photo of them in bed doing something shocking). Don’t believe me? See the criminal case against former Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert. They are all doing something morally wrong, or breaking some law. And Obama’s partners in the National Security Administration and IRS are always watching. America is being lost because the GOP is bringing knives to a gunfight.

The only way to save America is to bring a nuclear weapon to a gun fight. And Donald Trump’s mouth is a nuclear weapon.

It’s time to stop being “nice.” “Nice” is okay for playing golf with Muffy at the country club. But “nice” doesn’t work in politics. “Nice” guys finish last in politics. “Nice” is getting our country ruined. “Nice” is killing middle class jobs. “Nice” is wiping out middle class incomes. “Nice” has led to negative GDP growth. “Nice” has led to more businesses closing than opening each day for the first time in America’s history. “Nice” has left the border wide open to an illegal alien invasion, the bankruptcy of America and a terrorist attack like Sept. 11, 2001.

“Nice” has led to disaster and disgrace all over the globe. The world no longer has any respect for, or fear of America. We are in decline and disarray. We are headed for collapse and disaster.

Into this crisis steps “the nuclear mouth” Donald Trump. He isn’t afraid to put America first. He isn’t afraid to tell the truth. He isn’t afraid of what the media thinks. He isn’t afraid of being called a “racist” for pointing out how Obama has damaged and destroyed America. He isn’t afraid to question Obama’s very mysterious, questionable and troubling past – much of it sealed away in darkness.

Trump isn’t afraid to fight like our future is on the line because he understands it is. He isn’t afraid to offend. He isn’t afraid to expose the cowards and frauds in his own GOP leadership for what they are. He refuses to be “politically correct” when he sees corruption and idiocy. He won’t back down or apologize for telling the truth.

Of course the evil Democrats, corrupt and cowardly GOP leadership, and biased mainstream media hate him. They are all rooting for another Mitt Romney. Let’s compare Mitt to Donald Trump:

They are both rich white guys. Both famous successful businessmen. Both Republican presidential candidates past and present. That’s where the similarity ends.

Mitt Romney is a very nice guy. Mitt has manners. Mitt would never offend anyone. Mitt let the media run roughshod over him. Mitt would never say something rude or offensive about Obama or Hillary. Mitt would never accuse them of crimes against the American people. Mitt would never prosecute Obama or Hillary if he was elected.

And one other difference: Mitt lost.

It’s no coincidence that Mitt lost. The last thing we need now is “nice.” It’s also no coincidence that the people in power (evil Democrats, the corrupt GOP leadership, and the mainstream media) all want another Mitt Romney. They want the status quo. They want to keep the bribes and blackmail coming. They don’t want anyone to upset the apple cart.

They are scared to death of Donald Trump, who doesn’t play by traditional rules or etiquette. They are scared to death of a guy who can’t be bribed. They are scared to death of a guy who speaks about the hopes, dreams and fears of middle class Americans. They are scared to death of a street fighter. They are scared to death of a candidate who is as relentless for saving America…as Obama is for destroying America. Donald Trump understands what I call, “The Power of Relentless.”

Mostly, they are scared to death of Trump’s mouth. The kind of mouth that could stir up a citizen revolution and topple “business as usual” in Washington, D.C.

Yes Donald Trump’s mouth is a nuclear weapon. And that’s precisely why we love him.

Bombs away!

The court stated that 81 weapons, as well as semi-automatics that use detachable magazines, and can sport two or more features such as a flash suppressor, or a folding stock as “dangerous and unusual” and being “exceptionally lethal weapons of war,” by majority opinion writer Judge Robert B. King.

The majority is of the opinion that such weapons that look like rifles used by our military in wartime should not be accessible by civilians.

Our ruling on Second Amendment protection is limited and clear: Because the FSA-banned assault weapons and large capacity magazines are like M16s, in that they are most useful in military service, they are not protected by the Second Amendment.

Later…

Rather, the issue is whether the banned assault weapons and large-capacity magazines possess an amalgam of features that render those weapons and magazines like M16s and most useful in military service.

The M16 is a fully automatic rifle, seeing use in our military since the Vietnam war. However, none of the banned guns are capable of firing like the M16. A popular rifle civilians tend to use is the AR-15, a semi-automatic. While unable to fire automatically, the Ar-15’s high modifiability has arisen concerns amongst lawmakers unfamiliar with how the rifle works.

Regardless, by calling the banned weapons “dangerous and unusual” the 4th Circuit court has utilized Supreme Court language from the District of Columbia v. Heller case to support their ruling. However, as Reason’s Jacob Sullum notes, this description of the weapons doesn’t add up, and flies in the face of Heller.

The majority’s judgment that folding stocks, flare launchers, and flash suppressors make rifles “exceptionally lethal” is dubious. It is also irrelevant, because the Supreme Court did not say the Second Amendment allows bans on exceptionally lethal weapons. It said the Second Amendment allows bans on “dangerous and unusual” weapons that are not “in common use for lawful purposes,” and that description plainly does not apply to rifles that are among the most popular in the country. The argument that magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds are more lethal than smaller magazines is more logical but still irrelevant, since “large-capacity magazines” are very common, sold standard with many handguns and rifles.

This was also seemingly the view of the dissenting judges. Judge William B. Traxler Jr. — joined by Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Dennis W. Shedd and G. Steven Agee — stated that the majority have “gone to greater lengths than any other court to eviscerate the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.”

“As long as the weapon chosen is one commonly possessed by the American people for lawful purposes — and the rifles at issue here most certainly are. The state has very little say about whether its citizens should keep it in their homes for protection.”

Heller is quite clear that rifles in lawful common use are protected under the 2nd Amendment, however the 4th circuit seems to have ignored this, along with the 75 million magazines that hold ten or more bullets common among the American populace. As National Review Online Editor Charles C. Cooke notes, “…the majority doesn’t care about that, choosing to apply only the “military” standard that it has invented.”"

Merriam-Webster Dictonary defines “assault rifle” as “any of various automatic or semiautomatic rifles with large capacity magazines designed for military use.” The keywords here are “designed for military use.”

If that definition doesn’t quite cut it for you, here’s how David Kopel (via the Washington Examiner) describes it in an article in the “Journal of Contemporary Law” based on a definition from the Department of Defense (emphasis added):

As the United States Defense Department’s Defense Intelligence Agency book Small Arms Identification and Operation Guide explains, “assault rifles” are “short, compact, selective-fire weapons that fire a cartridge intermediate in power between submachine gun and rifle cartridges.”[21] In other words, assault rifles are battlefield rifles which can fire automatically.[22] Weapons capable of fully automatic fire, including assault rifles, have been regulated heavily in the United States since the National Firearms Act of 1934.[23] Taking possession of such weapons requires paying a $200 federal transfer tax and submitting to an FBI background check, including ten-print fingerprints.[24] Many civilians have purchased semiautomatic-only rifles that look like military assault rifles. These civilian rifles are, unlike actual assault rifles, incapable of automatic fire.

Based on these two definitions, since AR-15 is designed for civilian use, it therefore doesn’t fit with the definition of an “assault” weapon. This then begs the question why the association is being made in the first place.

(Editor’s note: machine guns, or automatic weapons, are reserved for the military but they can be purchased for a relatively high cost after a very lengthy background check and licensing procedure. See David Kopel’s definition we included above.)

“It’s a way to demonize something for a political agenda and misconstrue [the guns] and the public on the Second Amendment,” Alwood said.

Alwood, who the day he spoke with TheBlaze was traveling around helping police departments with their rifles, pointed out that all arguments for further gun control regulations or bans seem to go back the question “what would you possibly need this for?” Or rather, why would someone need the civilian equivalent to a military firearm?

Alwood said many gun control advocates would tie this question to hunting. In other words, why would a hunter need such a firearm? As the governor of New York Andrew Coumo said his State of the State address this week, “no one hunts with an assault rifle.” To which Alwood would respond, 1) there are practical applications in hunting with a so-called assault rifle and, 2) “the Second Amendment wasn’t designed for hunting,” an association which he thinks started being made in the 1980s.

“We need these rifles because the government has them,” Alwood explained.

He stopped there to say he realizes this is where gun enthusiasts and riflemen are made out to seem like anti-government “whack jobs” by the media, but that’s just not true.

“I don’t want people to think of me as anti-government. Most gun owners are not anti-government,” Alwood said.

He added that the Founding Fathers drafted the Second Amendment with protection of the citizens and their freedoms in mind.

“[Without the Second Amendment] there is no way to resist the government, voiding all other amendments,” Alwood said. “Why should [the government] continue to give you your freedom of speech if there is no one to stop them. It’s the only safeguard we have to protect us from a tyrannical government. …Look at all countries in trouble with dictators, they have absolute gun bans.”

The conservative publication Townhall recently called out two countries with a similar sentiment to this in mind:

Neither the Venezuelan nor Chinese governments have particularly good track records when it comes to human rights. By maintaining a government monopoly on guns, both can ensure that further abuses are carried out with less protests from the citizenry. Overall, it is sad to see two dictatorial governments making it easier to abuse their citizens as they please while also squelching the possibility for resistance.

Florida resident Ivette Ros, a former bank manager at Wells Fargo, claims she feels “naked” without her gun and says because she had a concealed carry permit it was unlawful for her employer to terminate her for carrying, the Tampa Tribune reported.

“I am within my constitutional right,” Ros reportedly said. “The bank is one of the places that I am able to carry a weapon to. My weapon was concealed. I have a certified license.”

Last year someone noticed Ros was carrying a firearm and reported her to bank officials, according to the Tribune. She was later fired.

“I’m a manager of a bank,” she added. “We have a lot of robberies that happen in our banks. I feel safer having that weapon if I ever needed to protect my employees.”

[sharequote align=”center”]”I feel safer having that weapon if I ever needed to protect my employees.”[/sharequote]

However, while Wells Fargo wouldn’t comment on a specific ongoing case, the bank told the Tribune that they have a strict policy forbidding firearms.

“Team members are strictly prohibited from possession of firearms and weapons on company premises,” spokeswoman Kathy Harrison reportedly said.

Ros’ lawyer disagrees.

“Employers can’t discriminate against their employees nor can they discriminate against their customers if they are … law-abiding, licensed concealed weapons permit owners,” Noel Flasterstein told the Tribune.

“Just because it’s in their handbook doesn’t mean it is correct or it will withstand a legal scrutiny or a legal investigation, which is what we’re doing in this case,” he reportedly added.

Another legal expert, however, said Ros was outside her legal rights, noting that Wells Fargo is a private institution.

“There is nothing in the state statute that says the employer has to let her bring it into the building,” reportedly said Jason Bent, an assistant professor of law at Stetson University College of Law.

The bank does offer some exceptions in certain areas, though, that would allow team members to store their firearm in their vehicle while they work at the bank, the Tribune reported.

Ponce. The Navy spent $40 million developing the Laser Weapons System, or LaWS, which only costs about a $1 each time it’s fired. The beam travels at the speed of light and doesn’t need to take wind speed or range into account.

Naval officers tout the advantages and benefits of the system, saying, “Operationally it works just like a laser pointer.” The weapon is silent, so enemy combatants cannot anticipate the strike. It is so accurate, it can pick drones out of the sky or specifically target an enemy ship’s engine.

This type of targeting could reduce the lethality of engaging the enemy, disabling their vehicles and weaponry while reducing casualties. Mike Opelka remarked on today’s “Pure Opelka” that the weapon’s use of photons reminds him of “Star Trek,” the 1960s science fiction show based on a naval military structure that used “photon torpedoes” and “phasers.”

blaze36,blaze,['Buck Sexton'],2012-01-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/01/13/here-are-five-of-the-most-expensive-military-weapons-on-earth,"Earlier this month, The Blaze brought you the single most expensive piece of military hardware ever — the new Ford Class USS Gerald Ford Aircraft Carrier.

But military spending in 2010 was $693 billion — nearly half of all military spending on earth. So other than aircraft carriers, where is all that money going?

Take a look below to get a good idea. With an eye to the dollars and cents of major U.S. military programs, the website 24/7 Wall Street has put together a list of the most expensive U.S. military weapons. Cost figures come from documents published by the Department of Defense and the Government Accountability Office.

Check them out. All are amazing pieces of hardware, but you’ll have to determine for yourself if any of them could be considered a bargain:

1) F-22 Raptor

> Type: stealth fighter jet

> Total Cost: $79.2 billion

> R&D: $40.5 billion

> Procurement Cost: $37.9 billion

> Total Units: 188

> Price per Unit: $211.6 million

Many people say the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is the best fighter jet in the world, hands down. One thing is for sure — it’s the most expensive at $211 million per unit. The DOD budget has 188 on its current budget. Other countries want them, but so far Congress has banned the sale of Raptors to any country.

The Raptor is a hyper-maneuverable, stealth-enabled fighter and can eliminate targets long before they even know it’s in the sky. Equipped with two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, six medium-range air-to-air missiles, a 20 mm gatling gun, two 1,000 pound bombs and eight 250 pound bombs, it gives the U.S. complete air dominance capabilities.

2) Virginia Class Submarine

> Type: nuclear submarine

> Total Cost: $83.7 billion

> R&D: $7.2 billion

> Procurement Cost: $76.6 billion

> Total Units: 30

> Price per Unit: $2,552.6 million

The Virginia Class subs are among the most useful strategic tools in the DOD arsenal. These nuclear submarines can carry 38 different weapons, including Tomahawk Cruise Missiles, mines and torpedoes. While eight are currently in operation, the Department of Defense has 30 of these $2.5 billion mobile undersea missile platforms budgeted.

Here is a video overview of the Virginia Class Sub, courtesy of the Military Channel:



3 ) Trident II Missile

> Type: ballistic missile

> Total Cost: $53.2 billion

> R&D: $16.8 billion

> Procurement Cost: $35 billion

> Total Units: 561

> Price per Unit: $65.7 million

The Trident II is the most advanced U.S. Navy ballistic missile. Equipped with a thermonuclear warhead, the Trident II is carried by most Ohio-class submarines. According to 24/7:

“The missile is 44 feet long and weighs 80 tons. Equipped with a three-stage rocket, the missile is capable of traveling at more than 13,000 miles per hour, and has a range of 4,600 miles. The Department of Defense currently has 561 Tridents on the budget, each worth more than $65 million, not counting research and development costs.”

4) V-22 Osprey

> Type: tiltrotor transport plane

> Total Cost: $57.8 billion

> R&D: $13.6 billion

> Procurement Cost: $43.5 billion

> Total Units: 459

> Price per Unit: $95.2 million

The V-22 Osprey is a hybrid plane/helicopter design — called a “tiltrotor aircraft” — which means it can engage in extremely short take-offs and landings, as well as hover in place.

But when the rotors come forward, it has much longer range than a helicopter. The Osprey is a transport craft that can travel up to 390 nautical miles without refueling at speeds surpassing 260 miles per hour. The 459 Ospreys include in the Pentagon budget cost a cool $95.2 million dollars each.

5) Arleigh Burke-class Destroyer

> Type: destroyer

> Total Cost: $101.8 billion

> R&D: $5.1

> Procurement Cost: $96.6 billion

> Total Units: 75

> Price per Unit: $1,299.3 million

The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, also known as the DDG 5, has been part of the U.S. Navy’s fleet since 1995. These days there are about 60 in active service, with 15 more in the DOD budget. At more than 500 feet long, stem to stern, the larger generation of Arleigh Burkes displace roughly 9,200 tons, with 350 servicemen on each vessel.

The newest generation is equipped with two vertical launching systems for tomahawk missiles, a 5″ gun, torpedoes and an advanced mine-detection system.

blaze37,blaze,['Tré Goins-Phillips'],2017-02-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/03/mattis-promises-overwhelming-response-if-north-korea-uses-nuclear-weapons,"Secretary of Defense James Mattis is taking a hardline stance against North Korea over its saber-rattling, promising an “effective and overwhelming” response should the country ever use nuclear weapons.

“Any attack on the United States — or our allies — will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming,” the retired four-star Marine general said Friday during an appearance with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-Koo, Reuters reported.

Mattis’ comments follow continued concerns that North Korea could be preparing to test a new ballistic missile — a move that could prove to be an early challenge for the Trump White House. In his New Year’s address, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un said his country is in the “final stage” of preparation to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, NPR reported.

An intercontinental ballistic missile is a land-based, nuclear-armed ballistic weapon with a trajectory of more than 3,500 miles.

North Korea, which frequently vows to destroy both South Korea and the U.S., conducted more than 20 missile tests in 2016, as well as five nuclear tests over the last decade, defying United Nations sanctions against them.

Former President Barack Obama received criticism last year from both Republicans and then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for not taking a stronger position against North Korea after it conducted its fifth nuclear test, according to Politico.

Obama’s opponents and allies alike distanced themselves from the White House for being too soft on Chinese companies, banks and individuals doing business with North Korea. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, China is North Korea’s “most important ally, biggest trading partner, and main source of food, arms, and energy.”

Beijing, while it has sought a denuclearized North Korea, has long opposed strong sanctions against Pyongyang, citing concerns that a regime collapse in the North could lead to an intense influx of refugees across their 870-mile border.

Obama “should immediately make full use of the sanctions authorities Congress gave him earlier this year,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said at the time.

“He should join me in urging China, as Pyongyang’s chief sponsor, to fully enforce the international sanctions on the Kim regime,” Ryan added, referring to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

Clinton, for her part, called for a “rethinking” of the U.S.’s strategy against North Korea. She called the nuclear and missile tests “outrageous and unacceptable” and described the country’s “determination to develop a deliverable nuclear weapon” as a “direct threat to the United States.”

According to Reuters, North Korea has also apparently restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility, which produces plutonium to be used for the country’s nuclear weapons program.

According to new data from South Korea, the Kim regime has stockpiled enough plutonium to develop 10 nuclear warheads, Time reported last month.

“North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior,” Mattis said.

In response to the continued missile and nuclear tests from the Kim regime, the U.S. and South Korea have developed the U.S. missile defense system, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), which is expected to be deployed in South Korea later this year.

THAAD is a land-based, vehicle-mounted system developed by Lockheed Martin with a “globally-transportable, rapidly-deployable capability to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles inside or outside the atmosphere during their final, or terminal, phase of flight,” according to the Defense Department’s Missile Defense Agency.

While the Chinese Foreign Ministry, through spokesman Lu Kang, said it does “not believe [THAAD] will be conducive” to resolving the North’s nuclear proliferation, the South Korean defense minister said Mattis’ remarks send a clear message.

“Faced with a current severe security situation, Secretary Mattis’ visit to Korea … also communicates the strongest warning to North Korea,” Han said."

From the Daily Mail:

It was created by crossing three of the hottest varieties of chilli pods known to man. The result is a record breaking chilli that will make your eyes stream, throat burn, nose run and much, much worse. The Naga Viper chilli packs an astonishing 1,359,000 on the Scoville scale, which measures heat by the presence of the chemical compound capsaicin. Experts at Warwick University carried out tests on the chilli and officially declared it the hottest. It beat competition from the ferocious Bhut Jolokia pod – the previous holder – to take the title of the world’s hottest chilli in the Guinness Book of World Records.

The pepper is the creation of British chili pepper farmer Gerald Fowler.

“It numbs your tongue, then burns all the way down,” he told the Daily Mail. “It can last an hour, and you just don’t want to talk to anyone or do anything.”

The pepper is so hot Fowler, who owns a local pub, makes customers sign a disclaimer stating they are “of sound body and mind” before sampling a curry cooked with Naga Viper. Only two have managed to finish the whole dish."

But right when you thought his homemade artillery couldn’t get anymore intense, he shows off one that he has kept secret for a while.

It’s a sophisticated thrower of circular saw blades.

Why was this “rotational saw blade shooter”, which Sprave compares to a traditional clay pigeon thrower that’s fired like a rifle, kept secret? Sprave said he designed for a television show and couldn’t publicly showcase it until now.

Although Sprave made some adjustments to account for the disc shape and spin of the ammo to improve accuracy, he said it is “in no ways a sniper rifle.”

The rational saw blade shooter doesn’t make its appearance in Sprave’s video until after he shows off a nail shooter, so skip to 2:46 if you only want to watch the circular blades fly:

An ABC News reporter said he found one of those heroes, Mike Cronk, sitting on a curb “with his head in his hands.” Cronk was shirtless at the time — having used the article of clothing to put pressure on bullet wounds — and gave a short interview describing the terrifying scene.

In a second interview with ABC News, Cronk offered more details about what happened after his best friend was shot in the chest three times.

He told the reporter that after the shots rang out “my buddy is like, ‘I got hit.'”

“It seemed like forever,” he recalled, noting that many people were “selfless” and stayed with the wounded.

When the reporter added that Cronk is a retired teacher who came to Las Vegas for his 48th birthday — and that his seriously wounded friend Rob was standing just inches away when the shooting started — Cronk paused and teared up.

“It was hard,” he said.

“Everybody pretty much dove on top of each other,” he continued, adding that it was “chaos” and that there were “people trampling each other, trying to get away.”

Cronk, who’s a hunter, told ABC News he realized the gunfire was “fully automatic.”

But Cronk’s face brightened when he noted an EMT and trained, ex-military people jumped right in to help compress his friend’s wounds — and they actually had their fingers in the bullet holes to help stop the bleeding, Cronk recalled.

Even his wounded friend Rob had his own finger in one of the holes: “He was like, ‘Don’t take it out … leave your finger there, we’ll compress over the top of it.”

He said that he and three other men hauled his friend over a fence and then they all got under the stage for protection — and that’s where “another awesome lady came over and helped compress,” Cronk said.

“I’m no hero,” he said before praising the “tons of heroes” who helped.

But once they got his friend out from under the stage and into a pickup truck — along with other wounded people — they got turned right back around because it was an active shooter situation. Eventually, they found an ambulance and helped get the wounded inside.

And that’s when another tragedy struck Cronk: Another shooting victim whom he did not know but was helping died in his arms.

Describing that moment, Cronk teared up again and paused for several moments before saying, “It’s been a tough night … So many people died and are wounded. It’s very sad. … It’s a terrible tragedy. I don’t know what other words you can use for it.”

But there was happy news for Cronk — he learned that his seriously wounded friend was going to be OK.

Still, Cronk acknowledged, “it could have been me. I was right next to my buddy.”

And it could have been Cronk’s girlfriend, too — but he told ABC News that she got sick after about an hour in the heat and returned to their hotel.

When the reporter praised Cronk’s for his actions, he replied that “you try to keep your head and do what you can. But like I said, there’s tons of people who were true heroes tonight.”"

WJW-TV reported that Plesec was holding his Bible and reading Scripture to the suspect in the moments leading up to his death early Saturday.

According to the WKYC report, local law enforcement revealed that Jones, after allegedly killing Plesec, reportedly went on a carjacking spree that ended in nearby Lakewood.

What are the details?

Plesec, a Bible study teacher for the Salvation Army, was reportedly wearing his uniform, holding his Bible, and proselytizing to his alleged murderer when he was shot in the head and killed.

WKYC noted that Plesec was on his way to collect money for the organization’s annual Red Kettle campaign.

According to WKYC, police are charging Jones with aggravated murder, grand theft auto, and fleeing and eluding.

The incident remains under investigation.

Is there more?

The Salvation Army on Sunday released the following statement to WKYC:

It is with a heavy heart that I confirm your email. Jared was an employee (youth worker) and church member of The Salvation Army Temple Corps Community Center in Collinwood. Jared died as he lived, sharing God’s love. Jared passed away in full Salvation Army uniform with his Bible in hand leaving home on his day off to volunteer at The Salvation Army’s Red Kettle. In the past two days, hundreds of individuals, mostly youth, have flocked to The Salvation Army in Collinwood to pay tribute to Jared’s life. They all had one thing in common, Jared loved them, he cared for them and he changed their lives. Today our we feel great loss that Jared was taken from us too soon. Yet we rejoice that he is in heaven with the loving Heavenly Father he told so many people about. Well done, good and faithful servant.

Maj. Daniel Alverio of the Salvation Army told WJW that Plesec simply wanted to “teach people who God was” and to “love and care for people.”

“I would talk to Jared often and he would say that he was not afraid,” Alverio revealed. “I would say ‘Jared, be careful in the streets.’ He said, ‘I’m not afraid. I know where I’m going,’ and for him he would tell you to die is gain. Like he had no problem with the idea of being persecuted for the gospel.”

Alverio added, “He knew what he believed and he was assured that if anything ever happened to him he was going to be alright [sic].”

WJW reported on Monday that the city of Cleveland named a street after Plesec in his honor. According to the report, the portion of Cleveland’s Grovewood Avenue near the Salvation Army facility will be named after Plesec."

blaze43,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-07-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/07/17/questions-swirl-after-australian-woman-is-fatally-shot-by-minneapolis-police-bodycams-were-off,"Questions are swirling after a 40-year-old woman from Australia — a yoga and meditation teacher set to be married next month — was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer after family members said she called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night, the Star-Tribune reported.

Primary among those questions is why police bodycams weren’t on when 40-year-old Justine Damond was shot.

The Star-Tribune reported that three sources with knowledge of the incident said two officers in a squad car pulled into the alley in response to the 911 call. Damond — who was in her pajamas — went to the driver’s side door and was talking to the driver when the officer in the passenger seat pulled his gun and shot Damond through the driver’s side door, sources told the paper. No weapon was found at the scene, the Star-Tribune added.

“Two Minneapolis police officers responded to a 911 call of a possible assault just north of the 5100 block of Washburn Avenue S. just before 11:30 p.m. Saturday,” the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said in a news release, the paper said. “At one point, an officer fired their weapon, fatally striking a woman.”

The bureau’s release said that the “officers’ body cameras were not turned on at the time and the squad camera did not capture the incident. Investigators are attempting to determine whether any video of the incident exists.”

Minneapolis police told the paper the two officers are on paid administrative leave.

More from the Star-Tribune:

Zach Damond, 22, whose father, Don, 50, was to be married to Justine in August, arrived at the scene with a close family friend about 11:30 a.m. Sunday. While the couple were not yet married, Justine referred to herself as Damond on her personal website. Her maiden name was Justine Ruszczyk.

“Basically, my mom is dead because a police officer shot her for reasons I don’t know, and I demand answers,” Zach Damond said on a video, referring to the victim. “And If anybody can help, just call the police and demand answers. I’m so done with all this violence. It’s so much bulls**t. America sucks. These cops need to get trained differently. I need to move out of here.”

Here’s the clip. (Content warning: Profanity):

Zach Damond also said on the video that his stepmother-to-be — a native of Sydney, Australia — called police after she “heard a sound in the alley.” He added on the clip, “F*** the police.”

A woman named Hannah — who told the Star-Tribune she didn’t want to give her last name for safety reasons and is a close friend of the Damond family — came to the scene with Zach Damond and called Justine Damond a “spiritual healer.”

“I don’t know what she was doing out,” Hannah told the paper.

From her home in the middle of the block she shared with her fiance, Justine Damond would have had to walk just over 100 yards to get to the end of the alley, the Star-Tribune said.

“She’s such a kind woman,” Hannah told the paper. “She took me in when I was in a tough situation and helped me with whatever I needed.”

A Sunday night community vigil at the spot Justine Damond was shot drew about 50 friends and neighbors who held hands in a semicircle, the Star-Tribune reported, while another 200 or more watched from the sidewalk and the street.

Dustin Johnson and his wife, Roz, live across the street from where Justine Damond lived and told the paper they saw the flashing lights and walked over to see police trying to resuscitate her while she lay on the ground. Johnson told the Star-Tribune he heard no gunshots.

The shooting comes on the heels of a Minneapolis-area police officer’s controversial acquittal a year after he shot a black man, Philando Castile, during a traffic stop.

Hannah told the paper there’s no way Justine Damond would have had a gun and that she often noted how much better it was in Australia where people aren’t allowed to have guns.

Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges on Sunday said, “I am heartsick and deeply disturbed by the fatal officer-involved shooting that happened last night,” the Star-Tribune reported, adding that she said she has “questions about why the bodycams weren’t on.”"

The story began on New Year’s Day in 2016 when Smith was dispatched to an attempted robbery at a convenience store. The suspect was said to be wearing camouflage and a red bandanna.

When Smith arrived on scene, he confronted the suspect, Orr, 29, who continued to walk away from him despite being ordered to halt. Smith noticed the man had his hands in his pockets and drew his taser. The officer was wearing glasses with an attached camera and recorded the event on video.

“If you don’t stop sir, I’m going to tase you,” Smith said. “Take your hands out your pocket, take your hands out your pocket.”

“I didn’t draw my firearm because at the time I didn’t think it was warranted,” he told WJCL. “He was just walking away. But unfortunately I made a mistake and I drew my taser, and he got the upper hand on me.”

Orr quickly drew a handgun and fired at Smith, hitting him in the arm, neck, and torso. Smith panicked, and ran back to his unit. The video showed Smith’s bloody hand grabbing his radio and calling for help.

“Dispatch please tell my family I love them,” Smith said in the video.

According to WJCL, Smith is still recovering both physically and emotionally.

“I had nightmares sometimes about the incident. I’m still trying to heal up injuries to my arm,” Smith said.

WJCL reported that Smith’s neck and arm injuries have almost fully healed, and his physical therapy is nearly complete.

“I take it day by day with the support of friends and family and everybody else,” Smith said.

Despite his injuries, Smith said he has forgiven Orr.

WJCL reported that Orr was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 35 years in prison Wednesday. Smith said he prays for Orr and his family.

“Both our families are the ones really suffering the most. Violence and guns aren’t the answer, that’s why I became a police officer,” Smith said.

According to WJCL, Smith is still on medical leave, but he hopes to return to active duty with the Estill Police Department in 2018."

John Henry Barrett, 77, died in May from an infection and complications from the gunshot wound decades ago, and the Palm Beach County medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide.

Barrett was shot in the neck in 1958 at age 19 after a tense confrontation with a friend resulted in gunfire. The bullet, which damaged his spinal cord, left him partially paralyzed for the remainder of his life.

According to the Palm Beach Post, the shooter served time in prison for the crime, but the medical examiner’s report did not identify the shooter or indicate how long he had served time. Officials said they could not locate any information about the suspect in court records.

Barrett was a pastor for more than 30 years and became the first black executive director of the Pahokee Housing Authority. Although doctors told him he would probably never walk again, he eventually learned to walk using a cane. The Post recalled a 1974 interview he did with the Miami Herald when he told them he felt the incident was a blessing to his life.

“I don’t believe I’ll ever completely recover,” Barrett said in the interview. “But if the accident hadn’t happened, I would have spent all of my life as a farm worker.”

Family members said he tried to use his situation to inspire others around him. “He never wanted to be looked upon as [being disabled],” Terrance Lee, Barrett’s great-nephew, said. “He wanted to be looked up to as a normal person in society. That’s the way he lived his life.”"

According to the Jerusalem Post, the police are investigating how exactly the man made it through various security checkpoints, but believe that he did so by posing as a journalist.

“When the other officers saw the stabbing, they opened fire that led to him being incapacitated. When the troops approached the terrorist, they identified an explosive belt, which led to additional fire to prevent him from triggering it,” the police said in a statement.

The belt did not explode and Israeli police have opened an investigation into whether the man “had an explosive device on him or a fake explosive device on him.”

According to the Jerusalem Post, the Red Crescent took the wounded Israeli officer to Shaarei Tzedek hospital in Jerusalem, where he is in “moderate condition with two stab wounds in the upper body.”

In the eight-minute [GRAPHIC] video, the stabbing takes place out-of-frame. Amid screams and commotion, followed by several gunshots, and then the cameraman quickly rotates the camera as the man, backing up with his jacket open, shouts. The police shoot one shot into his left leg — he continues to step back — then one into his right leg — he falls backward, still looking toward the police — then once in his abdomen, sending the man backward into the ground.

The incident is the latest incident in a week of violence following President Donald Trump’s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Muslims throughout the world have protested the decision with violence and threats.

During a visit to European Union headquarters Monday in Brussels, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged EU members to follow Trump’s lead.

“For 3,000 years, Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people [and for 70 years] it has been the capital of Israel,” Netanyahu said. “I think what President Trump has down is put facts squarely on the table.”"
blaze47,blaze,['William Avitt'],2015-12-16 09:13:43-05:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/star-wars-why-han-shot-first-debate-is-still-important,"With the newest chapter of the “Star Wars” saga being released this weekend, we thought the time was right to revisit one of the franchise’s most prominent controversies: Han shot first.

For those not in the know, the controversy surrounds a change George Lucas made to the first film – Episode IV, ironically – when Han Solo was cornered in a seedy cantina by a bounty hunter named Greedo. In the original version, while Greedo has a blaster leveled at Han and is talking about how much he wants to shoot him, Han sneakily gets his own blaster out under the table and shoots the bounty hunter before his green-skinned adversary could get off a shot.

In 1997, in anticipation for the release of Episode “The Phantom Menace,” George Lucas re-released the original films in theaters with all new special effects and some deleted scenes put back in. Lucas dubbed these new cuts “Star Wars: The Special Edition.” It was in this “Special Edition” that he also made the change of having Greedo shoot first and miss, and then Han Solo shoot back.

For almost 20 years, this has been a hot button topic for fans. But it really is an important topic, and here’s why.

Back in 2012 Bill Whittle looked at this subject – which he called “this geek story” – from a real world point of view. To Whittle, it was a no-brainer that Han shot first. Why wouldn’t he shoot first? If someone who wants to kill you has a gun trained right on you, are you going to wait for them to shoot before you feel vindicated in “shooting back?”

To liberals, like George Lucas, that would seem to be the prudent thing. Let the bad guy shoot at you, and then you can shoot back and claim self-defense. If you shoot first, however – regardless of circumstances – you are a murderer. They would certainly have police live by this rule. The problem is, 10 times out of 10 if the bad guy gets the chance to shoot first, the good guy won’t have the opportunity to shoot back at all. He will be dead.

Writing for “Vulture,” attorney Josh Gilliand even explains step-by-step why Han Solo was perfectly justified under the law – albeit our own human law – for taking the first shot at Greedo.

According to George Lucas, however, Greedo always shot first. The original cut just had a bad camera angle.

“The controversy over who shot first, Greedo or Han Solo, in ‘Episode IV,'” Lucas told The Hollywood Reporter, “what I did was try to clean up the confusion, but obviously it upset people because they wanted Solo to be a cold-blooded killer, but he actually isn’t. It had been done in all close-ups and it was confusing about who did what to whom. I put a little wider shot in there that made it clear that Greedo is the one who shot first, but everyone wanted to think that Han shot first, because they wanted to think that he actually just gunned him down.”

So to George Lucas, and presumably all of his liberal friends, fans who argue with the change just wanted Han Solo to be a cold-blooded killer. You know what, though? He’s correct. Even though, in a real world scenario, Bill Whittle is completely right and the moment that Greedo pulled his gun on Han Solo, Han was justified in killing him in self-defense, the fans do want Han to be a cold-blooded killer.

You see, that gives Han Solo a character arc. It shows how the character changed through the course of the film.

When we first meet Han Solo, it’s in a seedy bar, negotiating a price for doing a highly illegal thing. Han Solo is a smuggler; a pirate. Han Solo is not a good person, nor is he a heroic character. He kills another man in cold blood – for the sake of argument – and he spends the rest of the film reminding everyone that he’s not doing this for the Rebellion, or any idealistic crusade, he’s in it for the money. That’s it, he wants his reward and then he’s hitting the bricks.

Han Solo does, in fact, get his reward and then leave just as Luke Skywalker and the rebel pilots are going on a dangerous mission to blow up the Death Star. He doesn’t care because their mission isn’t his.

It’s Han Solo, however, at the climax of the film, who returns to help and saves Luke from being blasted out of the metaphorical sky and clears the way for him to destroy the Death Star. While Luke fires the fatal shot, that shot never would have been fired had Han Solo not decided to come back and help his friend.

You see, Han Solo has an arc. He goes from a not-so-nice character in a seedy bar, to a reluctant hero, and finally to the heroic character we remember him as through the course of that film. Forcing Han into the anti-gun left’s idea of morality and heroism causes that arc to become much less drastic, less meaningful, and therefore less important to the story.

What George Lucas knew in 1977 and seems to have forgotten – mostly due to his Hollywood liberal programming – is that developing your characters is important. Yes, George, we do want Han Solo to be a cold-blooded killer, but not because we’re blood thirsty. It’s because we want his character to be important to the story, and for that his arc must remain intact.

Why do police think it was suicide?

Kentucky state Rep. Dan Johnson was found on a bridge dead from a gunshot wound. Police discovered the body after being contacted by someone who was concerned over a post the lawmaker made on his Facebook account.

“The accusations from NPR are false GOD and only GOD knows the truth, nothing is the way they make it out to be,” he wrote. “AMERICA will not survive this type of judge and jury fake news . Conservatives take a stand.”

“I LOVE GOD and I LOVE MY WIFE, who is the best WIFE in the world,My Love Forever ! My Mom and Dad my FAMILY and all five of my kids and Nine grandchildren two in tummies and many more to come each of you or a total gift from GOD stay strong, REBECCA needs YOU,” he continued.

“9-11-2001 NYC/WTC, PTSD 24/7 16 years is a sickness that will take my life, I cannot handle it any longer. IT Has Won This Life . BUT HEAVEN IS MY HOME. “PLEASE LISTEN CLOSELY, Only Three things I ask of you to do,if you love me is (1)blame no person,Satan is the accuser, so blame the Devil himself. (2) Forgive and Love everyone especially yourself .(3)most importantly LOVE GOD. P.S. I LOVE MY FRIENDS YOU ARE FAMILY ! GOD LOVES ALL PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT !” the post concluded.

What were the molestation allegations?

Johnson was under investigation over accusations that he kissed and fondled a 17-year-old in 2012 while he was a pastor at Heart of Fire City Church. The incident allegedly happened on New Year’s Eve after Johnson had drank too much alcohol.

He had vehemently denied the allegations, but had not been charged criminally.

Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin tweeted about the apparent suicide Wednesday.

Saddened to hear of tonight’s death of KY Representative Dan Johnson…My heart breaks for his family tonight…These are heavy days in Frankfort and in America…May God indeed shed His grace on us all…We sure need it… — Governor Matt Bevin (@GovMattBevin) December 14, 2017

Here’s a news report about the allegations before his suicide:"
blaze49,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-06-01 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/01/teen-shot-dead-after-allegedly-pointing-gun-at-off-duty-customs-agent-but-lawyer-calls-it-a-murder,"A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot by an off-duty U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent after the teen allegedly attacked the agent on a southern California sidewalk and then pointed a gun at him and demanded his property, authorities told KABC-TV.

The fatally shot teen, identified as Darius Smith, was with a pair of 14-year-old accomplices when they allegedly attacked the agent from behind just after 8 p.m. Friday in Arcadia, authorities told the station.

The agent said he had exited a train — and so did the teens, law enforcement officials told KCBS-TV.

At a street corner, one of the teens allegedly came at the agent from behind while one struck him in the head and another pointed a gun at him and demanded his property, officials told KABC.

“The victim thought the subjects were going to rob and shoot him so he retrieved his department-issued handgun,” Caroline Rodriguez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy told the station. “The victim shot at the subjects in an effort to defend himself.”

The teen with the gun and one of his accomplices were hit by the agent’s gunfire, investigators told KABC. Arcadia police recovered a handgun at the scene that Smith allegedly held, deputies said in a statement to the station.

Smith was pronounced dead at a hospital Saturday morning, the sheriff’s department told KABC.

But the lawyer for Smith’s family said the teen was murdered.

“Darius Smith was executed,” attorney Lee Merritt told KABC in a follow-up story. “He was not in the midst of a robbery. He was shot twice in the legs first. [He fell] and his shooter got over him and shot him three times in the chest. That’s a murder. That’s not subduing the robbery.”

Smith’s family wants the agent to face criminal charges, KABC reported, adding that Merritt and members of Black Lives Matter said young black men often are falsely portrayed as criminals — and that Smith was anything but.

Jasmine Abdullah of Black Lives Matter told the station that Smith was “a child of God, he was a good kid, he was an aspiring football player and we’re asking that justice be served.”

The second suspect in the incident remained hospitalized with gunshot wounds that weren’t life-threatening. The third teen fled on foot unharmed but was later found at a nearby home, taken into custody and booked at a juvenile facility on suspicion of robbery, the station said.

The two teens still face robbery charges, but Smith’s family and their attorney said those charges should be dropped.

“Them boys didn’t do that,” Smith’s mother Reshawna Myricks told KCBS. “They aren’t those type of boys to do that.”

The gun found at the scene turned out to be a replica, KCBS reported.

The agent — whose name wasn’t released — suffered facial bruises in the incident but required no medical attention, KABC said."

A Facebook post describing the reason why has gone viral.

What happened?

The day after the shooting, Ben Dickmann vowed to surrender his AR-57 rifle, the same style of firearm used by the Florida shooter just of a different caliber. The AR-15 shoots a 5.56 mm round, while the AR-57 shoots a 5.7 mm round.

On Friday, he did just that, surrendering the firearm to his local Broward County Sheriff precinct.

“I’m putting my money where my mouth is,” Dickmann wrote. “This is an AR-FiveSeven, I own this rifle. It’s a caliber variant of the AR-15. I am a responsible, highly trained gun owner.”

“However, I do not need this rifle. No one without a law enforcement badge needs this rifle,” he explained. “I have surrendered this rifle to the Broward Sheriff at the Tamarac Post. I could have easily sold this rifle, but no person needs this. I will be the change I want to see in this world. If our lawmakers will continue to close their eyes and open their wallets, I will lead by example.”

Dickmann posted pictures of his rifle and a Broward County Sheriff’s deputy filling out paperwork to accept the surrendered firearm along with his message.

In his Thursday Facebook post, Dickmann vowed to not sit idly by and not act while more massacres take place. In that post, he offered three suggestions of steps to take to come to a reasonable solution to the problem.

First, he said the development and importation of “new military style semi-automatic weapons and replacement parts” needs to end. Second, he said the Second Amendment should be limited to “militias,” and finally, he said urged better “control and training requirements” for firearm ownership.

“We need to start, we need to act. We need to be the generation that says enough is enough and we are going to start the wheels to stop this,” Dickmann wrote. “I know this is not going to stop overnight, but, if we don’t start to actually DO SOMETHING it will NEVER STOP.”

The post of Dickmann’s rifle surrender has gone viral, receiving more than 550,000 reactions and nearly one-quarter million shares."

The Blaze brings you the SSK industries .950 JDJ. It’s the biggest centerfire rifle ever made.

With a 2400 grain bullet, propelled by 240 grains of powder, the JDJ is comparable to a World War I-era tank round or a 20mm cannon in terms of kinetic energy.

Estimates are that one of these rounds would easily pass through several human targets– even if each were equipped with full body armor.

It was almost classified as a “destructive device” but a special “sportsman exception” was made for the JDJ.

The guys from Knight Rifles headed out to the range to give this monster a try. Very few people have ever shot the .950 JDJ as a rifle, as only 3 have been made.

This model was the first and the lightest coming in at a robust 50 lbs. The custom bullets cost about $40 each.

So what’s it like to shoot a bullet that nearly an inch wide and four inches tall? Well, it has been described as having “significant recoil” and in the video below, one of the shooters say “it’s like firing ten .30-06’s at once.”

Another shooter, after getting a taste of that vicious recoil, turned to his buddies and yelled “you lied to me. it kicks like a mule.”

But to custom rifle-maker George Gardner, a couple of scenes mean the world.

Gardner founded a rifle-making outfit in North Kansas City, Missouri, that Kyle mentioned in a very significant way in his autobiography on which the film is based:

“Since I’m talking about guns, I’ll mention that my current favorites are the weapons systems made by GA Precision, a very small company started in 1999 by George Gardner. He and his staff pay close attention to every detail, and his weapons are just awesome. I didn’t get a chance to try one until I got out of the service, but now they’re what I use.” (pp. 103-104, kindle version)

The post-active duty weapon to which Kyle referred in his book is the GA Precision Gladius model, Gardner told TheBlaze. In fact, the Gladius figures prominently in many later — and iconic — photos of Kyle.

So when it came time for Clint Eastwood to make the silver screen version of “American Sniper,” a cash-strapped production team came calling for Gardner in regard to Kyle’s favorite civilian-life long-distance shooter.

“They didn’t get enough money to be buying all the rifles,” Gardner told WDAF-TV in Kansas City. “So they asked us if I would loan them one for the movie and I said ‘Of course,’ which for me was great because I got it back with a letter stating it was in the movie, there’s pictures of Clint Eastwood holding it, pictures of Bradley Cooper holding it and so it’s cool to have it.”

Kyle never made spec requests for the Gladius — he simply used the standard model. “He didn’t ask for any changes,” Gardner told TheBlaze. But since each time the small outfit gets a rifle order, the weapon is built by hand — and that’s exactly what GA Precision did for “American Sniper.”

“It was in two good scenes,” Gardner told TheBlaze of the scenes in which the Gladius appears. “When he’s training four wounded vets at the range, and one where he and his son are hunting.”

As you can imagine, Gardner has received numerous offers from buyers interested in procuring the Gladius used in “American Sniper,” but he’s nixed them all, WDAF-TV reported. And you won’t find Kyle’s glowing endorsement of GA Precision in any of the company’s advertising, either.

Gardner just feels fortunate that his handiwork has become part of movie history — and that he got a final chance to see Kyle at the annual SHOT show before he was killed two years ago.

“I enjoyed talking to Chris when I got the chance,” Gardner told TheBlaze.

Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) is being mocked by gun rights advocates after he made a number of inaccurate statements while promoting a bill that would require individuals who manufacturer homemade firearms to undergo background checks.

“This is a ghost gun,” de Leon begins, holding an unloaded rifle in his hands. “This right here has the ability with a .30-caliber clip to disperse with 30 bullets within half a second. Thirty magazine clip in half a second.”

A “ghost gun” generally refers to a firearm that doesn’t have a serial number or a homemade gun, like one created using a 3D printer.

For those not familiar with firearms or gun-related terminology, there are a number of issues with de Leon’s argument.

Firstly, there is no such thing as a “30-caliber clip” in the context of which he is speaking. He clearly is referring to a 30-round magazine. An ammunition magazine is different than a “clip,” but the two are often confused by those not familiar with guns. And though it’s obvious, there is also no such thing as a “30 magazine clip.”

Secondly, caliber refers the measurement of the width of a bullet or internal diameter of a gun barrel, not magazine capacity.

According to the Associated Press, the rifle on display in the video is indeed a homemade fully automatic rifle. Still, a rate of fire of 60 rounds per second — or 3,600 rounds per minute — is unlikely with a “homemade” rifle. Fully automatic weapons are also essentially banned already, even if they are homemade. The average rate of fire for a semi-automatic rifle is roughly 120 rounds per minute, depending on the shooter and reload time.

Now, it’s entirely possible that de Leon got nervous during his public address and mixed up his words and numbers. But it’s also possible that he needs to brush up on his gun knowledge.

YouTube user David West put together a video pointing out the flaws in de Leon’s remarks. The video, featured below, already has nearly 500,000 views.

“He’s got an older-model shotgun or rifle,” the caller said on Thursday’s 911 recording, WTVT-TV reported. “He’s got a bag that looked like ammunition.”

“And where are the weapons now?” the dispatcher inquired, the station said.

“He was walking right into the school with it,” the caller answered, according to WTVT.

That prompted a lockdown at the Bradenton school, the station said.

And indeed it turns out the object was a rifle — and more than that, it was being carried by a teacher at the middle school.

Problem was, however, that the rifle is a Civil War-era replica the history teacher brought in to show students that day, the Bradenton Herald reported. The rifle can’t be fired, the station said.

The teacher previously informed a school resource officer about the rifle, the paper reported, but the officer wasn’t aware the teacher was bringing it in Thursday. Michael Barber, spokesperson for Manatee County Schools, told the Herald that administrators and office staff should have been informed about the rifle. WTVT said that the teacher has been bringing the rifle to school for several years.

The lockdown was lifted before 9 a.m. — and before the the first bell, Barber told the paper.

“If somebody sees something, they’re going to pick up the phone and call, and they should,” Barber told WTVT. “We have to handle these things in such a way that the school administration, the school staff, and the school resource officers are involved, and it’s done in such a way that would not cause any alarm to anyone.”

Barber told the Herald that the teacher should’ve placed the rifle in a case so no one would mistake it for a working weapon. District administrators are going to review the incident and determine if there should be a policy prohibiting faculty from bringing to school anything resembling a weapon, WTVT reported.

“It very much looks like a real rifle, especially if you saw an adult walking around on campus with it. It would be pretty scary,” parent Wendy Buckner told the station after looking at a photo of the rife. “I was very nervous especially for all the kids that I know that go here and that I knew were probably already at school and my daughter, fortunately, wasn’t there yet. But you think about something like that and especially with everything that’s happened — terrorist bombings and shootings in schools — it’s terrifying some days.”

Buckner told WTVT she dropped off her daughter only after learning the campus was safe.

It was the first time he’s ever told the story publicly.

Richard Kim rushed to his parents’ store in Koreatown when he heard that his mother had been shot on the second day of the riots. Arriving on the scene, he said the streets were in chaos with the police seemingly abandoning the area. He had a legally obtained Ruger semi-automatic rifle and shot at cars near what he believed were the shooters. They drove away quickly.

Kim’s mother was taken to the hospital, and he stayed to protect the store. Kim was relieved when he spotted police, but they quickly handcuffed him and confiscated his gun. They had heard reports that Korean Americans were indiscriminately shooting into crowds.

His wife, who was his fiancée at the time, recalled seeing his detainment on television.

“He was on his knees. He was being handcuffed along with some of his employees,” she said. “My heart just dropped to the pit of my stomach, and I couldn’t make sense of any of what I was seeing on TV.”

Police let Kim go when they couldn’t find anyone who was shot, but they told him they were under strict orders to confiscate any guns. When he asked if they would be protecting the shop, they said no.

“Then you can’t take our weapons,” Kim told the policeman. “You’ll leave us sitting ducks.”

After looking him in the eye for a long time, Kim says the policeman handed him back his rifle without saying a word .

Although he was unable to save one of the two stores his parents owned, he took to a spot on the rooftop with his rifle to defend the second store. Kim says he stood guard without sleep for three days, watching other stores go up in flames. He was able to save the second shop.

Residents held events to mark the 25th anniversary of the riots that broke out in the wake of the verdict exonerating four Los Angeles policemen who were caught on videotape beating a black motorist, Rodney King.

Introducing the .700 Caliber, “Dinosaur Hunting WTF” rifle.

A member of the Cast Boolits firearms forums posted photos and video of this weapon and cartridges he built from scratch.

Everything you see below is customized craftsmanship, except the barrel.

The cartridge is named the .700 WTF (“What The F…”) and was made by “fire-forming a .50 BMG brass case, trimming it to 3 inches in length and then sizing it. The round is loaded with a 1132 grain paper patched .700 lead cast bullet.”

According to Firearm Blog, the rifle has a “16.25” barrel, can push the 1132 grain of lead up to 2300 fps. Thats 13,000 ft/lbs of energy, right up there with the .50 BMG and far exceeding the .700 Nitro Express. The cast lead bullet has enough energy to pass clean through a 1/4″ steel plate.

When a Tyrannosaurs Rex rampages through your neighborhood, this would seem to be the perfect tool for the job.

Grisham while he was on a hike with his son in March. The officer is seen grabbing the dad’s gun and then seemingly attempting to unlatch it from the man’s sling without telling him why or asking for permission.

Video recorded by Grisham and his son went viral earlier this year, but it did not show the moment the dad was approached and disarmed by the officer. He was later charged with “interference with duties of a public servant,” though the officer is heard in the video from March telling Grisham he was stopped for “rudely displaying” his rifle.

On Nov. 19, Grisham was found guilty by a jury of three men and three women of “interference with duties of a public servant” and ordered to pay a $2,000 fine. In an email to TheBlaze, the veteran said he plans to appeal the decision.

In the newly released dashcam video, officer Steven Ernis can be seen flagging down Grisham and asking him, “What are we doing?”

“We’re hiking,” Grisham replies.

Ernis, without warning, grabs Grisham’s AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and examines it.

“Some reason why you have this?” the officer asks in the video.

“Because I can,” Grisham shoots back.

“Well, OK,” Ernis says as he seems to attempt to unlatch the firearm from its sling.

That’s where things spun out of control.

“Hey, don’t disarm me man!” Grisham says, grabbing the butt of the rifle.

The officer immediately drew his pistol and yelled, “Get your hand off the gun!” Grisham removed his hand from his gun and protested before Ernis slammed him on his squad car, his pistol still in hand.

“You’re trying to disarm me illegally!” Grisham says.

“I am gonna disarm you,” Ernis replies. “Once I find out there’s no issue…you’re going to be on your way.”

Except he wasn’t allowed to go on his way after it was determined that Grisham’s firearms were legal and he wasn’t breaking any laws when he was approached by law enforcement. He was first charged with resisting arrest, but the charges were later downgraded.

In Texas, it is legal to open carry long guns, such as a rifle. Grisham has maintained from the beginning that he was illegally detained and disarmed without consent or notification.

But as the system is now on sale the manufacturer said demand has been so high there’s a wait list for interested customers.

The TrackingPoint rifle with its “Xact System” is classified as a “precision guided firearm,” and claims to be “the most accurate shooting system in the world.”

“It delivers five times the first-shot success rate of traditional systems, at targets up to 1,200 yards, regardless of shooter skill level,” TrackingPoint’s website states.

The system includes a custom rifle, ammunition, a tracking scope with “heads up display” and a guided trigger. The system adjusts for various factors including range, temperature, barometric pressure, wind and more.

Here’s all the shooter has to do:

Paints the target with the tag to lock on Watches as the tag persists, regardless of relative movement Aligns the reticle with the tag to produce the firing solution Squeezes and holds the trigger to arm the system

Watch this demo to see how the system works:

After being featured at the Shot Show earlier this year, TrackingPoint’s system is now for sale and demand is “overwhelming,” the company’s President Jason Schauble told NPR. He also noted that Remington Arms is interested in the technology for its rifles.

But not everyone is happy about the system that allows the potentially inexperienced to achieve an easy on-target shot. NPR provides more on this perspective:

One hunter who doesn’t want one is Chris Wilbratte. He says the TrackingPoint system undermines what he calls hunting’s “fair chase.” “It’s the traditional shooting fish in a barrel or the sitting duck. I mean, there’s no skill in it, right? It’s just you point, you let the weapons system do its thing and you pull the trigger and now you’ve killed a deer. There’s no skill,” Wilbratte says. […] Chris Frandsen, a West Point graduate who fought in Vietnam, doesn’t believe the TrackingPoint technology should be allowed in the civilian world. The gun makes it too easy for a criminal or a terrorist to shoot people from a distance without being detected, he says. “Where we have mental health issues, where we have children that are disassociated from society early on, when we have terrorists who have political cards to play, we have to restrict weapons that make them more efficient in terrorizing the population,” Frandsen says.

For these concerns, Schauble told NPR the company sells the firearm directly, not through gun dealers, so it can make sure customers are vetted. He also said there is password protection on the gun’s scope, which without being inputted would take the precision shooting capability out of the picture. It would still fire without a password but wouldn’t have “the tag/track/exact” capabilities.

Ars Technica reported in January that the cost for the TrackingPoint system starts around $17,000.

The system also comes with an app that can stream real-time video from the heads up display.

“This kind of technology, in addition to making shooting more fun for [the younger generation], also allows shooting to be something that they share with others,” Schauble told NPR.

More were expected Sunday, the station said.

While the gun show’s manager, George Fernandez, told the station he’s never witnessed such a large crowd, he concerned about the recent push for addition gun-control legislation in the wake of the recent deadly mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school.

“Some of persons that are attending are afraid that further legislation might impact their gun ownership rights,” Fernandez told WTSP.

What gun-control measures are being considered?

Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson (Fla.) told the station he wants to close the so-called “gun-show loophole,” which allows purchases at gun shows without background checks — as well as an assault weapons ban.

“When the NRA killed the law in 2004, the number of deaths as a result of assault weapons has grown up like a rocket taking off,” Nelson told WTSP.

Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s “action plan” to keep kids safe includes raising the legal age to buy a gun from 18 to 21, banning “bump stocks” and helping people who suffer from mental health issues, the station reported.

What does Fernandez have to say about possible legislation?

Fernandez told WTSP that about 95 percent of the vendors at the Tampa gun show are licensed dealers legally required to run background checks on buyers — and the remaining 5 percent of vendors are private citizens.

Several Florida counties have passed ordinances requiring private citizens to run background checks on gun buyers also, the station said.

But Fernandez added to WTSP that tightening the gun-show loophole wouldn’t have stopped the recent deadly mass shooting at Parkland, as 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz passed a background check before buying an AR-15.

“This was a mental health issue,” Fernandez also told the station. “This is someone that should have been identified from the beginning by law enforcement.”

What did a dad protesting the gun show have to say?

“If you want to protect yourself, get yourself a revolver or how about learning how to fight,” Sergio Gonzalez told WTSP.

What is the Florida Gun Show doing next?

The company canceled next month’s event in Fort Lauderdale after the mayor asked that the outfit show respect to the Parkland victims, but it will sponsor another Tampa show in late April or early June, the station said."

In the wake of the school shooting on Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made some comments about gun violence that were unintentionally ironic.

What did she say?

“When you see the effect of this extreme violence on a human body and especially the body of a child, maybe it will shock some people into understanding,” Harris told MSNBC while calling for gun control. “We cannot tolerate a society and live in a country with any level of pride when our babies are being slaughtered (emphasis added).”

Pat’s take:

Can you really say you care about “babies being slaughtered” when you have a 100 percent positive rating from pro-abortion group NARAL? In the 45 years since Roe v. Wade, there have been around 60 million abortions in the U.S.

“There is no bigger slaughter [in the U.S.] than the slaughter of American babies in the last 45 years,” Pat said on today’s show. “Biggest slaughter in American history.”

John Kennedy (R-La.) said America needs “more idiot control” as opposed to more gun control laws in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at a Florida high school earlier this month.

“I don’t think we need more gun control laws,” Kennedy told CNN Tuesday.

“Not a single one?” host John Berman asked.

“No. I think we need more idiot control,” Kennedy answered, referring to mass shooters who don’t suffer from mental illnesses. The senator added, “There’s an assumption that [Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz is] mentally ill. I don’t know that, so I will call him an idiot.”

Kennedy also said, “I happen to believe there is evil in the world.”

What is the solution?

Berman asked Kennedy that if no more gun control laws are needed, then what tool is available to keep guns out of killers’ hands?

“We have the tools in place,” Kennedy responded. “They’re not being implemented … the NICS database has holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through.”

More from CNN:

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, have proposed legislation, known as the Fix NICS bill, aimed at improving federal and states’ reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. But the bill was blocked Monday night from consideration and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said it doesn’t go far enough.

Kennedy told the network that while he supports the “spirit” of the bill, “I just don’t think it is gonna do anything.”

Why does Kennedy believe the Fix NICS bill won’t accomplish anything?

Kennedy told CNN the bill says federal employees — in order to encourage their compliance with the NICS — should be told that “if you don’t start doing your job, we’re going to take away your bonuses.”

“Why the hell are they getting bonuses to begin with?” a perturbed Kennedy asked.

He added that the bill indicates states should be told “pretty please” comply with the NICS and “we might give you more money, we’ll give you a leg up on getting grants.”

“That’s not going to accomplish anything,” he said.

Kennedy also noted that President Donald Trump should tell federal agencies to fire employees who don’t do their jobs with respect to reporting to the NICS rather than give them incentives to do their jobs.

“They already have an incentive to do their job,” Kennedy told CNN. “It’s called a job.”

He also said governors who “talk about the need to do something … can start by making sure their states are cooperating with the database.”

In the week since 17 people were killed during a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, gun control advocates have organized several national marches and other forms of protest calling for action by lawmakers.

What was in the letter?

Needville Superintendent Curtis Rhodes sent the following message to parents and students in a letter and on social media:

The Needville ISD is very sensitive to violence in schools including the recent incident in Florida. Anytime an individual deliberately chooses to harm others, we are sensitive and compassionate to those impacted. There is a “movement” attempting to stage walkouts/disruptions of the school through social media and/or other media outlets. Please be advised that the Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness!! Should students choose to do so, they will be suspended from school for 3 days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension. Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative. We will discipline no matter if it is one, fifty, or five hundred students involved. All will be suspended for 3 days and parent notes will not alleviate the discipline. A school is a place to learn and grow educationally, emotionally and morally. A disruption of school will not be tolerated. Respect yourself, your fellow students and the Needville Independent School District and please understand that we are here for an education and not a political protest.

When are the scheduled protests?

Students in Florida have planned the “March for our Lives” on March 24 in Washington, D.C.

The group that organized the Women’s March has planned a National School Walkout on March 14.

Another National School Walkout is planned for the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, April 20, organized by a student who lives near Sandy Hook Elementary, the site of a 2012 school shooting.

“Not liking guns is a millennial thing, it’s the cool thing to be against guns,” said Justin Vaughn, 17, who attends a Maryland High School. Vaughn, a Second Amendment supporter, told McClatchy News he feels like he is on the “wrong side” of the gun control debate.

How did students feel at CPAC?

Vaughn was relieved to be around other like-minded conservative students from across the nation during the CPAC meeting Friday at National Harbor, Maryland.

“This is like the only place I’ve seen where kids are on my side,” Vaughn said.

Many peers at his school view his pro-Second Amendment views as: “I’m supporting killers, when I’m really supporting people who want to protect the Constitution.”

Vaughn’s comments come as student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, have launched a very visible national campaign to support gun control. The students have become a powerful force, rallying many young people across the nation to support their cause. The Valentine’s Day shooting left 17 dead at the school.

Liberty Fuchs, 19, of Los Angeles, told McClatchy she strongly empathizes with the Florida students. But she questions if their tactics are alienating others who are sympathetic toward what the students went through. Fuchs cited social media comments that imply support for gun rights is akin to supporting school shootings.

“It’s so upsetting to hear them say you’re either for gun control or dead kids,” she said. “I don’t question their motives, of course they want to do something, and it’s been so powerful, so strong. But to turn it into an attack on the right wing? It’s like the feeling when you get bullied in high school because you believe in something different.”

What about college campuses?

Jacob Thomas, a 20-year-old student at Germanna Community College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said he feels his opinions on gun rights are being silenced.

“You can’t express that opinion, especially on college campuses,” he told McClatchy News.

The students are standing up for their beliefs, despite a growing group of peers who are planning campus walkouts and other protests against gun violence.

“The Second Amendment is what we’re protecting,” said Abby Brinkman, 22, a senior at Shawnee State University in Portsmouth, Ohio, told McClatchy News.

“People have been so quick to turn on gun owners rather than smart solutions,” she added.

Eric Folkerts, 20, a freshman University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, told McClatchy that he believes the Florida students are “victims being used as pawns in a way to advance a political agenda.”

“They’re 16, 17, 18, the reality is they really don’t know what they’re talking about,” he said. “Just because you go through a tragedy doesn’t mean you know the issues, the policy and the legislation.”"

Indeed, the homeowner spotted two suspects trying to break into his home, the station said, adding that he told police one of them — a 16-year-old male — pointed a gun at him.

But what the crooks likely didn’t know is that the homeowner holds a concealed pistol license and also was armed at the time, WDIV reported.

“There has to be a line-of-defense. It’s not something we want to do — it’s something we have to do,” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told “Fox and Friends” on Saturday.

What is the plan?

Dubbed the “Sentinel Program,” Judd explained that his department has devised and already implemented a plan that would become a “game-changer” if it was implemented on school campuses nationwide.

The plan is simple: Arm teachers with concealed weapons and train them to effectively defend students should the need ever arise. The program has already been put into action at Southeastern University in Lakeland, Florida, which is in Judd’s jurisdiction.

Judd explained that the process to choose which teachers to arm is extremely vigorous. He told the “Fox and Friends” hosts he only selects teachers with impeccable, crime-free backgrounds. Then, the teachers undergo rigorous training that includes meeting standards beyond those that Florida law enforcement must maintain. In addition, each selected teacher undergoes intense psychological evaluation.

Only after the teachers successfully complete the training are they honored as “special deputy sheriffs” and allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus.

What did Judd say?

If a program like his was in-place on Wednesday at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Judd said he believes “everything could have been different.”

“There’s no absolutes in life, but I can tell you this: At least two coaches were killed standing in front of and trying to protect kids. Don’t you believe it would be a game-changer if they had a gun to defend the children?” Judd said, adding:

Here’s the basic math: The average shooter his evil deed in two to five minutes…in fact in Broward County [where the shooting happened], it was three minutes. The average police response is plus five minutes. When 911 is called, the shooter is on the campus reeking havoc — that’s too late. We have got to wake up! Wake up and understand that we have to have more than one, that we have to have specially trained people that have concealed firearms that can run to the threat and protect our children.

Currently, the program has only been implemented in Polk County, Florida, but Judd explained he has presented it to the Florida legislature and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and has urged them to take action.

Will the plan be implemented?

Judd told the Fox hosts that he spoke with Scott on Friday about the plan, who vowed to take action, though Judd didn’t elaborate on the conversation. However, he stressed South Florida legislators would be a roadblock to a plan like his from being implemented.

Haley Leach had been vacationing in Hunter, New York, since November, the station said, but she did not possess a New York State pistol permit. She was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, WTEN-TV said.

While the 28-year-old was released on $200 cash bail, WTEN said more than a few folks are upset that New York’s failure to adopt a handgun reciprocity law is criminalizing innocent people.

What does a gun range manager have to say?

“It’s frustrating for people who don’t know the law,” Leslie McDermott, general manager of a gun range in Brunswick, told the station.

McDermott said customers with concealed carry permits from neighboring states like Vermont and Massachusetts regularly come in to his business to find out they might be breaking the law since their permits don’t count in New York, WTEN reported.

“Traveling through, see our sign, and stop in,” McDermott told the station. “They can’t shoot here because they don’t have a New York State pistol permit.”

What does a sheriff have to say?

Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple isn’t happy about the latest casualty of New York’s lack of gun reciprocity.

“We’re taking so many law-abiding citizens and basically making them criminals,” he told WTEN, adding that “doctors, pilots, lawyers, cops, firemen, whatever the case may be … they go to fly out, they get arrested.”

Apple said that until New York joins other states that have adopted the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, arrests like the one involving Leach — who has a court date in February — will continue, the station said.

“This is sad because it’s happening more and more,” Apple told WTEN.

What related incident just happened?

A Brooklyn woman shot her ex-boyfriend in the neck after he kicked open her apartment door on Dec. 30 — but the woman who defended herself was taken into custody, police sources said. Why?

She recently moved from North Carolina where her .40-caliber handgun was legal — but she didn’t have a New York gun permit.

blaze68,blaze,['Robert Rees'],2014-02-07 13:15:17-05:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/firearm-registration-bill-introduced-in-illinois,"Illinois State Rep. Kelly M. Cassidy (D-14) introduced a bill on Feb. 5 that would require gun owners to register every gun they own. According to the bill, called the Firearms Registration Act (HB4715), this would not just apply to new purchases but Illinoisans would also need to register guns they already own.

The bill’s synopsis explains [emphasis added]:

“Creates the Firearms Registration Act. Provides that every person in the State must register each firearm he or she owns or possesses in accordance with the Act.”

The bill also takes aim at ammunition ownership and purchases. Illinois residents would have to show proof of firearm registration in order to buy

ammunition [emphasis added]:

“Provides that a person shall not purchase or possess ammunition within this State without having first obtained a registration certificate identifying a firearm that is suitable for use with that ammunition, or a receipt demonstrating that the person has applied to register a suitable firearm under the Act and that the application is pending.”

Failure to comply with the bill would be a Class 2 felony. The penalty for Class 2 felonies in Illinois is three to seven years imprisonment and not more than a $200,000 fine.

In order to own a gun in Illinois, residents already have to apply for and possess a state issued “Firearm Owner’s Identification Card” (FOID). Illinois also just became the last state in the union to pass a concealed carry law. Residents must have a FOID card before they can apply for a concealed carry permit.

Since the concealed carry law passed last summer, the Illinois State Police have been bogged down by FOID card applications and concealed carry applications and even though the law went in to effect in January, the first licenses aren’t expected to be issued until March or April of this year.

Pruet', 'Sr. Staff Writer']",2017-11-28 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/28/hawaii-police-order-medical-marijuana-users-to-voluntarily-surrender-guns-and-ammo,"Hawaiian police sent medical marijuana users a letter ordering them to “voluntarily surrender” their firearms and ammunition.

According to federal law, patients who use medical marijuana are not allowed to own a gun. Federal law applies even in states that allow the medicinal or recreational use of the drug.

The letter signed by Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard says those notified have 30 days from receipt to transfer ownership or turn in weapons and ammunition to the police, Leafly reported.

What does the federal law say?

In 2011, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued an open letter to federal firearm licensees stating there are no exceptions to gun laws whether a particular state passes cannabis legalization laws or not. According to the ATF letter:

Any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms and ammunition.

Twenty-nine states have passed laws making it legal to use cannabis for medical or recreational use. California was the first to allow lawful use for medicinal purposes in 1996. In 2012, Washington and Colorado were the first to pass laws approving it for recreational use.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals upheld the federal law last year.

“It may be argued that medical marijuana users are less likely to commit violent crimes, as they often suffer from debilitating illnesses, for which marijuana may be an effective palliative,” the federal ruling stated. “But those hypotheses are not sufficient to overcome Congress’s reasonable conclusion that the use of such drugs raises the risk of irrational or unpredictable behavior with which gun use should not be associated.”

Hawaii opened its first marijuana dispensary in August, and it may be the first state to issue a notice to users regarding the surrendering of firearms, according to Leafly.

How did police know who uses medicinal cannabis?

RCMP Sergeant Patricia Neely said that “Firearms that were unsafely stored in plain sight were seized for safekeeping,” but Sgt. Brian Topham told the National Post that officers forced their way into many of the homes because of “urgent need.”

“We just want to make sure that all of those things are in a spot that we control, simply because of what they are,” Sgt. Topham said. “People have a significant amount of money invested in firearms … so we put them in a place that we control and that they’re safe.”

They will be returned to residents with proof of ownership after the evacuation order — which is now into its eighth day — is lifted, authorities say.

Business owner Brenda Lackey told the Globe and Mail: “Now what they’re doing is looking for firearms and ammunition. How do they have the right to do that? What does that have to do with the disaster? …This is martial law. What has happened to our country?”

“Absolutely incredible,” she added.

Lackey’s sentiment seemed to be pretty consistent with the rest of the frustrated crowd. Some of the members have apparently be threatening to rush the blockade in an effort to get back into their homes.

“We don’t want our town to turn into another New Orleans,” resident Jeff Langford told the National Post. “The longer that the water stays in our houses the worse it’s going to be. We’ll either be bulldozing them or burning them down because we’ve got an incompetent government.”

A woman in the crowd pointed out they can do more to repair their homes if they actually have access to them.

“We can do more there than we can out here,” she said.

When an officer attempted to calm the crowd by saying “imagine if something happens to you [if I let you in],” a member of the crowd shot back: “Are we children? We’re adults!”

Canada’s Sun News has more on the story:

The Conservative Prime Minister’s office has said in an email to the National Post that it believes the guns will be returned as soon as possible, and that “the RCMP should focus on more important tasks such as protecting lives and private property.”

Ed Burlew, a lawyer and firearms specialist in Ontario, weighed in on the legality of the RCMP’s apparent actions.

“This is without precedent, this is unreasonable search and seizure,” he said. “The entry was illegal, it’s against the charter, it was unreasonable search and seizure. There’s no judge that would uphold the evidence obtained through an illegal entry into a person’s home.”

The firearm maker announced last week that it would construct a set of extraterrestrial pistols made from a 4.5 billion-year-old meteorite that was first discovered in the sub-Saharan part of Africa in 1838.

“We wanted to raise the bar again,” Cabot founder and President Rob Bianchin said in a statement. “The pistol set will be a modern work of functional art and the ultimate set of luxury guns.”

The collectors piece is crafted from the Gibeon meteor, which is “believed to have landed on Earth during pre-historic times.”

“Not only is the age and metallurgical composition of the Gibeon meteor fantastical, it is considered the Cadillac of meteors in large part because of the aesthetic Widmanstattten pattern exhibited but the meteorites grain pattern once acid etched,” the Cabot Guns press release said.

A photo posted by cabotguns (@cabotguns) on Dec 26, 2015 at 7:34am PST

The set, which consists of a right and left handed 1911-style semi-automatic 45 pistol, has been dubbed “The Big Bang Pistol Set.”

Cabot Guns said a collector offered $250,000 alone based on the concept, but thinks the value of the “unprecedented” set could ultimately exceed $1 million.

“It’s both romantic and fascinating to imagine that this meteor traveled across the heavens for four billion years before landing on Earth and is now being transformed into Cabot pistols,” Bianchin said.

The guns will be shown in public for the first time at the NRA Annual Meeting and Convention in May.

Cheaper Than Dirt! recently announced that it was temporarily suspending online sales of firearms pending a review of its order processing and procedures. Well-known for its ability to process and ship orders within 24 hours, online sales have skyrocketed to a point where it may take up to 72 hours for firearms and other items to ship. “In light of recent events, we believe it is prudent to review our policies and procedures to ensure we can continue to provide the products and firearms our customers demand,” said Chief Operations Officer Roberta Wilson. “We will resume online sales once we update our process and continue as we have always done by shipping firearms only to FFL dealers.” Ms. Wilson closed with, “As a long-time supporter of the Second Amendment, we will continue to serve the needs of the firearms community while ensuring our unsurpassed level of quality and customer service.” Cheaper Than Dirt! prides itself on being America’s Ultimate Shooting Sports Discounter since 1993. Cheaper Than Dirt! boasts over 100,000 items available for purchase through their Web site and catalog. Articles, photos and videos appear daily on the Shooter’s Log at www.CheaperThanDirt.com/blog.

​UPDATE II ​Dec 19, 2:37 EST: Cheaper Than Dirt has changed the statement on its Facebook page. The new one notes the company has received an “overwhelming number of orders,” but still leaves in language about evaluating its process:

UPDATE 6:54 p.m. EST: Cheaper Than Dirt posted the following statement to its Facebook page at around 6 p.m. on Tuesday:

Cheaper Than Dirt! has temporarily suspended online sales of firearms. As a long time supporter of the Second Amendment, Cheaper Than Dirt! will continue to promote the safe and responsible use of firearms by law abiding customers. During this temporary suspension, we will review our policies and promotions.

No further information was provided.

–

Online gun retailer Cheaper Than Dirt announced Tuesday that it will be suspending certain firearm sales “effective immediately” pending an internal policy review. ​What exactly they are reviewing remains unclear, but the announcement has prompted swift reaction on the site’s Facebook page.

Their Facebook message reads:

“Cheaper Than Dirt! is suspending online sales of firearms effective immediately. We are reviewing our policy internally, and will continue to be the leader in the outdoor industry with our full line of gear and accessories.”

In less than 45 minutes, the message already had thousands of comments:

There are now over 8,000 comments in the two hours since the message was first put up. And because the post comes amid the fierce gun control battle after the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary last Friday– where 20 students and 6 adults were fatally shot– many are accusing the retailer of “selling out” to the gun control crowd:

It should be noted, though, that the company’s language does not specifically reference Sandy Hook or the current gun control controversy.

Dick’s Sporting Goods, however, has made it clear that it is taking action specifically because of the shooting. The retail giant announced Tuesday that it would be suspending the sale of modern rifles nationwide in light of the tragedy, declining to say exactly how long the suspension would last, or which guns would be pulled.

TheBlaze reached out to Cheaper Than Dirt for comment, but did not receive one.

​Full disclosure: Cheaper Than Dirt does advertise with TheBlaze.

That being the case, it’s important that we really examine all the facts surrounding gun violence.

So just how likely are you to be killed by a gun in the United States? The Economist has put together an interesting graphic that demonstrates your chances of getting killed by an array of things, including guns, heart disease, fire and more.

According to the Economist’s chart, your chances of dying as a result of “assault by firearm” is about 1 in 25,000. Americans also have a 1 in 514,147 chance of being killed by “firearms discharge. While still considered one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., the data certainly is at odds with the mainstream media narrative that all guns are simply mass killing machines.

The data from America’s National Safety Council suggests you are more likely to die from “intentional self harm,” an accidental injury or heart disease.

You are more likely to be killed by a gun than “walking,” choking or falling down the stairs. You are least likely to be killed by an asteroid impact (74,817,414 to 1), fireworks (50,729,141 to 1) or a bee sting (25,364,571 to 1).

Check out the graphic below (Click chart to see more):

Now, we also know that twice as many people are killed by “hands and feet” than semi-automatic rifles, which President Barack Obama and Democrats are looking to ban. There are also nearly five times more murders by knife than murders by so-called “assault weapons.”

This graph puts it in perspective, and calls into question how effective an “assault weapons” ban would actually be.

Five years before Nadir Soofi and his partner were shot to death by a responding officer after launching their failed attack, the 34-year-old reportedly visited a Phoenix gun shop.

According to the L.A. Times, Soofi wanted to purchase a 9-milimeter pistol, but knew prior misdemeanor drug and assault charges would be flagged in the federal screening process. Soofi, thus, went to Lone Wolf Trading Co., a shop known to sell firearms illegally.

The Phoenix gun shop, however, was part of the botched Fast and Furious operation, the L.A. Times reported. Federal authorities were allowing Lone Wolf to sell illegal firearms with the hope of tracing the weapons to drug cartels and smuggling networks.

Nonetheless, Soofi’s attempt raised flags and authorities put a seven-day hold on his ability to purchase a gun from the shop, the L.A. Times reported. However, for an unknown reason, that hold was lifted within 24 hours. Soofi left the shop with a 9-milimeter.

It was not clear whether that same weapon purchased five years prior to the Garland attack was used in the shooting, but federal authorities did contact Lone Wolf the following day, according to the L.A. Times.

The Garland attack left both shooters dead and a security officer wounded.

Such was recently the case for one woman, who had been in the hospital voluntarily for mental illness last year that she says was due to medication she was taking. Lynette Phillips of Upland, Calif., told TheBlaze in a phone interview Monday she had purchased a gun years ago for her husband, David, as a present. That gun, as well as two others registered to her law-abiding husband (who does not have a history of felonies or mental illness), were seized last Tuesday.

“My husband is upset that they took the right from us that should never have been taken, Phillips told TheBlaze.

But according to the state of California, that doesn’t matter.

“The prohibited person can’t have access to a firearm” regardless of who the registered owner is, Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, told to Bloomberg News.

According to the Los Angeles Times last week, budget cuts created a backlog of 19,000 people in the state with more than 40,000 guns that they are no longer legally allowed to own.

Such a Prohibited Armed Persons File is created through the Office of the Attorney General. When a person is entered into the Automated Criminal History System, the Consolidated Firearms Information System is also checked to see if they might have possession of a gun. The same check is conducted for those involuntarily admitted into the hospital for mental illness as well.

Bloomberg reported that nine police with the state’s Department of Justice wearing bulletproof vests and carrying Glocks went to homes on March 5 to retrieve the guns from people who, under this law, were no longer allowed to own. The Phillips family was one of them.

Phillips told TheBlaze the authorities arrived in unmarked cars Tuesday night around 8 p.m. Seeing as how she had never been in trouble with the law before, when they asked to enter, she said “sure,” not thinking to ask for a warrant. This gun confiscation law doesn’t go so far as to give officers warrants to enter property without permission.

Phillips explained that she and her husband were seated at their dining room table and questioned about the firearms. Phillips showed authorities where the weapons were located — a handgun in the top dresser drawer and two rifles in a safe in the garage. After Phillips unlocked the case in the garage, she said officers pulled her away from the guns and back into the house.

“They weren’t mean,” Phillips said. “I know they were just doing their job.”

But it’s a job Phillips said that never should have had to be done in the first place.

Phillips told TheBlaze she had an adjustment to her medication in December and could not stop crying. Her personal psychiatrist suggested she go to Aurora Charter Oak Hospital in Covina, Calif., where she said she was admitted voluntarily, not a threat to herself or others. Then, when she reviewed her file, Phillips said the nurse had recorded that she was involuntarily admitted and indicated she might be a suicide risk. Phillips claims the nurse had put words into her mouth.

“I kept telling her I had a grand-baby at home and had to be better for Christmas,” she said. “Does that sound like the words of someone who is a risk to themselves and others?”

Phillips believes — and noted online reviews of the center should substantiate her claims — that the process at the psychiatric hospital was a joke. Bloomberg contacted the hospital for a response regarding Phillips’ admittance but had not received a reply.

Still, the issue of patients potentially being misdiagnosed speaks of the larger implications of the laws that might apply following such a hospital admittance.

“Let’s see if we can’t prevent this from happening to someone else,” Phillips said, calling what has happened since she was in the hospital a “snowballing” effect.

“I do feel I have every right to purchase a gun,” she told Bloomberg. “I’m not a threat. We’re law-abiding citizens.”

She also pointed out the length of time it took before authorities had come to collect the firearms.

“This happened in December,” Phillips said. “I asked them at what point where they notified. They said between 24 to 48 hours after I was in the hospital.”

As Phillips pointed out, if she were truly a risk to herself or others, the authorities didn’t claim the guns in timely fashion. Timeliness could be what the state senate’s new funds for the collection of such firearms could be for. Some disagree, though, with where the new money is coming from. According to the LA Times, the $24 million would be made over three years from a fee paid for by those registering their guns in the state.

Bloomberg reported, according to state records, around 2,000 firearms, 117,000 rounds of ammunition and 11,000 magazines were collected under the law last year.

As for the Phillips family being reinstated with their firearms, she said they have to wait 30 days while an investigation is underway before she can appear in front of a judge who will determine her competency.

“What they are investigating, I have no idea.”

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives revoked the license of Riverview Gun Sales in East Windsor in December. The agency didn’t say why.

Authorities raided the store for undisclosed reasons shortly after the December school shootings in which Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He also shot to death his mother, Nancy, at their home. Authorities say he fired 154 shots with a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle inside the school, then killed himself with a Glock handgun.

Nancy Lanza purchased a Bushmaster from Riverview, according to a person close to the investigation into the school shooting who spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe is continuing. It could not be confirmed whether the Bushmaster was the one used in the shooting.

Shop owner David LaGuercia said in December that Nancy Lanza bought a gun from him years ago, but he couldn’t remember what kind. LaGuercia said at the time he was cooperating with law enforcement.

“There is nothing more devastating than the loss of a child,” LaGuercia said in a statement in December. “We are absolutely appalled that the product that we sold several years ago would be used in this type of horrendous crime. Our hearts go out to the victims and the families.”

His wife, Shelley Clemens, said Friday that she and her husband still don’t know why the ATF revoked his firearms license. She said the store remains open selling ammunition and other items while LaGuercia appeals the revocation.

“They just came in the store after Sandy Hook, raided the store and took away the license,” she said, referring further questions to her husband. LaGuercia, of Agawam, Mass., didn’t return phone messages Friday.

Clemens said in December that store records show one gun was sold to Lanza.

The weapons used in the shooting had all apparently been purchased by Nancy Lanza, prosecutor Stephen J. Sedensky III said last week when search warrants were unsealed showing the Lanzas’ home was packed with weapons and ammunition.

According to its website, Riverview Gun Sales, about 15 miles north of Hartford and about 65 miles northeast of Newtown, sells a variety of rifles and pistols, including Bushmaster and Glock.

The shop also sells high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones authorities say were used by Adam Lanza. In a law passed this week, Connecticut banned the sale or purchase of magazines holding more than 10 rounds."
blaze77,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2015-02-25 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2015/02/25/maker-of-a-machine-that-produces-ar-15-part-fedex-is-refusing-to-ship-my-product,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed, the organization that has made headlines for its 3-D printed firearms, has another product that can help gun hobbyists make their own parts. He has run into a snag, though, which he said he feels is indicative of a larger problem that leads to a “total state mentality”: FedEx won’t ship it.

Ghost Gunner by Defense Distributed is a computer numerical control mill that has software that allows users to make AR-15 lower receivers without serial numbers. Preparing to ship Ghost Gunner, Wilson was working with FedEx as a member of its FedEx Advantage/NRA Business Alliance, which provides discounts.

All was going well until last week. Wilson told TheBlaze FedEx decided not to ship his product. Wilson said his account executive, in the last few weeks, started asking more about the legality of the mill and on Friday said the company would not do business with it. Wilson still has not received a formal statement explaining why, but said his account executive said the company had issues with the machine because it was unregulated.

“Maybe they just wanted an excuse to not ship my product,” Wilson added.

Wilson told TheBlaze that he explained in conversations with his FedEx account executive that Ghost Gunner is just an industrial tool that has software allowing it to make the gun part.

“It’s just a mill people can have, a tool to make rifles in this country,” Wilson said.

According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, it is lawful for citizens to make their own firearms without a license if they are not for sale or distribution and if the person is legally allowed to own their own firearms.

Why would anyone have use for such a personal machine like Ghost Gunner though? Wilson said that earlier this year a law went into effect that makes it illegal to take an AR-15 lower receiver that’s 80 percent complete to a machine shop or gunsmith and use their machines to finish it.

“You now have to own the tool you use to make your lower receiver,” Wilson said.

Hence, why Ghost Gunner was created as a tabletop mill that gives people the ability to “legally manufacture unserialized AR-15’s in the comfort and privacy of your home.”

Gun parts aren’t the only thing that Ghost Gunner can make though. Wilson said the machine could be programed to make other items out of aluminum as well, giving bottle openers as an example.

In a statement to Wired, FedEx spokesman Scott Fiedler said that the company decided not to ship Ghost Gunner with Defense Distributed because it is “uncertain at this time whether this device is a regulated commodity by local, state or federal governments. As such, to ensure we comply with the applicable law and regulations, FedEx declined to ship this device until we know more about how it will be regulated.”

FedEx did not respond to TheBlaze’s request for comment at the time of this posting.

Watch this video from Defense Distributed showing the capabilities of Ghost Gunner:

Wilson told TheBlaze that he knew early on he would have to be prepared to answer questions about the machine’s legality.

“This is an unregulated activity,” Wilson said about the legal advice he received on the product. “There are no special implications.”

Wilson called FedEx’s position a “defacto ban on free activity.”

“I understand this is a private company and they can do business with whomever they please,” Wilson said. But he said he thinks when it comes to unregulated activities, the “default position should be a liberty perspective.”

Things like 3-D printers, drill presses and other industrial tools, Wilson said, are currently shipped by FedEx, but they too could be used to help make gun parts.

Wilson said he thinks FedEx probably felt the need to take this position on Ghost Gunner because of the fact that it can make a firearm piece, which could be seen as controversial in the current political atmosphere.

“This is the very death of the innovative, intrepid spirit of American [entrepreneurship],” Wilson said. “It’s completely antithetical to the ideas of the original American spirit.”

Defense Distributed is not stranger to legal controversy. Two years ago, the group’s forum that hosted 3-D printed gun designs went dark as the government “[claimed] control of the information.” The 3-D printer company Stratasys also pulled out of letting the group rent one of its machines a few years ago.

According to the Ghost Gunner blog, it sold out of its originally anticipated amount within 24 hours of pre-orders being made available last fall. Several hundred Ghost Gunners were being manufactured as of late January with the hope they would ship in February.

With FedEx pulling out, Wilson said he’s looking at other couriers.

“I’m pursuing all available options at this point,” he said.

blaze78,blaze,['Mike Opelka'],2013-03-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/03/26/rejected-gun-store-cancels-ar-15-purchase-by-gabby-giffords-husband,"An Arizona gun store cancelled a purchase made by former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords’s husband Mark Kelly. On March 5th, Kelly visited Diamondback Police Supply in Tucson, selected an AR-15 style rifle, a .45 caliber handgun, and some high capacity magazines, completed a background check and paid for his purchases.

Within days, the story broke nationally and Kelly claimed that his purchases were made to highlight how easy it is to get a gun. He also added that he intended to turn the AR-15 into the Tucson Police. The story sparked almost 4,000 comments to Mark Kelly’s public Facebook page, many of them not very supportive of his intentions.

The former astronaut told CNN that he intended to keep the handgun.

The store, Diamondback Police Supply in Tucson has now rejected Kelly’s March 5th purchase, and has sent him a full refund. The decision was announced on the company’s Facebook page, in a post from the Diamondback’s owner/president Douglas MacKinley:

“While I support and respect Mark Kelly’s 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use. In light of this fact, I determined that it was in my company’s best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store to complete the Federal From 4473 and NICS background check required of Mr. Kelly before he could take possession this firearm. A full refund was sent to Mr. Kelly, via express mail, on Thursday of last week.”

If you were wondering why it took so long for the transaction to be completed, the delay was due to a local regulation that requires a 20-day waiting period for private gun purchases. The rifle Kelly selected was a used weapon and that kind of transaction is treated as a private sale and the 20-day wait applied. Mark Kelly had not returned to pick up the gun.

Diamondback Police Supply has also announced that the rifle Kelly selected will be donated to the Arizona Tactical Officers Association (ATO), to be raffled off to raise funds for the group. ATO raises money to purchase much-needed equipment for SWAT teams. MacKinley also said that his company will make a $1295 (the price of the rifle) donation to the NRA’s Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program.

Mark Kelly’s representatives have not responded to requests for comments on the rejected purchase of the AR-15 style rifle."
blaze79,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2014-02-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/10/the-key-piece-of-information-that-even-some-conservative-media-are-missing-about-this-awesome-ar-15-sure-to-drive-gun-opponents-wild,"With a few cosmetic changes, gun manufacturers recently discovered a way to make the popular AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle compliant with New York’s anti-gun SAFE Act, the Times Union reports.

However, even though reports on the redesigned rifle were circulating on Monday, the Times Union report and photo cited in nearly all posts are actually both from last May. The news even made Drudge Report. Given the resurgent popularity, we’re trying to figure out what the reaction to the rifle has been since May — and more importantly, if the gun is currently being sold anywhere in New York.

On May 23, the Times Union reported: “Gun dealers, with the help of machine shops and gunsmiths, are on the cusp of offering what they call NY SAFE-compliant AR-15s and other military-style rifles.”

Because the semi-automatic rifle is no more powerful than many hunting rifles in terms of firing power, doing away with certain cosmetic features — like an adjustable stock, pistol grip and flash suppressors — transforms the “assault rifle” into a legal, somewhat odd-looking rifle in New York. Under the SAFE Act, magazines still can’t be capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

“Thanks to modifications by a Texas-based machine shop, the stripped-down rifle has an adapter that connects the spot where the grip would go to the stock, or portion of the rifle that the shooter braces against her shoulder,” the report states.

Further, an attorney representing a New York gun shop previously received an approval of sorts from a State Police lawyer, who confirmed that the AR-15-style rifles should be legal so long as they do not include any of the characteristics banned by the law. Again, that was back in May. It’s unclear if the gun shop has since moved forward with its plans to carry the redesigned rifle.

James Tresmond, an attorney representing H&H Firearms in western New York, told the Times Union that the gun is “basically an AR-15 without the features.”

We were unable to contact H&H Firearms before the shop closed on Monday. Attempts to contact the owner, Justin Reickart were unsuccessful.

The workaround is reportedly already riling up some anti-gun advocates who still see the AR-15 as a scary “assault weapon.”

According to the New York State Assembly website, the SAFE Act allows magazines to be loaded with seven rounds, however, “since very few guns are currently sold with 7 round magazines, the sale and possession of magazines with a capacity of up to 10 rounds will continue to be legal.”

The law also prohibits “military-style weapons that include one or more features that increase the lethality of the weapon.”

Pro-gun advocates will almost certainly argue the cosmetic change only reinforces that banning something based on the way it looks is ineffective.

But Long Island Democratic Assemblywoman Michelle Schimel previously argued the banned features only increase the weapon’s killing power.

“A pistol grip helps you keep firing on a target. Each characteristic has a specific battle component,” she said.

As National Review notes, “Fewer people are killed with all rifles each year (323 in 2011) than with shotguns (356), hammers and clubs (496), and hands and feet (728).”

blaze80,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-02-21 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/21/why-is-this-ar-15-being-called-the-most-terrifying-thing-on-the-internet,"Among the many subcultures on the community forum website Reddit is a lesser known “gunsforsale” subreddit where some firearms are being sold.

And there’s something on there that’s being called “the most terrifying thing on the internet.”

So what is it? Well, among the latest of the weapons to show up on the site is an AR-15 engraved with Reddit’s very own alien icon. It was posted by the Redditor x—x–x-x four days ago for $1,150. For an extra $50 the seller said he would include 200 rounds and a magazine loader with the rifle, case and magazines.

Here’s more from the seller’s description about the gun:

The deets: *Custom engraved Reddit lower purchased in initial Reddit lower buy. *PSA lower parts kit *PSA bolt carrier group *BCM 14.5″ mid upper w/ pinned flash hider *Troy battlesight affixed to rear *OD Green Magpul MOE furniture *3 OD Green windowed PMAGs *Blackhawk! soft case I’ve only put a couple hundred rounds through it since building it in, I think, August of 2011. I love it, it’s a great-looking, soft-shooting gun, but I never get to shoot the thing so it’s just oiled up sitting in my safe and I’m looking to get a nice shotgun (Citori 725 field) since I shoot that every Sunday at the trap club and I love upland game hunting.

The seller stated that he was hoping to sell it to a fellow Redditor. x—x–x-x received “heavy interest” for the Reddit-themed firearm that he decided he would only sell it to people with whom he could meet face-to-face if there was an offer by Tuesday.

There was.

The seller explained in a further update that he had tentatively accepted an offer from someone who would be able to complete the transaction in person, but if it fell through he said he would work with “one of two out-of-state purchasers using an [federal firearms license] transfer.”

This is where we get to the part where the rifle is referred to as “the most terrifying thing on the Internet,” by Gawker.

“Users of the internet culture behemoth Reddit are not famous for their level-headedness or discretion,” Gawker’s Adrian Chen explains.

“So it was a bit discomfiting to spot this AR15 assault rifle—the same kind of gun used by Newtown shooter Adam Lanza—with a cute little Reddit alien logo engraved into it for sale on the site,” he adds.

Redditors, as the gossip site notes, are relatively Libertarian, at least when it comes to the First Amendment. As for its pro-Second Amendment leanings, the site has more than 100,000 followers on the /r/guns subreddit, more than 8,000 for /r/firearms, and /r/progun has more than 6,000.

Even with these firearm-supporting subreddits, there are others who have called for administrators to take a stand against sale of guns on the site.

In a thread nearly a month ago, one Redditor said eight “assault rifles” were sold through the website.

“It is time for reddit to ask itself whether it is morally justifiable for it to continue to allow the sale of guns,” the Redditor Gabour wrote.

“Although I’m trying not to resort to hyperbole here, I think it fair to say that reddit has some blood on its hands for endorsing these transactions [emphasis added],” the post continued.

“And that is something that needs to be addressed. Although it may be questionable to some whether Reddit has a moral obligation to stop the proliferation of guns in the United States, there should be no doubt that it should not be directly participating in it.”

Many websites where individuals act as sellers and buyers, like Craigslist and eBay, have banned the sale of firearms due to strict regulations regarding their sale.

If the seller of the alien-engraved rifle is unlicensed (we aren’t told either way), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives states that if both people are unlicensed individuals within the same state, the firearm can be sold provided the seller “does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law.”

Here’s more from the AFT regarding private sales:

When a transaction takes place between private (unlicensed) persons who reside in the same State, the Gun Control Act ( GCA ) does not require any record keeping. A private person may sell a firearm to another private individual in his or her State of residence and, similarly, a private individual may buy a firearm from another private person who resides in the same State. It is not necessary under Federal law for a Federal firearms licensee ( FFL ) to assist in the sale or transfer when the buyer and seller are “same-State” residents. Of course, the transferor/seller may not knowingly transfer a firearm to someone who falls within any of the categories of prohibited persons contained in the GCA . See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and (n). However, as stated above, there are no GCA -required records to be completed by either party to the transfer.

ATF states that if the sale is between two people who reside in different states, then the firearm is shipped to a FFL in the state of the buyer.

Based on this Redditor’s post, it appears as if he were following the law regarding his transaction.

Derek Poe, 26, owns Golden Triangle Tactical at the Beaumont Parkdale Mall. KBMT-TV reports that he entered the Game Stop store in the mall before going to his own store.

Video of the aftermath of the incident has surfaced showing Poe talking with authorities:

KMBT has a picture of Poe carrying his rifle:

Beaumont Police Sgt. Rob Flores told the Houston Chronicle that Poe turned himself in on Friday after the district attorney’s office issued a warrant for his arrest. The mall incident occurred on Dec. 28.

Flores said authorities got calls from shoppers who said they were “very afraid,” “terrified” and “thought they were going to die.”

However, Poe said he was operating within the law.

“It was clearly obvious I didn’t have criminal intent. I had a drink in one hand and a bag in the other. I didn’t commit a crime. I legally carried a long arm in Texas,” Poe told KBMT-12 News.

Poe was not arrested but did have his rifle confiscated as police investigate.

The Texas open carry law allows state residents to carry rifles if it’s not done in a threatening manner. Handguns are not allowed to be carried in open, and a person must have a concealed carry handgun license.

TheBlaze has published a graphic showing the rights people have been dealing with police officers.

They say he burglarized a home twice the night before, stealing several items, including two guns.

In a statement, investigators said 19-year-old Genaro Hernandez Mendoza of West Salem, Ore. was heading to his family’s farm when he broke into a home on Independence Highway and stole several items. He then returned to the farm and hid the stolen items behind a barn.

Police say he then stole a pickup truck and returned to the same home he had already burglarized to steal more items, including a shotgun and an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.

Detective John Williams says investigators found a shotgun and the rifle Sunday morning, side by side on the passenger-side floorboard of a stolen farm truck, barrels pointed at the driver.

Williams says it appears that a lever on the shotgun got into the trigger guard of the rifle. When the truck hit a bump in the road, the rifle fired once, striking and killing Mendoza in a freak accident.

However, Sheriff Bob Wolfe said police are still investigating the incident to make sure no other parties were involved in the burglary. He added that it seemed clear that Mendoza’s death was accidental and the result of failing to safely store the weapons he stole.

The Associated Press contributed to this report. This story has been updated.

In stark contrast, a 7-year-old little girl shot an AR-15 for the first time and had a very different reaction. The noise and recoil from the semi-automatic rifle didn’t seem to bother the girl one bit.

“That was pretty good!” she exclaimed.

The video was uploaded by a dad who runs the Haus of Guns Facebook page.

As for Kuntzman, he said his experience with the “horrifying, menacing and very very loud” gun traumatized him.

“The recoil bruised my shoulder. The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary case of PTSD,” he recalled. “For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.”

Target shooting isn’t for everyone, apparently.

blaze84,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2016-06-21 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/06/21/ny-times-leaves-out-vital-context-on-gun-experts-disputed-ar-15-claim-and-he-says-pro-gun-critics-have-it-all-wrong,"The New York Times came under fire this week for reporting that the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle was capable of firing eight rounds per second. The gun expert behind the claim, who told TheBlaze he has received some “nasty calls” since the publication of the article, said the Times left out vital context behind the figure he provided.

Sam Andrews, owner of Tier One Weapons Systems, said New York Times reporter Alan Feuer asked him specifically for the highest “rate of fire” capability of an AR-15.

The Times summed up Andrews’ response like this:

Because of its gas-operated system, Mr. Andrews said, the AR-15 has a fairly gentle recoil. The weapon is also fast and accurate, he added, able to fire, under capable hands, eight rounds in a second.

There was no additional explanation.

Andrews said the Times article failed to mention that his claim centered around the technical definition of rate of fire by skilled shooters and also the common technique of “bump fire.”

He said all it takes is a quick YouTube search to find videos demonstrating how to “bump fire” an AR-15, essentially turning a semi-automatic rifle into almost fully automatic. Here’s an example:

He said even a novice shooter can be taught how to bump fire fairly quickly.

Due to the phrasing in the Times article, many readers assumed he was claiming 8 rounds per second is an average rate of fire. But without bump fire, Andrews said such a skill requires training and practice — but it is possible. For example, he claimed to know “special operators” who can fire 10 rounds per second with a “good trigger” and muzzle break on an AR-15.

Citing the video of competitive shooter Jerry Miculek used in TheBlaze’s initial report, Andrews said true definition of “rate of fire” doesn’t include reaction time. If you do the math, he claimed, Miculek is capable of firing at a rate of roughly 10 rounds per second.

In the video, Miculek fired five rounds in 1.08 seconds. His reaction time was .55 seconds. If you remove the reaction time, he was able to fire five rounds in just over half a second.

Any shooter who can fire an AR-15 with a split time, or the time between shots, of .12 seconds or less can achieve a rate of fire of eight rounds per second, according to Andrews. There are many shooters with that capability, he said. There is, of course, a question of accuracy with such a high rate of fire.

“When asked the question, ‘What is the potential rate of fire’ of a particular weapon, as an engineer, I must tell the truth,” Andrews told TheBlaze, adding that he wasn’t pleased that the piece was lacking important context. “What people do with that truth, it’s up to them; it’s not about me.”

Andrews told TheBlaze he has learned by now that 99 out of 100 reporters will report his comments out of context in some way.

“You have to make a decision to either stop talking to the press or accept that,” he added.

Andrews also addressed his critics who have insinuated that he is somehow anti-Second Amendment and helping anti-gun advocates push gun control amid calls to ban so-called “assault rifles.”

“The federal government has zero authorization under the Constitution to infringe on anyone’s right to own a gun,” he said. “So anyone who says I am anti-Second Amendment is completely insane, and that has nothing to do with the potential rate of fire of a given weapons system.”

Seidl'],2013-08-12 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/08/12/exclusive-look-glenn-becks-new-custom-made-ar-15-rifle-and-the-inspiring-gun-manufacturer-behind-it,"She’s long, tan, and loves left-handers. She’s a little heavier than you might expect, but that just means she can’t kick you as hard. And while those on the left would like you to believe it’s conservatives who have a “war on women,” liberals hate her.

Who is she? She’s the new custom-made AR-15 rifle from Black Rain Ordnance presented to Glenn Beck last Friday.

“Beautiful,” a wide-eyed Beck said after Black Rain Ordnance President Justin Harvel and his team presented him with the gun — a left-handed model from the company’s PG-6 line — as the sun’s rays seemed to spotlight the rifle during the late morning. Beck being left-handed, the modification is crucial.

It’s that attention to detail that made the presentation even more special.

“We were at our booth [during the 2012 NRA convention in St. Louis]. Glenn came by with his security staff on the way to his speech and I remember him holding one of our rifles up…and he was holding it up left-handed,” Harvel – who has a bushy, red beard that somewhat hides his mouth – told TheBlaze while at a local gun range.

“Well, we just introduced this left-handed model and [we thought], ‘What a great idea, let’s give him a left-handed, he’ll never believe it.’”

For Harvel and his team, seeing Beck’s reaction (which Harvel described as “awe”) was payment enough.

“Obviously he’s got money and he could go buy anything he wanted to,” he said. “But I think it was more of the meaning around it.”

You may remember the Black Rain Ordnance name from earlier this year. It was the gun-maker who built a custom AR-15 for C.J. Grisham, the Texas veteran who had his rifle confiscated while “rudely displaying” it in Texas.

“We follow his progress daily,” Harvel said. “He’s still battling through court.”

“He’s fighting for what’s right, and that’s what we believe in and that’s why we supported him,” Harvel added.

When TheBlaze first told you about the company’s gesture, Grisham was leaning toward the “pink splash” version. Harvel said that’s exactly what he chose – and he gave it to his wife “in the hopes that he would get his gun back and get her more involved in the sport.”

It’s a goal becoming tougher as politicians and gun control advocates are working hard to demonize so-called “assault rifles. Given that, what does the company think of the future of the AR-15?

“The modern sporting rifle is here to stay,” Kevin Greb, the state’s regional sales manager, told Beck while sitting in his office during the presentation. “It’s truly America’s rifle. Until legislation comes down that outright bans firearms, the AR is here to say. It’s not going anywhere.”

That’s good news for a company as rugged and hard-working as its guns. The story of Black Rain Ordnance is a quintessential “American dream.” Harvel’s dad, uncles, and grandfather were all in retail sales and introduced a young Justin to guns at a young age: “I literally had a gun in my hand before I could walk.”

“In the retail business, I had two stores at the time of my prime and I was listening to the customers as they would come in — they’re not getting what they need, as a retailer I wasn’t getting what I needed,” he said.

“It was so frustrating, because it was like the manufactures didn’t care, they weren’t producing a quality product, they were going overseas to China to import some of this stuff — they were just mass producing it and not caring about quality.”

So he decided to change that.

After working as a full-time firefighter for 10 years, he brought together a close group of family and friends in the small town of Neosho, Mo. He poured money and “sweat equity” into the business, worked 70-80 hours a week, and started living by a simple mission statement: “We’ll never produce anything we wouldn’t personally own or operate.”

It’s worked.

Since starting as a small mom-and-pop manufacturer in January 2009, the company has grown from him as the first employee to now about 40 workers. The first year, they produced 12 rifles – this year they’re poised to build over 12,000. And after initially being turned down by big retailers, you can now find their guns in over 5,000 stores across the country, including giants such as Bass Pro Shop, Cabela’s, Gander Mountain, and Scheels All Sports.

And while Harvel and his team have worked hard to get the company to where it is today, he’s also quick not to downplay good old-fashioned “luck.”

“I’m not going to deny that,” he said while chuckling.

If you’re wondering about the name, Harvel said the symbol is the result of working at the fire department and walking past the biohazard symbol for so long. “Black rain” stemmed from a Google search of what the symbol really meant. He finally came across a news article describing nuclear warfare as “white cloud, black rain.”

“So I thought, ‘black rain,’ that’s pretty cool: black rifle that we’re making; raining bullets, raining brass. And so ‘Black Rain’ it was,” he said. “And so we took it from there.”

But there’s more to it than that. One of their slogans now is, “Today’s forecast: storms likely.” And it has a special meaning for Harvel’s law enforcement and military clients.

“I know when you leave the house and you kiss your kids goodnight for bed and you have to work that night shift, what is that storm waiting for you on the other side of that door? Are you going to be able to come home to your wife and kids?”

“So you need the best weapons, you need quality weapons, you need somebody making those weapons that cares about who you are and your family coming home to them. … By carrying the best weapons, [you know] they’re going to work, the quality, the accuracy, the precision behind them, they’re American-made.”

Just like Justin’s relatives did with him, Mercury One – Beck’s charity and philanthropic arm – is looking to get guns in the hands of America’s future generation at an early age. And its doing it in small and big ways.

After the presentation of Beck’s gun on Friday, Kerry took a slew of young employees and interns to local shooting range, Elm Fork, for a private safety and shooting session with the executives from Black Rain Ordnance. There, the young people got to fire some of the company’s “coolest” weapons, including fully automatic ones.

Besides outreach such as the range trip, on November 2 the charity is putting on a clay pigeon shoot to raise money and “build awareness for gun safety and gun awareness among children and teenagers,” Mercury One President Joe Kerry told TheBlaze as bullets popped in the background.

“We’re seeing in schools and in public settings that guns are disappearing,” Kerry, who earlier held up a massive .308 rifle, explained, “and because of that people are afraid of them.”

“One of our missions is to make sure kids aren’t afraid of guns,” he said. “If they’re used properly and are respected, there’s nothing to be afraid of.”

blaze86,blaze,['Tré Goins-Phillips'],2016-05-31 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/05/31/ar-15-inventor-says-hbo-distorted-his-views-on-guns-in-recent-interview,"AR-15 inventor Jim Sullivan is seeking to clarify comments he made about guns in a recent interview on HBO’s “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,” saying the network “misrepresented much of what I said.”

“They were apparently trying to make the AR-15 civilian model seem too dangerous for civilian sales,” he wrote in The Federalist Tuesday. “They didn’t lie about what I said, they just omitted key parts, which changed the meaning.”

Sullivan wrote that the moments in the interview he takes issue with are in regard to discussion about the AR-15 when he says he “appears” to say the civilian model is equally as effective as the military-grade M16. According to Sullivan, HBO omitted when he clarified, “When firing semi-auto only” and “the select fire M16 on full auto is of course more effective.”

Additionally, he objected to the discussion on military and hunting bullets, adding that, due to the Hague Convention, military-grade bullets cannot be hollow points like hunting bullets “that give up all of their energy in the target body instead of passing through with minimum wound effect.”

Sullivan wrote that Armalite, a small arms engineering company, “went the small-caliber, high-velocity route and gave the bullet the right twist of 1:14 to be stable in air but unstable in tissue,” which he said was in compliance with the Hague Convention.

“This gave us a small cartridge that was half the size, weight, and recoil of a 7.62 NATO,” he wrote, “so the soldier could carry twice the ammo, fire controllable full auto, and be far more deadly out to 300 yards, the three characteristics that determine military rifle cartridge effect.”

He also said the 5.56 “can’t compete” with hunting bullets, which can legally be expanding hollow points that are more lethal than tumbling.

There was also a point in the interview that Sullivan said was made to look as if he was unhappy with the fact that AR-15 are popular in the civilian market.

“5.56 is only half as powerful as the 7.62 NATO (.308) hunting bullet. That doesn’t mean I’m not pleased to see AR-15s sell on the civilian market,” he wrote. “It just means I didn’t realize they would 57 years ago.”

“This would be exactly as a nuclear bomb, and we can say that Lebanon today has a nuclear bomb, seeing as any rocket that might hit these tanks is capable of creating a nuclear bomb effect,” Nasrallah said, according to a translation published in the Times of Israel.

Addressing his message to Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, Nasrallah said, according to quotes posted by Ynet, “It’s simple mathematics. A few missiles on a few ammonium plants equals the same amount of death as an atomic bomb.”

Israel’s military chief Eizenkot on Wednesday responded to Nasrallah’s threat, acknowledging that among the groups surrounding Israel, Hezbollah has developed the most significant military abilities, including developing the means to hit Tel Aviv in central Israel.

Though it is a formidable adversary, Eizenkot noted that the Lebanon border has been Israel’s quietest for the past 10 years since the 2006 conflict known as the Second Lebanon War.

Ynet reported that following the 2006 conflict, the municipality of Haifa — where the ammonia facility sits — ordered a study, which concluded that in the event the plant were to be hit, it would release a 10-mile diameter cloud, an area that would cover both Haifa and Acre, a city 10 miles north along the Mediterranean coast. Both cities are home to Jewish and Arab residents.

Ynet quoted professor Amos Natua from the Technion Institute of Technology who said, “Researchers who conducted the studies in the 1990s concluded that there could be 70,000 casualties.”

“The State Comptroller released a statement in 2003 that the number will likely be much higher,” he added.

Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav pointed to Nasrallah’s threat as a reminder to the Israeli government that it must move the plant out of the city, which has a population of nearly 300,000.

“We are happy for help” in raising the issue, Yahav said, “even if it arrives from a frightened man hiding in his bunker.”

Nasrallah spoke remotely from an undisclosed location transmitted to a rally honoring former top Hezbollah leaders who were assassinated. The event is known as “The Loyalty to Martyrs and Leaders Day,” Israel’s Ynet reported."
blaze88,blaze,['Mytheos Holt'],2013-02-25 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/25/federal-court-finds-no-constitutional-right-to-carry-a-concealed-weapon-we-explain-the-decision,"While gun rights supporters might like to think the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is an absolute guarantee against government interference, according to at least one (relatively conservative) appeals court, they are severely mistaken. In fact, according to that same court, when it comes to carrying concealed weapons, the Second Amendment is basically irrelevant.

Last Friday, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down its decision in the case of Peterson v. Martinez, a case involving the question of whether a state has an obligation to provide a concealed carry license to anyone who has been granted such a license in another state. Their answer was, to put it mildly, “no.”

In fact, the court adopted a fairly novel approach in explaining why the right to keep and bear arms didn’t apply in this case: Rather than rely solely on precedent that restricted gun rights, they built most of their analysis on language from cases that expanded gun rights, but still made clear that there were limits, of which concealed carry was certainly one. As Lawyers.com’s Larry Bodine put it, “To bullet-proof the ruling against an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the 10th Circuit recounted numerous court rulings and state laws dating back to 1813, and based its ruling on prior U.S. Supreme Court cases.”

Still, given which judges ended up deciding the case, this approach may be less surprising than it first appears. While the decision was written by Judge Carlos Lucero, a Clinton appointee, all three judges voted unanimously against the right to concealed carry, which may surprise some, given that one (Judge Bobby Ray Baldock) was a Reagan appointee, and the other (Judge Harriz Hartz) was a nominee by the second President Bush, neither of whom were presidents known for nominating liberal judges.

So why did they decide the way they did? To understand that, one needs to first understand a little about the case, and about court precedent regarding the Second Amendment.

The Case

The person bringing the case was one Gray Peterson, a resident of Washington state, who possessed concealed carry permits both in Washington and in Florida. Peterson frequently visited the Denver, Colorado area, and in so doing, wished to carry a firearm with him at all times. However, the city of Denver currently bans open carry of firearms, which means Peterson would need to get a concealed carry license from the state in order to carry his weapon in most situations.

Fortunately, Colorado did have a program for recognizing the concealed carry licenses of other states. The problem for Peterson was that Colorado only recognized concealed carry licenses from states that also recognized concealed carry licenses from Colorado. In other words, if a state wouldn’t recognize Colorado’s concealed carry licenses, Colorado wouldn’t recognize theirs. Neither Florida nor Washington state recognized Colorado’s concealed carry licenses, so Peterson was out of luck.

Worse, he couldn’t apply for a license on his own merits, because Colorado would only grant new licenses to Colorado residents, not people from out of state. In other words, there was literally no way for Peterson to get a concealed carry license in Colorado unless he moved. So, claiming he needed to carry a firearm with him, Peterson sued to get the law banning out of state residents from getting Colorado-issued concealed carry licenses struck down, claiming it violated his Second Amendment rights.

The court disagreed. Why? Because when it comes to the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms is far less absolute than many people might like to think.

The Limits of the Second Amendment

As we previously covered at TheBlaze, the right to keep and bear arms is more extensive than many liberals would like to think, and more limited than many conservatives would like to think. At the time, we wrote this about the legal realities regarding the Second Amendment (emphasis added):

For now, at least, the legal reality regarding the Second Amendment is that it does guarantee a right to keep and bear arms of some kind to individual citizens. Barring a massive shift in power on the court, this is unlikely to change, as five of the sitting justices voted to hold that the right exists and protects citizens against both state and federal law in the two cases cited above. Moreover, even cases that the majority of justice disagree with are not always changed after the fact, given the varying attitudes of various jurists towards the importance of upholding precedent. For the foreseeable future, therefore, the right to keep and bear arms is a fixed reality of the American legal and constitutional landscape. However, in practice, this tells us very little about how far that right extends, which is where the current (and future) legal debate is likely to focus. A right to own a handgun is one thing, after all, but what about the right to own rocket launchers? Miniguns? Anti-tank ordinance? An actual, physical tank? Are all of these things protected by the right to keep and bear arms? They are, after all, arms. Fortunately for those worrying about their neighbors acquiring weapons grade helicopters, even the most stringent supporters of gun rights admit that the law allows for limits on what sort of weapons are protected, or on how those weapons might be obtained. For his part, Scalia would limit the amendment solely to weapons that can be carried by an individual human being, knocking such armaments as tanks and missiles out of contention, and admitted in the majority decision in Heller that regulations such as background checks and concealed carry permits almost certainly pass constitutional muster.

This, as it turns out, is precisely the reasoning that the Court ended up using in this case. From Judge Lucero’s decision [emphasis added]:

With respect to Peterson’s claims against the Denver sheriff, we conclude that the carrying of concealed firearms is not protected by the Second Amendment or the Privileges and Immunities Clause. In Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275 (1897), the Supreme Court stated in dicta that “the right of the people to keep and bear arms is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.” More recently, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Court noted that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues,” and explained that “nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions.” Id. at 626. In light of our nation’s extensive practice of restricting citizens’ freedom to carry firearms in a concealed manner, we hold that this activity does not fall within the scope of the Second Amendment’s protections.

Part of the issue at work here is that the Supreme Court’s decision to grant the right to keep and bear arms the same legal status as more longstanding rights like the right to free speech has been exceedingly recent (the two cases that established this precedent, District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, were handed down in 2008 and 2010, respectively), and thus there is much less clarity about where that “right” begins and ends. The 10th circuit court explicitly acknowledged this:

In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court held “that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.” And in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 130 S. Ct. 3020 (2010), the Court concluded that “the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States.” Nevertheless, the Court has provided precious little guidance with respect to the standard by which restrictions on the possession of firearms should be assessed. In Heller, the Court determined that the challenged statute, which completely barred possession of handguns in the home and required that any lawful firearm be kept in an inoperable condition, failed “[u]nder any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights.” The Court rejected application of rational-basis scrutiny, but declined to select another standard. However, the Court stressed that its opinion should not be read to “cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms,” which the Court identified as “presumptively lawful regulatory measures.”

However, while the Supreme Court has proposed no method by which to gauge whether a restriction runs afoul of the Second Amendment, the 10th circuit court itself apparently does have a precedent, elucidated in the case United States v. Reese. The 10th Circuit specifically applied what the decision calls a “two-pronged approach” to Second Amendment claims. In other words, when assessing such claims, the court asks two questions:

1. Does the challenged law “impose a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment’s guarantee?” If not, the law is constitutional.

2. If so, does the law pass muster under a “means-end” test, IE does it pursue a constitutionally acceptable end using means that do not fall afoul of any explicit part of the constitution?

The court in this case completely avoided the second, more complicated question. Rather, they decided right out the gate that since carrying concealed weapons was not a right the Second Amendment was designed to protect, the law was presumptively constitutional:

We agree with the Fifth Circuit that in applying the two-step approach to Second Amendment claims, we consider at the first step “whether the law harmonizes with the historical traditions associated with the Second Amendment guarantee.” As the foregoing demonstrates, concealed carry bans have a lengthy history. Given…the Supreme Court’s admonition in Heller that “nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions,” we conclude that Peterson’s Second Amendment claim fails at step one of our two-step analysis: the Second Amendment does not confer a right to carry concealed weapons.

Nor was it only Heller and McDonald that the court relied on to make its decision. Rather, they used the treatises of the British legal scholar Blackstone (a contemporary of the Founding Fathers, and one of their inspirations), as well as quotations from several cases both in the early and late 19th century to prove that carrying concealed weapons was never a right that even the Founders meant to protect. In short, they wrote a decision with a liberal outcome using conservative reasoning on the limits of the Second Amendment. However, that is unlikely to be the end of the story.

So What Happens Now?

It is at this point that many gun rights supporters must be feeling nervous. After all, if a state can set up its concealed carry laws and open carry laws such that a citizen literally cannot carry their weapon in particular circumstances, surely that means the right to keep and bear arms is something of a formality.

Fortunately for these people, there are several factors that make that problem less pressing. Firstly, this case only applies to areas where the 10th Circuit Court has jurisdiction – specifically, Colorado, Kansas, most of Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, and may not even apply there, given that an appeal will almost certainly come out of the case, given that it directly contradicts another decision by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

Secondly, the court in this case did not rule that bans on open carry are constitutional (and, in fact, noted with some bewilderment that Peterson had not challenged the open carry statute in the decision), simply that there is no “right” to carry a concealed weapon implied by the Second Amendment. Again, other Circuit Courts differ with this assessment, and the Supreme Court will almost certainly be asked to step in.

For now, however, concealed carry licenses are a privilege, not a right."

The laws, the argument goes, mostly just outlaw guns that look menacing. It seems that line of thinking got one person on eBay thinking: What would so-called “assault” weapons look like back in the time of cavemen?

We seem to have an answer — and it could be yours for $20.51 now $100 $3,050:*

“This is your chance to own the most iconic piece of history tried and true of all assault weapons!” the auction’s description says. “This rock is millions of years old and may have been the caveman’s AR15. This is not a modern AR15 or assault weapon, rather this is the caveman’s AR15 (Assault Rock). Again this is a ROCK.

“This item is intended purely for decoration and not intended to be used as a weapon. This is your chance to own a piece of history.”

The auction has nine days left and started out at $0.99. However, you might want to rush to see it: One internet thread claims that a similar auction was taken down by eBay.

No word on if Vice President Biden is expected to include such weapons in his gun control recommendations.

blaze90,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2014-06-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/06/17/hillary-clinton-endorses-ban-on-assault-weapons-and-high-capacity-magazines-seemingly-confuses-automatic-vs-semi-autoamtic-firearms,"WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) — Speaking at a CNN town hall event Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton argued a “ban” on semi-automatic rifles — or so-called “assault rifles” — as well as high-capacity magazines would help reduce gun violence in the United States.

“What’s been happening with these school shootings should cause everybody to just think hard,” she said. “I was disappointed that the Congress did not pass universal background checks after the horrors of the shooting at Sandy Hook and now we’ve had more in the time since.”

Clinton, thought to be a likely 2016 presidential candidate, then made a glaring error when making an emotional plea to promote gun control.

She said she couldn’t understand how an individual could walk into a school with an “automatic weapon” and “murder innocent children, students, teachers.” In fact, automatic weapons are highly regulated and very difficult to acquire. It is likely the former first lady was actually referring to semi-automatic weapons.

She referred to “automatic weapons” for a second time later during the town hall, saying they can do more damage than ever before. There have been two homicides committed with legally owned fully automatic weapons since 1934, according to GunCite.com.

“I will speak out no matter what role I find myself in,” Clinton added. “We cannot let a minority of people… hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people.”

The former secretary of state also personally addressed the mother of one of the Americans killed in Benghazi during a CNN town hall event on Tuesday, saying she can “totally relate to her as a mother or to any of the family members of the four Americans who were killed that night.”

“I can see why she and others are inconsolable,” she said.

Clinton was referring to Patricia Smith, the mother of slain American diplomat Sean Smith. Smith has criticized Clinton and the Obama administration for telling what she believes isn’t the whole truth. She also questioned why it took nearly two years for the administration to capture a suspect who wasn’t even in hiding.

Her appearance came hours after the Obama administration announced the capture of a Libyan militant suspected in the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton said the capture showed the U.S. has an “an unwavering commitment to bring to justice” those who commit acts of terror against the U.S.

Republicans have criticized Clinton’s handling of the Benghazi attack, which killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. GOP officials have accused the Obama administration of stonewalling congressional investigators and misleading the public about the nature of the attack in the weeks before the presidential election.

Clinton said during the forum that she was “still looking for answers because it was a confusing and difficult time.”

She also expressed caution about the United States working with Iran to combat fast-moving Islamic insurgents in Iraq, saying the U.S. needs to understand “what we’re getting ourselves into.”

The U.S. and Iran have held an initial discussion about how the longtime foes might cooperate to address the threat from the al-Qaida-linked militants that have swept through Iraq. The former secretary of state said at a CNN town hall meeting that any partnerships with third parties such as Iran would need to be “carefully thought through.”

“I am not prepared to say that we go in with Iran right now, until we have a better idea what we’re getting ourselves into,” said the former secretary of state.

Clinton spoke during an hourlong forum to promote her new book, “Hard Choices,” about her four years as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state. Clinton is the leading Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 if she decides to run for president again.

U.S. and Iranian officials have both raised concerns about the swift advance of radical Islamist forces in Iraq and officials from the two countries met here briefly Monday. The White House, however, has ruled out the possibility that Washington and Tehran might coordinate military operations in Iraq."
blaze91,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2011-11-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2011/11/17/army-has-success-with-hypersonic-weapon-traveling-8x-speed-of-sound,"On Thursday, the U.S. Army completed a successful test of an Advanced Hypersonic Weapon soaring at eight times the speed of sound. The completion perhaps restoring a little bit of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA’s) confidence since it’s last test run of the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 crashed into the Pacific Ocean this past August.

Today’s test builds upon lessons learned from the two earlier tests of Falcon HTV-2 and brings the military one step closer to having the capability to hit a target anywhere on Earth within an hour, according to Wired’s Danger Room.

Wired notes that this test was considerably easier than the one conducted with Falcon HTV-2 a few months ago though:

Darpa’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 — the one that splashed unsuccessfully in the Pacific — was supposed to fly 4,100 miles. The Army’s Advanced Hypersonic Weapon went about 60 percent as far, 2,400 miles from Hawaii to its target by the Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. Darpa’s hypersonic glider had a radical, wedge-like shape: a Mach 20 slice of deep dish pizza, basically. The Army’s vehicle relies on a decades-old, conventionally conical design. It’s designed to fly 6,100 miles per hour, or a mere eight times the speed of sound.

According to Fox News, this prototype flies flat rather than soaring upward and then coming back down.

Wired reports that the weapon is part of the Prompt Global Strike project that focuses on developing hypersonic weapons, which includes anything that goes five times faster than the speed of sound, giving military the ability to strike targets anywhere in the world in less than one hour:

Those hypersonic gliders may cut down on the geopolitical difficulties, but introduced all sorts of technical ones. We don’t know much about the fluid dynamics involved when something shoots through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. And there really aren’t any wind tunnels capable of replicating those often-strange interactions. “You have to go fly,” says retired Gen. James “Hoss” Cartwright, who helped lead the Prompt Global Strike push as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and as head of U.S. Strategic Command. “You have to open up the envelope of knowledge.”

In addition to the testing of this Advanced Hypersonic Weapon and Falcon HTV-2 in recent months, Fox News also notes the semi-successful test in June of the Air Force’s X-1A Waverider. It reached Mach 5 speeds before “it failed to switch over to its main fuel source.”"
blaze92,blaze,['Sara Carter'],2013-10-23 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/10/23/for-the-record-explores-the-weapon-that-could-shut-down-america,"What kind of weapon could wipe out food and medicine distribution, force America into a slumber for decades, make planes fall from the sky, permanently shut down the U.S. electrical grid, sever communications systems and lead to the deaths of millions?

It’s called an electromagnetic pulse weapon, or EMP. Wednesday’s new episode of TheBlaze TV’s For The Record, Blackout (8:30 p.m. ET), reveals the very real threat America faces if such a weapon were detonated above the nation’s skies.

Multiple senior U.S. officials, lawmakers, military personnel and intelligence analysts say the Obama administration needs to take this threat seriously and prepare in the event an attack that would set the U.S. back to pre-industrial times and leave us vulnerable to enemy states.

James Woolsey, who served as CIA director from 1993 to 1995, told “For The Record” that 9/11 was a wake-up call that enemies of the United States were looking to launch massive attacks.

He said senior government officials began thinking outside the box and questioned what “if the government in North Korea or in Iran really thought that the world would be so much a better place and that they themselves would be so much more likely to go to heaven if they could just kill as many Americans as possible?”

“These guys lusted after massive destruction,” Woolsey told “For the Record.”

North Korea presents that very real threat. In 2011, President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would shift the focus of its military might from the Middle East to Asia.

“There was concern that the U.S. was missing the bigger picture,” a U.S. official said. “North Korea, China presented problems that we still have not fully grasped. A rogue nation like North Korea can be very dangerous.”

Earlier this year, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency declassified parts of a report presented to Congress that emphasized the threat of North Korea’s missile program, and its rocket launch in 2012.

The DIA report stated the agency accessed with “moderate confidence that North (Korea) currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles … However, the reliability will be low.”

The Pentagon, however, quickly went into damage control, attempting to clarify the statement saying, “it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage.”

Michaela Dodge and Jessica Zuckerman, both senior defense and strategic policy analysts with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said in a 2012 report that “Congress should demand that the administration develop, test and ultimately field defenses against EMP attacks, including improved ballistic missile defenses capable of countering short-range ballistic missiles that can carry EMP warheads.”

The most effective way of delivering an EMP attack is by detonating the weapon at a high altitude so energetic particles “released during the explosion would disable, damage or destroy all unhardened electronic devices within the line of sight of the detonation,” the report said.

“A rogue state would not need a long-range ballistic missile to deliver a nuclear warhead,” their report stated. “Even short-range ballistic missiles carrying an EMP device or a nuclear warhead launched from a ship off the U.S. coast could impact millions. Today, over 30 countries, including Iran and North Korea, possess ballistic missile capabilities.”"
blaze93,blaze,['Billy Hallowell'],2013-04-23 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/04/23/army-allegedly-orders-that-bible-inscriptions-be-scraped-off-of-weapons,"Questions surrounding purported attacks on faith in the United States military continue to abound. Over the past few years, many critics have decried perceived attempts to remove Judeo-Christian values from the ranks. A new report claiming that the Army has mandated that troops remove Bible inscriptions from their weapon scopes will likely only add to the debate.

Fox News’ Todd Starnes is reporting that soldiers were recently told to turn in their scopes so that a Biblical inscription purportedly etched into serial numbers could be removed. Active-duty members of the Army at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska, apparently reached out to let the outlet to shed light upon the situation.

Starnes has more about the lengths to which officials went to ensure that these verses were no longer visible:

The scopes were made by Trijicon and referenced New Testament passages in John 8:12 and Second Corinthians 4:6. The verses appeared at the end of the scope serial numbers – “JN8:12” and “2COR4:6.” “The biblical verse (JN8:12) must be removed utilizing a Dremel type tool and then painted black,” read instructions on how to remedy the matter. After the letters and numbers were [scraped] off, soldiers were directed to use apply black paint to ensure the verses were totally covered.

While the story seems unbelievable on the surface, Starnes reports that an Army spokesman confirmed the report in a written statement.

At issue was the notion that the military was purportedly not notified by Trijicon before the verses were placed at the end of series numbers. But the contention seems to stretch beyond that, as spokesman Matthew Bourke also told Starnes that the Bible inscriptions will be removed from all future weapons orders.

“The vendor etched those inscriptions on scopes without the Army’s approval. Consequently, the modified scopes did not meet the requirement under which the contract was executed,” wrote Bourke.

“Some of these scopes had already been fielded. Corrective measures were taken to remove inscriptions during the RESET/PRESET process in order to avoid a disruption in combat operations,” he added.

While the Obama administration pushes for a ban on so-called “assault weapons” and universal background checks, Democrats in both California and Missouri have proposed legislation that would result in possible confiscation of semi-automatic rifles.

Now, Democratic lawmakers in Olympia, Wash. last week introduced legislation that would allow county sheriffs to inspect the homes of semi-automatic rifle owners once a year. Seattle Times columnist Danny Westneat describes the move as “Orwellian.”

The proposed bill, Senate Bill 5737, would ban the sale of semi-automatic weapons that use detachable magazines and magazines that contain more than 10 rounds. It would also subject law-abiding gun owners to random searches by a county sheriff.

“In order to continue to possess an assault weapon that was legally possessed on the effective date of this section, the person possessing shall … safely and securely store the assault weapon. The sheriff of the county may, no more than once per year, conduct an inspection to ensure compliance with this subsection,” the bill states.

“They always say, we’ll never go house to house to take your guns away. But then you see this, and you have to wonder,” Seattle trial lawyer Lance Palmer told the Seattle Times.

“I’m a liberal Democrat — I’ve voted for only one Republican in my life,” Palmer added. “But now I understand why my right-wing opponents worry about having to fight a government takeover.”

He also said it’s this type of radical bill that “drives people into the arms of the NRA.”

One of the bill’s sponsors, State Sen. Adam Kline (D-Seattle), told the Seattle Times that he didn’t properly vet the bill prior to jumping on board. He claims he didn’t realize the bill authorized police searches.

“I made a mistake,” he said. “I frankly should have vetted this more closely.”

The legislation’s main sponsor, Sen. Ed Murray (D-Seattle) also blasted the search provision written in his bill, saying it is likely unconstitutional.

“I have to admit that shouldn’t be in there,” he said.

Murray also explained that an assault weapons ban isn’t likely to pass anyhow and the bill was intended to be a blueprint for gun legislation in the future. With the search provision included, the bill has very little chance of passing.

It wasn’t immediately clear which lawmaker wrote the search provision into the bill.

What happened?

Last Friday afternoon, an unidentified Springville police officer spotted a pair of feet dangling outside a donation bin. The officer ordered that man, Paul Douglas Anderson, out of the bin. Anderson complied, but refused to remove his hands from his pockets once outside. When he finally did, he reportedly began beating the officer.

Derek Meyer was driving in the area and spotted the alleged attack. He immediately knew he needed to help the officer.

The good Samaritan has a concealed carry license and regularly carries a firearm. He told KSTU-TV he has predetermined how he would act in a situation where he needed to use his firearm to protect life.

“I carry a gun to protect me and those around me, but primarily I carry a gun to protect my family first and foremost. Outside of that, if I were to use my gun to protect anyone it would be law enforcement or military personnel,” he said.

And that’s exactly what he did.

Meyer jumped out of his car, drew his firearm and ordered Anderson to stop assaulting the officer. Anderson complied, but ran off. He was found a half hour later hiding under a flatbed trailer and was arrested.

Anderson reportedly faces “multiple charges” and was well-known to law enforcement.

What did the department say about Meyer’s actions?

Springville Corporal Cory Waters told KSTU that if it weren’t for Meyer’s actions, the situation could have been “much worse.”

“Had he not been in the right place at the right time, who knows what would have happened. But he definitely stopped the attack from continuing and becoming much worse. He might have even saved either one of their lives. It could have gone really bad, even for the suspect,” he explained.

Meyer said he acted with instinct because it’s simply who he is.

“Not to get any extra attention or to have people talk about me or anything I did,” Meyer said.

Is the officer OK?

According to KSTU, the officer suffered a fractured eye socket and lacerations around that eye. Otherwise, he was released from the hospital and is expected to be OK."
blaze96,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-08-22 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/22/judge-shot-in-apparent-ambush-outside-courthouse-but-he-had-a-gun-too,"When an Ohio judge walked toward the Steubenville courthouse where he presides to start his day Monday morning, police said an armed man was waiting for Judge Joseph J. Bruzzese Jr. — and ran up to him and opened fire in an apparent ambush.

But Bruzzese also was armed.

While he was hit by the suspect’s gunfire, the judge — who sits on the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas — rattled off at least five rounds at the man, the Washington Post reported.

A nearby probation officer fired at the suspect as well. The attacker — identified as Nathaniel Richmond — fired five shots but was struck three times and killed, authorities told the paper.

Jefferson County Sheriff Fred J. Abdalla said since both Bruzzese and the probation officer fired their guns, it isn’t clear if any of the judge’s shots hit the suspect, the Post reported.

“This individual laid in wait for our judge,” Abdalla told reporters, the paper said. “It just hurts. First thing on Monday morning, you have a judge shot in front of his courthouse. … This was an ambush and an attempted murder on our judge.”

Bruzzese underwent surgery and was in stable condition Monday afternoon, Jefferson County Prosecutor Jane Hanlin said, according to the Post. The Herald-Star said he’s “doing fine” at a Pittsburgh hospital.

Abdalla — who described the judge as an avid hunter and sportsman, the paper noted — said he urged Bruzzese years earlier to arm himself.

“With all the nuts running around, I encouraged him to get a weapon,” Abdalla said, the Post reported. “And he did.”

Authorities said Richmond’s motives are unknown. While his teenage son was found guilty in a headline-grabbing 2013 rape case focusing on football players, Hanlin said officials don’t believe there was “any connection whatsoever” between Richmond’s son, Ma’lik, and the shooting of Bruzzese, the paper reported.

In fact, Bruzzese had “nothing at all to do with that particular case,” Hanlin said, emphasizing it was handled by a visiting judge from another area, the Post reported.

But Hanlin also said Richmond had a criminal history and cases under Bruzzese, along with other judges, the paper said.

U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson (R) represents Jefferson County and likened the shooting to one that hit a congressional Republican baseball practice in June.

“From the shootings at the congressional baseball practice, to today’s tragic shooting, public officials are increasingly under assault,” Johnson said, the Post reported. “Public service shouldn’t be a dangerous occupation, but it all too often is.”

More from the Post:

According to Abdalla, Richmond approached the courthouse early Monday morning in a car with another person before leaving and returning. When Richmond saw Bruzzese, Abdalla said, he “jumped out” of the car and ran over to begin shooting. The second person in the car is not considered an accomplice, Abdalla said, and told authorities that Richmond had only said he had to be in court Monday morning. This second person, who was not identified, did not get out of the car and was wounded by a possible bullet ricochet and taken to the hospital, the sheriff said. Abdalla said authorities have video of the shooting that they are working to have enhanced to show people what happened.

“This man shoots a judge, could’ve killed him,” Abdalla said, the paper reported, before adding “thank God he’s not that good a shot.”"

What happened?

Sanchez, as a result of his disability, didn’t obey officers’ commands, which led to the officers fatally shooting him, according to Oklahoma City Police Capt. Bo Mathews.

Mathews said that witnesses of the incident repeatedly cried, “He can’t hear you!” before officers on the scene fired and killed Sanchez.

Mathews said that officers received reports of a hit-and-run Tuesday evening when they arrived at the address listed in the report. The vehicle was no longer on the premises, but Sanchez was sitting on the porch.

It was later revealed that Sanchez’s father was the driver in the hit-and-run incident, but he had struck an object with his vehicle, and not another person.

Mathews said that when officers arrived, Sanchez had a metal pipe in his hand that measured approximately two feet in length. He said that Sanchez began making his way off the porch, toward the officers.

Witnesses overheard officers giving commands to Sanchez, but according to Mathews, officers did not hear their protests that Sanchez was deaf and could not understand the officers’ commands.

“In those situations, very volatile situations, you have a weapon out, you can get what they call tunnel vision, or you can really lock in to just the person that has the weapon that’d be the threat against you,” Matthews said. “I don’t know exactly what the officers were thinking at that point.”

Mathews added that neither officer was wearing a body cam.

Background on Sanchez

Sanchez’s neighbor, Julio Rayos, told the Oklahoman on Wednesday that not only was Sanchez deaf, but he was also unable to speak.

“He don’t speak, he don’t hear, mainly it is hand movements. That’s how he communicates,” Rayos said. “I believe he was frustrated trying to tell them what was going on.”

Another neighbor, Jolie Guebara, told The Associated Press that it was customary for Sanchez to have a stick in his hand to fend off stray dogs.

“He always had a stick that he would walk around with, because there’s a lot of stray dogs,” Guebara said.

Sanchez did not have a criminal record."

Originally, it was planned that Pompeo would be confirmed by the Senate by the time President Donald Trump took his oath of office Friday, or later that afternoon. Republicans noted that President Barack Obama had seven of his Cabinet members confirmed by the time he took office in 2009, and that it’s standard practice to have key members of the U.S. national security team in place while the transition of power takes place.

However, when Trump was sworn in last week, Pompeo had not yet been confirmed. By Friday afternoon, only Gen. James Mattis and Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s nominees for secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security, respectively, were confirmed.

The delay occurred because Senate Democrats, lead by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), failed to make good on their promise to include Pompeo in the small group of nominees who would be confirmed via a voice vote Friday afternoon, according to the Weekly Standard.

The magazine — cited six unnamed sources familiar with a confrontation between Schumer and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton that took place on the Senate floor Friday — after Schumer broke his promise to confirm Pompeo with Trump’s other top national security figures, and said he offered Republicans an “insulting excuse” for having done so.

It all began several days before when Republican leaders agreed to push back Pompeo’s Senate hearing by one day because Democratic leaders said they had too many on their plate.

“Democrats asked that the hearing be moved so that six hearings did not occur on one day,” a Democratic Senate aide told the Weekly Standard. “That many Cabinet hearings in a single day had only happened once in American history, and it was an unfair schedule to senators on both sides.”

Republicans agreed to the request, and Pompeo’s team reportedly welcomed the extra day to prepare, but Republicans had one condition: Pompeo must be confirmed on Inauguration Day with Mattis and Kelly.

More from the Weekly Standard:

But on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration, [Oregon Democratic Sen.] Ron Wyden said he’d seek to delay Pompeo’s confirmation when the Senate convened late Friday afternoon. That evening Cotton, who is close to Pompeo from their time together in the House of Representatives, began calling his colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Wyden, seeking to avoid the delay. Some of the calls were cordial. Others were testy. The Senate reconvened after the inaugural ceremonies on Friday, with Pompeo’s nomination set to come up at 4:50pm. Cotton angrily confronted Schumer about his broken promise. According to witnesses, Schumer told Cotton to lower his voice and asked him move off of the Senate floor to an adjacent hallway for a private discussion. “We need to take this out into the hallway,” Schumer said. Cotton walked with Schumer but loudly rejected his first request. “Don’t tell me to lower my voice!” he shouted, with an additional salty admonition tacked on for emphasis. Burr and Cornyn were present, as was Senator Mark Warner, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and several aides.

That’s when Schumer told Cotton, who is an Army veteran, that if he would have been around eight years prior, then he would know that Republicans didn’t confirm Obama’s CIA director nominee by or on Inauguration Day 2009.

Cotton did not take too kindly to the slight, according to the Weekly Standard.

“Eight years ago, I was getting my ass shot at in Afghanistan,” Cotton reportedly barked in reply. “So don’t talk to me about where I was 8 years ago.”

Then, according to the Weekly Standard, Schumer claimed that it wasn’t his fault that other Democrats were trying to stall Pompeo’s confirmation.

“That’s when [Schumer] started dissembling and said: ‘I don’t control my whole caucus.’ Either he’d lost control or he was trying to make excuses for an outcome he wanted,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told the Weekly Standard.

And because of the incident, top Republicans have reportedly said they now know not to trust Democratic leaders in the Senate.

“I won’t make that mistake again,” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) reportedly said afterward.

While Senate aides confirmed the version of events to the Weekly Standard, as did Cotton himself, a top Democratic aide told the publication that there had never been a deal to confirm Pompeo on Inauguration Day.

Despite the incident, Pompeo was confirmed on Monday and later sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence."

In an interview with Piers Morgan on “Good Morning Britain,” O’Neill detailed his fears that he and his SEAL team would not see home again following the mission in May 2011 to eliminate bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan — a mission 10 years in the making.

“We were honored, but we were very serious because we knew it was probably going to be a one-way mission,” O’Neill said about the group of SEALs deployed to take out bin Laden. “I personally didn’t think we were going to come back.”

O’Neill prepared heavily for the mission and told Morgan that he had written letters to his daughters in the event he didn’t make it out alive.

The former SEAL detailed a helicopter trip to bin Laden’s compound and the team’s entry of the premises. O’Neill revealed that several “threats” had to be eliminated as he and his team swept the house, but was advised by a woman in the compound that wherever they found bin Laden’s son, bin Laden would be on the floor above without question.

O’Neill was the one who found bin Laden on one of the upper levels of the structure.

“Standing there three feet in front of me with his hands on his wife was Osama bin laden,” O’Neill said. “He was pushing his wife sort of toward us.”

He revealed that his military instincts took over at that point and that he disposed of bin Laden the way you would any suicide bomber.

“I took care of him the way you would take care of a suicide bomber,” he said, and revealed that he shot at the notorious terrorist over the shoulder of bin Laden’s wife. “I shot him in the face twice and once more when he fell down because you need to make sure that threat is eliminated.”

O’Neill said that it took a moment for it to sink in that he had just killed bin Laden.

“One of my guys said, ‘Hey are you OK?’ and I said, ‘Yeah, what do we do now?’ “

The tactical team then swept the compound for intel that would give the U.S. government more insight into the terror attacks and returned to the helicopter.

“The flight back after we put bin Laden’s body in one of the helicopters,” O’Neill said about the flight, “we knew at that moment that if we can make it 90 minutes on this helicopter we have 50 more years of life.”"

The number is actually down from year ago when 62 people were shot — six fatally — over the same weekend.

To combat the violence this year, Chicago police deployed 1,300 extra patrol officers over the weekend through early Tuesday.

Those shot fatally this year include a 15-year-old boy killed about 6:30 p.m. Sunday in Lawndale during a neighborhood drive-by shooting, which also wounded a 16-year-old girl.

An unnamed 18-year-old man was shot in the head an hour earlier at 5:40 p.m. on Sunday. Police pronounced him dead on the scene and said witnesses described an unknown man who fired multiple shots at the victim.

An unidentified 17-year-old boy was shot in the head by an unknown male assailant around 9:50 p.m. on Sunday. A second 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man, both unidentified, were shot as well. The two victims have been stabilized and are expected to survive.

Oscar Clay, 52, was killed in a domestic-related shooting at 1:32 p.m. on Sunday after he got into an argument with an unidentified 27-year-old man who pulled out a handgun and shot Clay. Police have still not captured the shooter.

Tiara Goodman, 25, and an unidentified 32-year-old man were found around 10:50 a.m. on Sunday. Police said both Goodman and the man were shot in the head with a gun found on the scene, leading police to believe the deaths were a result of a murder-suicide. It was not clear which of the two was the alleged killer.

At 2:45 a.m. Tuesday, an unidentified 21-year-old man was shot multiple times while he was sitting in his vehicle, hitting his back and heart. He was taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The Chicago Tribune reported that despite the violence occurring all over the city, Chicago’s Harrison District on the West Side, one of the city’s most violent police districts, saw zero shootings occur. This was a stark difference from last Memorial Day weekend when 21 people were shot.

First Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro told the Tribune that the lack of violence was a result of police proactivity and the placement of officers “in all the areas that we knew we should have them.” He also credited officers with talking to people on the streets instead of just responding to crimes over the radio.

“I think the officers are out there doing a great job, also doing proactive stuff and interacting with the community, that’s a big thing,” Navarro said.

Chicago is often hailed as one of the U.S.’s most violent cities, with 762 homicides in 2016 alone."
blaze101,blaze,['Kate Scanlon'],2017-09-06 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/06/tiger-shot-after-attacking-dog-in-atlanta-neighborhood-and-no-one-knows-where-it-came-from,"A Bengal tiger was shot and killed early Wednesday morning after attacking a dog in an Atlanta neighborhood, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

WXIA-TV reported that Henry County police received multiple reports around 6 a.m. Wednesday that a tiger was loose near an overpass on Interstate 75.

In a statement provided to WXIA, police said, “Henry County officers responded, locating the tiger and kept visual sight of it while animal professionals were contacted. The tiger began to run toward the Meadow Brook community off of Jodeco Road, to the back of a residence and began to attack a dog.”

Police shot and killed the tiger.

“With the tiger in close proximity to a school bus route in a densely populated area, officers made the decision to put the animal down with gunfire fearing that occupants of the home could be in danger as well as others in the area,” the statement said.

Brittney Speck, the owner of the dog attacked by the tiger, told the Journal-Constitution she was woken up by flashing police lights and the sound of her dog “going crazy in the backyard.”

She looked out her window to check on her Dachshund, Journey, and saw a tiger in her neighbor’s yard. She called 911, but officers were already nearby. Soon, the tiger jumped on her dog.

“And the officers I guess just started firing rounds and took it down, and then gave me my dog back,” Speck said.

She said that her dog is OK, and she was thankful her three young children were inside at the time.

“It was like a full-grown zoo tiger,” Speck said of the incident.

The tiger’s origin remains unclear.

Zoo Atlanta officials as well as staff at the Noah’s Ark Animal Sanctuary, a local animal shelter, both said that all of their tigers are accounted for. The Noah’s Ark Animal Sanctuary posted on Facebook that police had contacted them about bringing them the tiger before they determined that it was a risk to human life.

Gerri Yoder, Henry County’s animal control director, told the Journal-Constitution that she has “no idea where [the tiger] belonged.”

“There are a lot of theories, but who knows?” Yoder said, adding that the tiger could have been “a victim of the exotic pet trade” and “born and bred for the purpose of resale.”

Yoder noted that tigers “are not illegal to own with the proper permitting.”

The Journal-Constitution reported that the incident is under investigation by Henry County Police, Henry County Animal Control, and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources."

In a recent interview with ABC’s David Muir, Trump hammered on his opinion that Chicago needs to fix its high murder rate before he sends in federal assistance. While doing so, he made an erroneous claim about people dying while former President Barack Obama delivered his farewell address on Jan. 10.

If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017

According to the ABC transcript of the interview, Trump said:

It can’t be a great city. Excuse me. It can’t be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread. Can’t be a great city. […] So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can’t have that. They weren’t shot at the speech. But they were shot in the city of Chicago during his speech. What — what’s going on?

But according to police records reviewed by the Chicago Tribune, that claim is untrue.

Not only was no one killed during Obama’s Chicago address, no shootings at all took place during that time frame, according to the police records as well as the Tribune’s own crime database.

The Tribune discovered of the shootings on Jan. 10:

Five people were wounded that day in separate shootings on the South and West sides, but none of them died, according to Tribune data and the Police Department. The first three shootings occurred hours before the president even landed in Chicago. At 9:10 p.m., about 20 minutes after Obama’s speech concluded, a 22-year-old man was shot in the back in the 1500 block of South Kolin Avenue before being transported to a local hospital in fair condition, records show. The final shooting took place about 10:30 p.m. when another man, also 22, was shot in the right leg in the 1800 block of South Drake Avenue, records show.

As the Tribune reported, Trump’s claim did not air but was included in the transcript of his interview with Muir.

In the interview, Trump continued to describe the gun violence in Chicago as “carnage,” “a war zone” and “a catastrophe.”

“People are being shot left and right. Thousands of people over a period — over a short period of time,” Trump said, according to the transcript.

In Chicago, 2016 was the deadliest year in almost two decades as 762 people were murdered. That number is significantly increased from 496 in 2015 and 423 in 2014.

“Can I ask you for a flat-out judgement?” the “Varney and Co.” host asked O’Neill. “Do you think that women should be part of special ops teams that go in and shoot down Osama bin Laden?”

O’Neill went on to tell Varney that he has “operated with women” in the past, adding that they have accompanied him on special operations. He said the military frequently uses women when searching for other women and children and for “cultural sensitivity type stuff.”

He then addressed one asset to using women in combat that many might not consider. According to the former Navy SEAL, if Islamic fighters are killed by women, “they go to Hell as far as they know.”

“Also, I know these Islamic fighters, they don’t fear death, but they do fear Hell, and if they are killed by women, they go to Hell as far as they know,” he told Varney. “So, I like to say, lock and load, ladies. If they don’t lower the standards and they pass them, I think they should get a shot.”

Varney, who admitted to having never been in combat, seemed to have a difficult time understanding how O’Neill could feel safe with a female SEAL by his side.

“Are you telling me you are perfectly okay going into a life and death situation with a woman by your side?” Varney asked astonishingly. “I’m told that it changes the dynamics of the group that you’re operating with.”

O’Neill did concede that there is potential for a “change in dynamic,” but insisted that he is 100 percent OK with women in combat as long as “the standards stay the same,” chalking his argument up to “equal opportunity.”

“Women and men working together is better,” he added, but Varney still pushed back.

“I think men have a sort of hunter-gatherer mentality. They go out and break things and kill people,” Varney said.

Ultimately, though, the Fox Business host seemed to concede that it is “fair” if a woman can make it through the Navy SEAL’s rigorous training, which O’Neill described as “the hardest military training in the world.”

The suspect, 19-year-old Terrion Pouncy, was hospitalized after the incident and missed his bond hearing Thursday. The judge ordered him held without bail pending a hearing next week, the Chicago Tribune reported.

What’s the story?

Pouncy, whose face was concealed with a dark scarf, pulled a gun on two employees, 39 and 45, at a Far South Side hot dog stand. He demanded they hand over their cash, pressing his gun to the head of one of the employees, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The victim, 39, who was passing a bucket of grease across the counter, called for the other worker to hand over cash from the register.

The bucket fell over while they were handing a stack of bills and their wallets to Pouncy. Bills flew all over, the Sun-Times reported.

Pouncy still pointing the gun at the workers bent over to grab the cash, the Sun-Times said. Then he stuck the gun in his waistband and started to run away.

But as he ran off, according to the Sun-Times, he shifted the gun and accidentally pulled the trigger firing the weapon in his pants.

He was struck in the right leg and penis, the Tribune reported. The robbery was captured on surveillance video.

Did he get away?

Sort of.

The restaurant workers called the police to report the robbery. At about the same time, someone made a 911 call to report a person found with gunshot wounds to the leg and penis, the Tribune story said.

Pouncy was transported to a local hospital where he was later arrested.

Police recovered the wallets that Pouncy had allegedly stolen from the two employees, as well as the .38 caliber pistol.

Pouncy faces two felony counts of robbery while armed with a firearm, according to Chicago police."

The department said it let officer Roy Oliver, a six-year veteran of the force, go for violating “several department policies” after it was discovered that he fired shots into a car as it was driving away.

Initial reports of the shooting said that the vehicle was driving in an “aggressive manner” toward the police officers, but the report was later corrected to reflect that the vehicle carrying teens was, in fact, driving away from police officers.

The Dallas County medical examiner ruled Edwards’ death a homicide, and though no charges have been brought against Oliver, the Dallas County DA’s office is investigating the case in conjunction with the local sheriff’s office.

HEAR what Balch Springs Police Chief Johnathan Haber has to say. @CBSDFW pic.twitter.com/o7DPfhFUv6 — Andrea Lucia (@CBS11Andrea) May 2, 2017

The slain teen’s family said that they are anticipating Oliver’s arrest and revealed that Edwards’ two brothers were also in the vehicle at the time of the shooting. According to the family, the brothers not only witnessed their brother’s death but were “manhandled, intimidated and arrested.”

In a statement, the Edwards family said:

We are grateful the decision has been made to terminate the officer responsible for Jordan’s murder. Over the past 24 hours Chief Haber has made commendable strides toward justice. However, there remains a long road ahead. We anxiously await this officer’s identification and arrest for the crime of murder. The magnitude of his horrible actions cannot be overstated. We fully expect an equivalent response from those responsible for investigating and punishing the crime. We also know that although his actions were the most wicked and consequential, he was not the only officer responsible for dreadful behavior that evening. After Jordan’s two brothers, Vidal and Kevon, along with their two friends, were forced to experience this tragedy up close as occupants of the car, they were immediately treated as common criminals by other officers; manhandled, intimidated and arrested, while their brother lay dying in the front seat. The officers who extended this nightmare for those children ought to be properly reprimanded as well. Our family is working hard to deal with both the loss of our beloved Jordan and the lingering trauma it has caused our boys.

Lee Merritt, attorney for the Edwards family, reported that one of Edwards’ brothers was handcuffed and detained overnight.

“After seeing his brother get shot,” Merritt said, “Jordan’s older brother was handcuffed and taken by police for no particular reason.”

Merritt noted that Edwards’ older brother was not a suspect and that there were no charges filed against him.

On Wednesday morning, Merritt revealed via Twitter that Oliver is appealing his dismissal."
blaze106,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/03/27/the-awesome-adapter-for-your-12-gauge-shotgun-that-turns-your-gun-into-an-ultimate-survival-rifle,"In an extreme survival situation where the appropriate amount of ammunition for the type of firearm you’re carrying can’t necessarily be guaranteed, what would you do? Carry multiple types of firearms to increase your chances of coming across ammo you can use? You could do that, or you could have an adapter system that comes in a handy pouch that allows one 12-gauge shotgun to take 11 different types of ammunition.

The creator of Gear Up’s X Caliber Shotgun Gauge Adapter System, Tim Ralston, told TheBlaze it’s like carrying 11 guns in one.

“It’s my version of the ultimate survival rifle,” Ralston said, pointing out how useful an adapter system that couples with a single shot, break action shotgun would be as ammunition might become harder to purchase or in a desperate situation.

The X Caliber adapter system was recently unveiled in late November 2012 and the first shipment of pre-orders is coming in now, Ralston said. Showing it off as a drawing at a show, Ralston said he got 300 pre-orders just from there.

“I said, ‘I don’t even know how much it costs yet’ and they said ‘I don’t care,'” Ralston recounted to us. “With this system, you can pick the right ammo for the right time.”

It is composed of eight adapters that allow the 12-gauge to shoot 11 different caliber rounds. The adapters are each 7-inches long and made from chromoly steel.

Watch Ralston’s reveal on the Gear Up YouTube channel:

The system itself costs $449.99, but as Ralston pointed out, a 12-gauge shotgun with which the system is fitted to work, can cost as little as a couple hundred dollars. All in all, the system plus shotgun would be more cost effective than purchasing several different types of guns.

Calibers of ammo that the X Caliber allows a singe-shot shotgun to fire are .22lr, 38 special, .357, 9mm, 45 acp, 45 lc, .410 shotgun, 12 ga. shotgun, .223, 7.62×39 and 308.

But what about accuracy? Ralston said the adapters have been tested for this. Although they might not be as on target as shooting with the actual firearm for which the ammo was designed, the adapters are rifled to increase accuracy.

Here are a couple videos showing you how they perform in field tests:

After the gun control debate truly came to a head with the mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in December, stores have been reporting ammo shortages and even police departments have been having a hard time getting their hands on ammunition needed for the job.

Ralston said he envisions ammunition being treated as currency in a bartering system in the near future. In fact, he told us that he recently had an exchange where he himself was paid with 1,000 rounds of AK-47 ammunition.

And Ralston believes the X Caliber system will only allow people to easily adjust to situations where they might want to barter for any type of ammunition.

“The key to survival is the ability to adapt,” one of the X Caliber promotional flyers reads.

But Gear Up isn’t stopping with X Caliber when it comes to creating an adaptable firearm. Although still in the works and patent pending, Ralston teased a new firearm, which he believes will be ready for showcasing at the 2014 Shot Show, that he said will “set the gun world on fire.”

“We’re keeping an eye on what’s coming down as for regulations and already adapting,” Ralston said. “We’re going to be proactive instead of reactive.”

And that’s about all he would reveal to us on that front.

Check out more about the X Caliber here.

Update: Some people were asking about the possibility of adapters sold as single units instead of a set. X Caliber Adapters are sold individually for $50 each. See those here.

blaze107,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-09-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/09/13/check-out-the-semi-automatic-rifle-with-machine-gun-like-rapid-fire-and-its-legal,"Machine guns, those requiring only one trigger pull to unleash countless loads of ammo, are illegal for civilian ownership with the exception of special licenses. But a Texas-based firearm manufacturer has created a semi-automatic weapon that delivers machine gun-like rapid fire.

Slide Fire Solutions is set to release a new rifle, said to sell for $6,000, using a technique called bumping. The belt-fed rifle, which could also be fed with a traditional magazine, according to KTVT-TV, could fire hundreds of rounds.

“It sprays like a fire hose,” Brandon Renner, sales and marketing manager for Slide Fire, told CNN Money. “We recommend no more than 30 rounds on the belt, but one person could make it as big as they want.”

The product is legal under Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulations because it still requires a single pull for each bullet, although the trigger pull is facilitated by the momentum of the gun’s recoil moving the user’s finger.

Here’s how it fits within the law, according to CNN:

The key is that of the pieces that make up a gun, the ATF regulates only the “receiver.” It’s the only piece that has a serial number and the only one that requires a background check to purchase. Slide Fire modifies the trigger and the stock — the butt of the gun that sits against the shooter’s shoulder. Slide Fire’s technology uses the recoil of the rifle shot to “bump” the gun, speeding up the rate of fire without changing the gun’s classification as a semiautomatic, which requires that only one round is fired each time the trigger is pulled.

Slide Fire states on its website that it “has not been notified by any individual state that our products conflict with any state laws.” CNN confirmed with ATF Spokesman Christopher Amon that the device is legal.

Still, some won’t carry the new Slide Fire rifle, it’s other products or allow it to be used on their ranges.

Tom Mannewitz, who owns TargetMaster store and indoor gun ranges, told KTVT they don’t allow weapons using bumping technology at the range.

“…one of our range rules is no uncontrolled rapid fire,” Mannewitz said. “When you’re bump’ firing a gun it is not under control.”

Mannewitz though acknowledged an understanding for some gun enthusiasts wanting to see how fast they could shoot. Still, he said for those licensed to own and fire machine guns, it can get old.

“I’m a class-3 dealer and most people that buy machine guns – once they’ve shot a couple or three thousand rounds through it, realize how expensive it is, then don’t shoot it anymore,” he told KTVT.

CNN reported James Hill, owner of Abilene Indoor Gun Range in Texas, saying he carries Slide Fire products but won’t carry the new rifle because he thinks there will be too much demand.

From a safety standpoint, Hill said the “poor man’s machine gun” is a little harder to shoot than a traditional automatic weapon, but with practice “it’s fairly idiot proof.”

In addition to the SFS BFR, Slide Fire already carries magazine-fed rifles for less than $2,000 and bump-stocks to modify existing rifles about $370.

Watch this footage with Guns & Ammo magazine showing how the Slide Fire product works:

“Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the firearm. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward,” Slide Fire describes of its product.

CNN Money reported the SFS BFR should be available this fall.

Laura Shackelford, Chief Executive Manager of Slide Fire Solutions, in the spring during the heat of the gun control debate published a piece on TheBlaze’s Contributors section regarding the constitutional issues of proposed gun legislation.

TheBlaze reached out to Slide Fire for comment but has not heard back at the time of this posting.

Coffey posted a slow motion video from the event to her Instagram account with the caption, “We’re not in Australia anymore, Toto.”

In the video, the 22-year-old Coffey is seen wearing black jeans and cowboy boots, seated at a bench with her eye down the scope of a suppressed rifle. The video shows Coffey firing the gun, which recoils quickly, causing the surfer to wear a look of shock for a brief moment.

Her shock is quickly replaced with a large smile. “Wow!” she said, shaking her hands.

We’re not in Australia anymore, Toto. #laruetactical #texas A post shared by Ellie-Jean Coffey (@elliejeancoffey) on May 30, 2017 at 8:04am PDT

Australia passed a gun-ban in 1996, which instituted a gun buyback program that saw some 650,000 guns purchased by the Australian government with funds raised through a special tax.

Owning a gun in Australia is still possible, according to Time. Acquiring a firearm first means obtaining a license. In order to get a license, you must first have a reason for needing one, such as being a member of a hunting or shooting club. All requests for handgun ownership require background checks by police. Handgun and long-gun firearm purchases require a 30-day “cooling off period” after applications for purchase have been submitted. Safety training courses are mandatory as well.

Additional requirements for owning firearms are based on the varying licenses available. For example, competitive shooters are required to compete in at least eight shooting competitions a year to keep their handguns. Failing to compete would mean the loss of their “category H” licenses. And collectors who want to keep their “category G” licenses must attend at least one meeting of an approved historical society a year.

Australian police are also required to inspect firearm owners’ home gun storage to confirm that they are obeying all the laws. This includes checking that ammunition and firearms are kept in locked containers separate from one another and making sure that firearms are in a locked and secure area where it cannot be stolen or lost."

Balch Springs Police Officer Roy Oliver was indicted Monday on one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant for the shooting death of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards after Oliver shot a rifle at a car driving away from a house party, striking Edwards in the head and killing him.

Oliver, 31, and several other officers were called to the scene in late April after neighbors called police about a loud house party in the neighborhood, stating that they were worried about underage drinking because of the teens they could see coming in and out of the residence.

After Oliver and the other officers approached the scene and began to investigate, a group of teens began to flee the area. Edwards, a high school freshman, and some of his friends all piled into a car being driven by Edwards’ older brother and began to drive away when Oliver shot at the vehicle, killing Edwards.

Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber originally told reporters in May that the car drove “aggressively” toward Oliver and another officer, but later said he misspoke. Body camera footage showed the car driving away from the scene and away from the officers when Oliver fired the shots into the vehicle. Oliver was later terminated from the force.

Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson told reporters justice would continue to be served throughout the upcoming trial.

“It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA’s Office,” she said, according to KDFW-TV. “This is the very first time we have issued an arrest warrant for a police officer before the case was presented to a grand jury. As we move forward, my office continues to be committed to seeking justice for Jordan and his family. You have my personal guarantee that we will prosecute this case vigorously.”

Oliver was also indicted at the end of June on two counts of aggravated assault by a public servant for an unrelated incident that took place just two weeks before Edwards was killed, when Oliver allegedly pulled a gun on a woman who rear-ended his vehicle while he was off duty."

Trump has nominated Dr. Dean Winslow, a professor at Stanford University, to be the Department of Defense’s assistant secretary for health affairs. While fielding questions during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Winslow made the controversial remarks.

He was specifically responding to a question about the Texas church shooter and whether or not he should have been given a “dishonorable discharge” from the military instead of a bad conduct discharge. The former would have prevented the shooter from purchasing firearms.

According to Vox, Winslow first said the Air Force failed by not reporting the shooter’s record to civilian authorities, a mistake that allowed the shooter to buy the gun he used to massacre more than two dozen people. Then he added:

I’d also like to, and I may get in trouble with other members of the committee, just say how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used.

After making the remark, Winslow was immediately rebuked by the committee’s chairman for diving into an area that is not in his “field of expertise.” The Texas shooter used an AR-15 rifle made by Ruger.

Why are his comments significant?

Trump, and the leaders in his administration, maintain a conservative view of the Second Amendment: that no restrictions, outside of those allowed by the Supreme Court, should be placed on Americans’ right to bear arms.

It’s also surprising that Winslow chose to voice his personal views in such a public way, especially since it may hurt his chances of being confirmed to his post.

Were there any other questionable answers?

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chairman of the committee, grilled Winslow over his views on abortion. According to the Washington Examiner, Winslow stated in a presubmitted questionnaire that he believes “therapeutic abortion services should be provided by the military.”

McCain questioned exactly what therapeutic abortions are, and Winslow explained they are abortions needed to save the life of the mother.

“You better clean it up doctor or you are going to have trouble getting it through the Senate,” McCain told Winslow."

Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) said on CNN that the popular AR-15 rifle is capable of firing 700 rounds per minute. He was not challenged on the claim by CNN anchor Erin Burnett.

Police said Sunday that the shooter, identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, entered a popular gay club in Orlando and opened fire, killing 49 people and injuring over 50 others. He was armed with multiple firearms, including a semi-automatic Sig Sauer MCX carbine rifle, not an AR-15. The gunman was killed in a shootout with SWAT officers.

“If he was not able to buy a weapon that shoots off 700 rounds in a minute, a lot of those people would still be alive,” he said. “If somebody like him had nothing worse to deal with than a Glock pistol…he might have killed three or four people and not 50. It’s way too easy to kill people in America today and we have to think long and hard about what to do about that.”

Burnett responded, “You’re right about that. Thank you very much.”

Multiple viewers were quick to question the claim. However, one conservative journalist went one step further and offered to pay $50,000 to the charity of Grayson’s choice if he can fire an AR-15 700 times or more in one minute. Conrad Close, editor in chief of American Crossroads, made the offer.

I'll donate $50,000 to the charity of @AlanGrayson's choice if he can fire an AR-15 700 times in one minute. https://t.co/7imRIGiwjV — Conrad Close (@conradclose) June 13, 2016

So far, no word from Grayson on the offer. TheBlaze has reached out to Grayson’s office about his AR-15 claim.

It wasn’t immediately clear where Grayson got the 700 rounds per minute number, but he is likely referring to the capability of a fully automatic rifle. A semi-automatic rifle requires one pull of the trigger for every shot fired. Automatic weapons are heavily restricted at the federal level.

However, several YouTube videos showing gun owners using a “slide fire stock” on AR-15 rifles appear to increase the fire rate dramatically. There was no evidence Monday that the Orlando shooter used any such modifications during the attack that left 49 people dead.

A falling steel beam had broken his ankle, so Bennion understandably didn’t much like getting kicked and told Knowles he’d fight him if it happened again, the Post Register reported.

The bartender promptly kicked Knowles out of the saloon, the paper reported, citing court records, and told him not to come back.

But Knowles, 58, came back less than an hour later — armed with an AM-15 .223-caliber rifle and a .40-caliber pistol, the paper said.

“He flung the door open and jacked in a shell and started pointing this rifle at my buddy’s wife and then swung it at another friend,” Michael Martinez, a friend of Bennion, told the Post Register.

Police reviewed the Saloon surveillance video, which reportedly shows Knowles pointing the rifle at patrons, the paper said.

Bennion had a “fight-or-flight” response, he told the Post Register, grabbing a beer mug and chucking it at Knowles. Bennion said that allowed him time to rush Knowles and disarm him.

“He was distracted long enough that he didn’t get a round off, thank God,” Bennion told the paper.

It was all over for Knowles at that point, as other patrons began punching him.

More from the Post Register:

Police arrived shortly after and found Knowles lying near the front door of the bar with blood all over his face. Court records show Knowles was taken to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where he received six stitches and was diagnosed with a broken nose. Responding officers wrote in their reports that the crowd at the bar was screaming and several people were being held back from further attacking Knowles. Officers got Knowles away from the crowd so he could be treated for his injuries. He later told officers he had been drinking and left after the confrontation with Bennion. He told officers when he returned he never pointed the gun at the patrons, contrary to video evidence. Knowles told officers he didn’t think he stepped on Bennion’s foot.

Knowles also told police he came back to the saloon to talk to Bennion and armed himself for protection, the paper said, adding that court records indicate the handgun had a round in the chamber.

Bennion told the Post Register he’s glad no one was shot: “I mean I’ve got a 3-year-old little girl and a wife, and I’d hate to leave them and be shot over some drunk idiot.”

He toldo the paper that police didn’t confront him or his friends about punching Knowles.

“You know, cops can get a bad rap,” Bennion told the Post Register, “but they were really good and handled the business last night very professionally.”

Knowles is charged with aggravated assault, unlawful possession of a weapon by a convicted felon and an enhancement for use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony, the paper said, adding that he faces up to 15 years in prison over the charges.

Knowles was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in 2002, the Post Register reported, adding that court records indicate the conviction barred him from owning a firearm."

Provides Statement to TheBlaze on Vet Arrested After ‘Rudely Displaying’ Rifle (Plus, a Texas Firearms Attorney Weighs In)

–

Army Master Sgt. C.J. Grisham was on a ten-mile Boy Scout hike with his son in Texas when he was arrested and accused of “rudely displaying” his firearm. Knowing there are wild boars, coyotes, and cougars in the area, he had an AR-15 rifle slung over his shoulder and was also carrying a .45 caliber pistol, according to Fox News’ Todd Starnes.

A “huge Constitutionalist” and prominent military blogger, Grisham has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan throughout his 18 years in the military. He was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor for his service.

But on the day he was arrested in mid-March, Grisham says he was treated like a “street thug.”

He described how it all happened:

At about the 5 mile mark of our hike, a voice behind us asked us to stop and the officer motioned for us to approach him. He got out of his car and met us a few feet later. He asked us what we were doing and I explained that we were hiking for my son’s merit badge. He then asked me what I’m doing with the rifle, to which I responded in a calm manner, “Does it matter, officer? Am I breaking the law?” At that point, the officer grabbed my rifle without warning or indication. He didn’t ask for my rifle and he didn’t suggest he would take it from me. He simply grabbed it. This startled me and I instantly pulled back – the rifle was attached to me – and I asked what he thought he was doing because he’s not taking my rifle. He then pulled his service pistol on me and told me to take my hands off the weapon and move to his car, which I complied with. He then slammed me into the hood of his car and I remembered I had a camera on me (one of the requirements of the hiking merit badge is to document your hikes)…Up to this point, I am not told why I am being stopped, why he tried to disarm me, or even that I’m under arrest. […] The arresting officer is Officer Steve Ermis and the supervisor is Sergeant Minnicks of the Temple Police Department.

Grisham’s 15-year-old son recorded the entire incident, and the video is posted on YouTube.

In it, you can see a handcuffed Grisham repeatedly asking what he is being detained for. TheBlaze spoke with attorney Michele Byington of Texas Law Shield who confirmed that, while Texas does have open carry laws, they don’t apply to “long guns,” like Grisham’s AR-15. He would only be in trouble if he had been carrying the rifle in a way “calculated to cause alarm,” like waving it in the air — not strapped to his chest and pointed towards the ground.

“In this day and age people are alarmed when they see someone with what you have [a rifle],” one of the officers explains, noting that someone had called the police. “They don’t care what the law is.”

“Do ​you​ care what the law is?” Grisham shot back.

Video shows the veteran continuing to elicit clarification as his hands are handcuffed behind his back, asking why the officers didn’t ask him to drop the weapon instead of resorting to such drastic action.

“I will not be in the habit of doing that for anybody with a firearm, because it’s dangerous,” one of the officers replies.

“So just because a guy’s got a firearm he’s dangerous?” Grisham responds.

“Yes sir,” the officer says.

The video has even more stunning dialogue, but Grisham says he is the most upset about how his son was treated, and how the incident will shape his view of the police.

“What a bad excuse you guys are showing for [the] police force,” Grisham says at one point.

“Actually, it’s a bad excuse as a dad,” one of the officers replies.

Todd Starnes at Fox News has more:

As the officers put Grisham in the back of the car, the video picked up sounds of [Grisham’s son] Chris crying. The officers told Grisham they would take the boy home. “I told him not to answer any questions,” Grisham said. “I told him not to answer a single question until his mother was there — and she would answer the questions for him.” But that’s not what happened. Chris told Fox News that the police officer refused to let him out of the car until he answered a series of questions. The boy had not been arrested. “The officer told me that I wasn’t getting out of the patrol car until I answered his questions,” Chris said. “He said I didn’t have a choice. I was scared.” Grisham said his boy was traumatized by the incident. “Every time he sees a police officer he has a panic attack,” he said. “That’s unfortunate because we always taught our kids to respect police officers. My wife and I are angry about it.” [Emphasis added]

Chris told Fox News that he wants to be like his dad when he grows up. “He inspires me,” he said, adding that his father “didn’t do anything wrong at all.”

At this point, roughly a month later, Grisham says is still “100 percent confused” about why he was arrested. His charges were downgraded from resisting arrest to interfering with a peace officer while performing a duty, but he still thinks the situation is absurd and inexcusable.

“For me, it’s a difficult turning point,” the decorated veteran said. “I wonder what it is that I’m fighting for. If our basic rights are being violated this way — what is my purpose?”

TheBlaze has reached out to the Temple Police Department, but did not receive an immediate response.

“Where this case goes now is really up to a jury,” Grisham’s attorney Kurt Glass told TheBlaze. “It’s up to the citizens of the state of Texas.”

The entire, unedited video from the scene is worth watching:

UPDATE #2:

TheBlaze is aware of accusations that Army Master Sgt. C.J. Grisham has a controversial past, but the video is — at the least — curious, and deserves to be fairly debated. TheBlaze is working on getting more information on all facets of the story, including Grisham’s past, and will keep you posted.

Editor’s note: An editing error in the headline originally suggested the father claimed multiple Boy Scouts were present. It has been corrected to reflect that he was on a Boy Scout-related hike, but that his son was the only Scout present.

Here’s what they announced:

“In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales,” read a statement from the Walmart website. “Going forward, we are raising the age restriction for purchase of firearms and ammunition to 21 years of age. We will update our processes as quickly as possible to implement this change.”

“In 2015, Walmart ended sales of modern sporting rifles, including the AR-15,” it continued. “We also do not sell handguns, except in Alaska where we feel we should continue to offer them to our customers.”

“Additionally, we do not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories,” the statement said. “We have a process to monitor our eCommerce marketplace and ensure our policies are applied.”

“We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms and go beyond Federal law by requiring customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm,” it added. “The law would allow the sale of a firearm if no response to a background check request has been received within three business days, but our policy prohibits the sale until an approval is given.”

The statement concluded by adding that they would be removing items from the Walmart website “resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys.”

The move came after Dick’s Sporting Goods announced that they would end the sale of “assault-style” rifles in its stores nationwide."
blaze115,blaze,"['Sarah Taylor', 'Staff Writer']",2018-02-19 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/19/florida-high-school-student-says-media-is-politicizing-massacre-to-push-gun-control,"A high school student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — the school where Nikolas Cruz allegedly killed 17 people and injured many more — has openly condemned the media for politicizing the tragedy in the days after the Wednesday shooting.

What are the details?

Speaking with The Daily Wire‘s Ryan Saavedra, high school student Brandon Minoff accused the media of taking the focus off of those killed in the mass shooting and using the massacre for an opportunity to push for gun control.

“I think it’s the media,” Minoff told Saavedra, pointing to the media, who the outlet reports Minoff believes is pushing gun control as a response to the shooting. “They exploit everything to make it political. They’re more concerned about gun control at this moment rather than the fact that there were 17 people that were killed.”

The Daily Wire reported that while Minoff does believe that restrictions and limitations should be imposed on firearms, he is greatly disappointed by the media coverage in the days following the deadly attack.

“It pains me to see that knowing that 17 of my classmates are dead and they just want to talk about gun control,” Minoff added. “Students have opinions, they say stuff that they’re against guns, and that gun control is necessary, but they’re making it bigger than it needs to be at this moment.”

While Minoff said that passing some sort of legislation to reduce tragedies of this type would be “helpful,” he also seems to have doubts about any gun control laws’ efficacy.

“You can’t drink until you’re 21, but that doesn’t stop kids from drinking,” he explained. “I don’t know if there is a way to stop it. There is a way around anything.”

The outlet reported that Minoff does, however, feel that schools should have armed guards, and said that if assistant football coach Aaron Feis — who died a hero for shielding students from gunfire with his body — had a weapon, the fatalities may have been reduced.

“If Coach Feis would have had a gun or any of the other security guards would have had a gun it definitely would have been less fatal,” Minoff reasoned. “[The shooter] and coach Feis were face-to-face and he just shielded kids instead of having the ability to kill the shooter.”"

What happened?

According to law enforcement officials, a local Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident confronted 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley after he opened fire on parishioners in the town’s First Baptist Church.

CNN reports that when Kelly opened fire on the church with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, a local resident grabbed his own rifle and engaged Kelly, causing him to stop firing on the church, get into a vehicle and run. From there, a chase ensued and Kelly ended up dead. It’s not clear if the resident shot Kelly or if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot.

The resident who engaged Kelly ran into a man’s truck to chase him. That man, Johnnie Langendorff, told his story to local news stations.

What did Langendorff say?

Langendorff told local news station KSAT-TV that he saw the unnamed resident engaging in fire with Kelly. That’s when the resident ran to his truck and they began chasing Kelly. All the while, they were communicating with dispatchers.

Langendorff said the chase reached speeds of up to 95 mph before Kelly lost control of his vehicle and crashed. Langendorff said the unnamed resident then held Kelly at gunpoint. Sometime after the crash is when Kelly died, though it’s not clear when.

“[I was] just trying to get him, to get him apprehended or whatever needed to happened. I mean it was just strictly acting on what the right thing to do was,” Langendorff said.

According to Fox News, the latest updates says that 26 people lost their lives in the church. Dozens of others were injured.

Authorities say the two men saved “countless” lives."

The unfortunate incident took place on the morning of February 14, just hours before the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

According to witnesses, the actual shooter entered the Faith City Mission chapel in Amarillo, Texas, and threatened to hold everyone there hostage. While some people, including a security guard, managed to flee the scene, reformed ex-con Tony Garces saw an opportunity and decided to step up. The attacker had ordered a woman from the church to secure Garces with zip ties, but she purposely left one of them loose. Along with some other churchgoers, Garces confronted the attacker, and managed to take the gun away from him after a struggle.

Soon after that, the cops arrived to the scene of what they had been told was an armed hostage situation and saw a man holding a gun. But that man was Garces, not the recently-disarmed culprit.

“I got the gun,” Garces told the local ABC 7 affiliate in Amarillo. “I thought it was over. but they the cops shot me. The good guys shot me.”

According to Garces’s own account to ABC 7: “I said ‘hey, hey I got the gun. I took the gun away from him.’ … They [the police] said throw it down. I wasn’t going to throw it down because it could have fired. It had bullets in it, you know. I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt. … Then pop, pop they shot me. … I went down, then a puddle of blood. … I thought I was a goner.”

Garces was hit by two bullets: one hitting him in the back, and the other above his collar bone. One of those bullets punctured one of his lungs. NBC reports that the department is investigating the incident.

Garces and his lawyer are asking the city to pay his medical expenses, and to give police officers more training in the use of deadly force. According to NBC News, as of February 27 Garces’s lawyer said that city authorities have not yet reached out to him."

Now, it appears the dialogue has significantly shifted the public’s view of increased gun regulations. A new CNN poll found public support for more gun control has reached its highest levels in 25 years.

What did the poll find?

The poll, conducted Feb. 20-23 among a sample of 1,016 respondents, found that 70 percent of American adults favor stricter gun control laws while just 27 are opposed.

The numbers mark a significant shift in public opinion on the issue, even after mass shootings. The same poll found that after the Las Vegas massacre last October, just 52 percent of American adults favored stricter gun control laws, while 44 percent didn’t.

And after the Pulse Nightclub shooting in June 2016, only 55 percent of adults told CNN they were in favor of increased gun regulations while 42 percent said they opposed them.

The last time CNN’s poll registered such high support for stricter gun control laws was in December 1993, when 70 percent of Americans said then they supported increased gun regulations.

It came at a time when Americans had recently experienced three tragic mass shootings, the first coming at a California school in 1989, the second being at a Texas restaurant in 1991 — which is still the sixth deadliest U.S. mass shooting in history — and the third coming in 1993 in San Francisco.

At the time, the frequency of mass shootings and public opinion on guns led Congress to act. Just nine months after the CNN poll in December 1993, Congress passed the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban and then-President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law.

The ban lasted 10 years and mostly addressed cosmetic features of firearms, not differences that make some firearms more lethal than others, such as caliber and velocity variances.

Will Congress act again?

Possibly. President Donald Trump and many Republicans have signaled they are willing to give way on strengthening some firearm regulations. Trump said last week that he is looking into raising the age for long gun purchases to 21, in addition to directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ban bump stocks and seeking ways to improve the federal background check system.

But it’s the outspoken students who were victims of the tragic shooting who are likely making the biggest inroads on gun control. For more than a week now, a handful of Stoneman Douglas students have taken their anti-NRA message to TV and radio stations and it’s making a difference.

Meanwhile, many Americans are likely just plain tired of school shootings and want a solution — any solution — to prevent the next one.

No matter which way you slice it, it appears the gun control debate will rage on for the next few weeks. Whether anything actually comes of it remains to be seen."

CNN announced Wednesday morning that the NRA accepted the network’s invitation to take part in Wednesday’s town hall and revealed that Dana Loesch, national spokeswoman for the NRA and former host on TheBlaze TV, will represent the gun rights group.

Those set to appear at the town hall include students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed and many more were injured during a shooting at the school on Feb. 14, as well as parents and other members of the Parkland community.

The outlet reported that Florida Sens. Bill Nelson (D) and Marco Rubio (R) will also be in attendance, as well as Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.

According to CNN, President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott declined the network’s invitation to attend the town hall.

A spokesperson for Scott said, “With only two weeks left of our annual legislative session, Governor Rick Scott will be in Tallahassee meeting with state leaders to work on ways to keep Florida students safe, including school safety improvements and keeping guns away from individuals struggling with mental illness.”

A White House representative has yet to comment on Wednesday’s town hall at the time of this writing.

The sign — which well-known charismatic senior pastor Rodney Howard-Browne noted is on every door at the Florida church — has been up for about a year, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

But it got greater attention when Browne posted an image of the sign on his Instagram page following the deadly Texas church shooting that took 26 lives.

Welcome to the River at Tampa Bay Church – our sign at every door of our church #welcomesign #theriverattampabaychurch A post shared by drrmhb (@rodneyhowardbrowne) on Nov 7, 2017 at 12:56am PST

“It is a deterrent,” associate pastor Allen Hawes told the paper. “Look at what is going on. In the past two months, look at what happened in Texas. Look at what happened in Las Vegas. Because we are a church that is on television, we are very involved in the community. We want people to know that this is a safe zone.”

Hawes himself has a concealed weapons permit and a Springfield Armory 1911 handgun, the Times reported, adding that he’s far from alone in the 21-year-old church.

“If you walk through the door with the intention to harm, that sign serves as a deterrent to you,” he told the paper. “We are not a soft target. People here will defend their families.”

River at Tampa Bay Church also has hosted concealed weapons permit classes, the Times said.

Reactions to Browne’s Instagram post of the ominous church sign have run the gamut from starkly opposed to fully supportive:"

He made his comments on “Fox News Sunday,” and even criticized host Chris Wallace for focusing on gun control during a preceding interview with Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R).

What did he say?

“You’re talking about gun control. I just had to listen to you and Gov. Scott talk about gun control. Gun control is a big issue, no one in America is going to come together on gun control,” Pollack said.

“You didn’t say one thing about fixing it. The American people, we could get together on school safety,” he added. “But when you polarize it and every other media…we don’t care about gun control right now…you’re not gonna get everyone together on it. But, we are gonna get everyone together on fixing our schools.”

Pollack continued, tearing into the media and Wallace for not asking important questions on how school safety nationwide should be improved to ensure the kids’ safety. He said the media is focusing on gun control because it drives ratings.

“Today, it’s not about guns. It’s about the safety in our schools, and that’s what you ask Gov. Scott about. My kid’s not here, because the schools weren’t safe. That’s the main thing,” Pollack explained.

Pollack suggested that security at schools should be similar to security at airports and courthouses, two places that almost never see any type of violence.

Throughout the rest of the interview, Wallace tried to ask Pollack questions about other topics, such as the school resource officer who didn’t engage the shooter and took cover outside, but Pollack didn’t want to talk about extraneous issues. He sought to keep the dialogue focused on improving school safety, so his daughter’s death wasn’t in “vain.”

However, he did call the school resource officer a “coward” whose inaction led to more deaths.

But Ferrell and Hollywood suits weren’t laughing.

Ferrell’s views on guns are no secret; he appeared along with other celebrities in a 2012 video called “Demand a Plan” urging gun control. And as you might expect, Family Firearms received a cease-and-desist order over the ad from lawyers representing the movie’s production company, TMZ reported.

With that the Valrico store removed Ferrell’s “Elf” image from the ad and instead employed a new character: just your plain ol’ everyday elf.

But Family Firearms didn’t delete Ferrell’s “Son of a Nutcracker” exclamation:

TheBlaze on Thursday reached out to Family Firearms regarding the ad but a representative had no comment other than they complied with the order.

Either way, do you think we’d leave you without this brief blast from the past?

blaze123,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-10-04 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/04/woman-charged-for-cop-murder-attempt-i-shot-him-in-the-freakin-arm-i-wasnt-trying-to-kill-him,"Karisa Daniels — an admitted convicted felon — said she was “extremely high” when a Virginia state trooper tried pulling her over for speeding last month, WRIC-TV reported. After a vehicle chase, Daniels told the station she shot the trooper “one time and one time only.”

But speaking to a WRIC reporter from jail, the 23-year-old mother of two said what she’s accused of is “ridiculous.”

“They got me with this ridiculous charge … attempted capital murder,” Daniels told the station, “and I shot him in the freakin’ arm, you know? Like, I wasn’t trying to kill him.”

What happened?

Senior Trooper C.A. Putnam tried to pull over Daniels for driving 87 mph on Chippenham Parkway on the night of Sept. 19, authorities told WRIC.

She told WRIC she’s a convicted felon and was illegally carrying a gun, driving with a suspended license and didn’t want to go to jail.

Daniels told the station she stopped but “as soon as he got out of the car I took off. And … then next thing I know he’s right behind me again.”

She said she was “under the influence” and “extremely high” at the time, WRIC reported.

The pursuit ended miles later in a Henrico cul-de-sac — a dead end, the station said, adding that the trooper rammed her car.

“The next thing I know, I heard, ‘Put your hands up! Put your hands up where I can see ’em!’ and then I heard ‘pop,’ and I’m like, ‘OK, so he’s going to shoot me if I run,’ so I turned around and I shot him,” Daniels told WRIC.

Trooper Putnam never fired his weapon, state police told the station. Neighbors said they heard only one shot, WRIC added.

Daniels tried to run away, the station said, but Henrico police arrested her at a nearby home.

Putnam was expected to recover, WRIC reported.

Now what?

Daniels was charged with attempted capital murder of a police officer and using a gun to commit a felony, the station said, adding that she was in Henrico County Jail with no bond. Her next court date is Dec. 6, Richmond.com reported.

Is Daniels suspected of other crimes?

Richmond police said they plan to charge Daniels with two Sept. 12 payday loan robberies on Midlothian Turnpike, Richmond.com noted, adding that in both instances the robber was said to have pulled a firearm on employees and demanded money.

Daniels also was scheduled to face nine charges in Wake County, North Carolina — her home state — in connection with alleged offenses on May 25, the outlet reported, citing court records.

They include possession of a firearm by a felon, carrying a concealed weapon and a charge of “go armed to terror of people,” as well as three charges of assault by pointing a gun, Richmond.com reported, citing court records.

She also faces misdemeanor charges of simple assault, disorderly conduct and being intoxicated and disruptive, the outlet added, citing online court records.

Daniels also is a suspect in two early September armed robberies in South Carolina, Myrtle Beach police Capt. Joey Crosby told Richmond.com.

Daniels is charged with two counts of kidnapping, two counts of armed robbery and two counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime in connection with those robberies, Crosby added to the outlet.

She also has three pending weapons charges in Granville County District Court in North Carolina, Richmond.com said, citing court records.

Daniels also has convictions from 2012 and 2013 for larceny, shoplifting and resisting an officer, the outlet reported, citing records from the North Carolina Department of Corrections.

What else did Daniels have to say for herself?

Daniels told the station that shooting the trooper was “the worst mistake I’ve ever made in my life. I can’t believe I did something like that, but I can’t take it back.”

She told the station, “Just sitting in here today I’m like, ‘What have I done?’”

But she still maintained to WRIC that what happened to her isn’t right: “It’s so unfair that, like, you can be taken away from everything in a matter of minutes. Everything. Your job, your family, your house, your kids. Everything.”

Warren Drouin and Steven Boyce, both 22, were spotted walking around a Portland neighborhood around 2 p.m., their weapons in full view, KATU-TV reported. Police were called, but because Oregon state law permits the open carrying of firearms, the men weren’t breaking any laws.

Drouin and Boyce said they were just trying to normalize the image of legally carrying weapons in public.

“I just want to educate people that it’s OK however you want to carry or not at all,” Boyce told KATU.

But parents and others in the neighborhood were disturbed and upset by the display, which came less than a month after a gunman used a semiautomatic rifle to massacre 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

“That’s not the purpose of the Second Amendment, to frighten citizens, to frighten women and children,” Susan Anglada Bartley, the mother of a 9-month-old girl, told the station. “And I don’t think there’s anyone who can argue, especially after the tragedy where so many children were killed – nobody can argue that it’s not scary to have people marauding around Sellwood with guns.”

It also happened the same day Vice President Joe Biden suggested President Barack Obama could take “executive action” to crack down on guns.

“It’s completely ridiculous,” Bob Cronk said of Drouin and Boyce’s actions. “I think our right to a peaceful quiet school day comes before their right to brandish their rifles in a family-oriented neighborhood.”

Drouin’s YouTube account, under the username “Markedguardian,” contains dozens of videos of him walking around with his AR-15 strapped to his back and his encounters with law enforcement. He describes himself as a “constitutional guardian and activist…trying to normalize firearms in public.”

“I believe that carry [sic] a rifle daily will bring a strong culture in my area,” he says.

But what about gun rights other countries?

Last weekend, Fareed Zakaria’s “Global Public Square” on CNN spent an entire hour sharing “lessons” about guns that America can learn from the rest of the world.

Zakaria opened the segment on gun ownership in Japan by stating, “If you want to own a gun, good luck.”

How easy or difficult is it for law-abiding citizens to own guns in a place like Japan? The country’s Firearm and Swords Control law simply states, “No person shall possess a firearm.”

There are a few exceptions to the law, typically made for hunters. However, there is also a strict set of bureaucratic hurdles to get past before even a hunter can purchase a firearm.

CNN spoke with an American who navigated the stringent rules Japan imposes on would-be gun owners.

Retired U.S. Marine Rick Sacca lives in Japan and managed to successfully complete the lengthy process. He shared with CNN the details of what it took to acquire and maintain a firearm permit in Japan.

The Marine kept several binders filled with the information and forms he needed to complete the requirements.

In addition to the paperwork me must maintain, Sacca also had to deal with the following:

● 20 hours of classes

● Written test

● Shooting range test

● Complete background check

● Complete medical exam

● Complete psychological evaluation

● At least five interviews with police in an interrogation room

● Police questioned family members, co-workers and neighbors

● Detailed map of the home where the gun will be stored, including photos of the locks on the storage cabinet

Once you are granted permission to own a gun in Japan, Sacca noted that the permit needs to updated and renewed “regularly.”

He added, “The intrusion that occurs with the process regularly would never, ever be tolerated in the U.S.”

blaze126,blaze,['Justin Haskins'],2017-10-05 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/05/commentary-three-facts-that-destroy-the-lefts-anti-gun-narrative,"Since the mass shooting in Las Vegas that ended with at least 58 people dead and close to 500 injured, anti-gun progressives have been working overtime to convince the American people that gun owners’ rights should be greatly restricted, a move they say will make the United States a much safer place to live.

The left attempts to achieve its vision for a gun-free America by appealing to the emotions of a hurting nation, but if people look beyond the worn-out progressive slogans to the facts, they’ll see that passing restrictive gun laws does not create the promised reductions in crime. In fact, statistics show thousands of lives are saved every year because of legal gun ownership.

Below are three facts that completely dismantle the left’s anti-gun narrative.

No. 1: More guns do not equal more crime.

Progressives’ entire argument about gun ownership hinges on the idea that societies that have more guns are more likely to have greater problems with crime. It has always amazed me how easily so many Americans have bought into such an obviously false claim.

According to researchers at Boston University and Columbia University, there are only six states in which at least 50 percent of the households are believed to own a gun: Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming. If liberals’ arguments about guns were true, we should expect these six states to have extremely high crime rates, with an emphasis on murder and other violent crimes. The evidence reveals the opposite.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported four of the six states — Idaho, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming — ranked in the top half of all states for having the lowest homicide rates in 2015, with Idaho and Wyoming ranking in the top six. Further, although Arkansas has both a high gun-ownership rate and high homicide rate, it had a lower homicide rate than four of its six neighboring states (Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma), even though it had a higher gun-ownership rate than all of those states. And a review of other forms of crime statistics will reveal similar results.

So, if more guns don’t equate to their being more crime, what does? Generally speaking, poverty. In states where income disparities are lower, you tend to see fewer violent crimes. In states with higher disparities (and thus more extreme poverty), there’s more crime.

What about all of the statistics showing high gun-related deaths? Progressives love to show charts, graphs and tables supposedly establishing a connection between gun-related deaths and gun laws. What they almost never do, however, is tell people that gun-related death statistics include suicides, which greatly skew the results, especially since many rural states (where gun ownership is high) often have high suicide rates.

No. 2: Stricter gun laws don’t prevent violent crimes.

Progressives often argue that the only way to stop gun-related crime is to restrict gun ownership for everyone. People living in cities like Chicago, where the gun laws are very strict but there’s also lots of gun crimes, know this isn’t true. But when liberals are faced with examples such as Chicago, they will quickly say that the problem is guns are flooding into the city from other places. If gun laws were strict everywhere, they argue, gun crimes would be reduced.

If this were true, we should see lots of crime in states with lax gun laws. After all, if criminals are buying guns legally in the hopes of hurting other people, wouldn’t they be more likely to do this in states where it’s easier to buy guns?

Here, as we saw before, progressives are totally wrong. Many states with extremely lax gun laws have very low crime rates as well. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates for gun control, gave in its recent gun-control report card “F” grades to five out of the six states with the lowest homicide rates. The sixth state, New Hampshire, received a “D” grade. And these states also have very low crime rates in virtually every other category.

What about mass shootings like the one that happened in Las Vegas? Surely those would be prevented with stricter gun laws, right? Again, the research says otherwise. In an op-ed published Wednesday in the Washington Post, statistician Leah Libresco, a person who said she used to support gun-control laws (until she examined the evidence for herself), said the data show Australia and Britain have not experienced fewer mass shootings following their efforts to tighten gun laws.

“I researched the strictly tightened gun laws in Britain and Australia and concluded that they didn’t prove much about what America’s policy should be,” Libresco wrote. “Neither nation experienced drops in mass shootings or other gun related-crime that could be attributed to their buybacks and bans. Mass shootings were too rare in Australia for their absence after the buyback program to be clear evidence of progress. And in both Australia and Britain, the gun restrictions had an ambiguous effect on other gun-related crimes or deaths.”

Further, gun-control advocates ignore the fact that guns save lives every year. Numerous surveys have been conducted on defensive gun uses, and they report there are hundreds of thousands of defensive gun uses every single year. Some report more than 2 million. Even on the lowest end of the spectrum — the National Crime Victimization Survey — more than 67,000 people used guns to defend themselves or their property. (About 33,000 people are killed every year from guns nationwide, and two-thirds of those deaths are suicides.)

No. 3: Ridding America of its guns would be virtually impossible and conflicts with other progressive beliefs.

The United States has a gun culture unlike any other in the world. No one knows exactly how many guns exist across the country, but most estimates show around 270 million. Some show nearly as many guns as people. And guns aren’t just a hobby; for many Americans, gun ownership is considered an essential liberty. Even if the U.S. Congress were to pass laws severely restricting all forms of gun ownership, what would happen to the hundreds of millions of guns currently in existence? What would the government do to the millions of people who would refuse to give up their guns?

Progressives know passing restrictive gun laws anytime in the near future is an impossibility, but it remains one of their primary long-term goals, despite being in complete opposition to other progressive beliefs. For instance, progressives routinely demand strict gun control limits while at the same advocating for open borders. Even if the federal government could destroy every gun now in America, without closing our massive borders, guns would come flooding back in! True gun control without massive border-security improvements is not feasible, and of the two policies (open borders or gun control), it seems unlikely progressives would choose taking guns away over allowing illegal immigrants to enter the United States—at least for now.

Further, what is the logical end of strict gun control? No or very little private gun ownership. That would leave only the military and police officers with guns, and progressives are constantly arguing racism is rampant in U.S. police departments. Why, then, would the left want the police to be the only ones in our society armed?

Tragedies like the one that occurred Sunday night in Las Vegas are indisputably horrific, and Americans should do whatever they can, within reason and without destroying liberty, to prevent such events from happening again. But isolated tragedies should never be an excuse for limiting personal freedoms, and even if the case could be made that gun-control laws would reduce murders (it can’t), Americans need to consider the long-term ramifications of that decision. The Second Amendment wasn’t primarily passed so people would have guns to hunt and protect their homes; it was created and approved by the American people through their elected representatives to protect the people from a tyrannical government. As some unknown American writer once said, “When the people fear the government, there’s tyranny. When the government fears the people, there’s liberty.”"

Since the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, one of the major responses has been to increase restrictions on gun rights, presumably to reduce the probability that a mass shooting will take place.

But what if their proposed methods for doing so are unconstitutional? That’s the argument advanced by some experts on constitutional law, who argue that the landmark cases of District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago protect against the most controversial ideas being proposed, such as an assault weapons ban. Moreover, even some renowned liberal experts on the same law law admit that the tools available to the government are limited.

Key questions in the debate are: Can the government ban assault weapons without violating the Constitution? If so, why? To answer these questions, TheBlaze spoke to legal authorities on both sides of the ideological divide, including some truly famous names within the realm of constitutional law. What we found may surprise you.

I. Background: Heller, McDonald and the Limits of the Second Amendment

When it comes to the regulation of gun rights, two Supreme Court cases stand out as definitive: The 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, and the 2010 case McDonald v. Chicago. Both cases conclusively established that the individual right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Constitution, and that this right is in force whether one is talking about state-level gun law or federal gun law.

One might think this is the end of almost every gun law. After all, if there’s a constitutional right involved, the assumption is that the government can’t do anything to infringe on that right, right? Wrong. Every constitutional right has exceptions, or place where a right doesn’t apply. For instance, the Supreme Court has found exceptions to the First Amendment to include things like fighting words, obscenity and words that present a “clear and present danger” (such as yelling “fire” in a crowded theater when no fire exists). That is, the government can regulate, and even ban, such exercises of “speech” without running afoul of the First Amendment.

Similarly, both Heller and McDonald set limits on the right to keep and bear arms, even as they affirm that that right exists. TheBlaze has covered some of those limits already, but for now, it’s enough to quote from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion in Heller, which sets up the current controversy:

Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.

Some of this might strike the reader as obvious. However, there is one point of vagueness, which is where most of the controversy in the current climate comes in. Scalia writes that “dangerous and unusual weapons” are not protected by the Second Amendment. This raises a very simple question: What counts as “dangerous and unusual?” In fact, what counts as “dangerous”? What counts as “unusual?” If a weapon is only dangerous, but not unusual, or only unusual, but not dangerous, is it protected by the Second Amendment? The answers to these questions aren’t obvious, and they have real, non-academic implications for the government’s power.

II. Can the government ban assault weapons?

The original Heller case involved a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia, which the court struck down. The reasoning, in its briefest form, was as follows:

The District’s total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of “arms” that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition—in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute—would fail constitutional muster.[…] It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is per­missible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed. It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the Americanpeople have considered the handgun to be the quintessen­tial self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emer­gency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upperbody strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.

In other words, the problem with the ban on handguns was simple: Handguns are a class of weapons that are commonly used. This would seem to suggest that the reference to “dangerous and unusual weapons” really should have emphasized the “unusual” part, given that all weapons are (relatively) dangerous.

On these grounds, at least one expert would toss out assault weapons bans entirely. That expert, Randy Barnett of Georgetown Law Center, explained his reasoning to theBlaze via phone:

“When you get down to specifics, I think some of the easier cases for finding unconstitutionality is the assault weapons ban, which bans a weapon in common use, which is the phrase that Heller used to describe the weapons that are protected by the Second Amendment,” Barnett told TheBlaze. “There’s hardly a weapon that’s in more common use than the AR-15 so-called assault weapon. I say so-called, because we all know this is a made-up category. They don’t fire any faster than a constitutionally protected handgun fires, and it’s typically less lethal than a handgun.”

Barnett continued, “Because these weapons are in common use, it seems like it would be unconstitutional to ban them, especially given the irrationality of the statute in which cosmetic features are used to distinguish the bad guns from the good guns.”

However, Barnett’s opinion is not held by everyone. Laurence Tribe, of Harvard Law School, declined to comment directly on this story, but forwarded TheBlaze an unedited version of his own testimony before Congress on this topic via email. Tribe takes a much more generous view of the question of assault weapons bans.

“Heller recognized that dangerous or unusual weapons may be and have historically been heavily regulated or banned,” Tribe’s testimony runs. “It is not inconceivable – indeed, it seems quite likely – that the court‘s pause to distinguish unusually dangerous weapons from widely possessed handguns had precisely the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which included a prohibition on high-capacity magazines, in mind. At the very least, the Heller majority recognized that the government could keep machine guns —M-16 rifles and the like—out of the hands of civilians. The Supreme Court thus emphatically rejected the extravagant, or as Justice Scalia characterized it, startling notion, still promoted by some, that the Second Amendment could fulfill its original purposes only if citizens were guaranteed a right to arm themselves to the teeth, matching in their private armories essentially the full array of weapons possessed by the United States Military.”

Tribe continues:

Even if the characterization of these features as cosmetic were accurate, it would make little difference as a constitutional matter. In a recent televised interview, Justice Scalia explained the basis in history for exempting certain types of regulations from Second Amendment review. Certain limitations on gun ownership are constitutionally permissible, he contended, because there were some regulations that were acknowledged at the time [of the Founding. For example, there was a tort called affrighting . . . if you carried around a really horrible weapon just to scare people, like a head ax or something. . . . What the justice evidently meant was that regulating weapons because they are chosen specifically for their intimidating appearance is constitutionally unproblematic because the very use of intimidation is unnecessarily disruptive to organized society. Even more important to the constitutionality of the assault weapons ban is the absence of any connection to the core Second Amendment right to defend oneself with a firearm. At this committee‘s hearing on January 30, several witnesses criticized the assault weapons ban on policy grounds, but in my role as a constitutional lawyer listening intently for arguments relevant to the proposal‘s Second Amendment propriety, I was struck by the failure of anyone‘s testimony to support these features as essential to self-defense. In fact, I have searched in vain for any reasoned arguments that pistol grips, forward grips, telescoping stocks, grenade or rocket launchers, and barrel shrouds are indispensable or even contribute to self-defense.

Interestingly, in the same testimony, Tribe does not dispute Barnett’s characterization of the AR-15 magazine-fed semiautomatic rifle as a common weapon. In fact, he describes it as “America‘s most popular rifle.” Nevertheless, for Tribe, the relevant point is not the fact that the weapon is common, but rather that it is unusually dangerous, an idea that Barnett disputes, arguing that handguns actually fire more damaging rounds than the AR-15.

Another interesting difference between the more liberal line taken by Tribe and the more conservative one taken by Barnett is in their perception of lower court decisions since Heller and McDonald were handed down. Tribe cites a recent decision by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals upholding Washington, DC’s assault weapons to prove his points, whereas Barnett takes a much dimmer view of such cases.

“Many of the lower courts are engaged in what you might call civil disobedience against Heller and McDonald,” Barnett told TheBlaze. “I would not rely on courts to protect the Second Amendment. The courts did not protect the right to keep and bear arms until 2006, and yet nevertheless we had such a right, and that right we had as a result of political action.”

However, there is a compromise position between these two arguments, advanced by none other than Robert Levy of the Cato Institute, who was actually one of the co-counsels in favor of gun rights in the Heller case itself. In an interview this January, Levy told the Washington Post:

We had an assault weapons ban from 1994 to 2004. The New York Times, after the ban expired, reported that despite dire predictions that the streets would be awash in military-style guns, expiration of the assault weapons ban has not set off a sustained surge in sales or caused any noticeable increase in gun crime. There are, of course, millions of these so-called assault weapons, and they’re used by millions of Americans for all sorts of things, including hunting, self-defense, target shooting, even the Olympics. Criminals use handguns because assault weapons are expensive and they’re difficult to conceal. Now, [the Supreme Court] said that the Second Amendment would likely pose no barrier to outlawing weapons that are not in common use and are especially dangerous. And we have proof of that because fully automated weapons, like machine guns, have been essentially banned since 1934. I don’t consider myself an expert on the technical features of firearms, and so I’m not prepared to say exactly which weapons would go on the list and which shouldn’t, but I think experts should be able to come up with a pretty good list — obviously not needed for self-defense, obviously dangerous, not in common use. And that would be the new assault weapons ban.

In other words, Levy argues, the idea of creating a category of uncommonly used weapons that are less dangerous than fully automatic weapons, but still dangerous relative to handguns, and banning that category of weapons from civilian use, is not unconstitutional. Whether that aim has been achieved in the current case is an issue that probably only courts can answer.

Abate, who also operates Tocco restaurant in Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood, visits the prison daily to supervise the program which teaches inmates how to make delicious personal pizzas. The individual pies are sold to other prisoners in the facility, a skill Abate says will translate to a better life once they are outside of the prison walls.

Thursday on “Pure Opelka,” Mike interviewed Chef Abate. “I use food as a weapon to change people’s lives,” Abate explained.

The Italian immigrant talked about the origin of the program and his strong belief that teaching inmates how to make pizza offers the prisoners a better chance at succeeding once they integrate back into society. And, Abate has the statistics to back it up his belief. According to the chef, 200 inmates have completed his program and only one has returned to prison.

“I hope other people understand how beautiful it is to help others,” Chef Abate told Opelka.

Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, it was revealed that the gun used in the rampage had been checked by baggage claim on the shooter’s flight into what would be the scene of the deadly crime.

Esteban Ruiz Santiago, a 26-year-old veteran, took five lives in his rampage and wounded eight others using a semi-automatic handgun he checked at the Anchorage airport using proper Transportation Safety Administration protocol. After a layover in Minneapolis, Santiago arrived in Florida and reportedly retrieved the handgun, loaded it in the bathroom and began shooting in the baggage claim of Terminal 2.

The ease with which Santiago carried out his attack — which authorities are still open to calling terrorism — has many questioning the TSA’s rules allowing firearms to be checked. According to The New York Times, before Friday, guns checked with luggage raised few alarms:

According to the TSA, passengers at the nation’s airports are allowed to transport unloaded guns in their checked baggage. The firearms must be kept in a locked “hard-sided” container, and gun owners must declare firearms and any ammunition to airline representatives when checking the bags at ticket counters, according to the agency’s firearm regulations. Guns, real ones as well as replicas and toys, are allowed to be transported only in checked baggage, not in carry-on luggage. The same is true for clips, firing pins and other firearm parts.

But now, in light of Santiago’s vicious act of murder, the federal regulation allowing checked firearms is being scrutinized for several reasons, notably the lack of a requirement proving registration or paperwork for the firearm. Travelers in many cases need merely to sign a document proving the firearm is not loaded and nothing more.

There is also the matter of differences between cities’ gun laws. Many have faced fines when retrieving checked firearms in cities where they are technically not allowed to possess a firearm at all.

Checked firearms were once an obscure part of airline travel. The shooting in the Ft. Lauderdale airport Friday has ensured it will be likely be discussed as part of any firearm safety legislation going forward."

There are 44 companies on our list, with more being added as we receive notification. Here are the additions since Wednesday:

Here’s a sample of statements from some of the recent additions to the list as well as the positions of the companies that have reached out to TheBlaze directly to declare their policy shift:

Steve Adelmann of Citizen Arms shared the following from his company’s statement, made the day after New York changed its laws:

“Due to legal, ethical and moral concerns, Citizen Arms offers only those custom firearms that are legal for all lawful citizens of a given state to possess, regardless of law enforcement status. LE personnel living in states where citizens must have restrictive features will only receive like product support from Citizen Arms. We’re very appreciative of the sacrifices made by the law enforcement community but we’re even more appreciative of the right guaranteed to all law-abiding US citizens by the Second Amendment to the US Constitution: A well regulated militia, necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”.

On February 20th, as our story was hitting the web, Ronnie Barrett, the Chairman and CEO of Barrett Firearms posted his company’s position statement on their Facebook page:

Barrett’s Position Regarding the Assault on Liberty Barrett opposes those who are illegally disarming the American public from their efficient arms and creating superior armed elitist government agencies. Elected state officials of New York, having been sworn to protect our Constitution, have instead committed an offense against it and their citizens by stripping inalienable rights duly protected and guaranteed under th…e Second Amendment. By their deliberate and sinister actions, these officials now cause their state and local policing agencies to enforce these unconstitutional and illegal so called “laws”. By current law, Barrett cannot be an accomplice with any lawbreaker, therefore, cannot and will not service or sell to New York government agencies. Barrett also applies this stance to the individual elected official who, as a matter of public record, has voted for or created regulation that violates the constitutional rights of their citizens. This is an expansion of our 2002 ban against the California government due to their second amendment infringements, and shall apply to any future violators. In the course of world history there have been officials that strip inalienable rights from the people that were given to all by our Creator. Most of these officials inevitably come to trial, some do not. Intentionally violating constitutional rights by officials that have sworn to uphold them should have severe prison sentences. With the clear vision of horrible events in history repeating itself, all manufacturers of firearms or related equipment remaining in partnership with such violators should have a respectable fear of being found with the guilty on their day of trial. During this era of assault on liberty, Barrett will remain steadfast in our efforts to serve law-abiding citizens of all fifty states, and stands together with you in the struggles we will fight and win.

Jeffrey Norton of Norton Firearms not only sends a message about the Second Amendment, but also reminds folks that our rights come to us from “our US Constitution and our Creator.”

Norton Firearms, Inc. is a strong defender of the US Constitution, not only the 2nd amendment. We believe that a government that restricts it Citizens from executing their Constitutional Rights is no longer a government for the people or by the people. It is our policy not to sell our products or services to any organization that tries to diminish the rights given to us by our US Constitution and our Creator. If you are a government agency with a policy of restricting our Constitutional Rights we ask that you take our tax dollars and spend it somewhere else. I am sure there is some profiteering communist foreign company that will be glad to take our dollars for their gain. We will only sell to law abiding, Citizens and those agencies that truly support and will defend The US Constitution.

Doug Prince of Evolution Weaponry told TheBlaze, “Evolution Weaponry is proud to say you can add us to that list.”

I am a US Army veteran. I received a medical discharge due to combat related injuries after 6 years of service. I am a strong believer in American veterans, the US Constitution and individual liberty. My service to this country is among my greatest accomplishments in my life to this point and I carry what I have learned from that into every endeavor I undertake.

Arizona’s Kiss Tactical’s Facebook page also carries a story about denying a California police officer’s request to purchase an AR-15.

On Saturday I refused to sell a AR-15 rifle to a police officer from California. He came into my shop and wanted to buy his duty gun in AZ because the same gun in his home state would cost him more. I told him that I would not sell him the gun even though he had his department letter saying he was able to buy it. I told him that if the gun was not legal for law abiding men and women in CA, I would not sell it to him. after he told me that “civilians don’t need them type of guns” I asked to leave my shop. as he stomped out mad.

Doublestar Corporation (which includes J&T Distributing, DoubleStar Corp., Ace Limited, and the DoubleStar Training Academy) will also be unavailable to law enforcement and government agencies in states suppressing citizen’s rights.

Effective immediately, the J&T Family of Companies will be joining other manufacturers and distributors by ceasing sales of regulated items in states that have altered the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms.

There are also a host of smaller outlets taking a stand.

Witness the recent news from Old Grouch’s Military Surplus in North Carolina:

In support of our customers in the state of New York, effective today we are cancelling all orders to any state or municipal government agency customers in the New York and will accept no more. While we can’t stop the trampling of rights that is occurring there, we certainly can make sure we don’t assist in it in any way going forward.

We hope to keep this list as accurate as possible and will update it with news and additions as we receive them and can confirm their accuracy. Please forward any information directly to mopelka@theblaze.com.

You can also follow the efforts to encourage other companies to join this group here."

This is an editorially independent series sponsored by Tactical Firearms Training Secrets.

A 19-year-old sailor stationed in Annapolis, Md., in 1968 was arrested for getting into a fight with an alleged member of a street gang.

Now, more than four decades later, the 64-year-old U.S. Navy veteran has been stripped of his right to own a gun.

Jefferson Wayne Schrader of Cleveland, Ga., has been fighting a losing battle in the courts since 2008 to get his name off the fed’s firearm ban list. In fact, just last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a lower-court ruling barring him from owning a firearm.

“It’s a depressing thing. A depressing thing,” he told TheBlaze in a phone interview, “to have the government treat you like that. It’s not, well, it’s not a good thing.”

The ban list is meant to prevent people of questionable standing, including illegal aliens, drug addicts, people dishonorably discharged from the U.S. military, and fugitives, from buying or selling guns.

And although Schrader — a certified expert with a handgun — served in Vietnam from Jan. 1, 1968, until being honorably discharged in September 1970, the U.S. government believes he is unfit to own a gun because of his teenage misdemeanor.

“Due to a conviction some forty years ago for common-law misdemeanor assault and battery for which he served no jail time, plaintiff Jefferson Wayne Schrader, now a sixty-four-year-old veteran, is, by virtue of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), barred for life from ever possessing a firearm,” U.S. Circuit Judge David Tatel wrote in the court’s January opinion.

“In rejecting plaintiffs’ constitutional claim, the district court relied on the Supreme Court’s observation in District of Columbia v. Heller … that ‘the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,’ as well as the Court’s inclusion of ‘longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons’ within a list of ‘presumptively lawful regulatory measures,’” Judge Tatel added.

In its ruling against Schrader, the fed appeals court cited the Gun Control Act of 1968 signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson, which makes it more difficult for questionable characters to engage in interstate commerce involving firearms.

But we’ll come back to that later.

The other gun law that led to Schrader’s odd set of circumstances is the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. This bill laid the groundwork for the FBI’s 1998 National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

So when Schrader tried to buy a handgun in 2008, the NICS flagged his 45-year-old misdemeanor – which only now qualifies in Maryland for a sentence of two or more years in prison – and he was disqualified from making the purchasing.

But here’s the weird thing: Schrader has been selling and trading guns for a long time.

“I’ve bought and sold probably, oh, a dozen … maybe 15 guns over a 42 year time period” he said. “I never had a problem with it. I was just surprised it happened at all. The ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] agent said I wasn’t allowed to have any guns.”

“But he said I could keep my black powder rifle. Thank you very much,” he added sarcastically.

TROUBLE

As mentioned in the above, it all started in 2008 when an NICS check flagged Schrader’s name for his 1968 misdemeanor.

The FBI blocked Schrader’s wife, Harriet, from buying him a shotgun for his birthday and then blocked him on two different occasions from buying a handgun.

But let’s back up for a second and revisit his 1968 misdemeanor.

As Schrader told TheBlaze, one evening in Annapolis he and his Navy buddies were attacked by a street gang while walking back to base. A few weeks later, Schrader saw one of his attackers hanging out on a street corner.

“I told the guy driving to stop and let me out,” Schrader said, “and I walked over to him and was going to tell him, ‘You need to come with me, we’re going to talk you over to the police station.’ And he said, ‘Oh, you want some more?’ and stood up.”

As official court documents show, “a dispute broke out between the two, in the course of which Schrader punched his assailant.”

Unfortunately for Schrader, he didn’t see the two police officers “sitting at the red light.”

The sailor was arrested and convicted of common-law assault and battery. He was told he could pay a $109 fine, which included court costs, or spend thirty days in the hole.

He chose the former.

After paying the fine, Schrader went on to serve a 21-month tour of duty in Vietnam and was honorably discharged upon his return.

From that time forward, according to the complaint, he had no scrapes with the law (except for one traffic violation).

REASON FOR THE BAN



After going more than five decades without any serious trouble with the law, the 2008 background check came as a shock to Schrader.

“I don’t know why they’re coming after me,” Schrader said. “All I did was punch someone in the nose.”

So what’s the court’s reasoning?

The Gun Control Act (remember we said we’d come back to this?) specifically includes a ban on anyone convicted of a crime “punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.”

Okay, but Schrader never had to serve a prison sentence.

This is where it gets interesting. At the time of his arrest, the state of Maryland did not set any maximum sentence for common-law assault and battery convictions.

However, the DOJ reasons that because Maryland would have imprisoned Schrader for more than a year if it had the laws it has today, well, that’s good enough to keep him on the banned list.

TODAY

Two years after having his name flagged for the Annapolis fight, Schrader sued to challenge the ban and he has been fighting it ever since. Unfortunately, things haven’t gone his way.

“All I can do now is wait and see what my attorney can do,” Schrader told TheBlaze.

His lawyer, Alan Gura, a prominent civil rights attorney, says there are still a few options left.

“Today is our deadline for filing a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc in the Schrader case,” Gura told TheBlaze in an email on Monday.

“Some misdemeanors are very serious and Congress can address those specifically,” he added later in a phone interview, “but to broadly disarm anyone who has ever been involved in even a minor scuffle, 45 years later, seems to be excessive.”

“We hope that the court rehears the case. We think it’s worthy of that. It raises the types of questions that courts often find they need to rehear. If the court does not decide to reconsider the case then, of course, we will consider the next step, which will be a petition to the Supreme Court.”

A spokeswoman with the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to TheBlaze’s request for comment.

Here’s the full case: Schrader v. Holder, 11-cv-5352, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia:

blaze133,blaze,['Mike Opelka'],2013-03-19 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/03/19/dad-this-picture-of-my-son-holding-a-gun-triggered-a-visit-from-nj-police-family-services,"Did this photograph spark a police action that tried to enter a New Jersey home without a warrant? That’s the story being told on a website dedicated to “Open Carry” in the state of Delaware. The title of the story, “The fight has officially been brought to my front door.”

The young man in the photo is the 11-yr-old son of Shawn Moore. The gun is a .22 rifle, a copy of the AR-15, but a 22 caliber. The photo was posted on Facebook by a proud father. That Facebook posting apparently triggered an anonymous call to New Jersey’s Department of Youth and Family Services (DYFS). On Friday night, March 15th, two representatives from the state’s social services office (along with four local police officers) came to the Moore home and demanded to see the family’s firearms.

According to Moore’s lawyer, Evan Nappen (an attorney with considerable expertise in NJ’s very strict gun laws), the situation was “outrageous.”

Here’s what Moore alleges on the Delaware open carry forum:

NJ’s Department of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) came to his home, accompanied by police officers. They claimed to be responding to a call about a photo of a young boy holding a firearm. (photo above)

Without a search warrant, DYFS demanded entry into Moore’s home and access to all of his firearms. Moore was not initially there, but his wife called him.

With his lawyer listening to the exchange on the phone with police and DFYS, Moore denied entry to his home and access to his safe where he stores his guns.

When Moore requested the name of the DFYS representative, she refused to give it to him.

After threatening to “take my kids,” the police and Family Services worker left — “empty handed and seeing nothing.”

In an exclusive interview with TheBlaze, Mr. Nappen — the attorney who was listening to the entire incident via Moore’s speaker phone — added more details:

The DYFS worker repeatedly demanded access to the house and for Moore to open his safe where the firearms were stored. She said that the guns should be catalogued and checked to make certain they were “properly registered.” (NJ does not require registration, it is voluntary.)

The four police officers acted professionally, they were there at the request of DYFS.

The worker refused to identify herself. Mr. Moore demanded that she giver her name. She refused and ran away.

As of Tuesday morning, Mr. Nappen believes that DYFS is still pushing for an inspection, “which is not happening.”

Mr. Nappen also shared few very important facts about this case. For instance, Shawn Moore holds three very significant firearms designations:

NRA Certified Firearms Instructor – One of the toughest certifications to attain, requiring skills with the weapons as well as teaching.

NRA Certified Range Safety Instructor

NJ State Certified Firearms Hunting Instructor

Shawn’s son is also someone who has been certified by the state of New Jersey. In order for a person under the age of 18 to go hunting in New Jersey, they must be accompanied by a parent or adult supervisor, and they must also pass a state firearms hunter safety test. The young Mr. Moore passed the test and his father was NOT his instructor.

Editor’s note — the author of this post, Mike Opelka talked about the story during Tuesday’s live BlazeCast:

TheBlaze first learned about this story via a tip from reader who spotted Shawn Moore’s post on a pro-Second Amendment website. “ShawnMoore81” is a member of Delaware Open Carry, an online community dedicated to supporting open-carry in the state of Delaware. His account of the above incident at his home might give any law-abiding gun owner chills.

We present the un-edited post in Mr. Moore’s own words: Last night I was out with a buddy of mine. I got a text from my wife that the cops and dyfs are at the house and they wanna check out my guns and needed me to open my safe. I’m instantly on my way. I get in contact with evan Nappen on the way. I explain the situation. I walk in my house and hand the phone to the first cop I see. Then direct all of em outside. Dyfs got a call because of a pic on my son holding a gun. They wanted to look around and check all my guns out, make sure they were all registered. Obviously that didn’t go well because I refused. I had Nappen on speaker phone the entire time so they had to deal with both of us. They kept trying to pressure me to open my safe. They had no warrant, no charges, nothing. I didn’t budge. I was told I was being “unreasonable” and that I was acting suspicious because I wouldn’t open my safe. Told me they were gonna get a search warrant. Told em go ahead. Nappen (my lawyer) asked me for the dyfs workers name. she wouldnt give it. i asked for credentials and she wouldnt show em. i tried to take a pic of her and she turned around real fast and walked away. After a while of them threatening to take my kids, get warrants and intimidation they left. Empty handed and seeing nothing. People it can happen that fast. Most people wouldn’t have stood up to them like I did.

Mr. Moore also took photographs of the incident. One shows four police officers (wearing bullet-proof vests) from the Carneys Point, NJ police department were on the scene Saturday night. TheBlaze contacted Chief Robert DiGregorio of the Carneys Point PD to get the department’s account of what happened. The chief did not answer or calls or return our messages.

As you might imagine, the very tight community of Second Amendment supporters has posted this story on Facebook pages and various pro-gun websites. TheBlaze reached out to Mr. Moore in hopes of confirming all of the details he shared as well as asking why he thinks DYFS was called, and where the story stands now.

Moore has not spoken with us, but as mentioned we talked with his attorney and he has answered a few of our questions via e-mail. Late Monday night he wrote to TheBlaze saying, “I have dyfs still insisting to see the inside of my safe.”

Does the DYFS have a right to look inside Moore’s safe? Can they demand that he show his firearms to them? The agency and local law enforcement may be looking to see if Moore violated New Jersey’s Code of Criminal Justice, specifically, 2C:58-6.1 Possession of firearms by minors; exceptions.

b.No person under the age of 18 years shall possess, carry, fire or use a firearm except as provided under paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this subsection; and, unless authorized in connection with the performance of official duties under the provisions of N.J.S.2C:39-6, no person under the age of 21 years shall possess, carry, fire or use a handgunexcept under the following circumstances: (1)In the actual presence or under the direct supervision of his father, mother or guardian, or some other person who holds a permit to carry a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card, as the case may be; or (2)For the purpose of military drill under the auspices of a legally recognized military organization and under competent supervision; or (3)For the purpose of competition or target practice in and upon a firing range approved by the governing body of the municipality in which the range is located or the National Rifle Association and which is under competent supervision at the time of such supervision or target practice or instruction and training at any location; or (4)For the purpose of hunting during the regularly designated hunting season, provided that he possesses a valid hunting license and has successfully completed a hunter’s safety course taught by a qualified instructor or conservation officer and possesses a certificate indicating the successful completion of such a course. c. A person who violates this section shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. For purposes of this section the fact that the act would not constitute a crime if committed by an adult shall not be deemed to prohibit or require waiver of family court jurisdiction pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-11 or to preclude a finding of delinquency under the “New Jersey Code of Juvenile Justice,” P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-20 et seq.), P.L.1982, c.79 (C.2A:4A-60 et seq.), P.L.1982, c.80 (C.2A:4A-76 et seq.) and P.L.1982, c.81 (C.2A:4A-70 et seq.).

TheBlaze reached out to DYFS to confirm Moore’s account of the incident. The local office that covered the Carneys Point, NJ, area where Shawn Moore and his family live, would not respond to any questions from us. In fact, after our call was transferred to a “supervisor” named Lynette we were directed to the Trenton offices. When we requested a correct spelling of Lynette’s last name, she started to spell it and then suddenly stopped, saying, “I’m not comfortable giving you my name.” When we asked for a phone number to the Trenton office, Lynette told us “Google it. Goodbye.”

Calls to the Trenton office of DYFS (now known as “The Division of Child Protection and Permanency”) have not yet been returned.

blaze134,blaze,['Erica Ritz'],2012-11-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/11/10/violence-tax-illinois-county-approves-new-25-fee-on-each-firearm-purchased,"Cook County in Illinois approved a slew of new taxes Friday, including an extra $1 tax on each packet of cigarettes sold, a $1,000 tax per year on certain slot machines, a 1.2% tax on items costing more than $3,500 purchased outside the county, and a $25 tax on each firearm sold in suburban gun shops, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

The hope is that the new taxes will chip away at the roughly $240 million budget deficit by raising roughly $40 million in new revenue, NBC Chicago adds.

The board approved the changes by a vote of 16-1, and though a number of local business owners are concerned the new taxes will push customers into neighboring counties, legislators appear pleased with their work.

“Of the three budgets we have worked on, this has been the easiest. It has come together very well in a very bipartisan spirit,” Commissioner John Fritchey told ABC Chicago.

Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle contributed: “This is a fiscally responsible budget that reflects the values and priorities of my administration. It makes key investments in our public health and public safety systems that will advance a regional health care model and further criminal justice reform.”

Though Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, it is also one of the most dangerous cities.

The proposal originally included a five-cent tax on each bullet, as well, but the nickel-a-bullet tax has been dropped for the time being.

For now, NBC Chicago explains how the $25 “violence tax” is being justified:

“Gun violence is a real problem for us,” she said. “It’s a problem for us in our criminal justice system and it’s a problem for us in our health care system, and I make no apologies for the proposal.” Preckwinkle said acute care for the average shooting victim cost taxpayers $52,000 because nearly 70 percent of the victims don’t have health insurance. The move follows a violent Chicago summer, when some weekends left multiple people killed and dozens others injured in shootings. The city’s murder rate is up 25 percent, and the Cook County Jail is near capacity with 9,000-plus inmates. [Emphasis added]

“I think it is a good thing, especially in this economy right now,” Cook County resident James Fabbrini weighed in.

Shaneen Allen, a single mother to two young boys, is a legal concealed carry permit holder. She reportedly obtained her permit to protect herself and her kids after she was robbed twice. Allen has no prior criminal record and everything about her gun and concealed carry permit is legal.

However, her nightmare began when she traveled to New Jersey from Philadelphia.

Allen was reportedly pulled over by a New Jersey cop for an “unsafe lane change” back in October 2013. Doing what she had been trained to do, the mother informed the officer that she is a concealed carry permit holder and armed at the time.

What she didn’t know was that her permit and firearm became instantly illegal once she crossed into New Jersey, a state with extremely strict gun laws. As TheBlaze previously reported, the mother was arrested and at first faced about 3 years in prison.

Allen reportedly appeared in court this week and, to many people’s surprise, the case wasn’t dismissed by the judge. In fact, she now reportedly faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for possession a concealed weapon and another potential 18 months for possession of hollow-point bullets — more than 11.5 years in total.

My9NJ.com reports that the prosecutor wouldn’t even allow Allen to accept a pretrial deal in order to avoid jail time. Instead, the prosecutor reportedly offered her a plea bargain that includes five years in prison with no option of parole for 3.5 years.

Evan Nappen, Allen’s attorney, told the website that “New Jersey’s gun law is as unforgiving as a prosecutor or judge wants to make it.”

“Either of those two, the judge or the prosecutor could have taken steps to relieve Shaneen from this situation, but it didn’t happen,” he added.

blaze136,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-05-07 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/05/07/guns-and-crime-what-the-statistics-really-say-and-how-theyre-interpreted-in-the-debate,"The reason the recent gun control debate is even occurring is because of crimes committed with firearms. There are those who believe that increased regulation on guns might prevent some crimes and fatalities. Others believe just the opposite — that fewer crimes, or at least fatalities, would result if more people were armed.

But what is the truth about the use of firearms in crimes? What types of crimes are they used to help commit? How often do fatalities result? How often are crimes prevented because of the presence a gun?

There is no shortage of data to answer these questions. But what this data says means different things to different people.

Take Burke Strunsky, the senior district attorney specializing in homicide cases in Riverside County, California. His perspective is, the more guns there are available, the more likely homicides and suicides are going to occur because of them.

“What we do know is we have more guns in circulation than ever before in our history. You know you look at that number compared to U.S. gun violence …it’s 20 times more than other advanced, industrial countries have,” Strunsky said. “To say that’s not related to the proliferation of guns, I think that’s just disingenuous.”

Then there’s the perspective of Steve Siebold, author of “Sex, Politics and Religion: How Delusional Thinking is Destroying America.”

“I don’t think violence will go away. That’s just delusional thinking,” Siebold said.

“A lot of stats go back and forth,” he continued later in a phone interview with TheBlaze. But, when it comes to guns, they are “a proven deterrent.”

The stats

Not only are the statistics interpreted to defend different conclusions, but there are a lot of different sources collecting the information related to firearm use in crimes.

Here’s a look at just a few:

Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey (2009):

22 percent of all violent crimes were committed by an offender wielding a weapon — gun, knife or other object.

8 percent involved a firearm.

28 percent of crimes committed using a firearm were robberies, 5 percent were “simple/aggravated assault” and less than 0.5 percent were rapes or aggravated assaults. To compare, 8 percent of sexual crimes committed with a weapon used knives. In simple/aggravated assaults, knives had an equal percentage of use compared to firearms — 5 percent — and “other” weapons comprised 7 percent.

What does this survey say about firearms used in violent crimes historically? In 1992, handguns accounted for 13 percent of all violent crimes. This shows that between 1992 and 2009, the use of firearms to commit violent crimes dropped.

FBI Violent Crime in the United States (2011):

67.7 percent of all murders, 41.3 percent of robberies and 21.2 percent of aggravated assaults were conducted with guns.

More than 128,900 cases of robbery involved firearms, compared to 24,300 with knives and more than 27,000 with other weapons. More than 130,000 cases were “strong arms.”

More than 137,200 cases of aggravated assault involved firearms, while more than 126,800 involved knives, more than 222,100 involved “other ” weapons and more than 154,100 “hands, fists, feet, etc.”

Strunsky points out though that much of the data regarding guns and crime is based on voluntary reporting. To Strunsky, surveys have the potential to be limited by small sample sizes that are then expounded upon to make assumptions about trends representing the whole country. This is why he believes the most reliable numbers come from homicide data.

So here’s some homicide data from the FBI from the more than 12,600 murders that were committed in 2011:

67.8 percent of murders committed involved firearms.

72.5 percent of these were committed using a handgun.

Looking at the last four years of this data though, one can see that the number of murders caused by firearm use has dropped.

What about people defending themselves with a firearm resulting in a homicide on the part of the attacker?

The FBI reported 8,775 homicides as a result of firearms in 2010. Of these, 665 were reported as “justifiable homicides” — those where self-defence was enacted and resulted in the death of another — 387 by law enforcement and 278 by private citizens.

“Had they not had access to a gun, most murders, most suicides, would not have been a fatal incident,” Burke said, including that a life-time prison sentence might not be issue sans a firearm as well.

Then there is Siebold’s viewpoint.

“It is going to continue to be violent. In the mean time, at least give me the chance to protect my life,” he said.

The perspectives

Where do these stats bring us in the current gun control debate? Contrary to what many pro-Second Amendment advocates might think, Burke said, gun control is “not the first step to disarm the population.”

To Burke, stepping up gun control with background checks, like those that were shot down in the Senate recently, would have been “no more of an imposition than the TSA line.” He said he believes those seeing it as the first step to disarmament do not truly understand the Second Amendment.

“We just need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” he said.

“The ability of a criminal to get their hands on guns is directly related to the proliferation and number of guns we have,” Burke said. “Sure, they’ll get guns. Let’s not make it easy though.”

But Burke also acknowledged that many firearm owners never purchased the weapon with the intent of committing a crime.

“The reality is, most people don’t leave their house that morning and say I’m going to commit a murder,” he said, noting an argument or being under the influence of another substance are often escalating factors toward gun use.

Still, Burke said these situations, absent a gun in the first place, would be less likely to lead to a murder and a hefty prison sentence.

The gun control debate to Siebold is clouded by emotion.

Siebold said that because “the government can’t be there to protect us,” the right of the people to bear arms must be protected.

Burke acknowledges there are other measures to reduce violent crimes, at least homicides. He, like many others, think a more holistic approach needs to be taken. He said exposure to violence in childhood greatly increases the likelihood of someone committing a violent crime in their teenage or adult years."
blaze137,blaze,['Fred Lucas'],2014-02-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/17/blue-states-firearm-rule-is-so-onerous-it-restricts-self-defense-even-when-its-not-a-gun,"It’s probably not wholly surprising that Massachusetts, one of the bluest states in the country, has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation.

But what might come as a surprise is that the Bay State also strictly controls sales of pepper spray and mace.

Currently, a Massachusetts resident looking to buy pepper spray or mace must have a state-issued firearms identification card, the same as someone who is buying a gun.

But state legislators from both parties want to change that. At least five bills have been introduced to block some of the onerous red tape currently required, including the background checks and ID requirements.

Massachusetts is the only state in the country that imposes the firearms ID card restriction for the non-lethal, eye burning defense sprays, according to the Gun Owners Action League, an NRA affiliate in Massachusetts.

Democratic state Rep. Colleen Garry sponsored one of the bills, recalling a personal experience she had, the Fitchburg, Mass., Sentinel & Enterprise reported. She got a license, but didn’t think it’s necessary.

“I had a situation in my own life that I thought my family members were at risk,” she said. “I did not want to get a gun, but I wanted to be able to protect them.”

The newspaper reported that the string of bills comes amid other efforts to strengthen background checks for guns.

Another bill in the legislature, filed by Republican state Rep. Kimberly Ferguson has more than two dozen co-sponsors.

Thus far, there hasn’t been much vocal opposition to lifting the restrictions. However, according to the Gun Owners Action League, such legislation was introduced last year and the legislature continues to “drag their feet on legalizing pepper spray” this year.

The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association backs the idea of making mace and pepper spray easier to obtain.

Reports also say that the post Thanksgiving shopping extravaganza also spiked background checks for firearms to record numbers.

This year the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed 185,713 transactions the day after Thanksgiving, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer Jr. told NBC News. That breaks the FBI’s forecast of approximately 180,000 and the previous record of 185,345, an increase of .2 percent, set during last year’s Black Friday.

It should be noted that a background check does not necessarily mean a firearm was sold. Of course, this also doesn’t mean just one firearm was sold when the background check was completed either. With discounts on guns, it’s possible that multiples were purchased as gifts, as well as those sold to collectors attempting to take advantage of the deals.

An even more interesting tidbit of information comes from Kathy at the blog Pesky Truth, however.

The number breaks down to slightly more than two background checks per second, or enough firearms to arm each of the 182,000 active duty members of the United States Marine Corps. Semper Fi!

That’s right. It’s likely that in one day, Americans bought enough guns to match that of one of our most deadly branches in the military. This further lends to the idea that despite all the scare tactics, and misinformation by gun control enthusiasts, Americans are more concerned with defending and educating themselves about firearms than relying on authorities to do so."

In San Francisco, California, a shooting at a UPS facility left 4 dead, including the shooter. More were injured.

Cody Wilson of Ghost Gunner talked to Chris Salcedo today about abuse of Second Amendment rights, ways to enjoy them as a law abiding citizen, and historically how much easier it was exercise them on “The Chris Salcedo Show” today.

Wilson has created a technology that legally allows people to manufacture their own gun at home to protect themselves in these terrifying situations. It utilizes plug and play software for your computer that directs a machine to manufacture mil-spec parts for the AR-15 and AR-308. They will soon create technology to build common and popular handguns.

He explained that before the commercial regulation of guns, the government didn’t know who owned a gun, nor what kind of gun or how many. He said this information is “not their business, and it’s often inappropriate to insist that it is.”

blaze140,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2013-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/26/law-abiding-taxpaying-gun-owner-defends-ownership-of-ar-15-rifle-in-common-sense-filled-letter-to-the-editor,"Joe Minney, of Chillicothe, Ohio, is a self-described law-abiding, taxpaying American citizen who owns an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He selected the weapon for a number of reasons, including home defense, hunting and even pest control.

Unfortunately, he says many Americans get their “knowledge” about guns from “movies and TV shows.” This leaves many people uninformed and easily deceived amid the ongoing gun control debate. In a focused letter to the editor of the Chillicothe Gazette, Minney explains why he chose to purchase an AR-15, making the case for responsible gun owners.

“I am a law abiding, taxpaying citizen that selected an AR-15 rifle to own. I considered the activities I like to do with weapons and knowing my limited money I could spend, the AR-15 was the best choice,” he began.

Minney selected to use an AR-15 for home defense for the weapon’s quality design, accuracy and ease of use. Here he implements some common sense:

I selected the AR-15 as my Home Defense weapon. My rifle has a collapsible stock, in other words, I can shorten it up by about eight inches. This allows for greater maneuvering around my furniture and house in case I have an intruder. Unfortunately, most Americans gain their “knowledge” of weapons from movies and TV shows. The action hero or TV cop superstar fires one or two shots and the bad guy crumbles. This is not reality. Ask any combat veteran or police officer gunfight survivor. Better still, go online to YouTube and watch real life dash cam videos of law enforcement gunfights. Many times, the bad guy is shot multiple times before being stopped. Last year, a highly skilled and trained Columbus Police officer was attacked by a knife-wielding crazed man. The officer shot this guy seven times and still had to have multiple officers assist in subduing him. A famous picture of a mad man is in nearly every law enforcement textbook. It shows the body of a drug-crazed man who was shot 33 times with 9mm bullets by police officers. The complete story is the man walked two city blocks and climbed a flight of stairs before succumbing to his gunshot wounds. This is the real world! Recently, four gun-carrying people invaded a home in a high class neighborhood of Gahanna during the day time. All four participated in beating and robbing the home owners. If I, as a legal gun owner, faced this kind of threat, I would have to fire at least two or three shots per bad guy to stop the threat on my family. This is eight to [sic] bullets. Obviously, this exceeds both the seven and 10-round magazine capacity that others are promoting to legislate over [U.S.] law abiding citizens.

Minney explained that the AR-15 can actually use three different types of shells. He bought a 22-caliber conversation kit so he can use the rifle to go squirrel hunting. He said he prefers the .22 bullet at times because he eats what he kills.

He continued: “Using the .223-caliber or 5.56-mm shells I can assist farmers in controlling very costly pests on their farms. Groundhogs cause millions of dollars of damage each year throughout the country. Farmland and crops are heavily damaged from these rodents.”

[..]

“The airport in Columbus had to hire sharpshooters to solve their groundhog problem. It was reported that their runways, taxiways and buildings were being ruined by these burrowing, disease-carrying rodents. One can do a net search and find hundreds of news articles about the costly damage to golf courses, and local, state and federal highways and bridges. Groundhogs are very elusive and must be hunted from a distance. The sights on the AR-15 provide for these 100 to 200-yard shots.”

Additionally, Minney said he uses his AR-15 to help control the coyote population in his area, which are at “epidemic condition” in many states.

“These predators have invaded city and urban areas. The news media in all areas have reported dog and cat owners that have had their family pets attacked and killed by coyotes,” he added. “Shockingly, there have been people attacked and killed by coyotes in the U.S. and Canada in recent years.”

Finally, he said one of his hobbies is “target practicing in safe areas.”

“By using the 22 caliber shell at three cents per piece I can shoot many times for a relative low cost. Then, I can convert the rifle over and fire a few 5.56mm shells at 46 cents per piece to practice my accuracy,” he wrote.

“These are the main five reasons I selected to own an AR-15 rifle. I share this because I want to assist in finding true and workable solutions to the gun violence. I would welcome open dialogue in discussing gun ownership and the expectation of a safe society,” the gun owner concluded.

Police in Medford, Ore., say the incident occurred at around 11:30 p.m. on Sunday. Officers responded to an apartment complex in the area after receiving a disturbance call. During their investigation, cops heard a gun shot and a man running away toward the complex’s parking lot.

Authorities say 40-year-old Jonathon Kinsella, a wanted felon, was attempting to flee the scene when he was arrested on outstanding warrants, including for burglary and assault.

Military veteran Corey Thompson, 36, told KDRV-TV that the wanted felon was trying to beak into his home via the back door. Defending his property, Thompson said he warned the criminal that he was armed and he was giving him his one and only warning shot.

“This is the end result. You break into someone’s house, there’s consequences,” Thompson said.

Wielding his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, the veteran made good on his threat and fired one warning shot. The bullet did not strike the suspect or anyone else.

“When I’m dealt with a stressful situation, being a veteran from Iraq and the Afghanistan war, it’s natural. I just jump into combat mode. I told him, ‘I’m going to give you a warning shot’,” Thompson explained.

However, police later determined he wasn’t justified in firing his weapon. Medford Police Lt. Mike Budreau said “there was nothing that the suspect was doing that was aggressive enough to justify the shooting.”

Apparently, for police in Medford, a wanted felon trying to break into a law-abiding citizen’s home isn’t enough to justify a warning shot.

Thompson was charged with unlawful use of a weapon, menacing and reckless endangering. The veteran’s AR-15 was seized by police because they claim it was used in the commission of a crime.

Thompson said he doesn’t agree with the police’s decision in this case.

“I can see where they’re coming from, with those kinds of ordinances and stuff. I understand yes, I did discharge my weapon but I was careful not to fire it at any body’s residence. It was at the ground specifically,” he added.

Attempts by TheBlaze to contact Thompson were unsuccessful.

Up until this week, Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms published the name of the winner of its AR-15 giveaway Facebook campaign, but it is now revising its policy after one such winner said they were being harassed to the point where they had to shut down their Facebook page.

“So here is something that really pisses us off. Our winner of the [AR] package called us about five minutes ago to tell us this. ‘Thanks for what you guys are doing. Over the past few days people have been harassing me and my family on Facebook. I am closing my account because of this.’ That are not his exact words as he was swearing up and down about the liberal media and how they won’t leave him alone.

We might reconsider how we announce winners from now on. We want to keep your privacy as much as you do,” the firearms store wrote on its Facebook page Thursday.

In another post shortly thereafter, the business wrote that it would be allowing contest winners to have the choice of whether they would want their name publicly announced or not.

Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms has been receiving local attention for its contest and more recently is making national news. In a radio interview with 1020 KDKA the owner, Eric Lowry, said the giveaway was conceived to drive up business, which it did along with the concern some have over gun regulations. Within 12 hours two days after the December shooting, Lowry said on the radio his store sold out of 95 percent of its inventory. He had to call in friends to help with background checks for those wishing to purchase firearms.

The radio host asked why anyone needs that type of a weapon?

“The number one thing is that it’s your right. It’s your right to own a firearm no matter what type of firearm it is,” Lowry said on the show. “It’s clearly stated that the right to bear arms will not be infringed […] I don’t think it extends out to tanks and nuclear weapons like a lot of of people are suggesting, but citizens should be armed well enough to defend themselves against a tyrannical government, in which case they should be able to own the same exact firearms that any type of military soldier should be able to own.”

A recent letter signed by 1,100 green berets for the protection of the Second Amendment supported the same sentiment Lowry and others have regarding firearm ownership.

The Huffington Post reported Lowry saying that the contest was not meant to be a form of protest against President Barack Obama’s proposed gun control laws. He added that his store will do another giveaway soon when things quiet down.

TheBlaze contacted Lowry and will be speaking with him. Stay tuned for more information from Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms’ owner."

Following up on his 14-minute video, Campbell is back for a second installment. This time, he addresses claims that “weapons of war have no place on our streets” — a common claim coming from gun control proponents in favor of banning certain semi-automatic rifles like the popular AR-15.

The video opens with text explaining that this quote is faulty, mainly because it ignores the fact that all guns were initially designed for war. If true and applied across the board, it would render all firearms illegal.

After the clip addresses this issue, Campbell asks a question that’s been frequently posed since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting: What is an assault rifle?

The sheriff then lists the similarities between Mini-14s and AR-15s, noting that the two really only differ in terms of their cosmetic differences. Yet legislation that’s been advanced and proposed has taken aim at the latter and not the former.

Once again, Campbell went on to test out different magazine sizes to show that there is a very minuscule impact on the number of seconds that it takes to simply reload smaller-sized magazines. His point? Cracking down on higher-capacity units will do little in terms of opening up larger windows of time between shots being fired.

Using volunteers named Jim and Christy, he showed viewers how these policies and restrictions would look in practical terms.

“Jim firing one thirty round magazine was 17.11 seconds, three 10 round magazines was 18.55 seconds,” Campbell said. “Christy’s time on the 30-round magazine was 17.25 seconds and with the three 10-round magazines was 25.31 seconds.”

Clearly, there were relatively short windows of time when these individuals changed magazines.

Watch this and plenty more in the clip, below:

In a previous interview with TheBlaze, Campbell made his views about capping high-capacity magazines known (i.e. he’s not a fan).

“By limiting the access to standard magazines…I think you are restricting a good American’s opportunity to protect himself and his family,” the sheriff said.

blaze145,blaze,['Jonathon M. Seidl'],2014-02-09 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/09/blaze-review-drd-tactical-ar-15-rifle,"You know those days when you’re working hard, 12-hour days seem like a break, and you start forgetting simple things like the name of your kids when you’re yelling at them to stop throwing the pizza slice across the room (Jeremy-Jess-Jenny-Josh-Jonny stop!)? This fall I had the opposite of one of those days. I spent a quiet morning at the range siting in my hunting rifle (a 7mm magnum, if you’d like to know).

I figured that was as good a time as any to try out the AR-15 the team over at DRD Tactical sent me to review. How’d it do? It is what made the day so enjoyable.(My 7mm mag groupings, on the other hand, didn’t.)

But let me take a different approach to reviewing this item. Instead of pretending I’m a seasoned gun reviewer, let me assess it as if I’m a new AR-15 buyer; like I’ve never owned one and as if I’m a regular guy from the Midwest who doesn’t have an arsenal of 23 different ARs and I’m looking to buy one and only one and not waste my money.

Wait, that’s all true of me — so this should work fine.

I was sent the company’s CDR-15-556, or in other words, their AR-15 model chambered in .556 NATO. Let’s start by breaking it down into: first impressions, feel, ease of use, accuracy, price.

First Impressions

When you receive your rifle, it comes in a lockable, heavy-duty, custom foam box. Instead of being rectangular, it’s square. That’s because the company’s major selling point is that the gun is made to be assembled and disassembled very quickly. That’s perfect for the military cliental it caters to, but it’s also nice for overall transport and concealment.

But if you’re expecting anything beyond the rifle when you first buy, don’t. It comes with one 30-round magazine. That’s not a knock — when you buy a hunting rifle it’s not like the manufacturer automatically gives you a scope.

The website picture shows slots for a foregrip, silencer, and extra magazines. Mine, however, did not come with foregrip slot, which means I have to take that off when I want to store it in the case. Others who have received DRD rifled told me they got extra rails to attach to theirs so they can buy and attach extra accessories such as a light and foregrip. When I didn’t, I simply called the company and they sent me some. A very harmless process.

The rifle has a matte finish and comes well-oiled. For someone like me that cleans his gun after EVERY use, that’s a big plus. You definitely get the sense that you’re looking at something well-made when you open the case. But that said, the instructions that come with the gun are on regular computer paper and stapled in the corner. Some may view that as a little cheap. But that’s actually a plus for me: it makes it feel more like a custom rifle from a small manufacturer that really takes the time with each weapon instead of a large conglomerate pumping out a rifle a minute.

Overall first impression? I like it.

Feel

My first thought when picking up the rifle was, “Wow, this is heavy. I can’t imagine being a soldier and carrying this around all day.” But I also haven’t handled many ARs in my life and I certainly haven’t carried any military rifles around all day. So I could see a Navy SEAL coming to me and saying, “Jon, you have no idea, this is actually light!” And I would tip my cap. This type of weight may just be standard, as well as another reminder of why I could never pretend to be cut out for the service of some of our country’s greatest heroes.

That said, it was heavy enough (about nine pounds with a full magazine and accesories) that it made me buy a foregrip. I couldn’t imagine holding it up for any period of time without one. I bought a cheap one off of Amazon for about $8 and it was worth it.

The rifle comes standard with a Magpul pistol grip. I have small hands and so it fits me perfect. I’ve heard of others swapping it out, but it’s more than fine for me.

There’s also a telescoping butt that can lock in place. I can’t say how wonderful this is, especially since I had my wife handle the rifle a little bit to get her thoughts. She was able to instantly fit the rifle to her “size.” Still, the rifle’s weight did get to her. But that weight has a great side effect: the gun kicks like a fetal mule, which is to say not at all.

Ease of use

One of the selling points of DRD rifles is that they are easy to assemble, easy to disassemble, and easy to morph into other calibers. This is true. While I initially had trouble putting the rifle together when I first got it out of the box, I know that was because of my lack of familiarity with ARs and breakdown rifles in general. After the second time, it started to become muscle memory.

A video on YouTube demonstrates how easy it is to assemble and shoot:

However, it’s worth noting that since the rifle doesn’t come with any optics or steel sights, taking it out of the box and immediately firing is not quite possible. That’s not a knock — it’s just reality. I bought a red dot/green dot sight off Amazon that came within a couple days. I guess technically you could fire the rifle right out of the box and do more of a bore sighting, but that’s not as much fun!

Accuracy

Sighting in the rifle was my chance to see how the gun performed. And did it ever. Even though my first groupings were well left, they were still good groupings at about 30 yards. As I dialed-in the optics, the gun’s accuracy became apparent, as you can see in the target below:

As mentioned earlier, the gun barely kicks, making it easier to stay on target throughout multi-round shot groupings. My only trouble was with the gases that seeped back into my eyes. But again, I chalk that up to a normal occurrence that I’m just not used to because I don’t shoot ARs often.

Price

Now we get to one of the most important parts. And there’s no way to sugar coat this: the rifle retails for $2,091.00. That may be steep for a lot of people. But you could also say that this could be the only AR-15 you ever buy, and just like a good shotgun, investing in a good AR-15 can be a cost that produces a firearm that you keep a lifetime.

Bottom Line

The DRD CDR-15-556 is a top-of-the line rifle that shoots great, is built well, Sure, it’s a little pricey. But considering that the DRD concept is that you can buy other components and switch them out, thereby creating a new rifle of sorts, you may find it worth it.

I told you I wanted to review this as a regular “Jon” getting my first AR. With that in mind, I’d say this rifle is worth adding to your arsenal. And with the scarcity of ammo starting to dissipate, it can make for a lot of fun at the range.

blaze146,blaze,['Madeleine Morgenstern'],2013-09-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/09/17/cnn-ar-15-may-not-have-been-used-in-navy-yard-shooting-after-all,"The FBI said there is no indication that an AR-15 was used in the shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, despite wide initial reports that gunman Aaron Alexis was armed with one when he murdered 12 people Monday.

“At this time we believe that Mr. Alexis entered Building 197 at the Navy Yard with a shotgun. We do not have any information at this time that he had an AR-15 in his possession,” Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said at a news conference Tuesday. Officials said Alexis also took at least one handgun from a law officer.

The FBI’s confirmation came after CNN reported Tuesday morning that the initial reports that the shooter used an AR-15 may have been incorrect:

[F]ederal law enforcement sources told CNN Tuesday that authorities have recovered three weapons from the scene of the mass shooting, including one — a shotgun — that investigators believe Alexis brought in to the compound. The other two weapons, which sources say were handguns, may have been taken from guards at the Navy complex. The sources, who have detailed knowledge of the investigation, cautioned that initial information that an AR-15 was used in the shootings may have been incorrect. It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday morning’s shootings. Authorities are still investigating precisely how many weapons Alexis had access to and when.

The New York Daily News devoted its front page Tuesday to the supposed use of an AR-15, with the blaring headline “Same Gun Different Slay”:

Calls for bans on AR-15s skyrocketed after the mass slayings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut and an Aurora, Colo. movie theater last year. A new ban on “assault weapons” proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) specifically named AR-15-style rifles but was never brought up for a vote.

The Empire State’s Senate passed a bill, S.3199A, by a 54-5 vote margin Tuesday classifying a machete as a “deadly weapon,” making it a crime to possess one with the penalty of up to one year in prison.

Many of the legislation’s co-sponsors have long advocated the criminalization of machetes, and it will now head to the state Assembly, where the fate of the bill will be decided.

“Despite the obvious serious injury that can be caused by the use of a machete,” state Sen. Tony Avella (D) wrote in a memo, “such weapons have not been included in the penal law’s definition of ‘deadly weapon.'”

He went on to say it is “surprising” that the knife had not previously been marked as a “deadly weapon,” “given the common knowledge that machetes have often been used as weapons and are actually defined as such in Webster’s dictionary.”

A machete is defined as a “large, heavy knife that is used for cutting plants and as a weapon,” according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.

Should the bill become law, machetes will join a lot list of items classified as “deadly weapons,” including switchblades, daggers, metal or plastic knuckles, gravity and ballistic knives, billy clubs and blackjacks. Possession of any of these items is a misdemeanor and can result in as much as one year in jail.

The Senate’s passage of the legislation comes on the heels of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledging a drop in the city’s murders and shootings, but noting that slashings and stabbings are increasing.

According to Guns.com, the number of knife attacks in the Big Apple for the first quarter of 2016 increased by more than 20 percent to 899, up from 746 such attacks at the same time last year.

Similar legislation introduced last year by Avella after a fatal machete attack in Long Island, New York, failed to gain much traction due to multiple challenges.

Legal defense for possession charges requires the possessor to show they did not intend to use the weapon unlawfully, which can present some difficulties. For example, in 2015, an electrician in possession of what police determined a gravity knife won a $57,000 settlement when the court found the blade to be a utility knife used for work.

However, state leaders are determined to do something to curb the violent attacks occurring with knives.

“Stabbings and slashings aren’t going away,” NYC Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said at a press conference, adding that such crimes are a “reality” for those living in New York City.

Neither Bratton nor de Blasio have directly mentioned concerns over machetes.

One item in the memo that was not declassified though is just what weapon the National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 7 was allowed to load up on.

The Federation of American Scientists is bringing attention to this document called “Production of [Deleted] Weapons, 1981,” which was partially declassified in 2008, and even offers some speculation as to what would fit into the brackets.

The document itself states:

“The production and stockpiling of [deleted] weapons is authorized with stockpiling being restricted to the United States [deleted].”

Hans Kristensen with FAS is reported as speculating the redacted term is “enhanced radiation.” Why? Not only does FAS point out that two enhanced radiation weapons began production in 1981 — the W70 (Lance warhead) and the W79 (artillery shell) — but it also notes when former President George Bush declassified the title of the NSDD7 in 1996, “enhanced radiation weapons” was left unredacted.

If this stockpile does in fact indicate enhanced radiation weapons, what does this mean? This is another term for the weapon of mass destruction known as a neutron bomb. According to Global Security, a neutron bomb would have a total energy that was 30 percent blast, 20 percent thermal and 50 percent nuclear radiation. “Thus, a 3-kiloton ER weapon will produce the nuclear radiation of a 10-kiloton fission weapon and the blast and thermal radiation of a 1-kiloton fission device,” Global Security writes.

A study published by the National Institute of Health a couple years ago stated that the purpose of a neutron bomb, compared to other nuclear weapons, is to “enhance radiation casualties while reducing blast and thermal damage to the infrastructure.”

The study states that since the Cold War, there have been no threats for use of such a weapon. Still, given that five nations were reported to have developed enhanced radiation weapons at the time, the report recommends medical personnel know the difference in health implications compared to a fission weapon.

Here is a look at the one-page document:

Magazine stands. Restaurants. All these venues past airport security offer a wealth of options for “‘MacGyver-esque’ attackers” to develop weapons, as demonstrated by a security researcher.

“Can common items that are sold in airports after the security screening be used to build lethal weapons?” Terminal Cornucopia, a new YouTube channel, asks.

Researcher Evan “Treefort” Booth created a channel full of demonstrations answering this question with a resounding “yes.”

“As it turns out, even a marginally ‘MacGyver-esque’ attacker can breeze through terminal gift shops, restaurants, magazine stands and duty-free shops to find everything needed to wage war on an airplane,” the YouTube channel’s description read.

[blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/evanbooth/status/400745386295304192″]

These are the rules Booth follows for his project:

Only materials that can be sourced inside the terminal after the security screening can be used.

Only cash and a small, travel-approved multitool can be carried into the terminal.

Anything in the airport you’d get yelled at for taking or messing with is off limits.

How easy are these weapons to build with airport-only resources? Terminal Cornucopia’s demos can show you.

A spiked club made with magazines, tape, dental floss, a rolled up Constitution souvenir and pencil sharpener shaped like the Washington Monument:

A blowgun made with a double-walled, plastic Starbucks’ cup and straw, AR-Parrot Drone 2.0, Zippo lighters and tape:

A solid, pewter slug made from collectible spoons, tape and aluminum soda cans:

A break-action shotgun made from batteries, a magnetic refrigerator clip, hair dryer, hair band, dental floss, tape, magazines, Axe body spray, a condom, water aluminum cans and ammunition (a.k.a. Red Bull):

A fragmentation grenade made with a stainless steel coffee mug, AA battery, Axe body spray, condom, magazine, dental floss and water:

A crossbow made with a robot grabber toy, magazines, an umbrella, tape, dental floss, double-walled, plastic Starbucks’ cup and straw, and a luggage handle:

You might be wondering about the purpose of posting these videos. A natural question would be “what if terrorists see this?”

“That’s a great question. An even better question is: What if they already know all this?” Booth stated on the Terminal Cornucopia website. “All of these findings have been reported to the Department of Homeland Security (TSA) to help them better detect these types of threats. Furthermore, the next time you fly, you’ll be flying as a more informed consumer (and taxpayer, possibly) — one who is more equipped to demand better, more appropriate airport security.”

Also, in case you are wondering, Booth’s constructions and demonstrations were done in a lab, not an airport.

With this information, Booth offers some advice: “Don’t break the law. Don’t build weapons if you don’t know how to do it safely. Don’t be stupid.”

blaze150,blaze,"['Chris Enloe', 'Weekend Editor']",2015-12-07 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2015/12/07/supreme-court-turns-away-challenge-to-illinois-assault-weapon-ban,"WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) — The United States Supreme Court Monday decided not to take up a challenge to an Illinois “assault weapon” ban, a law that prevents certain residents in the state from buying a number of firearms and large-capacity magazines.

Two conservative justices said they would have heard the case and struck down the ban. The Illinois State Rifle Association, one of the plaintiffs, indicated that it would keep challenging local gun restrictions.

The court left in place a lower court ruling that found that local governments have leeway in deciding how to regulate firearms. The federal appeals court in Chicago had upheld the city of Highland Park’s 2013 law that bans several semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines.

In October, the federal appeals court in New York largely upheld similar laws in Connecticut and New York, among a handful of states that ban semi-automatic weapons.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly turned away challenges to gun restrictions since two landmark decisions that spelled out the right to a handgun to defend one’s own home.

Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Chicago appeals court ruling “flouts two of our Second Amendment precedents.” Without mentioning any mass shootings in California and elsewhere that involved semi-automatic guns, Thomas said the weapons ban “is highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes” by roughly 5 million Americans.

“The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting,” Thomas wrote.

The case had been under consideration at the high court for two months, but the delay in dealing with it now appears mainly due to waiting for Thomas to finish his opinion.

The appeal filed by Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argues that Highland Park has violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the United States, as well as ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds.

Richard Pearson, the director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, was disappointed the Supreme Court did not hear the case but said that his organization is still waiting for the conclusion of a state-court case challenging a similar ban in Illinois’ largest county, Cook County. He said the group will also keep looking for new plaintiffs in areas that have enacted assault-weapons prohibitions.

“We are not going to give up, and we’re not going to go away,” Pearson said.

Steven Elrod, an attorney who has represented Highland Park, did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press.

Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arises out of a decision by the federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois.

In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities around the state 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault weapons, or forfeit their right to do so.

Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association.

The city’s assault weapons ban was upheld by the appeals court in a 2-1 decision.

Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the court that there is a “substantial benefit” to the Highland Park ordinance if it makes the public feel less at risk from a mass shooting. Variations of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the guns specifically banned by Highland Park, were used in the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado.

The gun control laws that the appeals court in New York upheld in October were passed after the 2012 massacre in Newtown.

Seven states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning assault weapons. The others are California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. In addition, Minnesota and Virginia regulate assault weapons, the center said.

The case is Friedman v. Highland, 15-133."

Then Noah Collins, assistant principal at Stacy Middle School in Milford, wrote a conduct slip that listed Taylor’s actions — which included mouthing laser sounds — as a threat. With that, the fifth-grader was suspended for two days this week, WFXT-TV in Boston reported.

“I think this is very slanderous toward Nickolas and his character,” his father Brian Taylor told the Milford Daily News. “It was non-threatening. He’s just a typical boy with an imagination.”

Saying the suspension represents abuse of the rules and a “complete disconnect” between policy and reality, Taylor is withdrawing his son from the school and has filed paperwork to have him homeschooled, the Daily News reported.

The school’s position is that because students told staff they felt threatened by Taylor, he was dealt with more severely.

“It’s the difference between intent of the action and what the person feels receiving it,” Superintendent Robert Tremblay told the Daily News. “It’s just the same way you can’t yell fire in a crowded movie theater. There are things you can and can’t do.”

Taylor reportedly hadn’t undergone formal discipline beyond detentions for incomplete school work, although he’s been diagnosed with ADHD and sometimes was disciplined when hyperactivity made it hard for him to focus.

[sharequote align=”center”]“It’s just the same way you can’t yell fire in a crowded movie theater.”[/sharequote]

Tremblay added to the paper that there’s room for the school to be “not so caught up in the handbook,” which lists threats as punishable by detention, suspension or expulsion, based on their severity.

“It’s almost as if society has forced us into behaving a certain way and unfortunately, we’re the victims of circumstance,” Tremblay told the Daily News, adding that common gestures such as using a finger like a gun can’t be taken lightly anymore.

Nickolas’ grandfather had a different take.

“It’s totally ridiculous,” Rory O’Brien told WFXT, “it’s not right at all.”

Brian Taylor told the Daily News his son is “confused as to why he got suspended. He doesn’t realize he did something wrong.”

A video of the police officer was taken because a person receiving a citation was fighting for his right to film law enforcement. But the officer asked him for the phone saying they can be “converted into weapons.” The officer later explained more specifically that they can be “converted into firearms and Tasers.”

“Look it up online,” he challenged.

That’s just what we did. What we found was not so much conversions of cellphones into weapons but more weapons being disguised as cellphones.

Snopes, the Web resource that seeks to debunk misinformation, confirms that guns disguised as cellphones are a real threat. It reported spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms John D’Angelo saying disguising a firearms as something else is not a new idea.

“We’ve seen guns in the form of canes, pens, beepers,” D’Angelo said. “As technology progresses and becomes more prevalent, disguised weapons will change to mirror that.”

In our previous article regarding the San Diego cop’s comments, we included this video as an example:

Here’s a video showing a “beeper gun”:

The Daily Telegraph in 2008 reported Italian police finding a similarly concealed gun while raiding a group related to the mafia.

“This is the first time such a weapon has been seized and shows the sophistication that the crime syndicates are turning to,” a spokesperson for the police was reported saying at the time.

Stun guns seem to be far more prevalent in Internet searches than actual firearms.

Here’s the Guard Dog Cell Phone Stun Gun, a device that can deliver 2.7 million volts for about $45.

The MTW-095 “cellphone-shaped supervoltage” stun gun retails for about $17 but it only delivers 1.6 million volts.

The Home Security Superstore has 10 different stun guns that look like cellphones. There’s even the 3.8 million volt iStun, shaped to look like a iPhone.

Check out this video about the Guard Dog iStun:

In the fall of 2012, stun guns disguised as cellphones were found by screeners at the Newark airport in New Jersey and Washington, D.C.’s, Reagan National Airport.

Given the prevalence of weapons being disguised as cellphones, the San Diego police officer’s request to review the gun, which was refused by its owner leading to his arrest, seems to have some merit. But what we don’t know is if he was expressing genuine concern or using the idea as an excuse to be a bully."

Only 36 percent of Americans polled favor banning assault-style weapons, a drop from 44 percent in 2012 and 57 percent in 1996. Sixty-one percent of Americans now oppose an assault weapons ban, according to Gallup’s 2016 Crime poll, conducted Oct. 5-9. Gallup polled a random sample of 1,017 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older, in every state.

Beginning in 2006, more Americans opposed the ban than favored it — and opposition to the ban has been mostly increasing since then. Gallup starting asking about the assault weapons ban in 1996, two years after President Bill Clinton signed a federal assault weapons ban in 1994.

This year, 50 percent of Democrats and 25 percent of Republicans favor the ban.

It’s worth noting that support for the ban has fallen so dramatically among Democrats — since Democratic politicians are often the biggest legislative supporters of banning the weapons.

blaze154,blaze,"['Lt. Col. Jim Zumwalt', 'Ret.']",2016-09-30 12:00:56-04:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/islams-time-tested-weapon-testosterone,"The U.S. Department of Defense announced this month it will undertake an unusual study. It seeks to determine if boosting a warrior’s testosterone will translate into enhanced muscle and mental performance over extended periods of combat.

DOD need not waste its money. The answer is yes, evidenced by the fact we now are fighting our longest war against a testosterone-driven enemy.

Our warriors can attest to it. During the past 15 years, while concluding one war in Iraq, they have continuously had to fight another in Afghanistan—both wars against an enemy with a 1,400-year track record substantiating the answer.

To understand this, one first need understand how Prophet Muhammad enticed Muslim warriors to join Islam’s cause.

It all began in the 7th century after Muhammad experienced his Kodak moment with Archangel Gabriel—who became the conduit by which he and Allah supposedly communicated.

Muhammad definitely understood the male human psyche. He knew it was driven by desires of wealth, power and sex. As Allah “shared” various revelations with Muhammad, the Prophet gained followers by playing up all three vices. Unfortunately, these rewards came at the expense of non-believers. Among the three, importantly for most Muslims, undoubtedly, was libido.

Muhammad knew libido cut both ways. While it temporarily served to satisfy a male’s biological urges, its intimacy ran the risk of fostering a more familial relationship with a sexual partner. This, Muhammad feared, for it distracted the warrior from the ultimate sacrifice jihad might necessitate.

Muhammad could not allow a female’s allure to distract males from their role as warriors for Islam. The solution involved sought to prevent it while still satisfying the warrior’s testosteronic needs.

This demanded Muslim males not view Muslim women as equals. For this reason, women were made subservient to them. The wife’s obligation was to meet the husband’s sexual demands, as well as to field a future warrior army. To diffuse any one female’s allure, Allah allowed males multiple wives.

Undoubtedly, the rationale for multiple wives was a belief the more mares available in the husband’s marital stable, the less clingy he would become to one in particular. Enjoying each, husbands, unburdened by familial ties, were less likely to be distracted from their warrior role. This prompted Muhammad to equate Muslim wives to domestic animals. As the highly revered 13th century Islamic scholar al-Qurtubi noted, Muhammad’s teachings likened a woman “to a sheep—even a cow or a camel—for all are ridden.”

To further diminish the familial bond, Muslim warriors were empowered to satisfy their sexual needs in other ways. These too evolved to keep the warrior’s eyes upon the perpetual fight—still pursued today—for Islam’s global domination.

Islam prohibits premarital sex, but unmarried males were not to be denied their sexual satisfaction. Here, too, Islam made special provisions. Males were and are permitted to engage in “nikah mut’ah”—a temporary marriage for a limited time period.

While “mut’ah” means a contract between a man and a woman, the arrangement is clearly one allowing males to have sex while “on the go”, i.e., pre-occupied elsewhere imposing Islam upon others. And, since males are permitted multiple wives, such temporary marriages benefitted them as well.

While Muslim females lack equality with Muslim males, non-Muslim females fail to register on Islam’s totem pole of humanity. Captured non-Muslim women and children became sex slaves—a Muslim warrior’s spoils of war. As such, they were and are still used, abused and/or put up for sale—treated as chattel. Most recently, Islamic State has claimed this right as one handed down through the centuries.

And, as for those Muslim warriors slain trying to fulfill their Islamic duty, no pity party need be held. Here, too, the testosterone card was smartly played by Muhammad. Followers inspired to give their all on the battlefield were assured even greater sexual pleasures awaited them in Paradise.

Most religions focus on the afterlife’s spirituality; Islam does not. For Muslim warriors willing to die in furtherance of jihad, the focus overwhelmingly is on sensual pleasures. One need only listen to imams today assuring male flocks that, once in Paradise, “They will be busy tearing hymens” of virgins there. Interestingly, the Paradise Allah created provides its residents with the same material rewards they sought while in their earthly bodies.

Unsurprisingly, Islam’s Paradise caters primarily to men in what is best described as a heavenly brothel.

Earthly taboos against sex and alcohol no longer are enforced. Wine runs freely but is not intoxicating. Males enjoy sex with an endless supply of compliant, “eternal virgins” endowed with “large breasts…free from menstruation, menopause, urinal and other discharges, child bearing…” Such virgins seem to undergo a re-virginization process for, after intercourse, they return later, virgins once again.

Overwhelmed with virgins and sexual desire in Paradise, Muslim males need not worry about sexual performance—for Allah imbues them with the virility of a hundred men.

Interestingly, while Islam may ban homosexuality on earth, even that ban appears lifted in Paradise. Thus, the afterlife is made to appeal to Muslim warriors of all sexual persuasions.

Additionally, as few Muslim women are granted entry to Paradise, hen-pecked husbands (should any exist) need not worry about encountering wives.

Curiously unforeseen by “the Prophet” in his time, Muslim warriors today suffer consequences of the sex trade in which they engage. In those areas under Islamic State control, unprotected intercourse with sex slaves, exchanged among multiple partners, has sidelined many fighters due to an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases.

As one critic describes it, “Islam is Freudian libido unleashed…(it) glorifies the most naked, destructive passions of human nature…” Sadly, Muhammad successfully channeled this passion into a weapon of war that, for at least 1,400 years, has withstood the test of time.

Will a testosterone boost enhance a warrior’s battlefield performance? Muhammad has shown it does. This, unfortunately, has been demonstrated at tremendous cost to the non-Muslim world.

Well the joke is on America. Obama and his socialist cabal are in on the joke. Illegal aliens are in on the joke. The only ones left out are the rest of us- law-abiding American-born citizens and taxpayers. We are the joke. And everyone knows it…but us.

Do you see the picture above? It was taken yesterday by my friend- a U.S. border agent. He texted it to me- direct from the processing center. It shows an illegal alien he just caught wearing a shirt with his hero’s name on the back- OBAMA.

This is an every day occurrence my border agent friend tells me. Obama is the secret password that goes with the secret handshake. Obama is the secret sauce that guarantees entry to the U.S. Obama is the friend, hero, messiah and savior to every poverty stricken foreigner illegally sneaking over the border. Everyone, everywhere in the world knows this…but the American people. The joke is on us.

I am Barack Obama’s classmate at Columbia University, Class of ’83. We were taught a plan back then to collapse the U.S. economy and destroy this country. It was called “Cloward-Piven” (named after a husband and wife professor team at Columbia). The Cloward-Piven plan involved using spending, entitlements, debt and crisis after crisis to overwhelm the system, distract and overwhelm the citizens, and cause the collapse of America. At that point the people would be on their knees begging for big government to save them from drowning. They’d willingly accept a socialist Nanny State without argument or debate under duress.

People agree to all kinds of terrible things while their lives and survival hangs in the balance. Panic causes bad decision-making. That’s the key- panic and duress. With your job gone, income gone, or facing a massive 9-11-like terrorist attack, or devastating Ebola pandemic, the country is in a panic. “Cloward-Piven” counted on the citizenry making a very bad decision under duress- choosing the very group that destroyed your life (government) as your savior.

Don’t look now but it’s happening. America is crumbling- and it all comes back to the border and those illegal aliens celebrating Obama. This is no mistake. This is no coincidence. This is a plan.

Obama only has two years left to completely destroy America. He knows as of days from now he’ll probably be dealing with a Republican Senate, as well as an expanded GOP House. He knows there is a good chance he’ll face impeachment hearings. He knows that his presidency is effectively over as of November 4th- he will never pass another bill.

So things have to be accelerated. He must spend his last two years bypassing the Congress. He must find a way to collapse our economy without the need for any laws, bills or cooperation.

The answer is…THE BORDER.

Every single thing that could overwhelm the economy, incite panic and bring Americans to our knees emanates from the border. I call this triumvirate of disaster B.E.T.- Bankruptcy, Ebola and Terrorism. Those are the 3 wild cards that change everything…the 3 “Black Swans” that overwhelm the system…that have the potential to bring our economy down- just as Cloward-Piven intended.

The key is Congress is powerless to stop these tragic events from spiraling out of control. The wide open border is Obama’s “Cloward Piven” ticket to destroy America without any need for cooperation from Congress. This is the ultimate WMD- Weapon of Mass Destruction.

Anyone can walk across Obama’s wide open border. Thousands of illegal immigrants are walking across every day. This is fact. They are uneducated, desperately poor and speak no English. Obama assigns them lawyers with taxpayer money. We spend billions on legal fees and court appearances. They get myriad forms of handouts from taxpayers- food stamps, housing allowances, aid to dependent children, free meals at school, free education, free healthcare…and don’t forget prison and police costs for their crimes. This is the bankruptcy of America. This is how you overwhelm the system. This is how you bypass Congress. This is why illegals wear Obama shirts and shorts and sneakers.

But that’s only the start of what a wide open border brings to America. Terrorist cells from ISIS are free to walk across that border. One massive terrorist attack like 9-11, with our economy in such terrible shape at the moment, could overwhelm the economy and trigger the collapse of our country literally overnight. Isn’t that a fast-track to achieve Cloward-Piven’s dream?

Then there’s the third wild card that comes from an open border. Foreigners sick with Ebola are free to walk across that border. One single Ebola case costs over a million dollars. One. Can you imagine the cost of thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of Ebola cases? It’s unimaginable, unaffordable and unsustainable for the U.S. economy.

The government just announced a second case of Ebola in a healthcare worker this morning. But this is only the start. ISIS could be sending Ebola-infected victims over the border right now- to disperse throughout our communities and cause pandemic, panic and death.

Or an Ebola pandemic could explode in Mexico, Central and South America. Sick and frightened citizens of those countries could invade our border by the millions looking to escape the pandemic, or use the U.S. healthcare system to save themselves. Isn’t this Cloward-Piven’s dream?

Why would any sane leader leave our border wide open for attack, invasion, or pandemic? Only a madman would gamble with our lives…our children’s lives…and the entire American economy. Only a madman refuse to guard us against a possible WMD attack that could overwhelm the U.S. economy. Why would President Obama play “Russian Roulette” with the future of our country? Is he unstable? Or is this a purposeful plan?

Any American who isn’t blind can see something is very wrong. It’s time for patriots, political and military leaders to speak up. Our President is clearly reckless, irresponsible, incompetent, unstable, or evil. Regardless of the reason, for the sake of our families, and our physical and economic survival, it’s time to remove Obama from office.

Now…before it’s too late. Before he gets us all killed by a “Cloward Piven” Weapon of Mass Destruction.

It is possible that during the rally, Trump will announce a pardon of controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has been convicted of criminal contempt of court. It is also possible that Trump will announce an endorsement for one of the expected primary challengers to Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.

However, the day began with an ominous sign of the congressional Republican leadership’s growing public frustration with Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has chosen this day to send a not-very-subtle shot across Trump’s bow by releasing a brutal ad attacking Dr. Kelli Ward, who Trump recently praised as a possible primary challenger for Flake.

The background: Trump fires the first warning shots

Of all the things Trump has done to rankle Republican members of Congress, none has chafed the incumbency-obsessed Senate leadership worse than his public attacks on incumbent Republican senators such as Dean Heller (Nev.) and Flake.

Trump first raised eyebrows — and blood pressure readings — during an extraordinarily uncomfortable public exchange with Heller in July. Heller, who is up for re-election in swing state Nevada in 2018, had expressed public reticence over supporting the Better Care Reconciliation Act, a version of an Obamacare “repeal and replace” bill.

During a White House lunch with the GOP Senate caucus, Trump — who was seated next to Heller — predicted that Heller would get with the program because “he wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?” Already, a pro-Trump Super PAC had run attack ads against Heller, which were pulled after McConnell complained to the White House.

With Flake, Trump was even more explicit. Trump tweeted that he was glad that Flake was being subjected to a primary, and even offered an informal endorsement of sorts for one of his likely challengers, Dr. Kelli Ward:

Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017

What’s at stake in Arizona for Trump today

As Trump heads to Arizona, he is desperate for a change of subject after a tumultuous week that saw the departure of strategist Steve Bannon, widespread and bipartisan condemnation of the president’s response to Charlottesville, Virginia, and sagging approval numbers in the Midwestern states that carried him to victory.

Trump and his supporters clearly believe that a major source of trouble for Trump has been insufficient loyalty from Republicans on Capitol Hill, and he may wish to send a strong message by rewarding someone (Arpaio) who has shown him loyalty since the beginning of his campaign and attacking a Republican (Flake) who has been perceived as disloyal.

It cannot be a coincidence then, that McConnell chose this day to release this ad attacking “Chemtrail Kelli” — a moniker that was widely credited with torpedoing her failed 2016 primary challenge to Sen. John McCain.

Oh man. A McConnell-allied super PAC is out with an ad dubbing Flake challenger Kelli Ward ""Chemtrail Kelli"" https://t.co/kFXWGJIuy6 — Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) August 22, 2017

Senate Republicans are itching for a fight with Trump, and that’s bad news

McConnell’s ad is just the latest indication that Senate Republicans are not exactly cowering in fear of political reprisals from Trump and his most loyal supporters.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is also up for re-election in 2018 in a state that Donald Trump won by 21 points, and he publicly broadsided Trump last week without provocation, suggesting that Trump was unstable and incompetent.

Flake and Heller have likewise been defiant about Trump’s attacks, treating them as non-serious threats to their re-election chances.

Heller reportedly joked about the inefficacy of the Trump PAC’s ads to Trump’s face during a capitol luncheon, while Flake made the rounds on television this weekend to publicly declare himself unimpressed with Trump’s threats. The entire scene is already reminiscent of the nadir of George W. Bush’s presidency, when Republicans in Congress seemed actually eager to distance themselves from their Republican president during the 2006 and 2008 elections.

Bush accepted his status as political pariah with good grace and never sought public reprisal against Republicans who attacked him for the sake of their political careers.

Trump, on the other hand, is not George W. Bush. In fact, he is the polar opposite of Bush, at least in terms of temperament. Republicans who attempt to create distance from Trump can expect to find themselves on the receiving end of attempted retribution in spades.

However, this is where Trump’s anemic approval ratings do, in fact, matter to his agenda. Trump often dismisses these polls as irrelevant, and in a certain sense, they are. After all, Trump is going to be president for another 3 1/2 years regardless of what happens.

But in another sense, they matter quite a lot, because they are exactly what has emboldened red state Republicans who are up for re-election next year to defy him. Worse, not only are these red state Republicans willing to defy Trump, they actually seem to be itching for a public fight with him.

Democrats have already proven that they will not work with Trump on anything. Republicans only have an effective three-seat majority in the Senate. In order for Trump to accomplish literally anything on his agenda — including tax reform, infrastructure spending, or trade reform — he needs a totally unified Republican caucus behind him.

And it looks increasingly like any hopes for that are fading into the ether, perhaps forever."

Now, the school’s booster club has ousted the 74-year-old board member who stormed out on the court to confront the player for disrespecting the flag.

Jim Howard is a native of Garden City, Kansas, and has donated to the college for 32 years. He said he was voted out of his position as a Broncbuster Athletic Association board member after the confrontation.

When the player, Rasool Samir, came out of the locker room to shoot around while the national anthem played, Howard entered the court after the song to chastise Samir.

“I told him if you don’t respect the flag, get out of this gym. Get off the floor and get out of the gym and he proceeded to tell me he didn’t have to,” Howard told the Todd Starnes Show. “At least respect the people that paid for your scholarship to get you on this campus – like myself and everyone else in that gym.”

According to a letter written by Garden City Community College’s attorney, the school even considered filing battery, assault or disorderly conduct charges against Howard.

“Like I told campus police, [Samir] did not physically attack me. I did not physically attack him,” Howard said. “If we touched each other, that would have been — no penalty, no foul, incidental contact.”

Howard believes that Samir went out of his way to disrespect the anthem, because both teams were in the locker room as the song played, yet Samir came out during the song to shoot around.

“This was definitely an ‘in your face’ move,” Howard said. “He knew exactly what he was doing because he was waiting for it to happen.”

Howard told the Garden City Telegram that he regrets saying after the incident that he would stop supporting the college if Samir was allowed to continue as a student. Samir withdrew from the college after being removed from the basketball team."
blaze158,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-01-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/01/10/did-you-a-flu-shot-and-still-came-down-with-the-flu-heres-why,"You did your due diligence and received a flu vaccine this year. Congratulations, you’re one of the estimated 36 percent of people to have gotten the shot or nasal spray so far this flu season. So why are you feeling achy, exhausted, congested, feverish and generally lousy?

There are many factors at play here, including that the flu shot is no where close to 100 percent effective at preventing the virus.

“There are any number of reasons why people could have done all the right things and still get the flu,” Massachusetts’ head of the bureau of infectious diseases, Kevin Cranston, said, according to the Associated Press.

This season the flu is already considered “widespread” in nearly all states. Some cites, like Boston, have officially declared it a public health emergency. Boston has seen 700 confirmed cases of the flu, compared with 70 all of last season, with 18 flu-related deaths so far.

The CDC said the proportion of people visiting health care providers with flu-like symptoms climbed from 2.8 percent to 5.6 percent in four weeks. By contrast, the rate peaked at only 2.2 percent during the relatively mild 2011-12 flu season. The estimated rate of flu-related hospitalizations in the U.S. was 8.1 per 100,000 people, which is high for this time of year, according to Dr. Joe Bresee, chief of the epidemiology and prevention branch of the CDC’s influenza division.

Watch this report from CBS regarding Boston’s situation with the flu outbreak:

But why does it seem to be so virulent this year? The most popular strain identified this season is Type A influenza H3N2, which is historically associated with more serious illnesses. It is also among the strains covered by the flu vaccine.

But as Cranston said “no vaccine is 100 percent effective.” One reason is the lag time between vaccination and active immunity. A person who received a flu shot but comes in contact with the virus before the vaccine becomes effective — between 10 days and two weeks — they are still susceptible to becoming ill.

Recent studies have shown that the flu vaccine as a whole is only about 59 percent effective at preventing the illness. NRP pointed out that the vaccine appears to be less effective for the elderly, which is a population often highly encouraged to receive the shot in the first place.

Another reason someone might contract the flu even after receiving vaccination is if the strain they were infected with wasn’t included in the vaccine in the first place. Each year, virus experts select the strains most likely to cause illness that year to include in the flu shot. This year the World Health Organization recommended including the three following strains in vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere:

an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;

an A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus;

a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus (from the B/Yamagata lineage of viruses).

Even though the flu vaccine might have its flaws, the CDC says it’s still the most effective method at preventing the flu and recommends people receive it either in shot or nasal spray form. Whether or not you receive the vaccine, the CDC also points to a few other ways to prevent and/or stop the spread of the virus:

Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.

Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way.

Try to avoid close contact with sick people.

If you are sick with flu-like illness, CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. (Your fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.)

While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them.

The CDC said 18 children have died from the flu so far this season. While it doesn’t keep a tab of deaths overall from the flu, the CDC estimates that 24,000 Americans die each year.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."

It’s not just that Kelly launched a shot on his opponents’ goal that traveled a whopping 80 yards — and that went in before time expired.

It’s not just that Kelly performed his miracle before an awestruck home crowd on the Fourth of July.

It’s also what Kelly’s opposing goalie was doing — or more accurately, not doing — at the time of his long-distance bomb.

Atlanta goalie Adam Ghitelman, you might say, wasn’t exactly minding the net.

Instead, it appears he’d removed one of his protective gloves and was holding a water bottle in one hand and a stick in the other while Kelly’s shot was in the air. The ball is seen hurtling toward the Atlanta goal and flying past Ghitelman’s left side before he knew what happened.

Ghitelman seemed to react only after the ball rocketed past him —

— punctuated by him tossing down his water bottle and raising his arms in disbelief.

The announcers were stunned, too.

“I have never seen anything like that in my entire life,” one exclaimed.

Kelly’s goal gave Denver a 16-9 lead as the fourth quarter commenced, leading to its eventual 24-12 win over Atlanta."

LiveLeak user Grizzman uploaded a video showing viewers his set up and successful near-1.5 mile shot with a .338 Lapua Magnum rifle and a metal target.

“A few days ago I took out the 338 Lapua and attempted the 2,500-yard shot,” Grizzman said. “So I placed the target at 2,530 yards or 1.43 miles away, at that distance the bullet flight time is almost 4.5 seconds!”

Long-range rifle shots are ridiculously hard to execute, which is why military snipers are a rare breed with a carefully honed skill set.

But as sights and gadgets for measuring wind and distance have improved, odds of hitting far-off targets have increased as well.

“I went out early in the morning to beat the mirage, luckly [sic] there was very little wind around 3-4 mph coming from the left, I dialed 2.6 mils Left,” the shooter explained on LiveLeak. “I had to dialed the maximum elevation my scope (Nightforce NXS 5.5-22×56 MIL/MIL) had at 27.4 mils then held over 2.5 mils on the reticle to get me to 29.9 mils.”

Update 9:56 a.m. ET: Scalise’s office released a statement after he was shot in the hip Wednesday morning. The statement said the congressman is in “stable” condition and in “good spirits” as he spoke to his wife by phone on the way to a Washington, D.C., hospital.

Original story below:

“At least five people,” including Republican House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) and two Capitol Police officers, were shot early Wednesday morning at a congressional baseball practice outside Washington, D.C., according to multiple reports.

It happened near a YMCA in Alexandria, Virginia, just south of the nation’s Capitol, where multiple Republican members of Congress were practicing, CNN reported. Sources described the incident to CNN as a “deliberate attack.”

Images on social media showed at least one window near the scene with a bullet hole in it.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said the gunman was carrying “a large gauge rifle.” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told CNN that Capitol Police officers fired back at the shooter with pistols.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that if it were not for Capitol Police, “it would have been a massacre,” according to Fox News. Paul estimated there were at least 50 to 60 shots that rang out.

Fox News, CNN, and other outlets reported that Scalise was shot in the hip. Two Capitol Police officers were also shot. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said on air on CNN that “at least five” were injured, in total. The extent of the injuries was not immediately known.

Brooks said he took off his belt and used it as a tourniquet to control Scalise’s bleeding. The Capitol Police officer who was shot reportedly crawled to the outfield, where Scalise was lying on the ground, to check on him. Flake said Scalise was laying injured in the outfield “for at least 10 minutes.”

“We couldn’t get to him while there were shots,” Flake said.

Fox News reported that the gunman was shot and taken into custody at a nearby hospital. There were no immediate reporters of other shooters.

Scalise met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday. Following the shooting on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a statement, saying that the president and vice president are aware of the shooting.

Both @POTUS & @VP are aware of the developing situation in Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers are with all affected. — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) June 14, 2017

Trump tweeted that Scalise was “badly injured” but expressed confidence that he will “fully recover.”

Theunis Botha, 51, and the party he was leading stumbled upon a herd of breeding elephants, some of them pregnant, at the Good Luck Farm near Hwange National Park on Friday, the Independent reported.

Citing Netwerk24, an Afrikanns-language news site, News24 in South Africa reported that Botha shot at three female elephants that stampeded the hunters. A fourth female elephant then charged the group from the side and lifted Botha with her trunk, News24 said. After a member of Botha’s party fatally shot the fourth elephant, the animal fell on top of Botha and killed him, News24 said.

Botha is survived by his wife and five children, who received some sympathy on social media:

Another fellow detractor called Botha a “wanker” and said, “On behalf of all the unarmed wildlife in Zimbabwe ‘Good f***ing riddance.'”

Yet another wrote “may you and all your fans eat s**t … glad you’re dead.. (sic) scum.” An additional non-fan added, “Rot in hell, Theunis Botha, you flat piece of s**t.”

Botha reportedly traveled regularly to the U.S. in search of wealthy customers to take part in trophy hunting, the Independent reported. His Big Game Hounds Safaris company said Botha “perfected Leopard and Lion hunting safaris with hounds in Africa. He pioneered traditional European Style Driven Monteria hunts in South Africa.” A Monteira hunt involves dogs driving animals toward the hunters."

Amos, a retired Norfolk police officer, once shot and killed a 19-year-old black man. He received $3,000 per month while he was on leave. Kaepernick addressed such situations in a recent interview, saying: “The cops are getting paid leave for killing people. That’s not right.”

On August 29, Amos posted an open letter to Kaepernick on Facebook and argued they have more in common than the NFL star might think.

It’s recommended you read Amos’ open letter in its entirety below:

An Open Letter to Colin Kaepernick,

Dear Colin guess you have been pretty busy these last few days. For the record I don’t think any more or less of you for not standing for the National Anthem. Honestly, I never thought that much about you, or any professional athlete for that matter, to begin with. I’ve read your statement a few times and want you to know I am one of the reasons you are protesting. You see I am a retired police officer that had the misfortune of having to shoot and kill a 19-year-old African American male. And just like you said, I was the recipient of about $3,000 a month while on leave which was a good thing because I had to support a wife and three children under 7-years-old for about 2 months with that money. Things were pretty tight because I couldn’t work part time. Every police officer I’ve ever known has worked part-time to help make ends meet.

You know Colin the more I think about it the more we seem to have in common. I really pushed myself in rehab to get back on the street, kind of like you do to get back on the field. You probably have had a broken bone or two and some muscle strains and deep bruising that needed a lot of work. I just had to bounce back from a gunshot wound to the chest and thigh. Good thing we both get paid when we are too banged up to “play”, huh? We both also know what it’s like to get blindsided. You by a 280- pound defensive end, ouch! Me, by a couple of rounds fired from a gun about 2 feet away, into my chest and thigh. We also both make our living wearing uniforms, right? You have probably ruined a jersey or two on the field of play. I still have my blood stained shirt that my partner and paramedics literally ripped off my back that cold night in January. Fortunately, like you I was given a new one. Speaking of paramedics aren’t you glad the second we get hurt trainers and doctors are standing by waiting to rush onto the field to scoop us up. I’m thankful they get to you in seconds. It only took them about 10 minutes to get to me. By the grace of God, the artery in my thigh didn’t rupture or else 10 minutes would have been about 9 minutes too late. We also have both experienced the hate and disgust others have just because of those uniforms we wear. I sure am glad for your sake that the folks who wear my uniform are on hand to escort you and those folks that wear your uniform into stadiums in places like Seattle!

I guess that’s where the similarities end Colin. You entertain for a living, I and almost 800,000 others across this country serve and protect. Are there some bad apples within my profession? Absolutely and they need to be identified and fired or arrested! But you know what, the vast majority do the right thing, the right way, for the right reason. Did I mention that seconds before I was shot, an elderly African American gentleman walking down the sidewalk, turned to my partner and I as we rode past and said, “Get them.” Get who you ask? The thugs terrorizing an otherwise good and decent neighborhood, home to dozens of good, decent African American families trying to raise those families in communities not protected by gates and security guards. No these folks and families depend on America’s Law Enforcement Officers.

Colin I have buried 7 friends, killed in the line of duty and three others who have committed suicide. I have attended more funerals than I care to remember of neighboring departments who have lost officers in the line of duty, during my career. Law Enforcement Officers with different backgrounds, upbringings, and experiences united by their willingness to answer the call to protect and serve their fellow citizens.

Colin I am sorry for the endorsement deals you may lose and the dip in jersey sales, but please know you will NEVER lose what these men and women and their families have lost. And so whether you stand or sit during the National Anthem means very little to me. As for me and the men and women on whose team I was privileged to serve, we will put on our ballistic vests, badge, and gun, kiss our loved one’s goodbye, for some tragically for the last time, and out into a shift of uncertainty we will go. We will continue to protect and continue to serve and we will be standing at attention Colin, not just for the playing of our National Anthem, but far more importantly for the playing of Taps.

blaze164,blaze,['Carly Hoilman'],2016-06-11 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/06/11/former-the-voice-star-fatally-shot-after-concert-singers-brother-detains-gunman-police-say,"ORLANDO, Fla. (TheBlaze/AP) — A gunman who shot and killed a singer who rose to fame after appearing on “The Voice” traveled to Orlando from another Florida city specifically to attack her and then fatally shot himself, authorities said Saturday.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at a news conference that the suspect, identified as 27-year-old Kevin Loibl of St. Petersburg, Florida, didn’t appear to know Christina Grimmie personally. Grimmie was shot to death after giving a concert in Orlando on Friday night. She died early Saturday.

“She was doing a meet-and-greet, just signing autographs and selling merchandise. This white male approached her and opened fire, striking her,” Mina said. “We believe he came here to commit this crime.”

The 22-year-old singer from New Jersey finished third during season six of NBC’s “The Voice” in 2014, competing on the team of Maroon 5 star Adam Levine. She began amassing a following on YouTube as a teenager, gripping online viewers with her powerful renditions of hit songs. Her videos on YouTube have garnered millions of views.

In an earlier statement, police said Grimmie had performed with the band Before You Exit at The Plaza Live in Orlando. The concert ended around 10 p.m., and Grimmie was shot as she signed autographs for fans at a merchandise table in The Plaza Live concert venue.

Grimmie’s brother, Marcus, immediately tackled the gunman, who then shot and killed himself during the struggle, police said. They credited the singer’s brother with preventing the gunman from hurting others. Around 120 others were in The Plaza Live at the time.

“Very heroic actions by Marcus Grimmie to jump in and it definitely could have prevented further loss of life,” Mina said.

After the concert, 17-year-old Kaitlin Martin was standing with a group of other fans outside The Plaza Live, waiting for members of Before You Exit to come out, when she heard several loud “pops.”

“We thought at first they were balloons … but then security started running all over the place yelling at people to get out because someone has a gun and someone is shooting. Everyone is just running all over the place,” said Martin, who traveled to see to the concert from Brunswick, Georgia. “It was chaos.”

Martin said she was unsettled knowing the suspect had watched the concert in the same audience she was in.

“This person was in the crowd with us, and while we were singing, having a great time, he was there with different intentions,” she said.

Detectives were searching Loibl’s cellphone and social media accounts looking for clues as to a motive, Mina said, but they weren’t aware of any history of stalking of Grimmie by the suspect.

Loibl had on him two handguns, two loaded magazines and a hunting knife, Mina said.

There were unarmed security guards at The Plaza Live and they checked bags and purses for contraband, but there were no metal detectors or pat-downs of people as they entered The Plaza Live, he said.

A spokeswoman said all events at The Plaza Live had been suspended until further notice.

Loibl had made travel arrangement to come to Orlando alone, as well as travel arrangements to go back home, but he didn’t have a car, Mina said. The police chief wouldn’t elaborate further.

Grimmie had posted a video of herself shortly before the concert was scheduled to begin, encouraging fans to come see her perform.

Levine posted a photo of himself with Grimmie on Instagram, commenting before her death was confirmed: “I’m sad, shocked and confused. We love you so much Grimmie. We are all praying hard that you can pull through this … this just isn’t fair.”

NBC’s “The Voice” paid tribute to Grimmie on its official Twitter page: “There are no words. We lost a beautiful soul with an amazing voice.”

There are no words. We lost a beautiful soul with an amazing voice. Our hearts go out to the friends, fans and family of @TheRealGrimmie. — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) June 11, 2016

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2014 that Grimmie moved to Los Angeles in 2012 after joining Selena Gomez on tour to focus on her singing career.

“I’m done being surprised by cool things she does. She’s very talented and she’s worked incredibly hard – it’s a dangerous combination,” her brother told the newspaper at the time.

blaze165,blaze,['Buck Sexton'],2012-08-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/08/10/blaze-exclusive-check-out-the-paratus-308-clandestine-breakdown-special-ops-rifle-available-to-civilians-too,"The Blaze has been given a first look at an incredible special ops breakdown rifle that you haven’t seen anywhere else.

Consider this a special Firearms Friday treat:

It’s called the Paratus 16, and it is one of the most exciting new rifle designs we’ve seen in a long time.

Designed from the bottom up and built by DRD Tactical Arms, the Paratus was conceptualized from the start as a multi-purpose rifle specifically for Spec Ops/Covert Ops missions. It can also suit many diplomatic or executive security, military, air crews, law enforcement– and of course– home defense uses.

What DRD Tactical has come up with is a high-tech clandestine ops rifle that fits right in your backpack.

While it derives some of its basic concepts from the AR-15 family, the Paratus goes much further with an innovative new breakdown design. As DRD Tactical told the Blaze:

“We developed [Paratus 16] in 7.62NATO/.308 caliber, and the AR platform, being so popular, led us to stay with a direct gas operated system. There are 2 utility patent applications filed, one on the internal recoil system and the other on the quick take down barrel design. The internal recoil system eliminates the buffer tube, spring and buffer from a traditional AR15 design, hence allowing it to have a folding stock.”

For those of you who want to get right down into the nuts and bolts, here are all the weapon specifications:

CALIBER: .308/7.62x51mm

OPTIC MOUNTING RAIL: MIL-STD 1913 SIGHTS: Magpul MBUS Front & Rear

WEIGHT: 9.2 LBS

LENGTH: 38″ with stock unfolded

BARREL: Lothar-Walther Stainless Steel (LW50) 16” with 1 in 10 twist

MAGAZINE CAPACITY: 20 Rounds

BUTTSTOCK: Magpul Folding, Adjustable

SAFETY SELECTOR: Standard AR15 type

RIFLE FINISH: NiBore (NICKEL BORON) TRIGGER

GROUP: GEISSELE 2-STAGE

OPERATION: Direct Gas operated Semi-Automatic

While it has all the benefits of gas-operated rifles like the AR-15 and M4, it adds a high level of portability and can be fitted in many configurations. Much of this stems from the rifles original concept as a clandestine operations firearm, first and foremost.

To that end, the Paratus has a quick change barrel that you don’t need any tools to afix, which means switching out barrels in the field is no problem. One could also decide to carry multiple barrels of different lengths for various missions, like short barrels for Close Quarters Battle and long barrels for Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR) applications.

The whole Paratus package can fit in a small camera size hard case 16″x 10″ x 6″, or be placed in a Halliburton diplomatic attache case. There are also backpack and endless other civilian carry case options. You can see one standard carry configuration below:

So how fast can it be assembled from the case? Really fast. In fact, you can see for yourself in video of the Paratus going from breakdown to throwing rounds, courtesy of DRD Tactical:

Now some of you may be asking “Can I get one?”

The Paratus was created with the elite warfighter in mind, but it is now available to civilian gun owners too. As DRD Tactical put it to The Blaze: “Since we live in a free republic and our fellow citizens can own rifles we will be selling them to the commercial market as we work on demos with [government] personnel.”

He spent years wiring, welding and learning the high art of attention to detail in his craft. But for years he dreamed of a different line of work; he wanted to open up a company to build and sell reliable firearms. And in 2007, he and his wife Karen did just that.

“In my lifetime, we’ve gone from seeing people have large, nice walnut cases where they displayed their firearms; it was a status symbol,” Fuller, the president of Rifle Dynamics, told TheBlaze. “Nowadays people have to hide them in a locked case under the bed.”

Fuller has a passion for weapons, but he especially longs to see people learn to care for and develop a personal connection with their firearms. So in addition to teaching classes on rifle safety and familiarity in Las Vegas, he decided to offer classes where people can learn to build their own weapons.

“It is absolutely legal and possible to buy all the items you need to build your own rifle at home,” Fuller said. He’s right, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives states on its website, “per provisions of the Gun Control Act ( GCA ) of 1968, 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, an unlicensed individual may make a “firearm” as defined in the GCA for his own personal use, but not for sale or distribution.“

Granted, you could look it all up online, order the parts yourself and take on the task of building a rifle in your basement. But if you want to build an AK-47 that will actually operate safely and reliably, you may want to hire a professional.

“We specialize in the Kalishnakov, and I’ve been working with these weapons for more than 30 years,” Fuller said. “Some people can be intimidated by the idea of building their own weapon, but we carefully walk through the entire process and inspect everything.”

Fuller said he and Karen take careful steps to ensure everything is done legally and above board.

“It is a hefty process to get the permits to be able to distribute weapons,” he said. But they “really believe” in making sure gun owners have reliable products to use when needed.

But Fuller also said his dream job is about much more than just building operational firearms. It’s about honoring a nearly lost art form.

“These weapons are 1940s technology, and the the construction method for the AK was stamp sheet metal instead of milled parts … this is the right way to build it,” he said. “Over the years people have tried to build them different ways but it doesn’t really capture what the weapon is famous for, especially the reliability and work in nearly any environment, going nearly 300,000 rounds and still going strong.”

Fuller even developed a rear sight modification to the AK because so many people have complained that the sights were too small. He got creative and consulted with his optometrist — also an avid shooter — to developed the new sights.

“By widening the rear sight notch and rounding the corners it makes the eye naturally align with the sight notch, allowing a much improved sight picture,” the Rifle Dynamics site explains. “The meter marking and battle zero are still to spec, it’s a HUGE improvement using the stock sights.”

“To me it’s all about the Second Amendment,” the 58-year-old licensed gunsmith said.”This is an American tradition and we want to uphold that heritage and respect. We started this business out of our garage and grew it from there, and now all of our build classes are sold out for this year already.”

“This is my dream job,” Fuller said. “If I could have started doing this 30 years ago, I would have.”

Fuller said he meets amazing people in his line of work, especially special operators who often favor their hand-built AK-47s even to their military-issued weapons. “We know plenty of guys who switch over to their personal weapons when the fighting gets really tough, because they know they want them to work,” he said.

Rifle Dynamics hosts build classes in cities around the nation, and Fuller said they are already selling into classes for 2015.

The original clip of Tuesday’s incident was posted to Facebook where it’s been viewed more than 1.5 million times, WMAC said.

As marshals took Bobby Gibbs into custody, his uncle, Corterian Wright, told WMAC he began videotaping the arrest outside a Memphis apartment.

Suddenly, a marshal is seen on the video pointing a rifle at Wright.

When he and others asked why the rifle was being pointed, one of the marshals answered, “We ain’t gettin’ shot,” which the bystanders said was ridiculous.

“Go back in the house,” the marshal pointing the rifle said.

As the marshal moved toward the vehicle waiting to transport Gibbs, he activated the rifle’s light while continuing to point the weapon.

Toward the end of the clip, Wright told the marshal, “Your ass ain’t gonna be workin’ that long” — after which the marshal appeared to smile during a brief spoken reply.

Here’s a new posting of the clip via Facebook. (Content warning: Profanity):

This happened today in East Memphis Tn, they just took this po… This happened today in East Memphis Tn, they just took this post off Facebook so nobody could see it but ima keep posting it and y'all keep sharing it they locked my nephew up and was pointing the gun at me and his pregnant baby motherfor more info: http://bit.ly/1Wyjzvw Posted by But That's None Of My Business on Wednesday, September 30, 2015

In a statement to WMAC, the U.S. Marshals Service said members of the task force “were there to arrest a fugitive wanted for several violent felonies including aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. The fugitive was in an apartment which posed an unknown threat to task force members on the scene. As the fugitive emerged from the residence, he was taken into custody.”

“In accordance with USMS policy, task force members secured the scene until the fugitive was secure and transported. Once the fugitive was transported, task force members left the area,” the statement said.

Wright said the marshal who pointed his rifle at him should be reprimanded. “It was like 12 officers in all,” he told WMAC. “Out of 12, 11 were very professional.”

Wright added that he was concerned about a pregnant woman at the scene, Lafestia Keely.

“I was afraid for my life,” Keely told WMAC, adding, “Everyone had their hands up.”

“I know it’s proper procedures for them to make sure they’re secured and safe,” Wright added to the station, “but after they secured my nephew and put him in the car, you made a statement by keeping your gun pointed and you turned your light on me.”

Black Lives Matter activist Tami Sawyer told WMAC the move by the marshal was “pure intimidation.”

“When you were done messing with them, you turned your back on them,” Sawyer added. “He didn’t back up with the gun. He turned around and got in the car. So how afraid were you really?”

That’s not how former West Memphis Police Chief Bob Paudert sees it. Paudert — whose son Brandon, also an officer, was fatally shot during a traffic stop in 2010 — said the marshal’s reaction was correct, especially given the present anti-police climate.

“We’re being ambushed constantly around this country,” Paudert told WMAC. “They’ve got to take precautions. I think they did exactly what they should do so they could go home at night.”

Wright, however, wants something done.

“They’re going to wait until somebody’s killed and then take action?” he asked.

But it’s where this rifle range is located that has some adults asking questions.

It’s in a high school.

The brand-new North Atlanta (Ga.) High School, in fact, which opens for business Wednesday, according to WSB-TV.

While the range is for the school’s Junior Reserve Officer Training Corp as well as the rifle team, some parents want more information.

“I’ll probably question it a little bit just to get a better idea,” parent Donna Jones told WSB. “Like I said, I didn’t understand they were going to be doing that but I think they’re going to be very careful in protecting the students.”

While sponsoring a rifle range on school property may be eye-opening to some, it isn’t the only campus rifle range in Atlanta; it’s modeled after one already up and running at a neighboring school, WSB reported.

Others fully support having the range on school property. “It’s nothing that can hurt anybody and they will be supervised to the max,” said parent Cappy McAlpin to WSB. “Why not start now for those that want to do that?”

“If I see a kid walking around school with a weapon locked and loaded I would have concern,” parent Bobby Strozier said, adding that he believes the rifles will be safely locked away when not in use.

As it happens, “rifle” is a loose term in this case: The range is for compressed air-powered pellet rifles, WSB reported. The program will also have an instructor certified by the U.S. Army Cadet Command and the Georgia High School Athletic Association, according to Atlanta Public Schools.

In addition, once the range is safety certified, likely within 30 days, and students are allowed to use it, rifle team members will be equipped with the latest safety gear, WSB says.

“I can see why they would be concerned but I know they go through lots of training and they’re heavily supervised,” said senior Turner Hume.

Then she noticed a reflection in the lens of her glasses, WDTN-TV reported.

When she turned around she saw a male at the door, according to a Dayton police report, wearing a clown mask and holding a rifle.

Dressed also in a long-sleeved black shirt, black gloves and black jeans, police said the man told the resident to open her back door, which was locked.

Instead, she ran into her living room and saw two other men in her front yard, and the other man with the clown mask soon joined them.

Citing the police report about last Thursday’s incident, WDTN said the woman grabbed her “black revolver handgun” and walked out front where the man with clown mask pointed the rifle at her and attempted to load it.

Police said she told the man to drop the rifle — and when he didn’t comply, she fired a “warning shot” into the garage, the station said.

All the men in the yard took off running, WDTN reported.

The Kentucky Republican is facing a primary challenge from Tea Party candidate Matt Bevin, and is arguably in less-than-friendly territory at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

McConnell presented the rifle to retiring Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, saying, “This is for you.”"

C.J. Grisham, the decorated vet arrested last month after “rudely displaying” his rifle while on a hike with his 15-year-old son, was still without his firearms on Thursday. Police in Temple, Texas are holding onto his AR-15 (and .45.-cal. pistol) until his case is resolved, and as you know, the wildly popular rifles aren’t cheap to replace.

But on Friday, Black Rain Ordnance, a Missouri firearms company, graciously offered to give Grisham his choice of any AR-15 rifle at a significantly discounted price — free.

“When we heard about his situation, it was obvious that his rights were trampled on,” Charlie Spires, the gun company’s co-founder, told TheBlaze at the 2013 NRA Convention in Houston on Friday. “Then we hear that they basically confiscated his weapon and he can’t get it back — what can we do? That the was the next question we asked.”

Spires said there were some suggestions of “throwing some t-shirts at him,” but the company wanted to take it a step further. “Ultimately, if they’ve taken his rifle and we are a firearms manufacturer, why not give a rifle to him?”

“I’ve got goosebumps just thinking about it,” Grisham told TheBlaze after learning he would be getting a free rifle. “It’s completely unnecessary… I don’t even have words for it.”

By the way, here’s what someone who just learned he’s getting a free AR-15 looks like:

Spires confirmed that the Army vet can “flip through the catalog and pick whichever AR-15 he wants. So, Grisham made his way down to the company’s vendor booth on the convention floor and went shopping:

But ultimately, Grisham, who is certain he will get his firearms back and win his case, was leaning towards getting a “pink splash” AR-15 for his wife.

Grisham told TheBlaze that his case is awaiting a May 15 hearing, where his legal team will submit a motion for evidence. If the motion is successful, police will be forced to release dash cam footage from the arresting officer’s police cruiser. Grisham said the footage will verify everything he has revealed about the incident.

For all the details — and video — surrounding Grisham’s detainment and arrest, read TheBlaze’s previous report here.

Apparently not satisfied with just one random act of kindness, Black Rain Ordnance also offered a free AR-15 to Glenn Beck for covering Grisham’s story so closely and standing up for America’s gun rights.

So, Beck made his way to the NRA Convention floor and picked out his own rifle:

You can get your own AR-15 from Black Rain Ordnance here — you just will have to pay for it.

Take what hackers demonstrated in a Jeep Cherokee last week.

If having a vehicle hijacked electronically is frightening, how about a firearm?

TrackingPoint, a “precision guided firearm,” boasts that its Xact System is “the most accurate shooting system in the world.”

Perhaps, but not after security researchers like Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger infiltrated its system through a Wi-Fi connection and software flaws and found they could change its aim or disable it all together.

The hackers, who plan to present some of their findings at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas next week, demonstrated to Wired how they were able to “change variables in the scope’s calculations that make the rifle inexplicably miss its target, permanently disable the scope’s computer, or even prevent the gun from firing.”

“You can make it lie constantly to the user so they’ll always miss their shot,” Sandvik told Wired. “If the scope is bricked, you have a six to seven thousand dollar computer you can’t use on top of a rifle that you still have to aim yourself.”

Here’s how the hackers exploited the system, as reported by Wired:

But Sandvik and Auger found that they could use a chain of vulnerabilities in the rifle’s software to take control of those self-aiming functions. The first of these has to do with the Wi-Fi, which is off by default, but can be enabled so you can do things like stream a video of your shot to a laptop or iPad. When the Wi-Fi is on, the gun’s network has a default password that allows anyone within Wi-Fi range to connect to it. From there, a hacker can treat the gun as a server and access APIs to alter key variables in its targeting application. (The hacker pair were only able to find those changeable variables by dissecting one of their two rifles and using an eMMC reader to copy data from the computer’s flash storage with wires they clipped onto its circuit board pins.) […] Sandvik and Auger found that through the Wi-Fi connection, an attacker could also add themselves as a “root” user on the device, taking full control of its software, making permanent changes to its targeting variables, or deleting files to render the scope inoperable. If a user has set a PIN to limit other users’ access to the gun, that root attack can nonetheless gain full access and lock out the gun’s owner with a new PIN. The attacker can even disable the firing pin, a computer controlled solenoid, to prevent the gun from firing.

Watch the demo they gave Wired:

Fortunately, the security researchers found that they could not cause the gun to remote fire. The trigger still has to be pulled by the user for the firearm to shoot.

TrackingPoint Founder John McHale told Wired the company would be developing and issuing a software update as soon as possible in light of Sandvik and Auger’s exploit. The hackers though told Wired they’ve tried to get a response from TrackingPoint on what they’ve found for months.

McHale told the tech site he still stands behind the gun’s safety aspects as well.

“The shooter’s got to pull the rifle’s trigger, and the shooter is responsible for making sure it’s pointed in a safe direction,” he said.

He also added that the fact that this hack requires a Wi-Fi connection to exploit, makes it a more remote possibility that someone would infiltrate the firearm’s system for nefarious reasons.

“It’s highly unlikely when a hunter is on a ranch in Texas, or on the plains of the Serengeti in Africa, that there’s a Wi-Fi Internet connection,” McHale told Wired.

Sandvik and Auger warned that a hacker could mess with the gun’s system in a way that would continue even after the weapon is out of Wi-Fi range, Wired reported.

A couple of years ago when the rifle system became available, TrackingPoint reported sales were strong enough to have people on a wait list. Earlier this year though, Ars Technica pointed out that the company appeared to be experiencing financial trouble.

“Due to financial difficulty TrackingPoint will no longer be accepting orders,” a message on the company’s home page in May read, according to Ars Technica. It’s a message that no longer appears on the website.

McHale told Wired that TrackingPoint is currently “working through an internal restructuring.”"
blaze173,blaze,"['Aaron Colen', 'Staff Writer']",2017-12-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/13/michigan-police-point-gun-at-handcuff-11-year-old-in-search-for-stabbing-suspect,"A police search for a 40-year-old attempted murder suspect ended with an officer pointing a gun at and handcuffing an 11-year-old girl in Michigan last week, sparking condemnation from the police chief and mayor.

What happened?

Grand Rapids police officers were searching for Carrie Manning, who was suspected of stabbing her sister.

11-year-old Honestie Hodges, a niece of the suspect, walked out of the door of her aunt’s house with another aunt and her mother.

Officers had each of the women and the girl approach separately for detaining and questioning.

When Honestie was asked to approach, an officer had a gun pointed at her. As she came forward, the officer had her put her hands on her head, then turn around and walk backward toward him.

When she reached one of the officers, he ordered her to put her hands behind her back as he pulled out his handcuffs, and the girl began to scream.

The officer spoke to Honestie in a calm and reassuring voice during the encounter, but she became upset by what she likely perceived as her being arrested.

“You’re not going to jail or anything,” the officer said as the girl screamed.

‘It makes my stomach turn’

Grand Rapids Police Chief David Rahinsky condemned the officer’s actions, saying the video of the encounter made him sick.

“You listen to the 11-year-old’s response, it makes my stomach turn,” Rahinsky said. “It makes me physically nauseous.”

Rahinsky acknowledged that sometimes suspects try to conceal weapons by giving them to children, but also said he didn’t believe this was a situation where the child posed any danger.

Grand Rapids Mayor Rosalyn Bliss said that “no child in our community should experience that.”

“You should feel safe running to an officer,” Rahinsky said.

The child’s perspective

Honestie told Fox WXMI in Grand Rapids that she was confused by the situation.

“I didn’t know what was going on,” she said. “I didn’t do anything wrong. I’ve never got in trouble by the Grand Rapids police.

“I used to want to be a Grand Rapids police officer, but ever since that happened, I want nothing to do with them. Chief or not, I really don’t feel comfortable around any cops.”"

One suggestion made by officials? Use wooden sticks instead of guns.

What are the details?

KOVR-TV reported Monday that officials in Elk Grove shot down the historical society’s two-day Revolutionary War event and said that local gun laws were to blame.

According to KOVR, the re-enactment — which the society expected several thousand visitors to attend — was set to include “firing black powder muskets,” but officials told the group that using such props were against a local code that prohibits using, maintaining, possessing, firing, or discharging any firearms.

Jim Entrican, facilities manager for the group and president of Elk Grove’s Native Son of the Golden West, told KOVR, “There’s no firing guns in a park, but there’s exceptions for each one of the ordinances.”

Entrican added that exceptions have been made in previous years.

“They actually asked us if we can use wooden sticks, and can you see 12 men in full regalia and another 12 charging with wooden sticks saying ‘Bang bang!'” he said. “It just doesn’t have the same effect.”

Entrican said that the April event would have featured “encampments and all kind of entertainment for the kids to see,” and called the cancellation — ordered late last year by the park district — “very frustrating.”

“History is important, and we’re losing it,” he added.

Entrican says he plans to attempt to change the ordinance preventing the show from continuing as-is, but noted that it could take months. KOVR reported that the group is working along with the city and park district to collaborate on a solution prior to the group’s next event."
blaze175,blaze,"['Aaron Colen', 'Staff Writer']",2018-03-01 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/01/georgia-teacher-who-fired-gun-in-school-previously-tried-to-confess-to-involvement-in-murder-police,"A Georgia high school teacher barricaded himself in a classroom Wednesday and fired his gun through a window. Now, police say the teacher had multiple incidents of strange behavior, including an attempt to confess to a murder, according to WTVC-TV.

What’s the story?

Jesse Randal Davidson, a teacher at Dalton High School in Dalton, Georgia, wouldn’t let students into his classroom at about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.

When the principal tried to get in using his key, Davidson pushed it closed and kept him from entering.

At that point, Davidson fired his snub-nosed .38 revolver through a classroom window.

Police evacuated the hallway and convinced Davidson to surrender after about 45 minutes.

Davidson was charged with aggravated assault, carrying a weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, and disrupting a public school.

How did he get the gun in the classroom?

Dalton High School does not allow guns on campus, but a police spokesman said Davidson brought it in his computer case.

What’s the teacher’s background?

Davidson came to Dalton High School in 2004, and principal Steve Bartoo called him a “good teacher” who was named teacher of the year in 2012. He’s also the broadcaster for school football and basketball games.

Involved in a murder?

Davidson has had some troubling incidents over the past two years, according to police documents.

In March 2016, Davidson told police he’d had an internet affair with a woman named Jacqueline Enrique, who he said was his adopted son’s girlfriend.

Davidson said he broke the affair off after a few weeks, when he told his wife about it. He said Enrique was pregnant with twins at that time, and that she was physically abusive to the children after they were born.

Davidson then said he was approached by “two friends” who offered to “take care” of Enrique for him because of her abuse. Davidson agreed.

After the men returned, Davidson said he asked them if they had scared Enrique, and they replied that it was “worse than that,” which Davidson interpreted as murder.

Davidson did not give any details about the men, and police could not verify the existence of a Jacqueline Enrique. He said he was on several medications for depression and had just been discharged from the hospital. Davidson was taken to a local hospital because he said he was thinking about hurting himself.

The police report speculated that Davidson “may be delusional.”

Anything else?

In January 2017, Davidson was reported to police as missing from the school. He had reported to his wife and supervisor earlier that he wasn’t feeling well.

Davidson was later found by school staff members at a local intersection, sitting on the curb, conscious but unresponsive. He was taken to the hospital.

An email sent to Bartoo on Thursday afternoon asking about the school’s response to the aforementioned occurrences has not yet received a response. School officials were unable to be reached by phone because the school was closed Thursday as a result of the incident."
blaze176,blaze,['Breck Dumas'],2018-03-01 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/01/australia-holds-second-gun-amnesty-collects-nearly-60000-more-firearms-from-citizens,"The Australian government collected 57,324 firearms voluntarily handed in by its citizens after a publicly funded media campaign between July 1 and Sept. 30, 2017.

The country released a National Firearms Amnesty 2017 report on Wednesday, detailing the intentions and outcomes of the initiative. The report also included the results of a voluntary survey provided to participants, asking their reason for surrendering their firearms, the source of the firearms, and their reason for not surrendering their firearms previously.

Why now?

Australia’s latest amnesty program was prompted by the Martin Place Siege, which took place in Sydney in December 2014. Three people were killed and seventeen taken hostage when an immigrant who had been granted political asylum used an unregistered shotgun in an attack at a Sydney café.

The gunman had been released on bail, awaiting trial on sexual assault charges. The shotgun used in the slaying was illegally obtained, prompting an immediate investigation. A government review of the incident resulted in recommended measures with the intent of preventing future gun violence.

Ministers from each jurisdiction met to address the issue at a Law, Crime and Community Safety Council meeting in October 2016. They approved a nationwide firearms amnesty program to be conducted in 2017, with states and territories being held responsible for the administrative and operational costs. The purpose was to improve public safety by reducing the number of unregistered firearms in the country and allowed citizens to hand over their guns and other weaponry without fear of prosecution.

The report referred to an illicit firearms market in Australia, including “grey market” weapons that “should have been handed in or registered following the major firearms reforms in 1996, but were not.” It also notes that at its most recent amnesty, “the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimated there were more than 260,000 firearms in Australia’s illicit firearms market.”

What’s the background?

Thirty-five people were killed in 1996 during the Port Arthur Massacre, when a gunman, Martin Bryant, with a semi-automatic weapon fired into a café in Tasmania.

In response, the Australian government quickly moved to imposed significant gun control laws, leading to the eventual buyback and destruction of one third of the country’s privately held guns.

The 1996 buyback was met with fierce opposition from the countries’ shooters organizations, who argued that their members were not criminals, but Australians.

Prime Minister John Howard, who supported the gun amnesty program, said at the time that while the intent was not to smear law-abiding citizens, this was an occasion for the government to make a decision “in the interests of the overall national good.”"

Cuomo retweeted a headline from an article where a 20-year-old with an expired license claimed to be able to buy an AR-15 at a gun store.

But the story was inaccurate because the man didn’t buy the gun, he changed his mind before going through the background check.

“Two days after the worst mass shooting in American history,” he wrote, “and my local gun shop in Virginia showed no hesitation in selling me an AR-15.”

“In fact, they really wanted me to buy it,” he said. “And I was only there for five minutes.”

But later he admitted he didn’t buy the gun, and therefore didn’t go through the background check.

“After he walked me through the paperwork, all five pages of it, I told him I changed my mind and wanted to think more before I bought an AR-15. He told me it wasn’t a problem and listed the store hours if I wanted to come back. I then said thank you and walked back to my car.”

When Cuomo was accosted with these facts, he defended retweeting the false story.

“Isn’t the point that the kid’s age and lack of ID wasn’t a deterrent? and this isn’t all gun shops. Place I bought my shotgun basically goes farther than law requires and makes judgments about whom to sell to. Point is the system should be better,” he tweeted.

The point is that the kid lied about buying a gun that he didn’t, and that you are now lying too. — Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) February 21, 2018

“Lying? Look if you want to fight against background checks, make the case,” Cuomo responded. “Whether it is calling the kids actors or LYING about how no laws could stop the shootings…that is the bs to call out. 97% of people want better checks. Why fight that?”

“This isn’t a response,” Cooke replied. “This is a straw man that has nothing to do with what I said to you, and nothing to do with the topic at hand. You promoted somebody who lied, and then you lied about why you did it.”

“It’s also a non sequitur, @ChrisCuomo,” Cooke continued. “The debate at present is over whether to extend background checks to private sales, not over the existing FFL system that the kid you promoted would have gone through had he actually tried to buy a gun. As for the introduction of those . . .”

Some politicians have pondered whether to ban the sale of AR-15 rifles to those under the age of 21 after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting where 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz murdered 17 people with an AR-15."

What did Kimmel say?

Kimmel described the massacre during his show and segued into a call for gun control.

“I’ve been reading comments from people saying this is terrible but there’s nothing we can do about it, but I disagree with that intensely because, of course, there’s something we can do about it,” Kimmel said. “There are a lot of things we could do about it, but we don’t.”

He also addressed the Second Amendment and made a joke that the Founding Fathers “wanted us to have AK-47s” and said that the National Rifle Association not only controls the GOP, but runs the country as well.

“[GOP lawmakers] should be praying … for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country because it is, so crazy,” Kimmel ranted.

Kimmel later said, “Your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient.”

What was Shapiro’s response?

Shapiro in a Tuesday video addressed Kimmel’s Monday night monologue.

“Jimmy Kimmel should not be cheered for what he did,” Shapiro said. “Jimmy Kimmel should be asked to provide the evidence for his suppositions rather than the evidence for his emotions.”

Although Shapiro believed Kimmel’s sentiments to be sincere, “sincerity does not make what you’re saying smart.”

The conservative author noted that Kimmel’s statement about GOP lawmakers praying for forgiveness is nothing more than political rhetoric to further divide the country.

“Last night, he did a long shtick about gun control that was entirely based on emotion and it was really nasty,” Shapiro said. “It was really nasty. I don’t think it was nasty because he doesn’t care. He cares. It’s really nasty because he’s suggesting that you and I don’t care.”

He added that those who don’t agree with Kimmel’s “evidence-less suggestions about gun control” means that “we are bad people” and that “we don’t care.”

“You want to know why the country is not unified? It’s because of stuff like this,” Shapiro said.

He noted that division in the U.S. doesn’t stem from disagreeing on policy, but because certain groups within the country feel necessary to “impute bad motives to people who disagree.”

“Who’s Jimmy Kimmel to decide whether thoughts, your thoughts and your prayers, are insufficient?” Shapiro asked. “So, your thoughts and prayers are only sufficient if you do what Jimmy Kimmel wants you to do? That’s the way this works now? Who died and made him Jesus?”

Shapiro wasn’t finished there, however:"

What did he say?

The former Republican Speaker of the House appeared on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” Tuesday morning where he discussed his take on school safety after last week’s school shooting that took the lives of 17 people and injured many more in Parkland, Florida.

Gingrich said that an important step in ensuring the safety of America’s children is to arm those capable of defending the safety of those same children.

“I think the only long-term solution … depending on the size of the school, is a minimum of six to eight teachers and administrators who are trained in the use of firearms and have conceal carry permits and are prepared to defend the kids,” Gingrich continued.

“Every school in the country is supposed to be a gun-free zone. If gun control worked, how come it didn’t work?” he added.

Gingrich noted it’s important to be “realistic,” and indicated that there has to be a safety net in place to protect children in instances in which measures taken to ensure safety might be lacking.

“I think we have to be realistic: we’re not going to confiscate guns on a scale to make us a disarmed country, and the truth is sooner or later, somebody’s going to slip through the net because the civil liberties problem,” he explained. “If you go out and you pick up every person who’s a little weird, you are really infringing on the right of people to be free.”

The Claude ISD in West Texas implemented a program in 2016 where staffers were trained to carry concealed weapons and taught what to do if ever faced with an active shooter."
blaze181,blaze,['Becket Adams'],2014-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/03/03/gun-shop-battles-city-over-ar-15-sign-i-will-be-in-jail-or-dead-before-that-sign-comes-down,"A business owner in National City, Calif., claims politics are behind recent attempts by city officials to have him remove a storefront billboard featuring the silhouette of an AR-15-style rifle.

“The sign is not coming down. I will be in jail or dead before that sign comes down,” Dimitrios Karras, a former United States Marine and the CEO of Ares Armor, said in a recent interview with Guns.com.

Ares Armor is known in its community for specializing in do-it-yourself firearm projects and for opposing anti-Second Amendment groups. For example, the company actually registered the domain “SenatorFeinstein.com” so they could link their website to the notoriously anti-gun Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).

Trouble began for the former Marine in November when he had the sign on the National City store refaced. Just a few days after the work was done, the company learned second hand that a City Council member was reportedly unhappy with the sign, according to a statement on Ares’ website.

Later, on Jan. 18, Ares was issued a citation for having the sign refaced without the “necessary permits.”

The store owner contests the citation, arguing that in all the years that the building has existed, before and after his company moved in, city officials have never complained of signs on the property.

“The Local Government of National City thinks it is acceptable to re-interpret their own city code to suite their political agenda if a message appears that does not suite their liking,” Karras said in a statement on the company’s website.

“They have chosen to attack us based on opposing political views,” he added. “They have abused their elected positions in order to silence those who do not agree with them. We will not be removing our sign. I will go to jail first. If it’s a fight they want, it is a fight they shall have.”

For his part, Ron Morrison, Mayor of National City, argues that the citation has everything to do with the city’s ordinances and nothing to do with harassing a local business owner. The mayor explained in an interview with Guns.com that the city “revised their general plan in 1997 to ban rooftop signs.”

“Existing signs, like the one on the building that Ares Armor now occupies, were grandfathered, however in 2012 the city changed their ordinance for the grandfather to break if any building was taken over by a new tenant,” Guns.com notes, citing the mayor’s explanation. “Since Ares moved in at the end of 2013, the city contends that the sign is now illegal.”

Morrison is adamant that the city is merely trying to enforce regulations and that it’s not trying to make an example of of a pro-Second Amendment business.

“The sign had been up there for decades, that’s not an argument,” Morrison said.

“Our ordinance is content-neutral. It has nothing to do with the content of the sign. We told them they can take the exact same sign, the same graphics, and put it on the front of their building,” he said. “That’s what the whole issue is. This doesn’t have anything to do with the Second Amendment, or the First Amendment. They have every right to put that message on their building if they want to.”

But Karras, who has been chronicling the entire ordeal on his company’s website, isn’t buying this explanation.

“The appeal was railroaded and denied,” Karras told Guns.com.

“The city now wants us to spend a ridiculous amount of money in another appeal, but what we are looking at is to see if we can file in federal court before doing that because it is evident the decision is already made before we can get there,” he added. “It’s ludicrous the stuff they are trying to pull right now. They are sticking to their guns.”

blaze183,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2014-02-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/13/tens-of-thousands-of-connecticut-gun-owners-may-be-staging-a-massive-act-of-civil-disobedience,"On Jan. 1, 2014, tens of thousands of defiant gun owners seemingly made the choice not to register their semi-automatic rifles with the state of Connecticut as required by a hastily-passed gun control law. By possessing unregistered so-called “assault rifles,” they all technically became guilty of committing Class D felonies overnight.

Police had received 47,916 applications for “assault weapons certificates” and 21,000 incomplete applications as of Dec. 31, Lt. Paul Vance told The Courant.

At roughly 50,000 applications, officials estimate that as little as 15 percent of the covered semi-automatic rifles have actually been registered with the state. “No one has anything close to definitive figures, but the most conservative estimates place the number of unregistered assault weapons well above 50,000, and perhaps as high as 350,000,” the report states.

Needless to say, officials and some lawmakers are stunned.

Due to the new gun control bill passed in April, likely at least 20,000 individual people — possibly as many as 100,000 — are now in direct violation of the law for refusing to register their guns. As we noted above, that act is now a Class D Felony.

Mike Lawlor, “the state’s top official in criminal justice,” suggested maybe the firearms unit in Connecticut could “sent them a letter.” However, he said an aggressive push to prosecute gun owners in the state is not going to happen at this point.

Lawlor, the undersecretary for criminal justice policy in the state Office of Policy and Management, also suggested that the legislature should reopen the registration period to encourage more gun owners to register their firearms.

You may recall the viral photo of Connecticut gun owners waiting in line to register their guns in December, which one person said reminded them of the “Weimar Germany.”

Holy Crap. Looks like Weimar Germany @chipwoods @MaxCUA CT men waiting in line to register guns with the govt pic.twitter.com/L74YQxkICy — Legal Immigrant (@votermom) December 31, 2013

Republican state Sen. Tony Guglielmo told The Courant he recently spoke to a constituent at a meeting in Ashford, who informed him that some of his friends with semi-automatic rifles are intentionally taking a stand.

“He made the analogy to prohibition,” the lawmaker recalled. “I said, ‘You’re talking about civil disobedience, and he said ‘Yes.’”

Guglielmo said he really thought the “vast majority would register.”

Other officials think the low registration numbers are due to ignorance on behalf of gun owners who aren’t aware of the new law. It’s impossible to know the main reason why gun owners aren’t showing up to register their guns without hearing from them directly, though Guglielmo’s constituent indicates at least some are practicing “civil disobedience.”

“Sorting out the number of potential new felons is a guessing game. State police have not added up the total number of people who registered the 50,000 firearms, Vance said. So even if we knew the number of illegal guns in the state, we’d have a hard time knowing how many owners they had,” the report concludes."
blaze184,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2013-02-27 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/27/fact-check-sen-feinstein-claims-u-s-has-witnessed-an-increased-number-of-mass-shootings-during-gun-control-hearing,"Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) made her case in favor of gun control during a packed hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. The hearing was called to debate Feinstein’s proposed a ban on so-called “assault weapons.”

“Let me now describe the key features of our new legislation, the ‘Assault Weapons Ban of 2013,’” Feinstein said Wednesday. “The bill bans the sale, transfer, importation, and manufacturing of 157 specifically named semi-automatic assault weapons.”

She continued: “It also bans any other assault weapon, which is defined as a semi-automatic weapon that can accept a detachable magazine and has one military characteristic, such as a pistol grip, barrel shroud, or folding stock…These features were developed for military weapons to make them more effective and efficient at killing people in close-combat situations.”

Feinstein, with photos of Sandy Hook victims behind her, argued that the U.S. has “witnessed an increased number of these mass killings” and called semi-automatic “assault weapons” the one “common thread running through these mass shootings.” She says the gun ban is needed in order to prevent future tragedies.

“Sadly, [Newtown] is not an anomaly,” Feinstein said. “We have witnessed an increased number of these mass killings. The one common thread running through these mass shootings — from Aurora, Colorado, to Tucson, Arizona, to Blacksburg, Virginia — is that the gunman used a military-style semi-automatic assault weapon or a large capacity magazine to inflict unspeakable terror.”

But do the facts support Feinstein’s argument?

Let’s start with the claim that mass killings are on the rise in the United States. According to the Associated Press, those who study mass shootings say they are not becoming more common.

“There is no pattern, there is no increase,” says criminologist James Allen Fox of Boston’s Northeastern University, who has been studying the subject since the 1980s, spurred by a rash of mass shootings in post offices.

Grant Duwe, a criminologist with the Minnesota Department of Corrections who has written a history of mass murders in America, said that while mass shootings rose between the 1960s and the 1990s, they actually dropped in the 2000s. And mass killings actually reached their peak in 1929, according to his data. He estimates that there were 32 in the 1980s, 42 in the 1990s and 26 in the first decade of the century.

Chances of being killed in a mass shooting, he says, are probably no greater than being struck by lightning.

“Without minimizing the pain and suffering of the hundreds…who have been victimized in senseless attacks, the facts say clearly that [there] has been no increase in mass killings,” Fox wrote. When clusters of incidents occur close together, he added, that likely reflects a mixture of copycatting and coincidence.

Many anti-gun advocates have noted that six of the 12 deadliest shootings in U.S. history have occurred since 2007, with the Newtown massacre ranking second on that list. However, mass killings, in fact, peaked in 1929.

Feinstein also argued that banning so-called “assault weapons” would help decrease mass shootings.

A study by the University of Pennsylvania concluded that the old assault weapons ban was undermined because it is difficult to define what an “assault weapon” actually is and there were already so many in circulation. The study also concluded that the law appeared to have little effect on gun violence overall, most likely because rifles are used in a small percentage of gun crimes.

Consider this, hands and feet, knifes, shotguns, and handguns all killed more people than rifles in 2010. According to FBI data, 358 people were killed by rifles that year, half that of people who were killed by “hands and feet.”

Finally, Feinstein argued that semi-automatic “assault weapons” were the “common thread” in mass shootings. While Newtown shooter Adam Lanza reportedly used a semi-automatic rifle during his rampage, Aurora shooter James Holmes’ AR-15 reportedly jammed. Holmes also had two Glock pistols and a shotgun, according to reports.

Tucson shooter Jared Loughner reportedly used a Glock 19 pistol with an extended 30-round magazine. All magazines with more than 10 rounds would be banned under Feinstein’s bill.

These are just a few examples, however, to insist that only so-called “assault weapons” are used in mass shootings would not be accurate.

In a previous Blaze report, Jordan Hunter, director of marketing for Daniel Defense, said a semi-automatic rifle is not the weapon most commonly used in mass shootings.

“We tracked 62 mass shootings wherein 5 or more people were either shot or killed from the early 1980’s to now; 41 times pistols were used, 12 times shotguns or some type of hunting-style rifle was used, and 9 times semi-automatic rifles were used (14 percent),” Hunter told TheBlaze.

Overall, Feinstein’s claims — the basis of her gun ban — don’t appear to hold up under scrutiny.

However, it may be important to note that Sen. Feinstein’s bill refers to certain types of handguns and shotguns as “assault weapons.”

Take a look at the full list of weapons that would be banned under the “Assault Weapons Ban of 2013.”

Conservative podcast host and comedian Steven Crowder sent his producer, Jared, undercover to infiltrate a local Antifa group, and in doing so, captured those involved in the movement doling out weapons and discussing violence.

The investigation was launched ahead of a speaking engagement Wednesday by Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

Crowder said his team has been “infiltrating this organization for a long time.” He released the footage on Thursday.

What’s in the video?

A woman is shown in the first 10 seconds of the video describing movements of the group.

“The idea is plainclothes and hard tactics,” she explained. “I don’t think they’ll know what hit them. Because they’re not prepared for what we’re planning.”

Jared also filmed several members of Antifa and pressed them for information on what they were planning ahead of Shapiro’s speech.

They admitted that they were considering using various weapons against those who opposed them, including an “assault weapon,” a “sawed-off shotgun,” and a “regular rifle.”

That’s the moment in the video that they handed Jared an ice pick and directed him to the nearest military supply store to buy a “Ka-Bar,” which is a very large combat knife.

Throughout the video, many of the group’s “tactics” are revealed, including an encrypted messaging app, which allows members to communicate effectively and under the radar.

One of the group members even boasts about the arsenal of weapons he has in his vehicle, “in case the s**t hit the fan.”

Crowder concludes the narrated video by zeroing in on the media and their lack of response to the footage. According to Crowder, not one outlet was interested in the tape.

What happened after the video was filmed?

After Crowder and Jared reviewed the footage, they turned it into university police — who were in the loop on Crowder and Jared’s project — and thanked them for their service.

However, Crowder reported that there was a large entity that had no interest in the footage: the media.

Crowder instead shared the footage on YouTube, and just a day after the video was released, one of the Antifa members on the tape contacted him to file a privacy complaint.

He also spoke with Shapiro, and with him, marveled at the media’s lack of interest in this story.

“Not a single news agency,” Crowder said. “Not one.”

Shapiro lauded their coverage and said, “You guys did more undercover journalistic work than any of these major outlets.”"

Whether the threat comes from Hezbollah to the north, Hamas to the south, or Iran from the east, there are many scenarios that could lead to an outbreak of hostilities this year.

Of course, Israel’s storied military– the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)– comprises the most potent fighting force in the region, which is sure to make most enemies think twice. A large part of that combat prowess is due to world class training and discipline, but the Israelis also have some of the best war fighting gear outside of the U.S.

So we at the Blaze put together a primer on the latest and greatest in Israeli guns.

They are made by Israel Weapons Industries, formerly known as Israel Military Industries, which considers itself one of the world’s leaders in combat-tested small arms. IWI touts its cutting edge family of rifles and pistols, which include, as it states:

“The innovative TAVOR family of Assault Rifles, the ultimate two caliber X95 (Assault Rifle & SMG), the reliable NEGEV Light Machine Gun family, the well-known GALIL Assault Rifle family… the legendary UZI SMG (Mini, Micro and Uzi Pro) and the acclaimed JERICHO family of pistols.”

There are too many to list each individual model here (for those of you who really want a deep dive, the IWI site is an excellent resource) but we have picked out the latest and greatest of the IWI small arms arsenal. Enjoy.

1) The Negev Machine Gun

The NEGEV is a light and technologically advanced machine gun that is very reliable under adverse and extreme conditions such as mud, dirt and snow. Its current variants are the Negev, Negev SF, and Negev 7 (NG-7).

This family of rifles has seen action all over the world. The Negev takes either 5.56mm or 7.62mm ammunition with an open bolt LMG that can be fed by a belt, drum or magazine. Among its most useful features is the semi-automatic safety which makes the Negev a safer weapon in close quarters battle.

The folks over at the Firearm blog pulled out this video clip to give you a fuller sense of the brand new Negev 7 (NG-7’s) capabilities in action, courtesy of YouTube:

2) Galil Sniper and Assault Rifles

The Galil family of rifles consists of multipurpose personal weapons for infantry use. The basic Galil is light weight, air cooled, gas-operated and magazine-fed.

The Galil was first developed over 30 years ago and has been in use ever since. Today the micro Galil has become a popular variant for Israeli police and law enforcement agencies around the globe.

3) Tavor Assault Rifles

There are a whole series of weapons in the Tavor family of bullpup rifles, including the TAR, CTAR, STAR, and GTAR variants.

The Tavor serves as the IDF’s main service weapon, and was developed in close cooperation with the IDF. Among its biggest selling points are high reliability and accuracy under extreme and adverse weather conditions.

The Tavor family are compact rifles with a long barrel and are completely ambidextrous. State-of-the-art sighting systems can be affixed directly to the barrel.

4) The X-95 Family

The X-95 family of bull pup assault rifles was designed for Israel’s special operation units. Like the Tavor, it also boasts high reliability and accuracy under extreme conditions as well as increased hit probability during exertion.

The X-95 has a 30 round capacity, can be equipped with a silencer, has a detachable barrel, and with the aid of a conversion kit, can be turned into a 9mm caliber submachine gun.

Here is a video that shows the durability of the X-95, courtesy of YouTube:

5) UZI SMG

You can’t talk about Israeli weapons without mentioning the world famous Uzi. The first one was created in 1950, and it has since been exported to over 70 countries and has been more widely used than any submachine gun (SMG) in history.

Since those early days, the Uzi family of weapons has expanded dramatically. It has been modified and optimized to meet a variety of personal defense and specialized assault needs, depending on the mission set.

Today, the Mini and Micro UZI versions are very popular weapons, developed for special military units and police entities such as anti-terror teams."

However, that couldn’t be farther from the truth.

What are they saying?

The New York Daily News, a notoriously liberal newspaper, pushed the claim on its front cover on Saturday. “Trained By The NRA: School shooter excelled in marksmanship program sponsored by gun group,” the cover said.

Meanwhile, progressive outlet Think Progress further claimed: “The NRA donated $10,000 to help train the Parkland shooting suspect to use a rifle.”

At face value, the outlets appear to position the National Rifle Association as culpable in the horrific shooting. But in reality, the NRA had nothing to do with the shooting or the shooter.

What’s the truth?

What the stories don’t mention is that NRA monies helped fund a program for the JROTC program the shooter was a member of when he attended high school. The NRA gave the school’s JROTC program more than $10,000 in non-cash assistance to help build its air-rifle team.

The Associated Press explains:



Records show that the Stoneman Douglas JROTC program received $10,827 in non-cash assistance from the NRA’s fundraising and charitable arm in 2016, when Cruz was on the squad

What the NRA did not do — in any way, shape or form — is help “train” the shooter.

The NRA provides millions of dollars, via its Friends of the NRA program, to youth programs nationwide each year to build enthusiasm for shooting sports.

To that end, the air-rifles that JROTC shooting teams use are incomparable to AR-15s. They are lightweight and shoot small pellets propelled by compressed air in a controlled environment, mostly in small indoor ranges. JROTC shooting programs, and the air-rifles they use, do not “train” a person to use an AR-15, which fires a 5.56mm bullet at extremely high velocity.

What story did the outlets fail to tell?

Those of the school’s quick-thinking JROTC cadets who helped save dozens of students."

Here’s what happened

Following the horrific mass shooting in Florida, calls for the gun-control and attacks on the NRA have reached a fever pitch. But this time, according to Pat Gray, things are different. This isn’t the same as Sandy Hook Elementary because, according to Pat, these high school kids have been fed Democratic Party talking points that shift the blame on Republicans, the NRA, and law-abiding gun owners — not the killer himself, or a societal breakdown mind you.

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

Forget that the FBI dropped the ball or the fact that the killer lied in his background check or the fact that simple security measures that don’t impede our Second Amendment rights exist because come hell or high water, they’re going after the NRA and Republicans with the help of Democrats.

However, dozens of private buyers showed up in an effort to acquire the guns using the so-called gun show loophole, which allows guns to be sold without a background check.

Hundreds of people showed up Saturday morning to give their rifles and shotguns as well as semi-automatic rifles to police in exchange for gift cards worth $100 and $200 respectively, KING 5 reports. The police planned to destroy the guns and use them as rebar in local construction projects.

Meanwhile, a number of private buyers set up a makeshift gun show-style event and offered cold hard cash for guns and even lured customers with donuts.

“I pay cash, I don’t give Amazon gift cards,” one dealer told a gun seller.

“It’s a historical firearm, I would hate to see it get destroyed. I’ll give you $100 cash for it,” another buyer offered a gun owner.

Many held up signs that let gun owners know they would pay cash for unwanted firearms.

“I’d rather see it turned back into the gun community used to promote shooting sports,” one man told KING 5.

Private buyer Mason Vranish reportedly purchased a rocket launcher from of a man who had come to exchange it for a gift card, but officers confiscated the weapon on the suspicion that it had been stolen from the U.S. military.

“Their reason was even though it was single time use item it is still military property concern that a soldier had stolen it from the base or whatever and it wasn’t theirs to own… so it somehow ended up in the civilian market illegally,” Vranish told KING 5.

Seattle Police Chief John Diaz said he would “prefer” gun owners not sell their guns to private buyers at the gun buyback event.

“Some are looking at this as a money making operation,” he told KPLU-TV. “But I think that is very few of the people. Most people are here in the spirit of wanting to do something because of some of the tragedies that we’ve seen in our country and in our own city.”

The buyback program is funded by donations from Amazon of $30,000, the Seattle Police Foundation of $25,000 and local businesses of more than $118,000. In the first two hours of the event, police say they gave our $35,000 in gift cards for 160 guns.

In a separate gun buyback event, Mercer County officials say more than 2,500 weapons were turned in for cash during a two-day gun buyback program in Trenton, N.J.

The Trenton gun buyback surpassed one in Camden in December that netted more than 1,100 weapons.

Mercer County residents received $25 to $250 for each firearm depending on type, condition and legality.

About $100,000 was budgeted but because of the huge turnout, the amount spent is expected to be well over double that. Some participants were given vouchers after money ran out Saturday.

WASHINGTON—The White House signaled Friday that President Donald Trump is backing away from a broad overhaul of U.S. gun policy and focusing on more modest changes, after his Thursday night meeting with the National Rifle Association.

At a televised meeting earlier in the week with lawmakers, Mr. Trump had endorsed a Senate proposal to significantly expand background checks on gun sales and said he wanted to see sales of some firearms restricted to people who were 21 or older. He also suggested some guns be taken away from people without due process. All of these stances run counter to the positions of the NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights organization.

Since then, lawmakers have been looking for more guidance from Mr. Trump on his gun priorities, and whether he would continue to press lawmakers to embrace expanded gun laws. The new discussions about guns and school safety follow February’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Friday morning Mr. Trump now considers a federal increase in the minimum age as likely unrealistic.

“Conceptually, he still supports raising the age to 21,” Ms. Sanders said. “But he also knows there’s not a lot of broad support for that. But that’s something he would support.”

She added: “I think he thinks it would probably have more potential in the states than it would at the federal level.”

Florida’s political leaders last week said they backed raising the minimum age for the purchase of all firearms to 21. Several major retailers have said in recent days they will stop selling guns to buyers under age 21. Separately, lawmakers in at least 24 states are pushing bills that would allow courts to temporarily take guns from people deemed dangerous.

On background checks, Ms. Sanders dialed back the president’s stance. He is seeking “not necessarily universal background checks, but certainly improving the background-check system. He wants to see what that legislation, the final piece of it looks like,” she said. “He certainly wants to focus and improve on the background-check system. In terms of what legislation, as of right now he supports the Cornyn legislation.”

A bill sponsored by Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, dubbed “Fix NICS,” encourages states and federal agencies to submit criminal-conviction records to the national background-check system.

Mr. Trump called Mr. Cornyn on Thursday night to reiterate his support for Fix NICS, a person familiar with the discussion said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Cornyn to combine it with the much broader proposal from Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) that would expand background checks to all sales at gun shows and online, with some carve-outs, such as exempting gun sales or transfers between family members.

The Manchin-Toomey bill narrowly failed in the Senate in 2013. Currently, federal law requires background checks only for sales by federally licensed dealers, though some states have added their own requirements. If the bill were to pass the Senate, it is seen as having a very difficult time clearing the House, GOP aides said this week.

Mr. Trump’s shifts on the issue come after a meeting late Thursday with Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. Mr. Cox tweeted Thursday night it was a “great meeting” with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

“We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people,” said Mr. Cox, adding that Messrs. Trump and Pence “support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control.”

Mr. Trump followed with his own tweet, saying it was a “good (Great) meeting” with the NRA.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday also dashed conservative hopes that he would support a “reciprocity” rule, which would allow gun owners who legally carry concealed firearms in one state to carry them in the other 49 states, a goal of the NRA. More generally, he paid closer attention on Wednesday to Democratic suggestions to restrict guns than to Republican proposals to focus on school-violence prevention. It wasn’t immediately clear Friday if his position had shifted on that issue.

The president’s involvement is considered key in getting any gun legislation passed in Congress. Laws restricting gun usage would garner support from many Democrats, but would also need to win over more conservative Democrats in red states as well as some Republicans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) criticized the president for appearing to shift his position.

“President Trump should go with his instincts, not the clarion and destructive call of the NRA,” he said in a statement. “If he continues to bow to his right wing ringmasters, we will get nothing done on guns and his presidency will continue to fail.”

But Democrats said they had entered the gun meeting with expectations that Mr. Trump’s position could rapidly shift, as they believed it had after a similar televised meeting on immigration in January. He had expressed support for broad changes to immigration law to help undocumented immigrants, but then rejected a proposal a day later and blamed Democrats for the failure.

BlackRock Inc. BLK -1.91% went public with the questions that it is asking gun makers and sellers in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., an unusual step by the world’s largest money manager by assets.

The notice, posted to BlackRock’s website Friday, is the latest sign that some money managers are ramping up pressure on companies that make and sell weapons. The questions range from litigation risks and gun safety to background checks and staff training.

“We cannot dictate what a company should do,” BlackRock said, but warned it generally has the ability to vote against individual directors or in favor of shareholder proposals.

Blackstone Group LP last weekend asked outside fund managers to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns. State Street Global Advisors, another big money manager, has said it also plans to reach out to gun makers with questions.

A number of U.S. companies have reassessed their relationships with the gun industry and the National Rifle Association following last month’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Major retailers, including Kroger Co. , Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., said this past week that they would stop selling guns to anyone under 21 years old.

BlackRock is the largest shareholder in gun makers Sturm Ruger & Co. and American Outdoor Brands , AOBC -0.73% formerly known as Smith & Wesson, as well as a large shareholder in firms such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods. BlackRock said in the notice that it doesn’t own any gun makers in its actively managed stock funds, and in its index-tracking funds, those companies account for 0.01% of assets under management.

The New York money manager has met with clients, including pension funds and other institutional investors, to discuss ways they can exclude gun stocks from their portfolios if they wish to and what BlackRock is asking of executives at companies that make or distribute guns, according to people familiar with those efforts.

It held one such conference call for large customers as recently as Friday morning, with executives focused on corporate stewardship and client relationships.

BlackRock and other large money managers that control funds tied to market indexes say they prefer not to use their heft to make immediate demands such as putting an individual on the board or divesting business units, in contrast to more aggressive dictates from activist directors. Instead, they say they like to work behind the scenes and question their portfolio companies routinely about their policies and plans.

But it is rare for BlackRock to make those questions public.

Last year, BlackRock stopped short of detailing the types of questions it asked company boards and executives in a paper that broadly laid out how it engaged with its portfolio companies on climate-change risk.

In the notice Friday, BlackRock called gun violence “an issue of tremendous urgency.”

The questions the firm said were being posed to gun makers and distributors include broad inquiries such as how they measure the “financial, reputational and litigation risk” of those respective businesses and what actions they take to support gun safety and education.

But BlackRock is also posing specific queries of gun makers, such as if they monitor whether the distributors of their weapons “have a high volume of their guns identified as having been used in crimes,” if they are spending money on research to improve gun safety, and if they require retailers to train their staff or certify that they conduct background checks.

For gun distributors, BlackRock asked what steps they take to make sure gun laws are followed such as “prohibiting felons or domestic abuse offenders from purchasing firearms; sales to minors of certain products; training provided to employees so they comply with applicable laws and regulations.”

BlackRock previously said that it planned to meet with weapons-related companies but stopped short of publicly articulating what type of information it planned to seek from them. It and other managers of index-tracking funds typically keep the contents of their engagements with portfolio companies private.

“We are fundamentally looking to understand whether the company has the appropriate policies and controls in place and is sufficiently managing the risks associated with these issues,” the new BlackRock notice said.

It be Mr. Barton’s second time at the club in his more than 31 years in Congress – and the two coaches spent most of their joint press conference talking about how times have become more partisan in Washington, and attributing it to a climate that may have led to the shooting on Wednesday morning.

“Members are not looked at as people anymore, we’re kind of looked at, I won’t say targets, but people think they can come to our town hall meetings and just say the most obnoxious things and think we won’t feel it,” Mr. Barton said, referencing the rowdy constituent meetings that members have faced as they’ve gone home this year.

Mr. Doyle pointed to the pressure on members to get home right after votes on Thursday or Friday said to not assimilate to Congress, saying it limits time to socialize.

“We’re not allowed to stay here because then we’ve gone Washington,” he said.

The two hope that the game brings a sense of camaraderie and raises money for charity – though they both adamantly refused the idea that the teams should not be drawn across party lines, an idea floating around on Twitter as a sign of bipartisanship. Both said they were plotting ideas to honor Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and hoped he could watch it on CSPAN from the hospital."

And many types of the weapon still can't be bought in the alleged shooter's home state of California.

But Mr. Holmes was able to obtain a weapon gun enthusiasts praise for its ease of use and rock-solid reliability and, according to authorities, put it to use in his attack early Friday at a Aurora, Colo., movie theater.

A Bush Master AR-15 assault rifle is displayed at Firing-Line July 22 in Aurora, Colo. Getty Images

Authorities said last week that Mr. Holmes had a AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, along with a shotgun and at least one handgun.

A Bass Pro Shops retailer in Denver sold Mr. Holmes a handgun and shotgun, according to the company, but the seller of the assault rifle has not come forward publicly. Gander Mountain, another gun retailer with two stores in the Denver area, said in a statement last week that the company was ""fully cooperating with this on-going investigation"" but declined to say whether it had sold Holmes any firearms.

A federal ban on assault weapons went into effect in 1994, under President Bill Clinton, including a restriction on sales of the AR-15. But in 2004, the ban expired and it was not re-enacted.

The federal ban targeted weapons with specific features, including a device that hides the flash from a gun shooting in the dark. It is unclear whether Mr. Holmes' rifle had those features which would have then qualified the weapon for the federal ban. Indeed, stripped-down versions of the AR-15 were sold legally during the federal ban, experts say.

In the Aurora shooting, ""this shooter was planning a military style assault and he chose a rifle that was designed for just such an attack,"" said Dennis Henigan, vice president of the Brady Campaign to Reduce Gun Violence. He added that the impact of the violence was widened by the rifle's large stock of ammunition—a 100-round drum magazine, said Colorado authorities—which would have been restricted to only 10 rounds per weapon under the previous federal law.

But organizations representing the gun industry say gun control advocates misrepresent the uses for the AR-15 rifle, which is known for its light recoil, unlike some other semi-automatic weapons that kick back hard after firing. The AR-15 rifle is ""cheap to shoot, accurate, easy to take care of and take down,"" said Joe M. Cornell, a federally license gun dealer in Denver who also appraises firearms for his business A Accredited Appraisal Services.

One legitimate use of the AR-15 is marksmanship competitions in the United States, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for the firearms industry. ""And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer,"" the foundation's fact sheet reads.

The AR-15 was created by ArmaLite—hence the initials AR—and licensed to Colt's Manufacturing Company LLC in 1959. Its related weapon is the military grade M16 fully automatic weapon first used by U.S. military personnel in Vietnam and lauded for its high velocity and lighter-weight plastic parts, according to the companies and gun experts.

Today, several gun manufacturers make AR-15-style rifles.

""It was our counterpart to the Russian AK-47,"" said Joe Vince, the former chief of the crime guns analysis bureau at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives.

Colt's semiautomatic rifles are ""the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine,"" the company said on its web site. Attempts to reach a company representative over the weekend were unsuccessful.

On the day of the Aurora shooting, Mr. Cornell said, a friend called him inquiring about an AR-15 to buy his teenage son. The weapon is not appropriate to hunt big game because of its low-caliber ammunition, but can be used to kill varmints, including coyotes, according to Mr. Cornell.

""If I had 100 AR-15s, in seven to 10 days, I could sell them all. They're that popular,"" he said.

It's difficult to determine how many of these rifles are made in the U.S. each year. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reports how many rifles are manufactured each year—2,293,247 in 2011 according to interim figures, up 70% since 1998—but does not break down the rifles by make and model or how many qualified as so-called assault weapons.

A few states, including California, New York and Massachusetts, have bans on assault weapons. The one in place in Massachusetts was made permanent under the watch of then-Gov. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican president candidate who now opposes any new gun laws.

There were renewed calls for a federal assault weapons ban in 2009, after Michael McLendon killed 10 people in southeastern Alabama. He used two assault rifles in the attack—an SKS and a Bushmaster. Now, Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, is predicting yet another ""effort to resuscitate the assault weapon ban.""

Still, he said, ""The political odds are stacked against it"" actually happening as the federal government has been reluctant to act on gun control issues. ""For the most part, merely passing new laws, which for the most part go unenforced, won't do any good,"" Mr. Kleck said.

The congressman from Aurora, Colo., on Sunday called on Congress to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons. ""We've got to do something,"" said Democratic Rep. Ed. Perlmutter, speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

But only a smattering of politicians, mainly Democrats, joined him in demanding a legislative response to the massacre. While expressing remorse for the victims and outrage at the violence, neither President Barack Obama nor his Republican challenger, Mr. Romney, has asserted that easy access to firearms and ammunition had contributed to the massacre.

To the contrary, many Democrats avoided any suggestion that gun laws should be tightened, while at least one Republican speculated that more lives could have been saved had some audience members drawn weapons themselves and returned fire within the theater.

""If it wasn't one weapon, it would have been another. I mean, he was diabolical,"" Colorado's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""If there were no assault weapons available, and no this or no that, this guy is going to find something, right? He's going to know how to create a bomb.""

With her hands akimbo, Sgt. Stokley's French-tipped acrylic nails resembled cats' claws against her camouflage uniform.

She was addressing her female recruits during training in October 2010. Although they receive the same instruction, males and females have trained separately there since the first women Marines graduated from boot camp in 1949. Sgt. Stokley, whose eyes were shaded by a fringe of false lashes, found her next victim: ""Take them shoes off yer teeth and quit runnin' yer mouth!""

REGULATION BUN Marines at Camp Delaram in Afghanistan in November 2010. TKtk

Sgt. Stokley and the other female drill instructors (DIs) in the 4th Recruit Training Battalion—which trains all of the nation's female Marine recruits—were in their 20s and indisputably gorgeous. These women, with black belts in martial arts, liked to wear full makeup and kept their long hair slicked back into buns that did not exceed the Marine Corps' 3-inch bun limit.

Most of the DIs had served in combat, and Sgt. Stokley had earned the combat action ribbon in Iraq. Yet despite their actions on the battlefield and their dedication in pulling 140-hour weeks ""making Marines"" at boot camp, the drill instructors knew some males didn't view them as ""real"" Marines.

A female Marine and members of the Navy Hospital Corpsman walked at Forward Operating Base Jackson in Sangin, Helmand province, Afghanistan, on June 7, 2012. AFP/Getty Images

With Thursday's announcement that the ban on women in combat would be lifted, the role of women in the armed forces is on the brink of change. But that doesn't mean military women are set to become female clones of male troops. The female drill instructors I met at Parris Island didn't hide their femininity. ""Remember who you are,"" Sgt. Stokley would remind her recruits, many of whom were just out of high school. The idea she wanted to get across was: ""Yes, we are Marines, and, yes, we are drill instructors, but first we are women—not men.""

In many cases, the female DIs are the first role models the recruits have had. They try to teach the impressionable young recruits that being a strong woman is not a masculine trait—especially in the Marines, which prides itself on its warrior ethos and is often regarded as the most masculine of the service branches.

To make their point, the drill instructors accentuated their tiny waists with belts cinched so tight they had to remove them when sitting in the drill instructor hut so they could breathe. In their bathroom, tubes of hair gel, hair spray bottles, flatirons, blow-dryers, brushes and makeup compacts battled for counter space, with bobby pin casualties scattered on the floor.

The DIs wore their hair long and pinned up in ""sock buns,"" a Marine Corps specialty that required snipping off the toe line of a sock, rolling the fabric into a doughnut shape, and wrapping and winding a ponytail's worth of hair around it. The result was a perfect, plump bun.

In contrast to the DIs, the recruits weren't allowed to wear makeup. Those with short hair all sported the same shaggy style. Those who wore glasses (no contacts allowed) had their last names typed on white paper and taped to the left arm of their glasses. Some had tape along the bridge holding broken glasses together.

Later that October morning, the recruits were at the rifle range—the first place that the males and females were near one another during training. Despite the warnings of many male drill instructors, some of the male recruits couldn't help but sneak peeks at the female DIs. ""We've never seen one of those before,"" was the usual reaction.

Sgt. Stokley was checking target scores. But she was ready to pounce when she walked by male recruits who didn't issue the proper greeting.

""Did you get a good enough look? Are you done?"" she asked two male recruits who were several inches taller than she was. ""Keep your eyes ahead and to the front. You're representing your platoon, and you're embarrassing your senior DI.""

""Aye, sir!""

""Oh, do I look like a man to you? Do I sound like one, too?"" Sgt. Stokley asked, with her face tilted upward. ""I guess it's 'cause I'm female, you don't show the proper respect?""

""No, sir!"" It was a hard habit to break and an unfortunate mistake for the recruit.

""Really? How 'bout you say something! Get out of my face!""

""Aye…ma'am.""

""Scream! Scream, 'Aye, ma'am!' ""

""Aye, ma'am!""

""Get back!""

Getting yelled at by a female DI was embarrassing. In time, that may change.

wsj63,wsj,['William Mcgurn'],,https://www.wsj.com/articles/our-childish-gun-debate-1519689341,"“Do you want to do nothing? Do you want to do nothing? Do you want to just do nothing? Just leave it the way it is?”

The words belong to Geraldo Rivera. He emoted them Thursday on the Fox News Channel during a live broadcast of Sean Hannity’s show from the Conservative Political Action Conference. In a perfect encapsulation of what the gun debate has become, Mr. Rivera was yelling at the crowd for booing his assertion that the National Rifle Association needed to back raising to 21 the age for purchasing an assault weapon—even though he’d just admitted “it won’t solve the problem.”

Still, the mini-drama on “Hannity” was nothing compared with the Two Minutes Hate on CNN the evening before. At a CNN-sponsored town hall held in Broward County, Fla.—home to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the latest school shooting occurred—the NRA’s Dana Loesch was greeted with shouts of “murderer” as she tried to argue her point of view.

The rest of the broadcast was just as elevated. A high-school junior who survived the shooting said that when he looks at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio it’s hard not to see shooter Nikolas Cruz. A freshman said she wanted to ask the NRA: “Was the blood of my classmates and my teachers worth your blood money?” Meanwhile, Sheriff Scott Israel pointed fingers at everyone but himself—this of course before America learned that as many as four of his deputies opted to stay safely outside the school rather than go inside to engage the killer.

In short, the public debate about how Congress ought to respond to this latest mass shooting is guided by two broad principles. Dubious on their own, they are even more witless when combined. The first is the idea that the most important thing is to “do something.” The second is that we ought to look to high-schoolers for the answer.

As goes CNN so goes the nation. The high-schoolers who survived Mr. Cruz’s Valentine’s Day massacre are taking to Twitter , TV and Tallahassee statehouse rallies to pressure politicians to “do something.” In response, some on the right, entirely missing the point, have accused them of being “actors” or “scripted” by the news media.

These teens do not need to be scripted. Their youth and earnestness makes it all but impossible for any adult to advance a counterargument without looking indifferent to the horror these kids have been through. If you don’t agree with what they want, they seem to suggest, you’re OK with mass shootings—as Mr. Rubio and Ms. Loesch found out the hard way.

Quick show of hands for those with children: How many of you look to your teens for political wisdom, whether it’s the daughter obsessing over her Snapchat streaks or the son who would spend his day eating Doritos and binge-gaming “Grand Theft Auto” if you let him?

This in no way diminishes the barbarity of what happened to the Parkland students. It is, however, to insist on the obvious: As terrible as their experiences were, the attack gives them no special insight into the complex array of public policies that might have prevented the slaughter.

Ditto for the “do nothing” accusation. Is it really so unreasonable to insist that those pushing specific legislation or regulations provide evidence that the something they want done will in fact produce the results they claim?

Even keeping the focus solely on school shootings, the challenge here is daunting: how to pick out potential school shooters from the thousands of young men who post ugly things on social media, have no fathers, or have an unhealthy fascination with guns—especially if they have no criminal records and haven’t been diagnosed as mentally ill. Are we confident government has the Solomonic wisdom to sort through the 8.4 million boys in high school and identify the ones who would shoot up a school?

Surely the facts invite skepticism. The FBI call center didn’t forward a January warning to its local Miami office. Sheriff Israel’s deputies answered nearly two dozen calls regarding Mr. Cruz before his rampage, and then hid outside the school when he went active. Some callers said they thought this kid would be a school shooter. Will a new law fix this?

It’s not just conservatives who have doubts. In an October 2016 article in GQ, the Guardian’s full-time gun-politics reporter conceded she was “shocked by how little evidence there was behind some of the most prominent gun control policies.” The year before, right after the San Bernardino killings, the Washington Post fact checker backed Mr. Rubio’s claim that gun laws would not have prevented any of the major shootings the nation had seen in recent years.

Maybe there are “common sense” gun restrictions that could do some good. But that would first require an honest debate. Instead, ours holds up teenagers on national TV who tell us they can’t distinguish between Marco Rubio and Nikolas Cruz.

Lisa Murkowski, shown in June in Washington, is a strong gun-rights supporter who hails from a state that has legalized marijuana use. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty images

Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s husband and sons ordered her a new Benelli 12-gauge shotgun as a gift, but when the Alaska Republican—and enthusiastic duck hunter—went to pick it up, she was puzzled by a question on the federal background form she had to fill out.

The form asked if she used marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes, both of which are legal in Alaska. If she answered yes, she would be unable to get the gun, because federal law prohibits anyone who uses illegal drugs from buying a firearm.

The senator doesn’t use pot, but she was taken aback by the notion that an activity that is legal in her state could block gun ownership. “I don’t like marijuana—I voted against legalization—but we passed it,” she said in an interview. “Now, you’ve got this conflict.”

The scope of that conflict just grew, as voters in eight states last week approved marijuana-related ballot initiatives. Now, 29 states and Washington, D.C., allow marijuana use in some form, including eight that allow recreational use. Yet federal law still holds that anyone who uses marijuana, even medicinally, is doing so illegally and can’t buy a gun.

That is upsetting advocates for both gun owners and pot smokers, groups that don’t always find themselves on the same side of the cultural divide.

“This idea that you somehow waive your Second Amendment rights if you smoke marijuana” is wrong, said Keith Stroup, founder of NORML, which advocates marijuana legalization. “In particular, if you are using marijuana as a medicine, the idea that you have to choose between your health and the Second Amendment is offensive.”

“The Gun Control Act prohibitions are governed by the Controlled Substances Act, and marijuana remains an illegal, controlled substance under federal law,” said Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr.

Justice oversees the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which regulates licensed gun dealers; as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which runs background checks; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which classifies drugs.

The marijuana-gun issue is one of the stranger outcomes of an unusual conflict between state laws, which increasingly allow marijuana use, and federal law, which continues to view pot-smoking as a crime.

At issue are the applications that would-be gun buyers must fill out when they visit licensed firearms dealers. Question 11(e) on ATF Form 4473 asks whether the purchaser is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana.

Related Video The legal, recreational use of marijuana passed in four states on Tuesday with another three states passing it for medicinal use. Lance Rogers, manager of the cannabis law practice for law firm Greenspoon Marder, explains how that could influence efforts to legalize pot in other states. Photo: Getty

Under ATF guidance distributed to gun dealers, anyone who answers affirmatively can’t buy a firearm. If a dealer has reason to believe the would-be gun purchaser is a marijuana user, the ATF says it is the dealer’s responsibility to halt the sale of a firearm or ammunition.

“There are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana purportedly used for medicinal purposes, even if such use is sanctioned by State law,” the guidance says.

The issue can be tricky, especially for those who oppose drug use but support gun rights. Perhaps for that reason, gun-rights groups have been relatively quiet on the issue. The National Rifle Association, for example, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Officials at Gun Owners of America highlight the medicinal-marijuana issue. “GOA finds it very troubling that the Obama administration would use medical issues to ban law-abiding Americans from owning firearms,” said the group’s executive director, Erich Pratt.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled recently that banning gun sales to medical marijuana users doesn’t violate their Second Amendment rights. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law, the court noted, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use in treatment.” The DEA reaffirmed that status just last August.

The Fine Print on Marijuana Laws States with medical marijuana before Nov 8.

26 states and D.C.: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Washington, D.C. States with full legalization before Nov. 8: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Washington, D.C. States that passed and/or expanded medical marijuana proposals Nov. 8: Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota States that passed full legalization proposals Nov. 8: California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada

Ms. Murkowski wrote Attorney General Loretta Lynch in March urging her to reconsider the policy. “In my judgment, the disqualification of an entire class of marijuana users acting consistent with state law from possessing any firearm merits a review of federal legal policy,” Ms. Murkowski wrote.

Mr. Carr said the Justice Department responded to the senator’s letter in October. “It is not the department’s general practice to release publicly private communications with members of Congress.”

Ms. Murkowski said she understands the concerns about gun owners using marijuana, but said similar dangers could arise regarding alcohol. The conflict will likely intensify, she added, as more states approve marijuana use.

Marijuana advocates say legal users of the drug are discriminated against in other ways as well, from child custody and banking to student loans and public housing.

“Even if you’re a progressive who doesn’t like guns or a libertarian who doesn’t like public housing, you should still be outraged by the discrimination that people who use marijuana face,” said Tom Angell, founder of Marijuana Majority, which supports legalization.

Mike Goski stared into the steel casket at his twin brother’s body, dressed for eternity in a deep-blue Marine Corps jacket with red piping and brass buttons. It was like looking into a cruel mirror, Chris’s face, so like his own, distorted by a wound the mortician couldn’t conceal. Alone together for the last time, Mike slipped a knife into his brother’s hand, a weapon for Valhalla, the mythical refuge for fallen warriors. Chris was a born fighter from Red Oak, Texas, a Marine commando with six tours of duty. In combat, he could orchestrate from the chaos a lethal strike by jet fighters, helicopters, mortar and artillery, raining hot metal on enemies a few hundred yards away. At the cemetery, as “Taps” played, comrades of the Goski twins stood at attention, Marines in white hats and Special Forces in green berets. Mike, an Army Special Forces patch on his own shoulder, asked that none cry. After 9/11, twin brothers Mike and Chris Goski answered the call and enlisted in the U.S. military. Their long journey home is a story of love and loss. WARNING: STRONG LANGUAGE. Video: Gabe Johnson/WSJ. Photo: Laura Buckman for The Wall Street Journal. “Chris had only one fear that I’m aware of, and it was not death,” Mike said as he stood beside the coffin that held his twin. “He feared providing anything less than absolutely perfect close air support for his brothers. He feared failing them when they needed him the most.” The twins were small-town boys, part of a generation who came of age at the time of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Since 2001, volunteers from such places—many of them out-of-the-way counties struggling with lagging economies, drug addiction and limited options—have shouldered the greatest burden for America’s defense. They enlisted, fought and died in greater proportions than those from relatively more prosperous urban areas, an analysis of government military data by The Wall Street Journal found. Using Pentagon data on the hometowns of 6,800 military casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2016, the Journal found that 23% came from small towns and rural areas, even though those places made up just 17% of the U.S. population. By contrast, 23% of those killed came from core counties of U.S. metropolitan areas of more than one million people, where 29% of Americans live.

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

The Goskis’ story is one of brothers at home and at arms. Chris was born first, and Mike followed. That was the way it would always be. Growing up, Chris threw the first punch, and Mike leapt to his defense. Chris quit high school; Mike did the same. Chris enlisted in the military the day after 9/11; Mike wasn’t far behind.

“The thing Mike loved most in the world was Chris,” their father said, “and the thing Chris loved most in the world was Mike.”

After burying his brother in 2012, Mike was left to find a new path.

This account of his journey is based on military, police and medical records, as well as journals, emails, texts, videos and photographs; and interviews with relatives and friends, and comrades and officials from Army Special Forces, U.S. Special Operations Command, Marine Special Operations Command, the 10th Mountain Division and the 2nd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Co.

“The thing Mike loved most in the world was Chris, and the thing Chris loved most in the world was Mike.” Tim Goski

‘The thing Mike loved most in the world was Chris, and the thing Chris loved most in the world was Mike.’ —Tim Goski ‘Little destructors’ Chris and Mike Goski were born May 1, 1981. They grew up in Red Oak, at the time a town of 4,300 people and countless crepe myrtles, 20 miles south of Dallas. The family lived on a street of single-story brick houses. The boys were fraternal twins with good looks so similar it was hard to distinguish one from the other. Swapping places was a favorite classroom prank. Their father, Tim Goski, worked in trucking after falling short of a career as a basketball player, keeping the ropy, muscled arms of an athlete. Their mother, Kathy, was a nurse who spoke with the gravelly voice of a smoker. They seemed destined for each other: Kathy’s father was captured by the Germans after the D-Day invasion; Tim’s father was in a raiding party that tried to liberate his prisoner-of-war camp. The Goskis tried to raise the twins—obedient, as young boys—with a firm yet loving hand. Chris and Mike developed a charming, rambunctious energy that attracted friends. They turned a nearby storm drain into a clubhouse, squeezing in pals to lounge on a scrap of green carpet. Chris had a dirt bike that he used to ferry friends to the park, like a bus driver on his route. The boys once skipped a midday school assembly to host dozens of friends at their house while Tim and Kathy were at work. When the authorities arrived, Chris opened the door in a bathrobe, feigning illness even as his pals could be seen making a ruckus on the roof. The mischief eventually veered into delinquency. Their father, Tim, had quit drinking around the time Chris and Mike were 14 years old, yet the lure of substance-fueled escape seemed to pass from one generation to the next.

The boys sometimes drove from Red Oak, a dry town, into the city where they would slip a homeless man a few dollars to buy them Schlitz Malt Liquor. They hid in culverts or half-built houses to smoke pot. They grew bolder, buying and selling drugs in tough South Dallas neighborhoods. In Red Oak, the Goski brothers became the usual suspects. Local police knew them by name and routinely chased the boys into cornfields and creek beds. One night, an officer knocked on the door of their house and said, “Mrs. Goski, do you know your son is out front smoking marijuana?” A judge later hearing the matter ordered Chris to clean police cruisers as punishment. The teenager took the opportunity to sabotage the lights and sirens on the cars. Chris was the impulsive leader; Mike, the thoughtful follower. “Shut the f— up, Mike, and come on,” Chris would say. In fights, he would mouth off and throw the first punch, and Mike would step in to back up his brother. After one such bout, Mike told his mother: “I was just standing there thinking, ‘Chris, don’t do it, don’t say it.’” Chris also liked to steal. Once he came out of Best Buy with a car-alarm system under his jacket. Another time he pocketed a perfume bottle, just because it was in reach. “They just really were crazy,” said Jenny Jones, who met the twins in 8th grade and dated Mike. “They were willing-to-do-anything type kids, little destructors.” Tim cajoled, yelled and, at times, he swung a belt or brandished a Bible. Kathy tried a softer approach, and the boys were more likely to confide in her. She worried her husband’s ire pushed the twins to sins Tim hoped they would resist. When the boys were 16, Tim and Kathy moved the family, which included a younger son J.P., to Irving, Texas, a larger city, hoping to spare the twins from a future in prison or the morgue. “They were rebels in a little Texas town,” their father said, a label that was tough to shake. Chris Goski, left, and Mike Goski with their grandmother Evelyn Goski. Chris was good at math, and Mike loved military history, but they couldn’t abide by school rules. The twins repeated 9th grade three times, and Chris finally gave up. Soon, so did Mike. They earned GEDs when they were 17. Mike had reached 6 foot, an inch taller than Chris. The move to Irving led to more trouble. Chris ripped off a drug dealer, and his parents, worried for his safety, sent him to live with his grandmother in New Jersey in 1999. With his brother gone, Mike slipped deep into drugs. In early 2001, during a four-day bender of pot and speed, he tried to leap from his father’s car as they drove a Texas highway. Tim and Kathy checked him into a hospital treatment program, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. A doctor prescribed an antipsychotic medicine that slowed Mike’s thinking and bloated him to 275 pounds. Chris returned from New Jersey that spring. By the end of summer, the brothers hit bottom, aiming pistols at each other while high on PCP. Tim and Kathy put Chris into a drug-rehabilitation program, where he watched the 9/11 terrorist attacks on TV with another patient, a former Marine who immediately declared he would return to the service. Chris called his father and said, “Come get me the hell out of here.” The following day, Chris went to the Marine Corps recruiter’s office in an Irving strip mall and enlisted in the Reserve. Mike also tried to enlist, but Marine and Army recruiters rejected him for being overweight. Months later, when Chris returned from boot camp, he urged Mike to stop taking the antipsychotic pills. Mike complied, and he dropped 70 pounds on a diet of fish and vegetables—and by wrapping himself in trash bags as he worked unloading trucks at a warehouse. Mike’s mission In late 2002, the Army enlisted the newly trim Mike Goski. He served first with the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan and, following the invasion of Iraq, did a tour of Sadr City, a hostile Baghdad neighborhood. The brothers visited each other whenever possible. Mike once showed up in civilian clothes at Camp Lejeune, N.C., Chris’s home base. An officer there, thinking it was Chris, yelled, “Goski! What are you doing out of uniform?” Mike performed a lazy stretch and said, “I didn’t feel like putting it on today.” The twins found each other in Iraq, when Chris talked his way onto a helicopter to visit Mike in Baghdad. Mike embraced Army life and, after his second combat tour, was eager to advance beyond his infantry unit. “I’m better than this,” he told friends.

Mike Goski began his military career with the Army’s 10th Mountain Division, then joined the Special Forces, became an explosives expert, and fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2006, Mike was invited to audition for 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force. The elite unit is assigned difficult counterterrorism missions. Mike held his own among the hardened soldiers. But the Army evaluator recommended he first serve on a standard Special Forces team, which conducts raids and trains allied forces. “Needs more experience,” Mike’s evaluator wrote on Oct. 10, 2006. Mike won a spot in the Special Forces selection course. A third of the class gave up after standing in formation for hours in a cold North Carolina rain. He trained as an explosives expert, graduating in 2008 to become a Green Beret. The same year, Mike learned he was going to be a father. His girlfriend, Alexis Elliott, a former truck driver with the 82nd Airborne Division, was pregnant. When the sonogram showed two heartbeats, Mike burst into laughter and raced out to call his brother. Mike Goski, left, and Chris Goski with Mike's twins, also named Mike and Chris. Alexis had a rough pregnancy and spent weeks in a hospital bed. Chris and Mike cooked a Thanksgiving turkey dinner and brought it to the hospital. When the twins were born, the couple named them Mike and Chris. Mike and Alexis married and bought a house in Clarksville, Tenn., adjacent to Fort Campbell, Ky., where Mike had joined the 5th Special Forces Group. As Mike bounced between war and domestic life, the couple drifted apart. Alexis cared for the twins, while Mike sought refuge in his man cave, where he kept a sofa, computer and his guns. Death’s door Chris started unraveling in 2006, during his second tour of Iraq. At an outpost in Ramadi, a fellow Marine was shot in the head while trying to spot an enemy sniper, and Chris helped retrieve the mortally wounded man. Chris had a reputation as untroubled by death, whether witnessing it or delivering it. After this shooting, though, other Marines saw that he would spend hours at night alone, smoking unfiltered Camels. When he returned to Texas, the panic attacks started. One night he called Tim from a Bennigan’s restaurant in Dallas. “I think I’m having a heart attack,” he said. Chris’s mother, a nurse, recognized it as anxiety. Mike, left, and Chris Goski in Iraq in 2006. Chris returned to Iraq in 2007. One night, in a freak accident, static electricity from a helicopter’s blades detonated the explosives carried by a soldier. The blast blew up the man, and his remains drew feral dogs. The commander, worried about land mines, forbade anyone from retrieving the body until dawn. Chris asked permission to shoot the dogs, but the officer didn’t want to alert insurgents of the Marines’ position. Chris and two other men watched as the dogs ate their fill. In the morning, he and the others collected what was left. A couple of months after Chris returned home, he learned the woman he was dating was pregnant. He told friends he wasn’t serious about the relationship, and he worried he couldn’t afford child support. Their daughter was born in early 2009, shortly before Chris returned to Iraq for a fifth tour. Like his brother, Chris moved to an elite force. In August 2009, he earned a spot in the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, the Marine Corps equivalent of the Green Berets. Mike gave him a .45-caliber Springfield 1911 pistol to mark the promotion. The commandos wanted Chris for his skill coordinating air and artillery attacks. In Iraq, Chris excelled at his job with an uncanny ability to picture airspace in three dimensions during combat. But back home at the base in North Carolina, friends watched him grow disheveled and edgy.

Chris Goski served in Iraq, coordinating air, artillery and mortar attacks on the front lines, before a tour of Afghanistan as a Marine commando. His decline accelerated during an eight-month tour of Afghanistan that began in 2010. The pace of operations wore at Chris. The team would return from a mission at 4 a.m., high on adrenaline. The men would sleep a few hours, then get up early to plan the next operation. Chris turned to drugs to help him sleep and to wake him up. His close friend, intelligence specialist Doug Webb, could hear Chris rattling his pill bottles in the adjoining room. On April 24, 2011, the Marines found five insurgent bombs on the road. Dave Day, the team’s explosives expert, defused four of them. He was lying on his stomach to work on the last one when 80 pounds of homemade explosives blew up beneath him. Chris retrieved Dave’s helmet and jaw, then waved off the medevac helicopter. There was nothing more of Dave to collect. On their last mission, in June 2011, the Marines landed in an eight-hour fire fight. Chris directed bombers and helicopters overhead. At one point, several Marines were pinned down by a Taliban machine-gunner. Chris called for an airstrike, but the help came too late. One Marine, Bill Woitowicz, was killed. Chris blamed himself. He described the loss in an email to Mike, who would soon return to Afghanistan. “This is my teams 4th casualty, 2nd KIA,” Chris wrote. “He was our young dude. not as sad as the last one though.” To his cousin Becky Goski Fantuzzo, Chris wrote, “The war is still raging here in Afghanistan and at home people really have no idea.” Returning to the U.S. was difficult for Chris. “All of us were supposed to die out there,” his Marine comrade Doug Webb said. “So to come back to normal life—it just doesn’t feel right.” When Chris got back to Camp Lejeune, he bought a VW Jetta and tried to blend into stateside life, slapping a ”COEXIST” sticker on his bumper as a joke. Chris Goski. Chris lived in a two-bedroom apartment, the carpet pocked with cigarette burns. Two M4 rifles usually rested on the sofa. He kept a shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol, and he wore a .38-caliber revolver in a holster. All the weapons were loaded, he told friends, in case any authorities came for him. In the summer of 2011, Chris visited his uncle, Paul “Bingo” Goski, in New Jersey. Uncle Bingo had served in the Marines in the 1980s. One of the nights, Chris chugged nine beers and then sobbed. He begged his uncle to help him buy heroin. “I just want to get some to feel normal,” he said. At 2:30 a.m. that night, the police called Uncle Bingo: Chris, in a blackout from pills and alcohol, had crashed his Jetta. A judge later went easy on Chris after hearing his military record. Around Christmas that year, Chris flew home to Texas. While switching planes in Atlanta, he experienced heart palpitations that an airport medical team diagnosed as a panic attack. He finally arrived in Dallas, intoxicated on alcohol and Xanax, a prescription antianxiety drug. At the kitchen table, Chris showed his father footage of himself calling in planes to hit enemy fighters. Then Chris broke down. “I’m not doing too good, Dad,” he told his father. “I need a rest.” His commanders ordered a mental-health evaluation on April 20, 2012. The examiner diagnosed him with anxiety disorder but concluded Chris was no threat to himself or others. Chris started counseling sessions a week later. The counselor noted that Chris denied considering suicide because “he would never do that to his brother.” He was prescribed antidepressants and antianxiety drugs. On May 8, military clinicians said that “his anxiety was such that he needed consistent care/treatment,” and ordered him on limited duty, preventing him from returning overseas. They warned Chris not to mix his prescription drugs with alcohol, which would worsen his symptoms. Chris’s former girlfriend had petitioned a court for higher child-support payments, which nearly tripled to $1,232 a month. He fell behind on rent, lost his apartment and moved in with a fellow Marine and his buddy’s girlfriend in Holly Ridge, N.C. On June 7, he and Doug Webb attended a suicide-prevention lecture led by a general and his wife. The couple had lost a son in war and another to suicide. During the talk, Chris told Doug, “We’ve all had the gun in our mouth at one point.” The thought of Mike kept him from pulling the trigger, he said. On June 8, Chris reclined on the guest bed at his friend’s house. On his laptop, he entered a search for post-traumatic stress disorder. He watched a video of battle scenes from Afghanistan as Johnny Cash sang “Hurt.” I hurt myself today to see if I still feel. I focus on the pain, the only thing that’s real. Then Chris raised the .45-caliber pistol his brother had given him, put it to his right ear and pulled the trigger. He was 31 years old. Onslow County sheriff’s deputies found his body surrounded by 24 empty Bud Light cans. Doug Webb and other Marines cleaned Chris’s room before Mike arrived from Fort Campbell. They doused his blood-soaked mattress in gasoline out back and set it on fire. Then they shot it. Mike alone Mike and his parents waited on the tarmac in Dallas to meet Chris’s casket, which arrived draped in stars and stripes. A Marine friend stepped off the plane and told Tim and Kathy, “I brought Chris home to you.” Mike rode with Chris’s body to the funeral home. He looked into the casket and saw that there would be no viewing. “It doesn’t even look like him,” he told his father. Chris’s funeral was held on June 18, 2012. During the eulogy, Mike said, “Not all combat wounds are physical nor do they end the casualty’s life immediately. Chris’s wounds ended his on that night last weekend.” ‘You are all like cartoon characters to us. You’re not even in the real world.’ —Mike Goski The Goski family buried Chris at Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery. Afterward, family and friends went to Pappas Bar-B-Q for dinner, and the owners tore up the bill. That night, Mike told his aunt he was under surveillance by men in a white van parked across the street. “You better get a gun and protect yourself,” he said. Mike returned to Fort Campbell to a glowing evaluation and a bronze star. Sgt. First Class Goski “is a leader of character who places the mission, his Soldiers and his teammates before himself,” his commander from Afghanistan wrote. Yet Mike had struggled at home in the months before his brother’s death. Bills went unpaid. Dirty clothes and loose pills littered the floor. Routine problems of civilian life set him off. Arriving home after a frustrating visit to the department of motor vehicles for an expired car registration, he pulled out a gun. “I just want to f—ing kill people,” he told two visiting aunts. Mike Goski and Doug Webb during the week of Chris's funeral. “You are all like cartoon characters to us,” Mike told civilian friends. “You’re not even in the real world. You have no idea.” His wife had moved away with the twins, and Mike had a hard time talking about anything but war. He was quick-tempered and fumed over Chris’s death. He believed the Marines had killed his brother through negligence. “He was showing the red flags,” Mike said, “…they elected to not help him.” In December, Chris’s commander, Col. Jeffrey Fultz, and a sergeant major visited Mike’s house in Clarksville, Tenn., to hand-deliver the findings of a Marine Corps investigation. The report said Chris had mixed alcohol and antianxiety drugs despite repeated warnings and determined that the Marine Corps wasn’t responsible for his death. “No one who had association with him—from his friends, health-care providers, or chain of command—could have predicted nor fully understood the risk that Staff Sergeant Goski was taking by mixing the two,” Col. Fultz wrote in a Nov. 27, 2012, memo on the case. “This is unacceptable,” Mike told them. “He was your responsibility.” Then Mike took a menacing step toward the senior Marines. “Get the f— out of my house,” he said. Mike’s commander ordered him to undergo a mental-health evaluation in January 2013, citing a menu of issues: “Dealing with grief; Danger to self & others; Anger management; Ability to perform; coping skills.” For months, Mike was treated by a military physician assistant, who noted Mike’s history of knee and back pain; traumatic brain injury from exposure to explosions; and “adjustment disorder with anxiety.” Mike Goski with his twin sons, Mike and Chris, in 2010. Friends and family thought Mike intentionally hid symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder during medical appointments. He checked boxes on questionnaires that indicated he wasn’t depressed, and a military psychologist rated his suicide risk as low. In October 2013, Mike left active duty. He lost his house to foreclosure, and returned to Texas to live with his parents. Over the next 2½ years, he rarely left his room. He stacked body armor against his headboard, fearing gunshots through his bedroom wall. He thought people spied on his emails. He put duct tape over the cameras on computers. He had a loaded rifle within reach and a chair jammed under the doorknob. He obsessed over combat footage on the internet and bought into conspiracy theories—the U.S. government funded Islamic State and was behind the 9/11 attacks. He listened to recordings of the World War I poetry of Wilfred Owen and Robert Graves. When Mike did venture outside, he carried a snub-nosed revolver in his belt, hidden by a shirt. “If anybody knew what I wanted to do,” Mike told his father, “they’d lock me up.” Mike sought escape through a mind-addling use of Dust-Off, cans of compressed air used to clear debris from computer keyboards. He inhaled blasts of the chemical vapors, which gave him hallucinations. At times, he would run from his room yelling, “Get the medic. I got guys down.” High on the fumes, Mike would imagine Chris beckoning to him and saying, “I lost you. I’ve been looking for you.” Mike enlisted in the Texas National Guard Special Forces unit, but officers were troubled by his behavior. In March 2015, his commanding officer ordered a mental-health evaluation. By the end of the year, Mike had transferred to the North Carolina National Guard.

Mike “is a leader of character who places the mission, his Soldiers and his teammates before himself.” Mike’s commander from Afghanistan

In early 2016, Mike loaded his truck with weapons and began a meandering trip to North Carolina for drills. He stopped in New Jersey to see Uncle Bingo. One night he grabbed a can of his uncle’s computer-keyboard spray and inhaled. He drooled and seemed to stop breathing. His uncle shook him until he snapped out of it. “We used to do this over in Afghanistan all the time,” Mike said. He inhaled more and lay so still his uncle thought he was dead. “You can’t do that here,” he told Mike when his nephew revived. Then Bingo hid the can. On May 31, 2016, Kathy received notice of a certified letter waiting for her at the post office. It was about Chris. She read it before leaving the parking lot, sitting in the 14-year-old Chevy TrailBlazer he had given her. “I’d like to take this moment to express my deepest sympathies for the loss of your son,” wrote Gen. Raymond A. Thomas III. “I know that words could never ease the pain of your loss, which is why I have made suicide prevention my priority as the commander of the United States Special Operations Command.” Kathy Goski, mother of Chris and Mike Goski, on the front porch of her condo in Irving, Texas, on Monday, July 10, 2017. Kathy Goski holds a photo of Mike. Gen. Thomas asked Kathy and Tim to participate in a study of suicides among military special operators. He included the phone number of Donald Neff, a social worker in his command. Kathy called Dr. Neff at once. “You really want to help?” she demanded. “How about you help my son that’s still alive?” Dr. Neff promised he would. He contacted Larry Rivera, a care coordinator assigned to special-operations troops. The next day, Mr. Rivera called Tim and Kathy. Then he spoke with Mike for 90 minutes. They discussed treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla., which specializes in helping commandos. Tim saw a rare smile on Kathy’s face. Mike returned to Tennessee hopeful but wary. “I’ll believe it when I see it,” he told his mother. Best man On June 17, one of Mike’s closest Army friends—another Green Beret—invited him for a day at the rifle range on Fort Campbell. Mike had agreed to be the best man at the friend’s wedding the following month. Mike, the friend, and the friend’s teenage nephew loaded an SUV with AR-15 rifles, pistols, ear plugs and paper targets shaped like head-and-torso silhouettes. They stopped at a Wal-Mart for drinks and snacks. Mike came to the register with a six-pack of Dust-Off. Back in the car, the friend got angry over Mike’s purchase. They drove to a gas station, where the friend filled the tank. When he returned, he found Mike in the front seat sucking on a can of compressed air. “That’s what’s going to kill you, Mike,” the friend said, frustrated to tears. He was so upset he drove off with the gas-pump nozzle still in the tank. As they approached Fort Campbell, Mike motioned toward his pistol and hinted that he might provoke a violent confrontation with the gate guards. The friend pleaded with him. “Do you care about me?” the friend asked. “I keep you going, and you keep me going. Don’t do this to me.” They swerved onto a side street while Mike regained his composure. Kathy Goski holds the military identification tags that belonged to her twin sons. On July 2, Mike went to Nashville for the friend’s wedding. The ceremony included only the couple, a maid of honor and Mike, who seemed to have found his footing. He felt safe enough to leave his gun in the hotel room when the wedding party went out to celebrate. The next day, Mike drove back to his apartment in Clarksville, Tenn. He stripped to his undershorts and T-shirt and settled onto a camouflaged poncho liner on the bare mattress. He put a Glock pistol next to his pillow. Then Mike put the nozzle of a Dust-Off can in his mouth. Police found his body five days later. When Mike’s casket arrived in Dallas, Tim and Kathy followed the same journey as they had with Chris—from the airport to the funeral home to the National Cemetery. They learned Mike had arranged permission to share his twin brother’s gravesite. On July 18, 2016, the Goskis buried Mike’s casket atop of Chris’s, one brother’s name chiseled into the front of the grave marker, the other’s name chiseled into the back. “That’s how they came into the world,” Tim said. “And that’s how they left.”

In the case of two women accused of using nerve agent VX to murder Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea’s dictator, one question has puzzled authorities: How could the alleged attackers unleash a chemical weapon in a crowded airport without harming themselves or passersby?

Chemists reviewing evidence presented at the trial this week say it appears the plot worked by using a method of combining mildly toxic, relatively unstable elements of VX that don’t require heat to synthesize into the deadly nerve agent.

One of the identified substances, an alkyl chloride that Malaysia’s chemical weapons analysis center said was found on the clothing of Mr. Kim and one of his attackers, acts as a precursor that can be combined with another to form VX.

The presence of that precursor, along with the full VX nerve agent detected on Mr. Kim’s body, suggests there was a second precursor that went undetected in laboratory tests, said the chemical experts, who aren’t involved in the case. That compound likely would have been a sulfur-containing organophosphate, from a group of compounds commonly used in insecticides. Applied together to Mr. Kim’s face, they would have formed VX and entered his bloodstream in minutes.

Experts in medicinal chemistry and forensics said failure to detect the sulfur-containing organophosphate wouldn’t be unusual since it can degrade quickly, especially in humid environments, leaving only the rotten-eggs smell of sulfur gas and an acid. That acid, also a breakdown product of VX itself, was detected on Mr. Kim and on the other attacker.

The alkyl chloride and organophosphate precursors are toxic, but not nearly to the degree of VX, which was developed in the 1950s for chemical warfare and is the most potent of all nerve agents. Chemical experts theorize that Mr. Kim’s attackers exposed him to VX in such a binary form, allowing them to handle less-potent chemicals and survive.

Mr. Kim died shortly after being assaulted by two women at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13. Malaysian officials have said Mr. Kim died of VX poisoning. On Thursday, the lead chemist in Mr. Kim’s postmortem report, Raja Subramaniam, of Malaysia’s Department of Chemistry, testified he had found an array of VX precursors, VX-related breakdown products or VX itself on the victim and assailants.

Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam and Siti Aisyah of Indonesia are charged with murdering Mr. Kim. They have pleaded not guilty and face death if convicted. Malaysian officials have said the women acted under the instructions of North Koreans, some of whom flew from Malaysia moments after the attack. North Korea has denied involvement, and defense lawyers say the women believed they were performing a television prank.

Some aspects of the attack emerged in the ensuing days, but more detail become apparent in this week’s hearings.

On Thursday, Dr. Subramaniam revealed the alkyl chloride precursor was found on Ms. Huong’s clothing and fingernails. Security footage shows Ms. Huong was the second of the two women to approach Mr. Kim, coming from behind him and reaching around to touch his face. Testing showed her white, long-sleeve shirt emblazoned with the letters “LOL” was contaminated with VX.

Laboratory tests showed the first alleged attacker, Ms. Aisyah, had only one VX-related chemical on her: the acid that could either be the breakdown product of the second precursor or of VX itself. Defense lawyers are seeking to challenge those results. In the first week of the trial, prosecutors submitted samples taken from Mr. Kim and the alleged attackers, displaying them in transparent bags.

A binary application of VX was developed in the 1970s by U.S. weapons experts looking for safer ways to handle the nerve agent. Researchers aimed to place two precursors in separate compartments of missile warheads, leaving them to mix in flight. That method required heat for a reaction to occur, and wouldn’t be practical in an assassination attempt, chemical experts said.

The precursor identified during the trial indicates a different chemical pathway to VX: mixing it with the organophosphate in a reaction that doesn’t require heat.

Martin Boland, senior lecturer in medicinal chemistry at Charles Darwin University in Australia, said the method is an application of reasonably well-known organic chemistry. “It is probably avoided in binary weapons manufacture because the precursors are less stable and more toxic” than the method developed in the 1970s, he said. “But it is a viable method for production of unitary VX in a lab.”

VX has no known use apart from chemical warfare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Like all mass-produced nerve agents, it works by blocking the biological action of the enzyme cholinesterase, leading to loss of control of muscles and glands as the body’s electrical impulses rage unchecked. Muscles contract, creating convulsions. Eyes blur and speech slurs. Overstimulated glands cause profuse sweating, tears and salivation. A common cause of death is asphyxiation.

Many of the symptoms match those of Mr. Kim, doctors and witnesses said in court.

The alleged assailants appear to have been unharmed. Neither woman tested positive for VX in the bloodstream. But even if one was exposed to VX, she could have washed it off quickly enough to avoid harm, or been wearing a cream barrier to prevent VX from absorbing into the skin, experts said.

Dick's is ahead of the government on this particular issue is and Dick's asking the government to enact the same higher minimum age on gun purchases along with other stricter measures ... right so this the company is not only changing the rules internally but is also publicly advocating for the rules be changed by state and national loss I believe politicians they've been requested to enact a lot of the policies proposed not just the assault style rifle banner the minimum age did you know they also wanted and ...

The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are different from those who witnessed previous mass shootings at schools such as Columbine High School in 1999 or Virginia Tech in 2007. They’re digital natives. They are harnessing the language and power of smartphones and social media.

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s calls for changes to gun laws in the wake of last week’s Florida school shooting push Congress toward a new politically fraught debate just months before the midterm elections.

For more than a decade, and after multiple attacks on students, lawmakers have shied from making any significant changes to gun legislation in part because of the influence of the National Rifle Association.

WASHINGTON—For more than 20 years, federal law has effectively halted the government’s ability to research gun violence. Now, the shooting that killed 17 at a Florida high school in February has prompted a bipartisan group of lawmakers to take another look at the restrictions.

Warner, N.H.—The proposal for an indoor gun range and firearms shop didn’t cause a big stir at first in this small, rural town in New Hampshire, a state with some of the least restrictive gun laws in the nation.

But three mornings after the mass shooting Nov. 5 at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Warner resident Julie Orlando-Gibson emailed the local zoning board and urged them to reject the plan.

Ms. Orlando-Gibson, 48 years old, a mother of three who works in pharmaceutical sales, wrote that she is “pro-Second Amendment” and shares a home with a gun owner. But she said that such a business belonged “in a city-based warehouse facility where more police officers exist to manage issues.”

“I think it’s foolish for us not to realize mass shootings are a part of our world now,” she wrote.

Her letter is one of hundreds of comments pouring into the brick town hall in Warner, a no-stoplight community of 2,800 in the foothills of Mount Kearsarge. The flow of comments accelerated after recent mass shootings, and they reflected a divide in the community over whether a range would make it more, or less, safe. Stephen Paddock, the shooter in the Las Vegas massacre Oct. 1 that killed 58 and injured 500, had practiced at a nearby shooting range.

​​Some, like Ms. Orlando-Gibson, said they were particularly worried about the gun store after the Texas gunman’s history of violence didn’t prevent him from purchasing weapons.

With an official state motto of “Live Free or Die,” New Hampshire in February became one of 12 states that don’t require legal gun owners to have a permit to carry a concealed handgun. The state has a prominent gun-manufacturing sector, with the second most firearm-industry jobs per capita after Idaho, according to a 2017 report by WalletHub.

“New Hampshire is very much a pro Second Amendment state,” Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said in an interview. He didn’t take a stand on the Warner debate, saying New Hampshire also cherishes local control

Warner town officials could vote on the issue by mid-December.

“It really has polarized people,” said Kimberley Edelmann, a member of the Warner Board of Selectmen who discussed the issue as she tended to her horses at her farm up the hill from Main Street. “I don’t want to see it be a Hatfields and McCoy situation for the rest of eternity.”

Ms. Edelmann, 59, supports the proposal, believing the indoor range will draw the target shooters she hears firing bullets in the oak and maple forests near her property.

“It won’t have an impact on the lunatics who do the mass shootings but it will give the people who want to shoot in a safe environment to practice their skills,” she said.

At issue is a plan by Eric Miller, 52, a Sutton, N.H. businessman, who wants to build a roughly 9-500-square-feet indoor gun range and a retail shop just off Interstate 89.

“This is an ideal location for a range,” Mr. Miller said.

Multiple gun ranges sit within 40 miles of Warner but many are private clubs or outdoors. Mr. Miller, who previously managed insurance companies, envisions drawing customers who want to polish their skills or sample new firearms in all weather.

Customers could bring their own firearms or rent them, and Mr. Miller said his rentals may include several machine guns. “That’s sort of to satisfy people’s curiosity about them,” he said. He said the automatic weapons would be used only under close supervision and wouldn’t be sold to the public at the gun store.

Mr. Miller owns the commercial parcel but needs a special exception to zoning laws to build an indoor recreational facility in that spot. There are no particular zoning restrictions on building a gun range.

The town granted him one earlier this year, but the owner of an abutting business sued, arguing there hadn’t been ample public notice or due consideration of whether the range would affect the area. A judge sided with him in July, and the proposal went back to the town, which started deliberations anew.

Norm Carlson, the owner of that neighboring company, MadgeTech Inc., a major Warner employer with 70 workers, said he may move his firm out of town if a gun range opens next door.

Opponents to the proposed gun range include, from left to right, Laurie Morrissey, Sarah Kenney and David Elliott. Photo: Jennifer Levitz/The Wall Street Journal

MadgeTech employees, who design and manufacture electronics that measure factors like humidity for places ranging from the Louvre Museum to the International Space Station, are concerned about working next to a range, Mr. Carlson said.

While Mr. Miller said his safety procedures would keep loaded guns indoors, Mr. Carlson feels no plan is foolproof.

The divide is just as hardened along the brick sidewalks of Main Street.

“If our board thinks that no harm is going to come from that gun shop, that’s foolish,” said David Elliott, 70, a best-selling author who lives in Warner. He noted the rash of mass shootings this year.

Finishing breakfast at a restaurant across the street, Wally Morse, 74, said the fears were an overblown reaction to national events.

“I think it’s a whole lot of nothing,” said Mr. Morse, an Army veteran. “If it wasn’t for all these wannabe gun-control activists,” he said, “it wouldn’t even be an issue.”

Last week’s shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school that left 17 dead has kicked off an intense discussion about arming teachers, escalated by Mr. Trump, who is calling for having “weapons talented teachers” armed in the schools to deter would-be shooters.

School districts with armed teachers said it is an extra security measure that can provide an immediate response when a shooter is on campus.

“The faster we can respond, the more of our babies that are saved,” said Christopher Burrows, superintendent in Georgetown Exempted Village Schools, a 1,060-student district in Georgetown, Ohio, where some school employees carry guns. “Those folks that are armed are part of our safety team.”

Many teachers unions and educators have come out strongly against the president’s proposal, saying it would make schools more dangerous. Teachers aren’t trained law-enforcement officers and have enough to do educating students, they said.

“That’s a recipe for disaster,” said Shanna Peeples, a former Texas English teacher who was named the 2015 National Teacher of the Year. “I can’t imagine having to add weapons training on top of what I already do.”

At least eight states already allow teachers in some capacity to carry guns on K-12 school grounds, including Kansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, according to the Education Commission of the States, which tracks legislation.

So far in 2018, at least six states—Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Maryland, and Oklahoma—have introduced legislation that would make it easier to have school personnel carry firearms on school property, according to the commission.

It is unknown how many teachers are carrying guns in schools because there is no official national tally. While some school districts have publicly announced their armed-employee programs, they won’t say who is carrying them and typically won’t divulge the number of armed staff members. The armed programs usually require educators to own their own weapons; the school districts provide training.

Several school districts in Ohio and Texas with armed staff said Thursday they haven’t had any incidents involving guns accidentally going off or being shot unnecessarily, a concern by some who don’t want teachers armed.

Still, accidents have happened. A sixth-grade teacher was injured in 2014 when she discharged her gun by mistake while using the toilet in a faculty rest room in Taylorsville, Utah. She had the concealed gun legally. A spokesman for the Granite School District said state law requires permit holders to keep their guns with them.

President Donald Trump, in response to Florida’s deadly school shooting, pledged action on certain gun regulations on Thursday, including background checks. He said he’s concerned that violence on the internet, in video games and in movies, is shaping how young “minds are being formed.” Photo: Agence France-Presse

“Police determined she had the weapon on her lap and it slipped and she reached to grab it and pulled the trigger,” said a district spokesman. “The front of the toilet blew off and it blew a porcelain fragment in to the back of her leg.”

Kevin Dyes, superintendent in the Holliday Independent School District in the small community of Holliday, Texas, said arming employees was needed for safety because the schools had a large number of access points. Employees receive training and their weapons—typically high-quality semiautomatic handguns—are approved by the local police chief, he said.

“We’re not carrying a Saturday night special,” Dr. Dyes said. “We also have training requirements where they have to shoot every so often.”

David Thweatt, superintendent in the Harrold Independent School District in Harrold, Texas, said his district began allowing armed teachers in 2007, paying them an undisclosed stipend. The district’s decision to use armed educators was based on the closest sheriff being about 30 minutes from the school—too long to wait during a shooter situation.

“We cannot hope for the best. You cannot hide in a closet for 30 minutes,” Mr. Thweatt said.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, participated in a telephone town hall meeting with 60,000 educators this week. “The response was universal, even from educators who are gun owners: Teachers don’t want to be armed, we want to teach.”

Mr. Trump also wants to stop designating schools “gun free” zones so that properly trained educators can carry concealed weapons and fire back at a school shooter.

Many school districts have tight budgets, and police and security personnel are often shared between campuses.

Some schools that incorporate firearms into their safety plans have received funding for training through Faster Saves Lives, a program sponsored by the Buckeye Firearms Foundation in Ohio. About 1,300 school staff in 12 states has received training through the program in the past five years, said program director Joe Eaton.

“The faster we stop the killing, and the faster we start medical aid, that’s how we save lives,” Mr. Eaton said.

Jamaal Bowman, principal of the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action Middle School in the Bronx, called arming teachers “an insane idea.” He said it would be much more effective to invest in more mental-health counselors, social workers and arts programs that help children heal.

“School is not just a refuge from guns, it’s a refuge from violence,” Mr. Bowman said.

Kenneth Trump, a consultant who is president of National School Safety and Security Services, said in states that allow teachers to carry guns, very few districts use the option. “Most school boards, superintendents and teachers say thanks but no thanks,” he said.

Mr. Trump, who is no relation to the president, said there could be a host of responsibilities with arming teachers, including weapon inspections, certification and storing guns. Armed teachers also could present confusion during a live shooter incident, he said.

“You arrive at the scene and you have seven people coming out with firearms in their hands,” he said. The idea of arming teachers “sounds good, it feels good, but the devil is in the details of implementation.”

Stephen Voisine of Wytopitlock, Maine was arrested after authorities got a tip that he had shot a bald eagle, a federal misdemeanor punishable by up to a year’s jail time.

Because he had a previous state conviction for domestic violence, Mr. Voisine also was convicted of violating federal law prohibiting people with such records from possessing a firearm, which carried a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

He was sentenced to serve one year and a day, exceeding the maximum allowed for killing the eagle by one day.

The court, in a brief written order, said it would consider whether Mr. Voisine was improperly sentenced to extra prison time for the weapons possession, along with a second case involving another Maine man, William Armstrong III, who was sentenced to three years’ probation for possessing a firearm after a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.

Both men argued their prior domestic violence convictions were too minor to merit punishment for possessing firearms. The cases were consolidated on appeal.

Mr. Voisine argued his 2004 domestic violence conviction, for which he pleaded guilty to a state misdemeanor and paid a $200 fine for “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly” causing “bodily injury or offensive physical contact,” wasn’t sufficient to trigger the federal gun-possession charge. The federal statute applies to those convicted of state misdemeanors involving “the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.”

The brief court record doesn’t specify what precisely Mr. Voisine did in the domestic dispute.

Legal papers also provided few details regarding the shooting of the bald eagle, which isn't at issue before the Supreme Court. But according to a 2012 report in the Bangor Daily News, authorities said Mr. Voisine may have been the first person to kill a bald eagle in Maine since President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act in 1940.

“It is bad enough to shoot our national bird out of the sky, but even if he mistook it for a hawk, it is illegal to shoot a hawk in Maine,” said U.S. District Judge John Woodcock in Bangor, Maine, who sentenced Mr. Voisine, the News reported.

The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case in early 2016 and decide before July.

wsj133,wsj,['Shira Ovide'],,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123413872329061621,"As the ad recession takes the oomph out of the publishing industry, Sports Illustrated is betting it can turn its iconic swimsuit edition into a souped-up marketing machine.

The magazine, which plans to unveil the 46th edition of the franchise Monday on the ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" always tries to create a lot of buzz for the issue, which typically comes out in February and features some of the world's top models.

This year, however, Sports Illustrated, which is owned by Time Warner , TWX -0.93% has turned its promotional efforts themselves into moneymakers, generating about $3 million in revenue, say people familiar with the matter.

Among the deals struck by the magazine, PepsiCo 's PEP -0.66% SoBe drink brand is sponsoring YouTube videos of the women featured in the issue frolicking on the Canary Islands and in Naples, Italy.

In addition, a Southwest Airlines LUV -0.23% jet emblazoned with an image of swimsuit model Bar Refaeli will whisk VIPs to a launch party in Las Vegas this week. And, as part of a days-long Vegas celebration, stunt drivers sponsored by Nissan Motor will race cars on a lot adjacent to the Luxor hotel, with swimsuit models as their passengers.

Sports Illustrated's grab for such nontraditional marketing dollars has helped diversify its annual haul from the swimsuit edition. This year, about 40% of revenue generated by the issue -- which accounts for about a tenth of the magazine's total annual revenue -- will come from digital and event-marketing efforts. Four years ago, just 4% of the issue's revenue came from sources other than print advertising, executives say.

To develop its strategy for the issue, Sports Illustrated worked with Team Velocity, a sports-marketing and events firm based in Norwalk, Conn. ""It's really about taking this content we've created in the magazine and leveraging it through new channels,"" says Mark Ford, the magazine's president.

The promotions have helped Sports Illustrated offset a drop in print-advertising revenue. This year's swimsuit issue has 70 pages of ads, a third fewer than last year's.

The special issue was inaugurated in 1964 by Sports Illustrated editor André Laguerre to serve as a winter escape from what had been a dead zone for sports fans -- the interval between the end of football season and the start of baseball season. Its newsstand sales total about 1.1 million copies each year, though sales have declined from around 1.5 million copies earlier this decade. That compares with the magazine's normal weekly newsstand sales of about 85,000 copies.

Sports Illustrated may have a challenge keeping sales up this year. Amid a fee dispute with magazine distributors, publisher Time Inc. recently started working with new middlemen to truck copies to retail outlets like Wal-Mart Stores . WMT -1.72% Time Inc. has acknowledged there may be some bare magazine racks for a few weeks, which could jeopardize swimsuit-issue sales. But Sports Illustrated says it has taken steps to work around any distribution problem.

Sports Illustrated is just one media property attempting to extend its marketing beyond the traditional ad page or 30-second TV spot. ""Experiential marketing,"" a broad term for efforts to give consumers hands-on experience with products or services, is a growth industry as marketers seek out more ways to draw the attention of the increasingly distracted consumer.

""Brands these days have really got to be creative about how they're getting their messaging out in the marketplace,"" says Linda Rutherford, vice president for communications and strategic outreach at Southwest Airlines.

To piggyback on the unveiling of this year's swimsuit issue, the Southwest plane with the image of Ms. Refaeli will be unveiled this week at New York's LaGuardia Airport and will ferry about 100 people, including two dozen models, to Las Vegas. After that, the airline plans to use the Boeing 737, dubbed SI One, on regular routes for the next two months.

Las Vegas is spending more than $1 million with Sports Illustrated to feature swimsuit models in events this week, culminating Friday in a 1,000-person launch party and concert by R&B star John Legend at the LAX nightclub. Attendees can line up to have their photos taken against a fake backdrop of the Las Vegas skyline with one of the two dozen swimsuit models in attendance.

""We are the city of great special events. It's just a place where things can happen, and this fits right in,"" says Rob Dondero, executive vice president of R&R Partners, which is working with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Online, Sports Illustrated plans to post more than 1,500 pictures from its swimsuit photo shoots, an effort that generated more than half a billion page views for last year's swimsuit edition. SoBe's lizard mascot will be featured in YouTube video ads starting Tuesday morning, in a video showing him inspecting candidates for this year's swimsuit cover page.

Even in a bad economy and with sexy images ubiquitous online, the readership of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue has demonstrated staying power. The edition has about 66 million readers, including 4 in 10 adult men in the U.S., according to Sports Illustrated research.

In language reminiscent of the Cold War, Mr. Putin used his annual state-of-the-union address to boast about Russia’s military prowess and put on a display of new armaments, including intercontinental ballistic missiles and underwater drones.

“Efforts to contain Russia have failed,” Mr. Putin said to Russia’s political elite gathered in Manezh Hall adjacent to Red Square, speaking before large screens displaying images of the weapons.

Amid applause from the audience, a video showed a digital animation of a cruise missile fired from northern Russia flying across the Atlantic Ocean, evading missile defenses, then circling around the southern tip of South America before heading north toward the U.S.

Most of the weapons Mr. Putin highlighted are already well known to the U.S., whose missile defenses are designed to counter the actions of rogue states rather than of Moscow. He did surprise some U.S. analysts by announcing that Russia would field a new nuclear-powered, air-launched cruise missile.

Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual state of the union address to show off a series of new armaments, including nuclear weapons he claims are capable of penetrating U.S. air-defense systems.

Mr. Putin’s demonstration of might is further evidence of a general ratcheting up of sophisticated arms development among the world’s largest military powers. A Pentagon review last month made it known that the U.S. would undertake a major upgrading of its air-, land- and sea-based strategic nuclear forces, at a cost the Congressional Budget Office has estimated at $1.2 trillion.

China is also upgrading its arsenal, though its nuclear force is much smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia.

Moscow and Washington have both announced they are meeting their obligations under the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits each side to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. Hopes have vanished that the accord would be followed by one mandating deeper cuts.

Instead, the two sides are concentrating on updating systems allowed under that treaty and deploying weapons that fall outside its scope.

Among those, the Pentagon is planning to develop two new sea-based nuclear weapons—a new “low-yield” submarine-launched ballistic missile and a sea-launched cruise missile—it says are needed to deter Russia from contemplating the limited use of nuclear weapons during a military crisis.

Mr. Putin’s speech, in part, appeared designed to send a message that Russia would spare no effort to maintain its own nuclear capability.

“What worries me most is the resurgence of a dynamic to outmatch the other side with new nuclear weapons,” said Hans M. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists, which is critical of the American and Russian nuclear modernization plans.

Franklin Miller, a former Defense Department official who advised the Pentagon on its nuclear-modernization plans, said the new U.S. systems are needed to maintain the American nuclear deterrent, however much Russia might not like them.

“I think Putin understands that U.S. has awakened from its somnolence on nuclear issues,” Mr. Miller said. “If he understands that Russian should not carry out the first use of a nuclear weapon, all is well.”

Most of new systems touted by Mr. Putin on Thursday appear to be designed mainly to evade or penetrate limited U.S. antimissile defenses.

Among the weapons displayed on screens behind Mr. Putin was a new Sarmat heavy intercontinental missile that he said was capable of reaching any point on the globe. The Pentagon has long anticipated that system would be deployed next year. Last month’s nuclear review also indicated that the Pentagon was aware of the nuclear-armed torpedo Mr. Putin touted, which could be used to attack U.S. ports and submarine bases.

There was a new twist in Mr. Putin’s highlighting of a Russian program to develop nuclear-powered cruise missiles, which he said had undergone a successful test launch at the end of last year and would have an unlimited range.

The Russian president seemed to be sending a message that if the U.S. expands its defenses against ballistic missiles, Russia can circumvent them, U.S. analysts suggested. The U.S. has long maintained that the main purpose of its antimissile defenses is to block an attack by a rogue state like North Korea, and that they aren’t nearly capable of undermining Russia’s nuclear deterrent.

“The Russians seem to have more confidence in the U.S. ballistic missile defense than even the staunchest U.S. advocates do,” Mr. Kristensen said.

Mr. Putin’s approval rating at home shot up to over 80% after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 and has remained around that level. State-television news and talk shows regularly blame the U.S. for many of the world’s problems and present Mr. Putin as standing up to Washington. Domestic critics, meanwhile, accuse him of warmongering to distract from Russia’s stagnant economy.

Mr. Putin, who is almost certain to be elected to another six-year term in a presidential ballot on March 18, started his speech Thursday by talking up plans to better the economy, saying Russia needed to improve average life expectancy and raise people out of poverty.

The U.S., he said, had exploited Russia’s economic, political and military weakness after the collapse of the Soviet Union to ignore Moscow’s views, including by moving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization closer to Russia’s borders.

“No one listened to us. Listen to us now,” he said.

Mr. Putin said Russia’s Syria campaign had allowed the military to show off the results of a modernization program he launched in 2011. “The whole world knows the names of our newest airplanes, submarines, air-defense systems,” he said.

Ivan Konovalov, an independent defense analyst in Moscow, said the speech demonstrated how quickly Russia’s arms industry is progressing.

“It is developing some of the best weapons in the world, and the United States, if they want to maintain parity, has to answer the challenge quickly,” he said.

The Pentagon had little to say publicly about Mr. Putin’s speech, stressing that U.S. missile defenses were aimed at “rogue” nations, not Moscow.

“We are not surprised by his statement,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said Thursday during a press briefing, adding the American people should be assured the U.S. military is “full prepared” to defend the country.

Photo: Bloomberg News

After a year when Chinese companies bought record numbers of American firms, a U.S. company is getting a rare shot at a big takeover in China.

Allentown, Pa.-based Air Products & Chemicals Inc., APD -0.90% a maker of industrial gases, is looking for a bigger foothold in the Chinese market. In December, it got an unexpected opening, after a boardroom battle at China’s biggest industrial-gas maker, Yingde Gases Group Co. , effectively put the company on the block.

Air Products is offering up to $1.5 billion for Hong Kong-listed Yingde, a price that would make the deal the largest takeover of a Chinese firm by a U.S. buyer. People familiar with Air Products’ bid say it could raise that offer to fend off a rival bid formalized Tuesday by a Hong Kong-based private-equity firm PAG Asia Capital.

An important twist would come Wednesday, when shareholders vote on which of the warring board factions get to run the company, and thus handle the sale. The leadership is being contested between Yingde’s chairman—under whom Yingde has been slow to open its books, according to Air Products—and a pair of ousted former executives who say they want to hasten a sale.

A spokesman for Yingde said the company is “focused on the auction process,” but declined to comment further. It has said in the past that it is working to provide prospective bidders with access to financial data.

Air Products has said it is open to working with either party to strike a deal. “We believe that the combination of Yingde and Air Products makes significant strategic and financial sense,” the company said Tuesday in a statement, adding that it continues to participate in the sale process.

The fight over Yingde, which accounts for about 14% of China’s industrial-gas market by revenue, presents an unusual opportunity for a U.S. buyer to purchase a big Chinese company. Chinese regulators restrict foreign investment in many sensitive industries, and have nixed high-profile bids for local companies in the past, including Coca-Cola Co.’s $2.4 billion attempted takeover of China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. in 2009 on antitrust grounds. That has discouraged other U.S. firms from pursing splashy acquisitions.

The biggest U.S. acquisition of a Chinese company was Joy Global Inc.’s $1.4 billion purchase of International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. in 2011, according to Dealogic data.

Some U.S. politicians, including President Donald Trump, have lambasted China for not giving U.S. firms equal access to Chinese markets, even as Chinese investors cut a record $69 billion worth of deals last year for U.S. firms.

Lawyers in China say regulators there may allow a takeover of Yingde because it trades publicly and already has many foreign investors.

There are many foreign participants in the industrial-gas business, where companies create mixtures of gases such as oxygen and nitrogen, which are used in manufacturing products including steel and semiconductors.

An Air Products deal would require approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce.

Air Products’ pursuit of Yingde followed a split in the company’s management team in November, when Yingde Chairman Zhao Xiangti called a hasty board meeting to remove then-Chief Executive Sun Zhongguo and his chief operating officer, as well as the issue of a big chunk of shares to a Beijing investor picked by Mr. Zhao.

Mr. Sun protested the share sale and asked for the entire company be put up for sale. Yingde subsequently nixed the deal with the Beijing investor after its share price rose significantly.

The U.S. company, which has a market value of about $30 billion, made its initial offer in December.

In February, Yingde hired Morgan Stanley to shop the company to potential buyers.

Air Products’ chief executive, Seifi Ghasemi, has taken a deep personal interest in the deal, leading calls and peppering executives and advisers with questions, according to participants.

Mr. Ghasemi flew to Shanghai to pitch Yingde executives on its offer in February, and is scheduled to go again later this week to learn more about the company’s operations, according to people familiar with the situation.

There are still plenty of obstacles to an Air Products takeover.

Last week, Yingde’s feuding board members separately cut deals with PAG to sell their combined 42% stakes for HK$6 a share—the same price Air Products offered, but without requiring the due diligence that the U.S. company has said it needs.

PAG is planning to make the same HK$6 offer to the rest of Yingde’s shareholders, and the deal would become effective if it is accepted by more than half.

PAG, which declined to elaborate beyond its Tuesday official offer statement, says its offer isn’t conditioned on Ministry of Commerce approval.

Mr. Sun said in an interview he believes the PAG deal “puts a floor” on the price bidders must pay to buy the company, and that he welcomes higher competing offers from Air Products and others.

Yingde suspended trading in its shares Monday, but they closed at HK$6.22 Friday after news of PAG deal, meaning investors are betting the takeover battle will heat up and produce a higher offer.

“We want a fair deal for all shareholders,” said Seth Fischer, who runs hedge fund Oasis Management Co., which owns a 4.5% stake in Yingde. “Now is the time for buyers to finish sharpening their pencils and put in their best offer.”

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and chief executive of the NRA, used language similar to that employed by President Donald Trump on protecting students, while also taking shots at some of the president’s favorite political targets, including the national media, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prominent Democratic lawmakers.

Mr. LaPierre said local officials and parents need to take steps to “harden” schools, “including effective, trained armed security that will absolutely protect every innocent child in this country.” Mr. Trump also called Thursday for “hardened” security, proposing that some teachers be armed.

Mr. LaPierre told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference that liberal lawmakers, egged on by the media national, are cynically using the latest school tragedy to roll back Second Amendment gun protections. Current laws, if more vigorously enforced and observed, are sufficient to curb mass shootings, he said.

“What they want are more restrictions on the law-abiding,” Mr. LaPierre said. “Think about that. Their solution is to make you—all of you—less free.”

The NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, faces renewed scrutiny following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Critics say the NRA’s campaign donations and political influence give it outsize influence in Congress, where the group works to stave off stricter gun controls and loosen existing ones.

The group endorsed Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential race and spent $30 million in ads supporting him and attacking his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Mr. Trump mentioned the group’s support of him during the White House meeting with local officials.

“They’re very close to me. I’m close to them,” Mr. Trump said, adding he had spoken “often” with the NRA in the past few days as he worked to develop a response to the Parkland shooting. He also played down potential conflict with the group over some of his proposals, such as placing new age restrictions on gun purchases, which the NRA has opposed.

“It’s not a battle,” he said. “I think the NRA wants to do the right thing.”

The NRA has long been a potent political force. The group says it has five million dues-paying members, and it “grades” politicians on their gun stances, sending those report cards to members across the country. In a measure of its cash clout, the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics calculated that five Republican senators have received more than $27 million in election aid from the group over their careers.

In his CPAC speech, Mr. LaPierre took political positions that align with Mr. Trump, accusing Democratic lawmakers of politicizing the shooting rather than coming up with what he billed as practical solutions.

“They want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of school security, the failure of family, the failure of America’s mental health system and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI.”

The FBI acknowledged after the attack that agents failed to act on a tip in January about the alleged shooter in Florida.

In an emotional meeting Wednesday at the White House, students, parents, and administrators affected by school shootings offered pleas for change to President Donald Trump. Photo: Getty

In another nod to Mr. Trump, Mr. LaPierre also attacked the FBI more broadly, and said rank-and-file members should call “BS on its rogue leadership.” He didn’t specify what he meant when describing FBI “corruption, and its own unethical agents.”

Mr. Trump fired James Comey as the head of the FBI in 2017 and has regularly criticized officials over their handling of separate probes into Russia meddling in the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Mr. LaPierre had harsh words for prominent Democratic lawmakers, saying the party has shifted left over the past few decades and is now controlled by “European-style socialists.” He mentioned some potential Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential race, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California.

“They hide behind labels like Democrat, left-wing and progressive to make their socialist agenda more palatable, and that is terrifying,” he said.

Sen. Harris responded to Mr. LaPierre in a tweet: “I am not going to be silenced by attacks from the NRA or anyone else — and neither will my Senate colleagues or the students from Stoneman Douglas. It’s time to stand up to the gun lobby and keep our communities safe.”

The office of Sen. Warren didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

On the media, Mr. LaPierre said: “You know, the whole discussion of the Second Amendment and the gun issue in this country has become so dishonest in the national media.”

In separate comments at CPAC, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said media outlets have their own motives. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” she said. “You guys love it. I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but I am saying you love the ratings.”

We are again confronting the challenge of remaining faithful to the unalienable right to life articulated in the Declaration of Independence – a challenge that the Constitution demands we protect from two angles.

By seeking to “insure domestic tranquility,” the government has an obligation to protect us from violence. But by acknowledging “the right of the people to keep and bear arms” it also recognizes the need for individuals to protect themselves by means of self-defense.

We must have a conversation about how to navigate the tension between these two realities. It should involve everyone in our society and within our government. President Trump is talking about it. Congress is talking about it. The media, educators and citizens are talking about it.

But one potential participant remains conspicuously silent: the United States Supreme Court. On Feb. 20, the Supreme Court refused to hear the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals case Silvester v. Becerra. That case concerned a California law requiring a 10-day waiting period before purchasing a firearm.

The challenge to the law said it should not apply to people who previously had gone through the background check process and now sought to buy an additional gun. The 9th Circuit Court upheld the 10-day waiting period.

Regardless of this case’s particular merits, the high court’s denial represents a larger pattern. For nearly a decade, the court has refused to rule on the constitutionality of gun regulations in a systematic fashion.

The justices’ reticence is both strange and problematic. It is strange in light of prior decisions. A decade ago, in the 2008 case of D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court interpreted the Second Amendment to the Constitution for the first time as protecting the right of an individual to own a gun. But far from making this right absolute, the court declared that limits existed to gun ownership.

What exactly were those limits? The court didn’t really say.

Beyond affirming that “longstanding prohibitions” could continue, Justice Antonin Scalia refused to give details when the Heller decision was announced. No need to do so, he said, “since this case represents this Court’s first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field … there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.”

It seemed that the court, having established the baseline of an individual right, expected a series of future cases to draw the lines for how to balance gun safety and gun rights. The court ruled in 2010 that the Second Amendment applied to the states in McDonald v. City of Chicago.

However, the decision in the McDonald case didn’t break much new ground on the content of the right itself. Instead, it merely kicked the can of further definition down the road. After that case, when given numerous options to further delineate the Second Amendment, the court has refused – again and again.

The Supreme Court’s failure to define the scope of gun rights is problematic because it leaves too much unsettled. The Heller and McDonald decisions opened up myriad questions about gun rights and their regulation without settling on a standard by which to judge gun laws.

This means that, absent further precedent, lower courts possess little guidance in how to rule on competing claims, which in turn has given rise to confusion.

As Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out when objecting to the latest court refusal to hear the Silvester case, there is a great disparity in the standards exercised by lower courts in gun cases. While some judges seek to impose a more stringent standard on gun laws, others – like many on the 9th Circuit Court – adopt a “deferential analysis” that accepts as valid nearly any regulation.

The Supreme Court once argued that “liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.” That remains true for gun owners, who are subject to the accident of whatever lower court judge’s jurisdiction they happen to live in.

It is also true for legislators, who are left without guidelines to follow when crafting legislation. But it is especially true for the victims of gun violence.

Liberty does not find a refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt, and neither does life. The Supreme Court cannot and should not try to settle every detail of gun policy. But it should begin to fulfill the promise made in the Heller case.

The nation’s highest court should seek to further describe what it believes the Second Amendment protects regarding gun ownership and what the amendment allows for gun regulations. The high court should also police lower courts to hold them accountable to those standards.

In so doing, the Supreme Court can make its own needed contribution to the present conversation. It can bring the Constitution to bear in its own way in the gun debate.

Above all, the Supreme Court can play a part in furthering the right that proponents of gun regulation and of gun protection both seek – a right that has been so desecrated by our seemingly endless school shootings: the unalienable right to life."
fox1,fox,"['Kaitlyn Schallhorn', '- Jonas Oransky', 'Everytown For Gun Safety', '- Sen. Pat Roberts']",2018-03-01 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/01/gun-control-measures-proposed-by-trump-lawmakers-after-florida-school-shooting.html,"In the weeks after a gunman walked into a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members, survivors aren't giving up their fight for stronger gun control efforts.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School teenagers have moved front and center in the gun control debate, organizing a coming national school walkout, meeting with President Donald Trump, lobbying state lawmakers and participating in protests.

Since the Feb. 14 shooting, several ideas have been floated by the White House, Republicans, Democrats and state officials to combat gun violence. Trump also hosted a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House to discuss reform.

Here are six measures lawmakers are now debating.

Arming teachers

Trump and Republicans suggested the possibility of arming teachers after the school shooting – and Florida lawmakers moved closer to do that this week.

A school safety bill that, among other things, would allow up to 10 school personnel to be armed, narrowly passed the Florida state House in March, and Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed it into law.

On Twitter, Trump promoted the idea of having “highly trained, gun adept” teachers and coaches in schools who could confront a shooter before first responders arrived or serve as a “deterrent to the cowards that do this.”

“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!” Trump tweeted.

Two school districts near Dayton, Ohio, already train a group of select teachers and faculty members to confront an active shooter. These staff members, whose identities are not revealed, have access to safes throughout the schools which have guns hidden inside.

Ohio offers funding for schools to train staff to respond in emergency situations. There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff members who are trained to fire back, or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds.

Strengthening federal background checks

Trump has seemed open to strengthening the federal background check process for gun purchases, saying it should be a bipartisan effort to do so.

Gun control advocates point to what they see as “loopholes” in the current system that could allow for people to purchase guns even when they legally should not be able to do so.

Specifically, Jonas Oransky, deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, noted the ability for consumers to purchase guns from a private seller without completing a background check.

“It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller,” Oransky told Fox News.

He also pointed to the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed – when National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) marks a document “delayed” but does not approve or deny it within three business days. He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers, citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency.

“It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller.” - Jonas Oransky, Everytown for Gun Safety

However, Second Amendment advocates argue the background check system already does too much.

“We don’t think it’s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit, told Fox News.

Eliminating bump stocks

In the wake of the Parkland shooting, Trump said he signed an order instructing the Justice Department to ban bump stocks, an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to resemble a fully automatic weapon.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said top officials in the Justice Department believe they can ban bump stocks through the regulatory process. However, gun manufacturers and owners are likely to sue if they are banned without any legislation from Congress.

Bump stocks were approved in 2010 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after concluding the devices did not turn guns into machine guns, which are prohibited under the National Firearms Act.

The devices weren’t used in the Parkland shooting, but the massacre did reignite the debate over whether they should be banned.

Limiting high-capacity magazines

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said he's open to changing his stance on one gun control measure after meeting with survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting: high-capacity magazines.

""I have traditionally not supported looking at magazine clip size and after this and some of the details I have learned about it, I am reconsidering that position,"" Rubio said during a recent town hall. ""While it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack ... So we'll have to get into that debate, but that is something I believe that we can reach a compromise [on] in this country, and that I'm willing to reconsider.""

The suspected gunman had to stop to reload his firearm during the massacre, which Rubio added was “evidence in this case that it saved the lives of some people.”

Several measures introduced in states across the country – including in Colorado, Illinois and Rhode Island – would ban high-capacity magazines.

Raising the age limit to buy certain guns

After hosting survivors of gun violence and their parents at the White House, Trump publicly backed raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21.

“There’s nothing more important than protecting our children,” Trump said.

When Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., acknowledged that a bill he’s sponsored with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to broaden background checks does not include raising the age limit, Trump accused him of being “afraid of the NRA.”

National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Dana Loesch has already said the powerful gun lobby does not support raising the age limit to purchase certain firearms. After Trump’s White House meeting, she told Fox News it was “good TV,” but some of the proposals were “really bad policy.”

“Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15.” - Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan.

However, some Republican senators, including Rubio and Pat Roberts of Kansas, have voiced support for raising the minimum age to purchase certain types of firearms.

“Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,"" Roberts said.

The legislation Scott signed into law in March raised the minimum purchasing age for buying a rifle from 18 to 21.

Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, also announced it would stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone under the age of 21.

Banning ‘assault-style’ rifles

House Democrats introduced a ban on semi-automatic firearms in February called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. More than 150 Democrats signed the legislation, the Washington Examiner reported.

According to a Harvard CAPS-Harris survey, 61 percent of respondents support banning the AR-15 firearm, used in many of the recent mass shootings in the U.S., including Parkland. Just 39 percent of respondents said adults who pass a background check should be allowed to purchase the firearm.

Dick’s Sporting Goods announced in February that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm.

“We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Edward W. Stack, chairman and CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods, said in a statement. “But we have to help solve the problem that’s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America – our kids.”

Stack also said the company would stop selling high-capacity magazines and will continue its policy of not selling bump stocks.

“Some will say these steps can’t guarantee tragedies like Parkland will never happen again. They may be correct – but if common sense reform is enacted and even one life is saved, it will have been worth it,” Stack said.

Other actions politicians are taking

Trump encouraged lawmakers not to be afraid to disagree with the NRA, the powerful nonprofit that advocates for gun rights, during a televised meeting with lawmakers.

“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump said. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”

Several companies have cut ties with the NRA since the Parkland school shooting. Among them are: Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, MetLife, United and Delta.

Georgia lawmakers voted to yank a tax break for Atlanta-based Delta on March 1 after the airline severed ties with the NRA.

The bill cleared the state House with an overwhelming 135-24 vote, after being approved in the state Senate on a 44-10 vote. It was then sent to the governor's desk.

The final version dropped an earlier amendment that would have renewed a jet fuel tax exemption worth $50 million that was taken off the books in 2015.

“Businesses have every legal right to make their own decisions, but the Republican majority in our state legislature also has every right to govern guided by our principles,” said Lieutenant Gov. Casey Cagle, who threatened to kill the airline tax break days prior to the vote.

The threat prompted liberal governors nationwide to court the airline, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who tweeted his support and encouraged Delta to move its headquarters north.

“Now more than ever the NRA is showing just how out of step they are with the American people,” Cuomo said in a statement, calling the NRA's agenda “dangerous.”

The NRA has fired back at companies like Delta – and at the lawmakers encouraging them – for allegedly not supporting the Second Amendment.

“Ultimately, our members are passionate #2A supporters. Having those on the left pushing for a boycott to pressure companies to drop discounts just shows how out of touch some are,” the NRA said on Twitter.

James Eric Davis Jr., 19, was apprehended just after midnight Saturday after being wanted in connection with the shooting deaths of his father James Eric Davis Sr., 48, and his mother Diva, 48. The manhunt for Davis went on for nearly a day and involved more than 100 police officers.

Central Michigan University Police Chief Bill Yeagley told reporters Saturday that the gun used in the shooting belonged to Davis Sr., a part-time police officer in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood. He would not say whether the father had brought the gun to campus when picking up his son, but noted that Davis Jr. was seen on video in the dorm's parking lot with the gun before going into the building where his parents were shot.

Yeagley did not say if the gun was Davis Sr.’s service weapon.

MICHIGAN STUDENT SUSPECTED OF SLAYING PARENTS HAS BEEN ARRESTED, AUTHORITIES SAY

Providing a timeline of the incident, Yeagley said Davis Jr. ran into the office of the CMU police officers Thursday in fear saying he believed someone was trying to hurt him. Davis was ""very vague"" and claimed someone had a gun. The officers investigated and were able to identify someone who ""may have been threatening Davis.""

The individual was found and interviewed to see if there was a threat. During that time, officers were talking to Davis who was ""not making much sense."" The officers determined there was no risk to Davis.

A few hours later, officers found Davis in the dorm's hallway with his suitcases and bags acting ""unreasonable."" The officers asked him to call his parents. The officers spoke to Davis' mother to tell her about her son's recent behavior. The officer said they were suspicious of drugs. Following the conversation, Davis was taken to the hospital.

CMU STUDENT’S FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS REACT TO NEWS OF PARENTS’ DEATHS

Davis stayed at the hospital until his parents picked him up the next day. The family went to the school's campus to pick up his bags and take him home, Yeagley said.

Surveillance video appeared to show Davis Jr. in the dorm's parking lot with the gun before going into the building where his parents were shot. Following the incident, the 19-year-old fled on foot and ran on railroad tracks. Authorities were able to recover the weapon at the scene.

Yeagley said the investigation was ongoing. A motive was not immediately clear.

The shooting at Campbell Hall occurred on a day when parents were arriving to pick up students for the beginning of a weeklong spring break.

Yeagley also said authorities were able to track Davis due to a tip from a railroad employee. The student is being treated at McLaren Hospital. He was reportedly ""hypothermic and confused"" when he was taken into police custody, the Lansing State Journal reported.

The New York Times failed to do this with an error-filled piece that incorrectly claims President Trump “peppered his remarks with inaccurate facts about mass shootings and gun policy” Wednesday in a meeting with members of Congress.

I have a bit of a personal stake in this, as President Trump was using arguments that I have been making for many years in my earlier academic research at universities on gun control laws and public safety and in my role as founder and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center.

By any objective standard, truth in labeling would show that the Times article by Linda Qui is not a fact check at all, but simply a political attack on President Trump, with no attempt to understand the arguments he is making.

At his televised meeting with lawmakers, the president stated: “You take Pulse nightclub, if you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did.”

Qui rates this statement by the president as “false.” “There was, in fact, an off-duty police officer working in the nightclub at the time of the shooting,” she writes.

But in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando – when a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 58 others – the police officer on guard was the first person who was shot at. An officer’s uniform is like a neon sign saying “shoot me first.”

The same targeting of uniformed officers happened at the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris in 2015, when two brothers shot and killed 12 people and injured 11 others. And it happened again last year when a gunman shot and killed 39 people and wounded at least 70 others in Istanbul in Turkey.

Attackers are not stupid. They want to eliminate anyone who poses an immediate threat at the outset of their attack. If a police officer or security guard in uniform is the only person with a gun, shooting him will give shooters free reign to kill others. Florida is one of only 10 states that ban civilians from carrying guns at nightclubs.

What President Trump had in mind was concealed carrying of a handgun. If one or more people who aren’t obvious guards are armed, attackers won’t be able to identify them, and so won’t know who they need to attack first. This is a critical distinction that Qui ignores.

Concealed handgun permit holders make a guard's job much safer, because an attacker won't be able to attack the guard without worrying that someone behind him or to his side might be able to stop him with a bullet. It is the concealed handgun permit holder who can’t be identified as having a weapon who takes away the attacker’s strategic advantage.

President Trump also stated in his meeting Wednesday: “98 percent of all mass shootings in the United States since 1950 have taken place in gun-free zones.”

Qui claims that this is “disputed” because gun-free zone prohibitions don’t “account for weapons being carried by law enforcement officers, military troops or licensed professional security personnel.”

Criticizing my research, Qui writes that “Lott’s data set included military bases like Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard.” But my point is valid. Whether the person guarding the place is a uniformed police officer or a security guard, they are the first target for these attackers.

Regular military members are banned from carrying guns at military bases in the United States, making the bases surprisingly soft targets. The only people who can carry guns on domestic bases are military police, so the situation is much the same as at the Pulse nightclub.

Fort Hood in Texas – where a U.S. Army major shot and killed 13 people and wounded 30 others in 2009 – is like a medium-sized city, with military police driving around just as police do in any city.

Terrorists can kill the police first, wait for them to leave, or pick another target. Concealed handgun permit holders take away the strategic advantage that terrorists have in being able to choose the time and place of their attacks.

Qui points to a study by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety that finds “70 percent of mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015 took place in private residences.” Qui cites another study that also counts gang shootings.

But President Trump properly follows the official FBI definition of mass public shootings, which excludes “shootings that resulted from gang or drug violence” or that occurred in the commission of another crime such as robbery.

The FBI also includes only shootings in “public places” such as: commercial areas (malls, stores and other businesses); schools and colleges; open spaces; government properties (including military bases and civilian offices); houses of worship; and health- care facilities.

Qui and the two studies she cites completely ignore the reasons behind the FBI's definition of “mass public shootings.” Shootings in private residences are distinctly different, since they often involve killers who know the homeowners and whether they own guns. If there is a gun in the home, the killer may know who has access to it. And in some cases, one spouse or romantic partner shoots the other.

Mass public shootings are uniquely motivated. Whereas gang fights are typically part of larger turf wars over control of the sale of drugs, the perpetrators of mass public shootings seek to gain publicity by killing or injuring as many people as possible. The remedies for these two types of violence are also vastly different.

The issue of gun-free zones is particularly pertinent to mass public shootings. The number of casualties in an attack depends on the amount of time that elapses before someone with a gun intervenes.

The above responses to Qui’s arguments have been made dozens of times. But Qui apparently didn’t feel it necessary to address them in her piece. Perhaps she didn't think it was necessary because readers of the New York Times would never hear the arguments on the other side.

If we're going to effectively address the problem of mass public shootings, we're going to have to set political biases aside."

Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, tweeted late Thursday that ""POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control.""

About an hour later, Trump appeared to endorse Cox's version of events with a tweet of his own: ""Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!""

On Wednesday, Trump shocked observers during a televised discussion with bipartisan lawmakers by appearing to endorse extreme gun control measures.

“Take the guns first. Go through due process second,” Trump said. “I like taking the guns early.”

JUDGE NAP: TRUMP'S COMMENTS ON DUE PROCESS ARE WHAT GUN OWNERS, NRA FEAR THE MOST

Trump, who has publicly changed his mind on other key issues, also urged Republican lawmakers not to be ""afraid"" of the powerful gun lobby and openly entertained more gun restrictions.

The NRA had reacted quickly to Trump's comments, even before Thursday's meeting.

NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Wednesdsay that Trump’s meeting with lawmakers “made for good TV” but “bad policy.”

She said the organization is “in lock step” with the president on protecting children, but wants to “respect due process.”

During the televised discussion with bipartisan lawmakers on Wednesday, Trump said they and the NRA don’t “have to agree on everything.”

He proceeded to pitch a mix of gun control measures as well as proposals the NRA likes -- such as arming teachers. But his language, at times, was stunning coming from a Republican president.

'Take the guns first. Go through due process second.' - President Trump

“Take the guns first. Go through due process second,” Trump said at the White House. “I like taking the guns early.”

Trump has long been comfortable defying conventional Republican policy tenets, working ever since his entry into the 2016 race to pull the party toward him -- on trade, on entitlements, on infrastructure and more.

If any GOP president could have the ability to test gun control positions without a devastating backlash from his base, it could be the president who once -- ironically -- bragged he could ""shoot somebody"" on Fifth Avenue and not lose votes.

Yet the NRA was one of Trump's biggest 2016 supporters, and has seemed taken aback. The group already has pushed back on his call to raise the purchase age for certain guns to 21.

NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Wednesdsay that Trump’s meeting with lawmakers “made for good TV” but “bad policy.” She said the organization is “in lock step” with the president on protecting children, but wants to “respect due process.”

“We’re talking about punishing innocent Americans and stripping from them constitutional rights without due process and making them pay for what the political class has done,” Loesch said on “The Story” with Martha MacCallum on Wednesday.

“The NRA is also going to protect due process for innocent Americans. That is an approach that we are going to hold to,” Loesch said. “We stressed this to the president. … It is a foundational principle of this country and due process must be protected and respected in terms of going around any solutions.”

The White House, meanwhile, plans to roll out specific policy proposals Thursday aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.

Trump stresses that he and the NRA have a solid bond.

“I’m a fan of the NRA. There’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA,” Trump told lawmakers Wednesday. “These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.”

Trump is expected Thursday to reiterate his support for a bill that bolsters the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, as well as the STOP School Violence Act, which gives grants for preventing school violence.

The president also doubled down Wednesday on his intent to get rid of “bump stocks,” saying they will “be gone shortly.” The firearm modifiers, which can make a semi-automatic weapon fire nearly as rapidly as a fully automatic machine gun, were used in the October 2017 Las Vegas Massacre, where 58 people were killed and hundreds more were injured.

“Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!”

Trump is also expected to call for changes Thursday to the FBI’s tipster program, amid revelations that the bureau received multiple tips about Nikolas Cruz, the teenager accused of killing 17 people at the Parkland, Fla. high school, but failed to stop him.

The president also said he wanted lawmakers “to come up with some ideas” and put them into a “very bipartisan bill.”

Jesse Randall Davidson, 53, allegedly fired at least one shot inside a Dalton High School classroom, then barricaded himself inside until he surrendered to police. Davidson, a social studies teacher, is known as the “radio voice” during the school’s football and basketball games because of his play-by-lay announcements, Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Police revealed details about the high school teacher’s past, including when Davidson went to detectives on March 21, 2016, and said he arranged to have someone killed, AJC reported, citing a police report. He reportedly ordered to have the individual killed because he had an online affair.

Police said they couldn’t verify what Davidson told them or if the individual existed. Davidson was taken to the hospital ""based on him thinking about hurting himself,"" the police report stated.

The school was aware of the incident at the time.

In another incident that occurred January 2017, Davidson was found sitting on the curb about a mile away from Dalton High School and refused to respond to police, the report stated. Davidson had left school early that day after he said he wasn’t feeling well.

Davidson was taken to the hospital and police did not take further action.

Davidson, who has been with the high school since 2004, was arrested Wednesday and charged with aggravated assault, carrying a weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of a gun during commission of a crime and disrupting public school, according to police.

The gunshot heard just before noon ignited panic and chaos among students and faculty members. Some students were sent running down the hallways and out of the school. Others barricaded themselves in classrooms.

“It wasn't a drill. And we had to get down and barricade the doors so nobody could come in. Nobody knew what was going on at the time,” Jayden Boston, a Dalton High School student, told WSB-TV.

Davidson was found with a handgun, which he carried into the building by placing it in his computer case, Dalton Police spokesman Bruce Fraizer said. Police took the 53-year-old into custody after a 30- to 45-minute standoff.

TRUMP CALLS FOR ARMING TEACHERS, RAISING GUN PURCHASE AGE TO STOP ‘SAVAGE SICKO’ SHOOTERS

Wednesday’s incident occurred two weeks after a gunman opened fire inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. President Trump called on arming teachers in classrooms shortly after to increase school safety after the deadly shooting.

“I never said ‘give teachers guns’ like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving ‘concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience- only the best,” Trump tweeted last Thursday when defending his proposal.

It is here, in a nondescript, unmarked warehouse that Tom Fargnoli runs his small gun fabrication business, Just Right Carbines.

As the child of a father who was vehemently anti-gun, Tom saw firearms as a forbidden fruit. His profound curiosity about them may be one of the reasons the 67 year old is today regarded as a gifted designer, fabricator and assembler of them. His 6 1/2 pound semi-automatic carbine has just 44 parts. He sells 75 of them a week on average. Tom speaks in the same way that buyers describe his carbines – simple, reliable, and accurate.

""In 2013, I was at the shot show in Las Vegas, and everything was fine on Monday. Tuesday morning, when I woke up, my gun was illegal in New York State,"" he said.

New York State's passage of the SAFE Act – the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 – was heralded as one of the strictest in the country. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's comments at the time, coming in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, might have well been spoken today after yet another mass shooting.

""Mentally ill people should not have access to guns. Criminals should not have access to guns. You should limit these high capacity magazines. Why? Because if, God forbid, the gun winds up in the wrong hands of someone you want to limit the danger,"" he said.

A growing number of gun manufacturers are leaving states like New York and California, which have unleashed a wave of strict gun control laws the past few years. Companies like Fargnoli are now becoming a rare breed in the Empire State as many flee to more gun-friendly states.

Fargnoli believes many of the SAFE Act restrictions were arbitrary and random. No more pistol grip. No more threaded barrel. It meant redesigning components, and finding new out-of-state-suppliers. Asked if he lost a lot of business, he replied, ""If 10 percent is a lot. It hurt us.""

Yet, the SAFE Act mandated no changes to the working parts of what critics call ""assault"" weapons – the very types of carbines Fargnoli and his staff of seven employees assemble.

""They are literally identical, they are interchangeable,"" said Scott Braum, counsel to Just Right Carbines. ""They're all the same function, they're all the same operation. They're all the same caliber. They just look different.""

One of the sponsors of the SAFE Act disagrees.

""These cosmetic changes are not cosmetic at all,"" says Jeff Klein, who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. He described them as ""features that enhance one-handed shooting comfort and rapid reloading capabilities that no sportsman needs.""

Just Right Carbines has found that even changing the color of its rifles, from black to a wood-grained metal, or to an American flag design, appeases some anti-gun legislators.

The ever increasing costs of compliance has driven many gunsmiths out of New York and other states southward to more gun friendly states. Remington, in business here since the 19th century, recently relocated to Alabama. Beretta pulled out of Maryland for Tennessee. KAHR Arms moved to Pennsylvania. So far, Fargnoli is resisting.

""I have 11 grandchildren and one on the way. And I can tell you my wife’s not leaving them. So moving the business isn't going to happen for me,"" he said.

And he ponders whether more laws will work when existing ones didn't. He notes that concerned citizens raised countless red flags about Nicolas Cruz. Most were ignored or casually dismissed by authorities, in what amounts to an utter failure by government institutions. A reality, he believes, that reinforces a citizen’s right – and need – to keep and bear arms.

""What they take away will never give back,"" he said."

During an event at the White House, the president announced he signed a memo ordering the regulations on “bump stocks” and told Sessions he wants new federal guidelines finalized “very soon.

He also signaled support for additional changes to gun legislation, tweeting Tuesday evening, “Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!”

The memo, released by the White House on Tuesday, directs the DOJ to propose a rule “banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.”

Trump wrote in the memo, “Although the Obama administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns.”

GUN LAW CHANGES ATTRACT RENEWED GOP INTEREST

A spokesman for the DOJ said it is acting ""quickly"" on the president's order.

“The department understands this is a priority for the president and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process,"" spokesman Sarah Isgur Flores said. ""We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed.”

During Tuesday’s press briefing, the White House said the president opposes the “bump stock” rifle modifier, which make semi-automatic firearms fire faster.

“I can tell you the president supports not having the use of bump stocks and that we expect further action on that in the coming days,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday.

Sanders added that the president had ordered the Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to review the regulation of bump stocks after a gunman opened fire on concert-goers on the Las Vegas strip in October, killing more than 50 people.

“My understanding is that review has been completed and movement will take place on that shortly,” Sanders said.

In the wake of last week’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people, Sanders said Trump plans to host parents, teachers and students on Wednesday to discuss “efforts to ensure safety at our schools.” Among those attending will be members of the Parkland community and those affected by the Sandy Hook and Columbine school shootings, the White House added.

Liberals have renewed calls for new gun control measures after last week’s shooting. Trump, who was backed by the NRA during the 2016 election, has expressed support for the Second Amendment and has said he’s against reflexive gun control measures that wouldn’t make a difference.

Sanders said the White House hasn’t “closed the door on any front.”

She also said, “The president has expressed his support for efforts to improve the federal background system and in the coming days we will continue to explore ways to ensure the safety and security of our schools.”

Meanwhile, the state House in Florida, days after the Parkland shooting, on Tuesday voted down a motion to take up a bill that would ban so-called assault rifles, effectively killing the measure for this session. The motion failed by a 36-71 vote.

Just weeks earlier, YouTube announced it would hire thousands of additonal human moderators to ensure that inappropriate videos are removed from the website, while continuing to develop automated moderating solutions.

But amid this week's national conversation on gun rights, some users said YouTube's moderators were nixing their legitimate uploads, Bloomberg reported.

For example, the owner of the popular Military Arms Channel on YouTube, which has more than 650,000 subscribers, said in a Facebook post that moderators removed three of his videos: ""Sure Shot Exploding Targets,"" ""MAC Opens a Gun Shop - Copper Custom,"" and ""New Kel-Tec RDB Bullpup.""

The videos are not conspiratorial or overtly political in nature. The Kel-Tec video, for example, is a mostly techincal rundown of the features of an upcoming rifle from the company, and features footage of a man firing the weapon.

Those videos are currently back online, but Tim Harmsen, founder of the Military Arms Channel, said Monday that YouTube had temporarily prevented the channel from posting new videos.

PROFESSOR ACCUSES GOOGLE OF CENSORSHIP

""As of this moment I cannot post new videos to YouTube for two weeks,"" the channel's owner, Tim Harmsen, wrote. ""Apparently if YouTube agrees with your political motivation, they side with the political trolls and disregard their own rules against reporting community standard compliant videos.""

""Apparently if YouTube agrees with your political motivation, they side with the political trolls and disregard their own rules ..."" - Military Arms Channel founder Tim Harmsen

Bloomberg, citing the website Outline, also reported that several other accounts with fringe political messages -- including one run by Titus Frost, who tweeted that Parkland survivor David Hogg is a crisis actor -- were also banned.

New York Times bestselling author and Infowars D.C. bureau chief Jerome Corsi also tweeted Tuesday that YouTube had removed some of his content and temporarily banned him.

An outright ban of fringe commentators would signal an escalation in YouTube's content-policing tactics, Bloomberg reported.

The video-sharing website's policies prohibit ""harmful"" or ""dangerous"" content, as well as hateful and harassing uploads.

YouTube did not comment on specific deletions, but said that its moderators may have made mistakes.

""As we work to hire rapidly and ramp up our policy enforcement teams throughout 2018, newer members may misapply some of our policies resulting in mistaken removals,"" a YouTube spokeswoman told Bloomberg. ""We’re continuing to enforce our existing policies regarding harmful and dangerous content, they have not changed. We’ll reinstate any videos that were removed in error."""

Federal officials said the Air Force didn't submit Devin Patrick Kelley's criminal history even though it was required to do so by Pentagon rules.

Kelley, 26, was found guilty of assault in an Air Force court-martial in 2012 for abusing his wife and her child and was given 12 months' confinement followed by a bad-conduct discharge in 2014. That same year, authorities said, he bought the first of four weapons.

Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel for crimes like assault should be submitted to the FBI's Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division.

It's the kind of lapse that gun-control advocates say points to loopholes and failures with the background check system.

At issue is the Lautenberg Amendment, enacted by Congress in 1996. The federal law was designed to prohibit people convicted of domestic violence from buying or possessing a firearm regardless of whether the crime was a felony or a misdemeanor.

""This is exactly the guy the Lautenberg Amendment is supposed to prevent from possessing a firearm,"" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and former judge advocate. ""Of course, the law only works if folks are abiding by the law.""

Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in an email that the service is launching a review of its handling of Kelley's case and taking a comprehensive look at Air Force databases to make sure other cases have been reported correctly.

An initial review indicates that Kelley's conviction was not entered into the federal database by officials at Holloman Air Force Base's Office of Special Investigations, the Air Force said.

Kelley served at Holloman in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge. He was in logistics, responsible for moving passengers and cargo.

Law enforcement authorities said Kelley owned four guns, including the three he had with him during the attack: a Ruger AR-15 that was used in the church and two handguns that were in his car. The weapons were purchased — one each year — from 2014 to this year.

A 2015 report by the Pentagon's inspector general found lapses in the military's reporting to civilian authorities of domestic violence convictions.

From Nov. 30, 1998, until last week, firearms purchases in the U.S. were denied 136,502 times because of a domestic violence conviction, according to Justice Department statistics.

""The fact this guy was even court-martialed at all indicates it reached a certain level of severity that should act as a red flag that this is a dangerous person and shouldn't have a gun,"" said Lindsay Nichols, the federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, named after former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was gravely wounded by a gunman in 2011.

Lawyers for Jose Ines Garcia Zarate on Thursday claimed that the judge presiding over the murder trial failed to properly instruct jurors before they acquitted him.

Zarate’s lawyers argued in court papers that the jury should’ve considered the claim that he didn’t know he was holding a gun when it fired on San Francisco’s Pier 14 in July 2015.

Lawyers also argued their client didn’t hold the gun long enough to warrant a firearm possession conviction.

The judge declined to include those instructions and jurors convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

They smash through front doors, with stolen vehicles if necessary, to steal dozens of firearms in seconds.

And it’s happening all across the country.

Just this week, brazen thieves broke into the Warhorse Firearms shop in Littleton, Colo. and stole 27 semi-automatic rifles just before 3 a.m. No arrests have been made in the case.

ATF officials say it’s a troubling new trend. Instead of stealing a gun from a home or street corner, thieves are now targeting gun stores where they could steal a handful or dozens of firearms at a time.

""This is our top priority at ATF,"" according Lisa Meiman, spokesperson for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which tracks gun thefts nationwide.

CALIFORNIA STUN-GUN ROBBERY SPREE: 3 WOMEN ON THE LOOSE IN LA AREA

In 2012, there was a total of 5,762 guns stolen in America, according to the ATF. Last year, that number jumped to 9,281. That includes guns taken in robberies, burglaries and simple larcenies. In the same period, the number of gun shop robberies, defined as thefts committed during business hours with staff present, increased by 175 percent, ATF said.

Many happen at night, with thieves using vehicles to smash through doors, grab as many guns as possible and leave before police get there.

SHERIFF: FUGITIVE CAPTURE TURNS INTO SEARCH FOR MISSING MAN

That's exactly what happened at the Sunshine State Armory in Zephyrhills, Florida last April. Police have not said how many guns were stolen in that case.

In March, thieves broke through the front doors of the 50 West Armory in Chantilly, Virginia. They were seen on security camera videos grabbing 35 firearms. Manager Scott Wahl said police responded within minutes, but the crooks were gone in just 48 seconds.

Most of these so-called smash and grabs are anything but random. They are committed by professional thieves who target store after store in coordinated break-ins, authorities said.

""Guns serve almost as a form of currency in many gangs,"" Meiman explains. ""You can barter for drugs or for favors. They give them to their criminal friends and associates, they use them in other crimes.""

Worst of all, Meiman said, everyone knows where these guns end up.

""They are not used as trophies, they are not going to be used for hunting,” she said. “They are going to be used in future crimes and potentially hurt people and maybe even cause death.""

Federal officials say they really have no idea why the numbers of gun thefts have increased so dramatically in recent years, but they acknowledge the problem is growing worse year by year.

The ATF says there are no federal security regulations gun stores have to follow, only recommendations.

Joshua Barton, who owns DCF Guns in Castle Rock, Colorado said most guns shop owners use the best security they can.

""We have state-of-the-art alarm systems and camera systems,” Barton said. “There's a certain amount of loss that's acceptable in a lot of retail businesses. In ours, it's not.""

Barton installed concrete and metals barriers in front of his store. They stopped a jeep that tried to ram the entrance in June. But, a week later, the thieves came back, tied tow cables to the front door and simply ripped them off the hinges.

""The community needs to know that this stuff is taken very seriously,"" he said. ""And there's a lot of money that goes into making sure that things like this are prevented. Unfortunately, like any other burglary, things are going to happen."""

Earl Ray Tomblin’s veto on Saturday in a bipartisan effort to enact permitless gun carry in the state.

Beginning June 5, anyone over age 21 who can legally possess a firearm will be allowed to carry it concealed on their person without having to obtain a permit. West Virginia has long allowed permitless open carry but, like most states, required a permit to carry a concealed firearm. With the new law the state will become the eighth in the nation to implement what gun rights activists call “constitutional carry.”

The law also creates a provisional permitting process for those between the ages of 18 and 20 who wish to carry a concealed firearm within the state. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 had previously been excluded from the permitting process altogether.

West Virginia’s move to permitless carry marks the continuation of a national trend that began in 2003. Before then, only Vermont allowed law-abiding adults to carry concealed firearms without a permit. The pace accelerated over the last five years, with seven states adopting the policy.

Concealed carry laws vary from state to state, but most adhere to one of three basic structures. The most popular, which is in effect in 34 states, is commonly referred to as a “shall-issue” structure, where applicants must be issued a permit if they pass a background check along with whatever training and identification requirements are set by the state.

The most restrictive type of concealed carry law, adopted by only eight states, is the “may-issue” structure in which applicants can still be denied a permit even if they meet all of the requirements set out by the state. May-issue concealed carry laws often issue very few concealed carry permits to residents.

The regulation, issued in the final months of President Barack Obama's term, is one of a handful congressional Republicans are rolling back, knowing they habe a new ally in the White House. The Senate is poised to scuttle an Obama rule preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams.

""In my home state of Kentucky and others across the nation, the Stream Buffer Rule will cause major damage to communities and threaten coal jobs,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

The House passed the gun resolution on Wednesday and Senate approval on Thursday will send the measure to Trump for his signature.

Obama's background check rule required the Social Security Administration to forward to the Justice Department the names of certain disabled beneficiaries for a database of individuals ineligible to purchase a firearm. The rule affects an estimated 75,000 beneficiaries who require a representative to manage their benefits because of a disabling mental disorder.

Republican lawmakers criticized the regulation for reinforcing a negative stereotype that people with a mental disorder are dangerous.

""There are people who need help and seek help, but that is not a criteria for taking away one's constitutional right"" to own a gun, said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.

After the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama directed the Justice Department to provide guidance to agencies regarding information they are obligated to report to the background check system. The Social Security Administration issued a final rule on Dec. 19 that spells out when the names of beneficiaries must be forwarded to the database that federally licensed gun dealers consult before selling a firearm.

In Newtown, 20 children and six educators were shot to death when a gunman entered the Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012. The gunman had earlier killed his mother inside their home, and he used a gun and ammunition that she had purchased.

Democrats said Republicans were doing the bidding of the National Rifle Association, which opposed the Social Security Administration's rule. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said his constituents have a right not to be victims of gun violence.

""They have a right to protect their loved ones who may use a weapon against themselves or their family members,"" McGovern said.

While gun rights groups have weighed in with opposition to the regulation, some advocates for the disabled have also said the regulation is discriminatory. The agency that advises the president and Congress on government policy, the National Council on Disability, said there is no connection between the inability to manage money and the ability to safely possess and use a firearm.

Republicans are employing a rarely-used tool to roll back some of the rules issued in the final months of Obama's tenure. The Congressional Review Act allows provides a temporary window for a simple majority of both chambers to invalidate the rule. Trump would also have to sign the resolution of disapproval for the regulation to be deemed invalid. What's more, the law prevents the executive branch from imposing substantially similar regulations in the future.

Among the top priorities for the GOP is to scuttle the rule to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. The Interior Department said in announcing the rule in December that it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests, preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby waters. The rule maintains a long-established 100-foot buffer zone that blocks coal mining near streams, but imposes stricter guidelines for exceptions to the 100-foot rule.

Interior officials said the rule would cause only modest job losses in coal country and could even create jobs as companies hire construction crews to haul and store debris.

Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., said repealing the stream protection rule would ""sicken and kill the very people Donald Trump falsely promised to help,"" coal miners in West Virginia and other states."

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, had commissioned the Government Accountability Office report to look into how online private dealers might be selling guns to people not allowed to have them.

Their efforts were based on a 2016 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which claimed that “anonymity of the internet makes it an ideal means for prohibited individuals to obtain illegal firearms.”

“Congressional requesters asked that GAO access the extent to which ATF is enforcing existing laws and investigate whether online private sellers sell firearms to people who are not allowed or eligible to possess a firearm,” the GAO report said.

Over the course of the two-and-a-half year investigation, agents tried to buy firearms illegally on the “Surface Web” and the “Dark Web,” generally by sharing their status as “prohibited individuals” or trying to buy across state lines.

But the GAO revealed that their 72 attempts outside of the dark web were all “unsuccessful.”

“Private sellers on Surface Web gun forums and in classified ads were unwilling to sell a firearm to our agents that self-identified as being prohibited from possessing a firearm,” the GAO reported, noting that in their “72 attempts ... 56 sellers refused to complete a transaction once we revealed that either the shipping address was across state lines or that we were prohibited by law from owning firearms.” In the other cases, the investigators' website was frozen or they encountered suspected scammers.

On the dark web, GAO agents successfully purchased two guns illegally, as the serial numbers on the weapons were “obliterated” and “shipped across state lines.” But in the attempt to purchase, the GAO agents “did not disclose any information indicating they were prohibited from possessing a firearm.”

Based on the findings of the study, the GAO said it is “not making recommendations in this report.”

Cummings, Warren and Schatz did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on the GAO’s findings.

The National Rifle Association seized on the report to claim that online sales are in fact regulated, calling the study an ""embarrassment"" for the gun control lobby.

“GAO’s findings showed nothing so much as that private sellers advertising online are knowledgeable about the law, conscientious, and self-policing,” The National Rifle Association said, adding that online gun sales are “subject to the same federal laws that apply to any other commercial or private gun sales.”

The NRA described the study as an attempt to model the findings of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s 2015 report, titled “Point, Click, Fire: An investigation of illegal online gun sales,” which found that 62 percent of private sellers were willing to proceed with a sale, even if the prospective purchaser could not pass a background check."

This is what a recent Pew Research poll discovered in a deep dive into the complex relationship Americans have with guns.

According to the poll, “The nationally representative survey of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, was conducted March 13 to 27 and April 4 to 18, 2017, using the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel.” In other words, the survey is pretty comprehensive. And its findings reflect the understanding of many clear-thinking Americans on the 2nd Amendment: for those who do own and use firearms, it is integral to who they are.

Guns are ubiquitous in our culture. Both the bad guys and the heroes utilize them in movies and books, which accurately reflects reality – the bad guys will always have guns and good guys know that firearms are an effective tool for securing property and protecting loved ones. In other words, gun ownership is completely normal, and – contrary to what the gun grabbers and “security liberals” would have you believe – safe.

There is a direct correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and less crime. Urban areas have fewer lawfully obtained guns and higher levels of criminal activity. Socioeconomics are a driver, but the impact of burdensome laws on who can own and carry firearms in urban areas plays a distinct role in lowering safety levels for residents.

Only a third of Americans expressed that they do not nor would they ever consider owning a firearm. A healthy 66 percent of gun owners, a significant portion of whom own more than one, would never consider not owning one. These people exist in a culture where gun ownership is the norm. It would be interesting to see the minority of Americans who eschew guns react to the findings here.

The survey results show a clear relationship between the conscious choice to own a gun and the exercise of personal freedom. Other studies on crime and gun owners have found that gun owners commit fewer crimes as a population than the police. The civilizing factor of owning a firearm increases the level of responsibility that must be exercised. This positively impacts everyone in proximity to gun owners.

Of note: only 19 percent of those dwelling in urban environments, where crime is the highest, own guns. In rural areas where crime is exceedingly low, 46 percent of those surveyed reported owning a gun. Of suburban respondents, 28 percent own guns. To place a finer point on the data, in just one out of five homes in an urban environment will an intruder face the possibility of a homeowner defending his home and loved ones with a gun. In a rural area an invader faces a nearly 50/50 chance, hence the miniscule incidences of criminal activity.

Another point worth noting is that while most gun owners could never see themselves not owning a gun, they have no desire to force others to possess them. Conversely, many Americans who do not own firearms have an almost compulsive desire to disarm law-abiding gun owners even as proof mounts against the efficacy of confiscation and disarmament. When guns are regulated away from those who seek them lawfully, only the criminals are armed.

Americans’ broad exposure to guns includes an overwhelming number who have fired a gun or have lived in a home with a gun owner. Approximately seven out of ten Americans have fired a weapon at least once.

Again, guns are tools and Americans have experienced their use as normal. The research done by Pew exposes the lesser-known facts surrounding firearm ownership and America’s relationship with guns. One thing is patently clear: guns aren’t going anywhere because Americans who own guns associate them with liberty and self-reliance. And that’s a good thing.

The Second Amendment spat began in 2013, when Gov. Bill Haslam signed into law the controversial “Guns in Parking Lots"" bill. But the original law, which stated citizens with permits to carry guns can keep them in their cars on company property even if the employer bars them, only protected citizens against prosecution, not firing. The Tennessee Firearms Association dubbed the law the “Lose Your Job if You Commute Act.”

Now, pro-gun politicians say they have fixed the law.

“No employer shall discharge or take any adverse employment action against an employee solely for transporting or storing a firearm or firearms ammunition in an employer parking area,” reads an amended version of the bill, signed into law earlier this month by Haslam, a Republican.

“The employer cannot [fire you] simply because you have a permit or a gun in your car.” - Tennessee Rep. Mike Carter

An estimated 500,000 residents of Tennessee have permits to carry guns, and in a state where hunting is popular, having guns secured inside a car is not uncommon. While employers usually would not know if cars in their parking lots contained firearms, there are ways it could be brought to their attention, according to University of Tennessee Law Professor Dwight Aarons.

“Maybe there’s a broken window in the car, or a drug sweep or somebody being careless where someone is talking too much, saying they have a gun in their car -- there are a thousand other different ways,” Aarons told FoxNews.com.

The amended bill had overwhelming support in Nashville’s GOP-dominated Statehouse, but was opposed by a coalition of groups that included Democrats, gun control advocates and the state Chamber of Commerce.

“It’s outrageous,” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart, who told FoxNews.com businesses are now forced to allow people with weapons on their private property. “What’s next? Are we going to have a law that forces a family to let an armed person into their living room? Where does it stop?”

The law’s sponsors initially thought employees were protected, but then-Attorney General Robert Cooper, a Democrat, issued an opinion months after its passage that the law did not prevent employers from firing workers who brought guns to the job site.

Vice President of the State’s Chamber of Commerce Bradley Jackson said his group opposes the law because it sends a bad message to employers.

“It violates our personal property rights and tramples all over it,” said Jackson. “It’s going to be costly to defend in court,” adding the law also compromises business’ ability to maintain a safe workplace.

State Rep. Curry Todd, the Republican who sponsored the bill in the legislature’s lower chamber, said the new version clears up legal confusion. But fellow lawmakers were quick to say it can’t be used as a defense for employers fired with other justification.

“The employer cannot [fire you] simply because you have a permit or a gun in your car,” Republican State Rep. Mike Carter told The Tennessean. “But if you sue alleging that, you have to prove that was the sole reason you were terminated. If you were late to work and terminated, no dice,” said Carter.

Nearly 20 states have adopted laws that ban employers, including school districts in many cases, from restricting guns in their parking lots, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

New York lawmakers passed the SAFE Act last year, and announced with fanfare that it effectively banned the sale of “assault weapons.” But AR-15s, the most popular type of guns often referred to as assault weapons, are sold in Empire State gun shops, freely and legally. The gun is being marketed by Stag Arms as a ""New York-compliant AR-15,"" and features a slightly modified stock and no bells and whistles. The gun does not have a pistol grip, for instance - one of the features banned by the act.

""This just shows that the gun prohibition lobby uses symbolic gestures over substance to push their anti-gun rights agenda. Banning guns based on cosmetic features proves that point,"" Alan Gottlieb, president of the Second Amendment Foundation, told FoxNews.com.

[pullquote]

Gun-rights supporters say it illustrates that so-called “assault weapons” – an often-used term with no single definition – are usually no more dangerous than hunting rifles. The ""AR"" in AR-15 does not stand for ""assault rifle,"" as commonly believed, but for ""Armalite Rifle.""

In New York, an assault weapon is defined as any semi-automatic rifle that accepts a magazine and has any of a list of ten features, ranging from a pistol-like grip to a flash suppressor to a bayonet mount.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center – all groups that support more gun control – declined to comment or did not answer questions from FoxNews.com about the effectiveness of assault-weapons bans.

The New York Attorney General’s office referred questions to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office, which did not respond.

Cuomo’s website boasts that the state has “the toughest assault weapons ban in the country” and that “under the legislation, the Bushmaster used in the Newtown, Conn., shooting will be illegal.”

Gottlieb said that may be well-intentioned but is ineffective at best.

“Some of the guns they’re banning are the safest guns,"" he said. ""There aren’t many accidents committed with Bushmaster rifles, and there are a number of times that so-called assault rifles have been used in self defense.”

Some gun dealers in New York State say they are glad to be selling AR-15s again.

“Believe it or not, if I had a hundred of things to sell, they’d already be gone. I’m hoping to have them in my shop in the next two weeks,” Justin Reickart, who runs H&H Guns in southwestern New York, told FoxNews.com.

“We’ve already showed it to about a dozen people, just a picture of what it's going to be, and the younger generation – they already love it. They’re like, it’s same gun, just with a sci-fi looking stock. The suggested retail price is going to be $1,050. Prior to the ban, you would have been able to buy the gun for $949 – so it adds $100, to make it New York compliant.”

Asked why people want AR-15s, Reickart said they are simply good guns.

“It’s a universal gun that you can put in anybody’s hands… I’ve used it for coyote hunting, deer hunting... it’s a fun and enjoyable gun to shoot,” he said.

Reickart got attention last year when he developed his own AR-15 which he believed complied with New York law – but he decided not to actually sell the gun because the State Attorney General would not give written confirmation that it followed state law.

For New York gun owners with existing non-compliant AR-15s, they either have to register their gun with the state by April 15 or modify it to comply with the law.

Some gun owners are hesitant to register their guns, some for fear that the list would later be used for gun confiscation as just recently happened in New York City.

To avoid that, some owners of old AR-15s are modifying them so that they no longer classify as “assault weapons.” One company, S&B Products, offers a “spur” to replace the pistol grip.

“The New York State Police have told us that by removing all of the prohibited design characteristics the rifle is no longer considered an ""assault weapon"" and is therefore not subject to the registration requirement,” Steve Byron, President of S&B Products, told FoxNews.com.

Byron said he thought the triviality of the modifications shows that the law is not productive.

“I believe politicians should not write and pass laws about something they know nothing about,” he said.

The candidate, Austin Petersen, published an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on his campaign website on Thursday and argued his situation was part of a larger trend of unfairness towards conservatives.

“It’s difficult to ignore that this action comes during a period of heightened tension regarding Facebook’s role in our elections, and its perceived bias against conservative voices,” Petersen wrote.

In his letter, Petersen said he has made Facebook a centerpiece of his campaign’s outreach efforts.

“That’s why, on September 22, I was so shocked to receive a notification from Facebook informing me that I had been ‘blocked’ from using Facebook for thirty days because I ‘recently posted something that violates Facebook’s policies,’” he wrote.

Petersen said a Facebook Live video he posted to his campaign’s page promoting the AR-15 giveaway for supporters was removed. He also said a status update posted to his profile referencing the giveaway was also removed.

“I’m confident that such giveaways are consistent with Facebook’s policies...so it’s unclear to me why such content would warrant an immediate takedown and thirty-day ban,” he said.

A spokesman for Facebook did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News.

But Facebook’s “community standards” website says the trade of firearms is prohibited on the site.

“The purchase, sale or trade of firearms, ammunition and explosives between private individuals isn't allowed on Facebook,” it says.

Petersen said in the letter that he reached out to Facebook for more information, but he has not yet received an explanation and the block remains in effect.

He also wrote in the letter that Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has contributed money to Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill – something he says “does not inspire confidence in Facebook’s neutrality.”

Donor records indicate Sandberg donated $5,400 to McCaskill in January.

It’s common for campaigns to create petitions as a way to collect names and contact information of potential supporters. Petersen’s giveaway requires people to sign a petition on his website to be entered to into a raffle for the rifle.

“Austin Petersen will always be a strong ally of the Second Amendment, and we know you will be too,” the site says. “That's why, when you add your name to this petition and stand up to defend the Second Amendment, we'll add your name into a raffle to win an AR-15! Yes, it really is that simple; no strings attached.”

Petersen’s fight with Facebook comes as President Trump has argued the site is biased against him.

BIG TECH TITANS SUMMONED TO CAPITOL HILL

“Facebook was always anti-Trump,” the president tweeted Wednesday, amid recent questions about how the site was used by the Russians to try to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Facebook’s announced earlier this month that it had uncovered $100,000 worth of fraudulent ad spending across its network tied to the presidential race.

Along with Twitter and Google, Facebook has been invited by lawmakers to testify on Capitol Hill as Congress ramps up scrutiny of Russia’s meddling.

fox23,fox,['Diane Macedo'],2010-05-06 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/06/exclusive-toy-gun-sold-easily-turned-real-thing.html,"Felons, illegal immigrants and all others banned from buying a gun in the United States have a new alternative if they’re looking to get their hands on a firearm: Just buy a toy.

A FoxNews.com investigation reveals that a popular recreational pellet gun can be converted easily to a real semi-automatic weapon. And while the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is already aware of the issue, these “toys” -- new, top-of-the-line airsoft rifles -- continue to be sold throughout the country.

Like paintball without the paint, the propane-powered airsoft guns are designed to shoot quarter-inch plastic pellets and are generally used for recreation or in military and law enforcement training.

When the ATF seized a shipment of 30 of these guns in October from a port in Tacoma, Wash., it said they could be “readily convertible” to machine guns. But gun experts called that claim absurd and said the ATF was overstepping its bounds.

Now one of those critics is reversing his position, saying at least one airsoft manufacturer has taken the quest to be authentic a little too far.

“The airsoft can be converted to an AR-15,” firearms manufacturer Leo Gonnuscio told FoxNews.com after testing the make and model of airsoft guns seized by the ATF.

Having concluded that several other airsoft guns could not be converted to fire real ammunition, Gonnuscio said he was surprised to find that he was able to to transform this particular gun to the real thing -- and with “minimal work,” because its bottom half, or “receiver,” is so similar to an AR-15's.

To make the airsoft receiver function just like an AR-15’s, Gonnuscio said, “All you have to do is drill one hole.”

And once that's out of the way, the rest is even easier. The AR-15 receiver is the only part of the semi-automatic rifle that is given a serial number, and is the only part that is regulated. All the remaining parts of the real thing can be purchased by anyone – any kid, criminal or terrorist.

The cost of buying the Taiwan-made airsoft gun and all the parts needed to convert it to an AR-15 comes to roughly $1,100 -- more than the cost of some real AR-15s. But someone who can’t clear a background check or has been refused a gun for any other reason could use this method to make his own lethal weapon, Gonnuscio said.

Making it into a machine gun, he said, would require yet another conversion, and the makeshift gun would likely be able to fire only 15-20 rounds before it stopped working due to the pressure it would have to withstand while firing in an automatic fashion.

But as semi-automatic weapon, Gonnuscio said, “It may not last forever, but they’ve got a gun to get the job done that they were assigned to do, and nobody knows the wiser.”

The ATF has made no reported moves to regulate or seize any more of the airsoft guns, which continue to be sold in stores around the country, and it appears to be bowing to critics and reconsidering its stance on the guns' convertibility.

“We’re having to take a serious look at this, so it’s just something that we’re reviewing, and I’m hoping we’ll have some information that we can make available to the public certainly very soon,” ATF spokesman Drew Wade told FoxNews.com.

But firearms expert Len Savage said the ATF is taking a “serious look” at the wrong issue -- or, more specifically, the wrong part of the gun.

The reason it’s possible to make these airsoft receivers function as real receivers is that all an AR-15 receiver does is hold the gun together, Savage said. So with enough gun knowledge, almost anything can be made into a receiver.

“There’s a line of AR-15 firearms out there where the lower (the receiver) is made entirely of injection molded plastic … It could be made of cardboard and scotch tape,” he said.

The most important part of an AR-15, and the most difficult part to replicate, he said, is the upper half of the gun -- which is unmarked, unregulated and readily available for purchase.

""The ATF is regulating the wrong part as a firearm receiver, not the part that goes bang,"" Savage said.

“The upper is what contains the barrel, the breech or bolt, that’s what contains all the pressure,” he added.

The reason the lower half of the AR-15 is the part with the serial number, and thus classified as the receiver, is that when the gun was created it was up to the manufacturer to choose the location of the gun’s serial number, he said. Because the bottom of the gun has a flat surface, it was the easiest to mark.

And though federal law has since defined a gun’s receiver as the part “which provides housing for the hammer, bolt, breechblock and firing mechanism,” Savage says the bureau has continued to mark and regulate the lower part of the AR-15 to avoid confusion.

“In the stream of commerce, you’d have uppers that were marked and regulated and then lowers that were marked and regulated, you could see the confusion on a dealer basis” in determining which parts require licensing and which don’t, Savage said.

But even though the upper half of the gun can be bought by anyone, Gonnuscio still says that banning the airsoft receivers and implementing a few new rules for airsoft manufacturers could be a good start to keeping unregulated AR-15s off the street.

“I would hope that the ATF applies pressure to the manufacturers of these airsoft guns to redesign them so they cannot be converted,"" he said. ""Make them move the pin holes ... so that an upper can’t be attached to it without major machining.

""Fill in some of that gap so that they would literally have to chuck this thing up in a mill and totally reconfigure it to work. Tighten up the magazine well so a regular magazine won’t fit in it.”

And because the U.S. is such a big market for these airsoft guns, Gonnuscio said, a foreign manufacture would change the product if its current design were banned here.

“There are tons of good uses for these guns: We use them for training, kids do reenacting with them, kids get out there and play just like the old days. We played BB gun wars when we were kids and we survived. These are little plastic balls that are shot by electricity or propane.

""So let them have their toys. Just make sure they're still toys.”"

""We live in a violent society, even here in Maricopa County, and across our nation, and the least we can do is to arm our deputies…,” Arpaio said, according to Fox 10 News.

Arpaio said Vargas was an eight-year veteran who worked for the Sheriff's Office Custody Support Bureau in the jail's food factory, but he often came into contact with inmates.

Before the shootings happened, Republican state Rep. Andy Holt had offered the AR-15 as a door prize at a fundraiser scheduled for later this month. When he was heavily criticized following Sunday's shootings, he said he would give away a second one as well.

""In response to people saying I shouldn't do this: No, actually we should — and we should celebrate it,"" Holt said in a telephone interview. ""Not in response to what happened in Orlando by all means, but in response to the bans that have been called for.""

Holt, a hog farmer from northwestern Tennessee, was the sponsor of a new law this year to allow faculty and staff at public colleges and universities to be armed on campus. He said that more armed people inside the Orlando club could have intervened before so many people were killed by the gunman.

State Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini in a release on Monday called Holt a reckless gun owner.

""Responsible gun owners don't put guns in the hands of strangers,"" she said. ""Andy Holt doesn't know if he's putting the winning raffle ticket in the hands of the next mass shooter.""

Holt dismissed Mancini's comments as misguided, saying that he plans to do all background checks required by law. He also argued that specific weapons shouldn't be targeted for bans.

""It doesn't matter what the physical characteristics of the gun are,"" he said. ""What matters is that in the hands of an unlawful, crazed individual, a person who is motivated by hate, any instrument can be used as a weapon of destruction.""

Holt said his office was contacted repeatedly by an anonymous caller who said he was armed and threatened to pay him a visit. He said he had forwarded the recorded calls to the Tennessee Highway Patrol's Capitol security unit because the threats were made to a staffer.

Holt said it has become a ""fairly regular occurrence"" for him to receive threatening emails, text messages and phone calls to his home. None has resulted in a personal confrontation.

""But I'm prepared if it does,"" he said."

Warner Bros., the studio that put out the franchise’s other films, was reportedly slated to sign on to the next movie.

The first film, released in 1987, followed Glover, a veteran cop, partnered with a younger, daring officer, Gibson, who work together to solve crime. The two officers, who were very different, go from disliking one another to having a close friendship.

The movie went on to gross more than $120 million and spawn three successful sequels. Glover and Gibson have not starred in a “Lethal Weapon” movie since the fourth film released in 1998.

The movies also led to a television series named after the franchise. The show was in its second season and stars Damon Wayons and Clayne Crawford."

DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is inviting you to demonstrate your MacGyver skills and use them to help keep your fellow Americans safe. And you have five days left to propose your innovation.

The agency will be awarding hefty cash prizes to patriotic Americans who can turn everyday items, like consumer electronics and model airplanes, into weapons and bombs. The key is to identify off-the-shelf products that could be adapted by bad guys to pose a threat to Americans. All together, a successful innovator could win up to about $130,000 for his or her skills.

The foundation for this challenge is improvisation – hence the program’s name: “Improv.” This is your chance to help give the US military the element of surprise.

For those who are handy around the house and love to invent new things, then you could help our nation expect the unexpected. The first deadline is Wednesday 4 pm ET.

DARPA is also reaching out to a wide range of experts, like engineers and biologists, to provide suggestions.

What type of tech?

Any type of commercially available product that could be weaponized is fair game.

Commercial drones have been in the news a lot as potential threats. In January last year, a quadcopter even crashed on the South Lawn of the White House.

But threats could arise from any commercially available tech in determined hands.

Cell phones and model airplanes are frequently flagged as potential threats. Other objects could also be weaponized, such as skydiving and scuba-diving equipment and even toys modified with parts from a coffee maker and hair dryer.

“DARPA’s mission is to create strategic surprise, and the agency primarily does so by pursuing radically innovative and even seemingly impossible technologies,” the DARPA program manager, John Main, said in the program announcement. “Improv is being launched in recognition that strategic surprise can also come from more familiar technologies, adapted and applied in novel ways.”

The threat

So why is DARPA throwing down the improvised weapon gauntlet?

Successful projects could yield new tech for the US military to use against adversaries.

This is your chance to join what DARPA is calling the world’s largest red team, and help play a role in national security. Red teams adopt an adversary’s perspective and challenge conventional wisdom and strategy. A red team member helps find vulnerabilities and anticipate threats.

Terrorist attacks in the past have concealed weapons in a range of ordinary objects. The 2006 liquid bomb plot disguised bomb ingredients as ordinary liquids. In 2010, the humble printer cartridge was used to conceal explosives. Terrorist Richard Reid, the infamous shoe bomber, hid his device in his sneaker. Improvised explosive devices are concealed in a limitless range of ordinary looking objects.

What kind of prizes?

In each phase of the program, multiple awards will be winnable.

The awards are expected to be up to $40,000 per individual in the first phase. For the second phase, the prize could be up to about $70,000 per individual. The final prototype phase could be up to $20,000 per individual award.

DARPA is moving fast on this program, to see what could be made on a tight budget in a brief set time. The competition was announced March 11, 2016 and competitors must submit their ideas by next Wednesday, April 13, 2016, 4:00 p.m ET.

Ideas are to be submitted in the form of an abstract -- more info here.

Those selected will then need to submit their full proposals by May 25, 2016, 4:00 p.m. EST.

Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency officer Andrew Ward went to Outback Steakhouse to have dinner with his wife Friday evening, he wrote in a public Facebook post.

Ward said in the post that a manager approached him and requested that he put his gun in his truck. Ward told the manager that he could not because he was in uniform and had to have his weapon on his person.

The manager left to make a call, Ward writes, and then returned to ask Ward and his wife to leave because Outback is a “gun free zone.”

Ward noted that he does not “blame the manager,” but was angered by the treatment an armed “uniformed Law Enforcement Officer who is sworn to protect and serve the public” received.

Since Ward posted the incident on Facebook, he said a representative for Outback contacted him and apologized for what they called a mistake.

In a statement to NewsChannel9, the Director of Media and Community Relations for Outback’s parents company, Bloomin Brands, said:

“We’ve always allowed uniformed law enforcement officers to carry their side arms inside our restaurants. A manager made a mistake and we have discussed this with her. We have contacted the guest personally and apologized.""

Ward said the chain told him “there was another customer that was ‘scared for her life’ who was seated across” from the couple, and said “she was afraid because ‘police are shooting people.’”

According to Ward’s post, “This customer went on to demand to be escorted to her vehicle out of fear of being shot.”

On Facebook alone, Ward’s story has been shared over 200,000 times and has over 150,000 reactions on Facebook with many calling the actions of the restaurant ""unbelievable.""

Ward continues not to blame the manager for her actions.

On Saturday, Ward told NewsChannel9 that he considers the incident to be over.

“I have spoken with the manger involved, the regional manager and the Vice President of operations for Outback today. They have apologized profusely and I have accepted their apology and the issue in my opinion has been concluded.”

Outback Steakhouse also sent the couple a $100 gift certificate for the ordeal."

Kim Jong Un’s military has been collecting large stockpiles of nerve agents, such as sarin and VX, that could target U.S. military bases in the region and large cities like Seoul and Tokyo, according to a new report.

“Nuclear weapons are not the only threat,” Kelsey Davenport, director of non-proliferation policy for the Arms Control Association told the McClatchy Washington Bureau. “North Korea could respond to a U.S. attack using chemical weapons. That would be devastating.”

While Pyongyang officials deny the rogue regime possesses chemical weapons, the country began developing chemical weapons in 1961 amid rising tensions at that time.

The Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology reports the country has four military bases equipped with chemical weapons and at least 11 facilities where they are produced and stored.

Davenport said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to neutralize North Korea’s chemical weapon stockpile with a preventive strike.

“Compared to the nuclear threat, which involves, a finite number of warheads and delivery systems vulnerable to air defenses and antimissile systems, the chemical threat is not as easily negated,” military analyst Reid Kirby wrote in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.

The report on Pyongyang’s chemical arsenal comes amid rising tensions with the U.S., a conflict which saw an apparent de-escalation this week after North Korean media reported Kim Jong Un had delayed a decision about whether to follow through with his threat to fire missiles toward Guam, a U.S. territory.

President Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday the dictator made a “wise decision” to back down from his threats.

“The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!” Trump wrote.

U.S. military officials have not commented on North Korea’s chemical weapons arsenal.

VX and sarin are two potent nerve agents, which attack the nervous system. Both are banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, but several countries maintain stockpiles.

Trump accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons on its citizens earlier this year, an attack that killed at least 74 people.

“There is legitimate concerns that sustained use of chemical weapons in Syria has lowered the threshold for their use elsewhere,” Davenport said."

After announcing Russia had developed new nuclear weapons, President Vladimir Putin on Thursday invited the nation to offer names for some of them — apparently not worried by Britain's red-faced experience doing the same thing.

In 2016, the most popular choice in an online competition to name a British polar survey vessel was Boaty McBoatface. That ship was eventually christened the Sir David Attenborough in honor of the naturalist, but the goofy moniker became the name of one of the country's remotely operated submarines.

The weapons for which Putin is soliciting names aren't anything to laugh about.

One is a nuclear-powered underwater drone capable of sneaking close to the shore unnoticed and blasting coastal areas away with a powerful nuclear explosion. Another is an atomic-powered cruise missile carrying a nuclear warhead that can fly around the globe and perform sharp maneuvers to dodge enemy defenses.

Just a couple of hours after Putin's speech, the Defense Ministry opened the online name contest.

Since Soviet times, Russia has had a tradition of giving innocuous names to some of the deadliest weapons in the nation's arsenal.

The sea-launched, nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles were named with the Russian words for Liner and Azure. The Tu-160 nuclear-capable strategic bomber was called White Swan.

And the list of names of Russian artillery cannons sounds like a blossoming garden, including the heavy Peony, Hyacinth and Carnation howitzers.

Some of the names in the Russian arsenal also appeared to have a streak of cynical humor, like the Sun Heat rocket launcher that reduces broad areas to scorched desert."
fox35,fox,['Harry J. Kazianis'],2017-08-27 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/08/27/north-korea-likely-tested-weapon-that-could-start-second-korean-war.html,"Question: Why didn’t President Bill Clinton in 1994—when the North Korean nuclear menace was still in its infancy—destroy Pyongyang’s atomic program before it would transform into the existential threat it is today?

Simple. He risked the possibility that the Kim family would, at the very least, rain down a barrage of massive artillery and rocket fire on the capitol of South Korea, Seoul, just some 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone.

As one senior Clinton official told me some months ago: “We just couldn’t take that risk.”

And this weekend’s test of three successful weapons remind us yet again that Pyongyang doesn’t need to fire nuclear missiles at targets in Asia or strike the U.S. homeland to kill scores of people—its conventional weapons can do enough damage all on their own.

In the event of a Second Korean War, North Korea could very well open its assault with such conventional weapons targeting downtown Seoul, home to 25 million people.

So much for the restraint the Trump Administration was commending Pyongyang for just a few days ago.

Indeed, in the event of a Second Korean War—or a continuation of the first, as we must remember, the First Korean War never ended with a treaty but a mere armistice—North Korea could very well open its assault with such weapons targeting downtown Seoul, home to 25 million people in that metro area alone.

Stop and think about it for a second. Kim Jong Un, seems to be reminding us again and again of his capabilities—one at a time.

Over the course of this year alone, Kim has been testing—and showing off—his ability to not only attack with short-, medium- and long-range missiles, but also killing off his half-brother with chemical weapons.

But Friday night Kim seemed to want to make a statement that he can strike with weapons we almost always forget about, with reports claiming that North Korea tested what is referred to as MLRS, or a multiple rocket launcher system, with a range that could put a large portion of South Korea under threat of attack.

Such systems are nothing new and not exactly a novel concept. What is concerning, however, is that the system that was potentially tested, according to reports in South Korean media, was one of North Korea’s more advanced missile systems, a 300-mm artillery rocket launching platform, commonly referred to as the KN-09.

The system, per the Center for Strategic and International Studies, has a range of 190km, carrying a total of eight rockets in two pods of four launchers. These deadly weapons sit on a mobile truck, making them mobile and harder to destroy in a conflict.

The danger of such weapons is obvious: such a platform might just be the ultimate terror weapon.

Consider this: With little or no warning, and if used in combination with more classic artillery platforms, these weapons could do tremendous damage to not only South Korean cities but also incite a mass panic the likes of which has not been seen in decades.

Imagine in Seoul large skyscrapers collapsing thanks to MLRS fired in a surprise attack with millions of people heading for safety. Roads, bridges, and highways would be clogged for miles. Social media worldwide would be filled with images of what looks like 9/11—but far worse than you can possibly imagine.

Now to be fair, such weapons would not last long in a conflict with South Korea and America, and indeed, Kim’s army is no match for Allied forces on the peninsula as it is old and clearly obsolete.

However, as the saying goes, quantity is a quality all its own. And the North Korean military is large—it has over 1 million men under arms, 4,300 tanks, potentially as much as 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and as many as 60 nuclear weapons. In wargame after wargame I have been a part of over the years, millions of people could be killed in a conflict with North Korea—as many as 8 million or more in one simulation I was part of.

Clearly the Trump Administration must redouble its efforts to contain North Korea as much as possible, as Kim Jong Un will no doubt to continue to show off his growing military might. He is also likely trying to sprint towards even more deadly nuclear and missile technologies—pictures coming out of the hermit kingdom last week seem to make that point crystal clear.

In fact, in the coming weeks, we will likely see Kim test another nuclear weapon or ICBM, potentially as early as September 9th, on North Korea’s founding day—the last time Pyongyang tested a nuclear device.

But no matter what Kim does next, he will continue to reinforce his ultimate point—to show that he can reach out and kill someone—lots of someones.

And we need to take that very seriously."
fox36,fox,['Joseph Weber'],2018-02-24 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/24/could-veterans-be-democrats-secret-midterm-weapon.html,"Washington Democrats and their supporters have recruited and backed dozens of military veterans to run in this year’s elections -- even sending some into deep-red districts to challenge the Republican Party for the so-called “guns-and-God” vote and to achieve the party’s ultimate mission of taking control of the House.

“Veterans are especially appealing candidates in key swing districts,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, who served four tours in Iraq and has been leading such efforts, told Fox News. “Veterans have credibility, not just with Democrats, but with independents and Republicans, as well. They’re the kind of people respected for their leadership, not just their politics.”

Moulton has endorsed 19 military veterans in this year’s House races and plans to back a total of 24 -- the exact number of seats Democrats must win to retake control of the House, with primary races starting in just a few months.

Republican have, at least in elections in the past several decades, largely won the military vote, including the 2016 White House race in which Republican Donald Trump took 60 percent of the vote, according to exit polls.

However, Democrats see opportunity this year in what they consider the president’s lack of respect for the military -- including his offhanded remark about Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain being captured in Vietnam and the Trump's public spat with a Gold Star military family.

Moulton, a two-term congressman and Harvard graduate, has at times been critical of Trump, even calling him “draft dodger.” (Trump received a series of student deferments while in college and a medical deferment after graduation, according to Selective Service records.)

But he’s also been outspoken about Washington Democrats and their continued anti-Trump platform, instead touting a pro-jobs message and cultivating what he calls “the next generation of Democrats,” including military veterans.

VoteVets.org, a liberal-leaning political action committee, is backing 36 Democratic military veterans in this year’s congressional races -- three sitting senators and 33 House incumbents or challengers.

The group was founded in 2006 to help veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and who were opposed to the Iraq War, get elected to Congress.

Four of the group’s roughly 46 veteran candidates that year won their congressional race, enough to help Democrats retake the House.

But the group has higher expectations this year, largely because of the “tremendous amount of anti-Trump sentiment” and Democrats being “shut out of everything” from the White House to Congress to statehouses across the country, says Jon Soltz, VoteVets chairman and co-founder.

He also maintains that 2018 candidates are in a better position to win than those in previous years -- considering what they’ve done since leaving the military, and because they have a more solid “infrastructure” of successful Democratic veterans in Congress.

Among the names he mentioned were Moulton, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who in fact lost in 2006, when she first ran for a House seat.

“There’s big difference now,” said Soltz, who points to candidates like Christina Houlahan, a former Air Force officer and nonprofit CEO with degrees from Stanford, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania.

“There’s a broader definition of service,” Soltz continued. “Candidates are much more professional.”

Houlahan is running in the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 6th Congressional District, a suburban Philadelphia seat occupied by GOP incumbent Rep. Ryan Costello. He won re-election in 2016 by 14 percentage points. But Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton essentially tied in the district.

Still, Democrats' efforts to run top-tier veteran candidates to help win back white middle-class voters who went for Trump will be stiff challenge.

The two-year budget deal recently passed by Congress had bipartisan support but was led by Republicans in the GOP-controlled Congress who successfully argued the increased spending in the $400 billion agreement was needed to keep the U.S. military from deteriorating under austere spending caps.

“Our government has no higher responsibility than to support our men and women who are in harm’s way,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said about the measure, which raised the cap on military spending by roughly $160 billion.

In addition, the tax cuts signed last year by Trump, after being passed in Congress without a single Democratic vote, is also presenting a challenge to Democrats, who once appeared poised to have a wave election.

Two recent polls show Democrats losing double-digits leads in so-called “generic” polls that ask potential voters which party they prefer in congressional races, even though history shows the party that doesn’t control the White House historically picks up about 30 seats in a midterm.

The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, whose mission is to help Republicans get elected and reelected to the House, did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the NRCC’s counterpart, told Fox News on Friday that is has more than 40 military veteran candidates in midterm races.

“We’re excited by the incredible candidates with records of service to their nation that have stepped up to run for office this cycle,” said DCCC spokesman Tyler Law. “There’s no doubt that veterans have unique qualifications and experiences that give them important credibility with Democrats, Independents, and Republican voters alike.”

The first real test could come in just a few weeks -- in western Pennsylvania where Democratic nominee Conor Lamb, a federal prosecutor and ex-Marine with an Ivy League law degree, is competing for an open seat against Republican nominee Rick Saccone, a state lawmaker and Air Force veteran.

Trump won the district by nearly 20 points. Lamb is keeping the race close, trailing by about 3 percentage points with voting for the special election on March 13.

Lamb continues to argue that the tax cuts are more of a gift to corporations than to the middle class and that they could have been enacted without increasing the federal debt.

The 33-year-old candidate has also tried to distance himself from the Washington establishment, particularly House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has said the employee bonuses related to the tax cuts amount to “crumbs.”

Meanwhile, Washington Republicans and their political action groups are reportedly spending millions on TV and digital ads to protect the seat.

“Everyone (except Lamb) must be seeing the latest round of polling that shows public support way up for the Republican tax cuts,” the RNC said last week.

In addition, Vice President Pence has stumped in the district for Saccone, and Trump plans to visit before Election Day.

The DCCC seems noncommittal about whether it will continue to put money into the race.

“We’ll continue to monitor that election day by day,” group chairman Rep. Ben Ray Lujan recently said. “But make no mistake, Conor will have the resources he needs to compete.”

Still, his statement is not being viewed as a sign of defeat.

Moulton and others last summer blasted establishment Democrats for investing so much in their failed effort to win a special election congressional race in the Atlanta suburbs, which likely has them trying to avoid the same mistake, as outside groups continue to help Lamb.

Among the other highly touted Democratic military veteran candidates this year are Navy veteran Gil Cisneros, running for the House seat in Southern California now left open by retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce, and Mikie Sherrill, a Naval Academy graduate and former helicopter pilot competing for the House seat left open by retiring GOP Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee

“She just scared him out the race because she’s just an incredible leader,” Moulton recent said on NBC’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”

At the beginning of the 115th Congress, 102 members were either serving or had served in the military. That number was one more than at the beginning of the 114th Congress but six fewer than at the beginning of the 113th Congress. The House has 79 veterans and the Senate has 19, according to information from the Congressional Research Service to Fox News."

On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the U.S. is considering the closure of its embassy in the Cuban capital following a spate of unexplained incidents that have left American diplomats injured.

Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, the Associated Press has reported.

SONIC WEAPONS REPORTED IN CUBA: COULD SOUND BE HARNESSED IN AN ATTACK?

Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential ""sonic attack."" Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms.

The U.S. hasn't identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn't ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba's security services might be involved.

The strange incidents continue to puzzle scientists. There has been speculation that infrasound (a low frequency sound below the human hearing range) or ultrasound (above 20 KHz and can not be heard by humans), may have been harnessed in the attacks.

SOUND WEAPONS THAT DELIVER INVISIBLE AMMO IN SPOTLIGHT AFTER AMERICAN DIPLOMATS INJURED

“Ultimately, devices working in either spectrum could cause hearing damage but it is unlikely to be infrasonic given the size of the speaker required to produce the requisite frequency and decibel level,” explained Dr. Toby Heys, leader of Manchester Metropolitan University’s Future Technologies research centre, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “Infrasound is also very difficult/next to impossible to direct, within current technological dictates.”

""There's no efficient way to focus infrasound to make it into a usable weapon,"" said Mario Svirsky, an expert on ear disorders and neuroscience at New York University School of Medicine.

Heys added that ultrasound could be directed at a target’s head, but would require extremely precise targeting within a building’s infrastructure.

SONIC WEAPON KNOCKS DRONES RIGHT OUT OF THE SKY

Experts say that it is also difficult to explain the concussions experienced by some of the victims of the attacks. Usually, those follow a blow to the head or proximity to something like a bomb blast.

“The frequency-based trauma in question would have to be very severe to cause this,” explained Heys. “There is a history of brain injury and hearing loss that stretches back to WW1 when soldiers had to endure not only the intense and massive sounds of conflict for extended periods of time but also the shock waves produced by large artillery.”

The academic cited a French study in 1918 that concluded, that, when exposed to intense noise over a prolonged period of time, the skull does not particularly protect the brain. “The difference of course here is that this is audible sound, whereas the frequencies in question in Cuba are supposedly ‘non-audible’, which makes it more difficult to explain as a phenomenon,” he added.

The attempted sale, documented in a U.N. report this month, has sparked new concern in the Trump administration, Congress and the U.N. about the proliferation threat posed by Pyongyang's growing nuclear- and ballistic-missile programs, congressional officials and nuclear-weapons experts said.

""The U.N. Panel of Expert's report on North Korea provides further evidence that North Korea will stop at nothing to advance its illicit nuclear and missile programs,"" said Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.) who wrote a new sanctions bill against North Korea last year.

NORTH KOREA COULD HALT NUKE PROGRAM IF SOUTH KOREA, PENTAGON STOP MILITARY DRILLS, CHINA CLAIMS

North Korea's production of the enriched lithium, known as lithium-6, is also seen by nuclear experts as evidence of the country's accelerated efforts to miniaturize a nuclear warhead, potentially for use on ballistic missiles.

Lithium-6 can be used to produce tritium, which is used to flood neutrons into a nuclear device and magnify the explosive power of nuclear detonations, allowing countries to build bombs with smaller amounts of plutonium or uranium, nuclear experts said.

These smaller devices can be affixed to intercontinental ballistic missiles.

""Lithium-6 is ideal, not only for making tritium for boosting fission devices, but also for directly fueling advanced weapons—including thermonuclear bombs,"" said Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon official who heads the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, a Washington think tank.

Lithium also has nonmilitary applications, particularly in producing batteries, lubricants and medicines, nuclear experts said. North Korea is believed to have significant natural deposits of the metal in its soil.

The number of reported attacks using corrosive liquids rose from 261 in 2015 to 454 in 2016, London police said. Some appeared to be related to gang activity or the theft of cars and motorbikes.

Most notably, in April, two people were left partially blinded after acid was sprayed at a crowded east London nightclub. A man has been charged and is awaiting trial.

Other similar high-profile attacks include a 25-year-old man accused of throwing acid at an aspiring model and her cousin as they sat in their car.

In August, an 18-year-old girl was recently given jail time for pouring drain cleaner into a fellow student's viola case in a revenge attack that has left the victim scarred for life.

The use of acid in attacks has even spread to children as young as 12 who have been arming themselves with substances ""for self-defense.""

Heat Street reported in April that students are using acid because it’s much easier to conceal than a knife, with some even placing the liquid in a water bottle. Gang culture has been blamed for the spike in schools.

“A lot of people ain’t got the heart to stab people,” a student told The Sun. “It’s just easier to squirt someone.”

In February, a student was arrested for an attack that left two teenagers and a man scalded after they were splashed with acid during a soccer match in east London.

London police chief Cressida Dick said officers were concerned by the increase in the ""completely barbaric"" attacks.

The spike in attacks has prompted some lawmakers to call for restrictions on the sale and carrying of corrosive liquids such as sulfuric acid.

James Eric Davis, 19, was apprehended just after midnight Saturday, an officer with Mount Pleasant Public Safety told Detroit's Fox 2.

No details were immediately available about where or how Davis was arrested, but the city of Mount Pleasant, Mich., tweeted about the arrest.

Authorities said the student was wanted for fatally shooting his father James Eric Davis Sr., 48, and mother Diva, 47 earlier Friday.

For hours the campus went into lockdown mode while a manhunt involving local and state police also included help from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Mount Pleasant officials said Davis Jr. opened fire inside Campbell Hall at Central Michigan University around 8:30 a.m.

Police described the shooting as a “family-type domestic issue.” The university confirmed that the shooting victims were Davis' parents.

The elder Davis was a part-time police officer in Bellwood, Ill., Bellwood police Chief Jiminez Allen told Detroit's Fox 2.

Vice President Mike Pence commented on the slayings during a stop in Detroit, the Detroit Free Press reported.

""Our hearts go out to the fallen and especially local, state and federal agencies who are working on the apprehension and the investigation,"" Pence said. ""We have to act and we will. We’ve got a lot of work to do. This president and this administration will not rest until we make our schools safe.""

Lt. Larry Klaus said surveillance video suggests that Davis fled on foot after the shooting.

The suspect is from Plainfield, Ill., and graduated high school in 2016, according to spokesman Tom Hernandez of the Plainfield School District.

Illinois state Rep. Emanuel Chris Welch confirmed the deaths on Twitter, calling it ""a sad day in Bellwood."" He said the shooting ""strikes close to home.""

""My sincerest condolences go out to the family of Bellwood Police Officer James Davis Sr. and his wife who were shot and killed this morning,"" he continued. ""May they RIP.""

According to Davis' Twitter page, he was a sophomore at Central Michigan University, slated to graduate in 2020.

Officials described Davis as being approximately 5 feet, 9 inches tall. He was last seen wearing yellow-colored jeans and a blue hoodie with a weapon tucked in his belt. Officials said he may have shed certain clothes while on the run.

Klaus said Davis was taken to a local hospital Thursday night with a drug-related injury, possibly an overdose, but would not elaborate.

Central Michigan University went on lockdown after students and faculty were sent emergency alerts around 9 a.m. Friday.

Halie Byron, 20, said she locked herself in her off-campus house, about a 10-minute walk from Campbell Hall. She had planned to run errands before traveling home to the Detroit area.

""It's scary thinking about how easy a shooter can come into a college campus anywhere — a classroom, a library. There's so much easy access,"" Byron said.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said he has been in contact with local police to ""determine what has occurred at Central Michigan University.""

""The priority right now is the safety of those still on campus and I thank all first responders involved for their swift action,"" he continued in a tweet.

U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said he was “deeply saddened” by another “tragic incident of gun violence.”

“I am heartbroken for the victims and praying for the safety of Mount Pleasant and @CMUniversity community as first responders work to apprehend the shooter,” he tweeted.

A men’s basketball game scheduled for Friday night between Central Michigan and Western Michigan University was postponed. No makeup date has been announced.

Central Michigan has about 23,000 students. The campus is in Mount Pleasant, about 70 miles north of Lansing.

The San Antonio Express-News reports the trooper pulled a man over Sunday afternoon in Guadalupe County. The Department of Public Safety says the man gave false information and a scuffle began as the trooper tried to arrest him.

The suspect got back in his vehicle and fled west into San Antonio.

DPS spokesman Trooper Deon Cockrell says a department helicopter spotted the suspect, and the trooper was able to track him back down and pursue him. At one point, the suspect drove onto a highway and started traveling in the wrong direction.

The suspect eventually stopped his vehicle and got out. Cockrell says the man and the trooper exchanged gunfire and were both hit.

Details about their conditions weren't immediately released.

Officer Glenn Doss Jr., 25, was shot in the head and chest on Wednesday night after receiving reports of a couple arguing and possible shots fired, Fox 2 Detroit reported.

When Doss, along with other officers, arrived at the scene, they encountered a 43-year-old suspect who was standing outside the home with a weapon, according to the Detroit Free Press.

The suspect, identified as Decharlos Brooks, allegedly opened fire on them before they even got out of their squad car, shooting Doss. The officer’s partner, Samuel Anderson, took him to Detroit Receiving Hospital.

Brooks reportedly barricaded himself inside the home until officers threw teargas into the home, and eventually captured him.

The suspect’s wife, Natalie Scott, told Fox 2 that the suspect suffers from mental illness.

“He’s not that type of person. He’s not himself,” Scott told the news station. “He’s no evil person. I feel sorry and prayers to the family, but this just not him.”

Brooks was charged Saturday — before Doss died — with eight counts of assault with intent to murder, seven counts of resisting and obstructing, one count of carrying a dangerous weapon and 17 counts of felony firearms, The Detroit News reported.

Police Chief James Craig on Sunday called Doss, who had been with the department for two years, an “American hero.”

Officer Glenn Doss Sr., Doss Jr.’s father who’s a 19-year veteran of the department, said he his son initially had studied therapy and psychology.

“I never told to join the police department,” Doss Sr. said. “I never advised him to join the police department. He called me up a couple of years ago, and said, ‘Dad, what do I have to do to be in the police.’”

“I told him to go to [Detroit Public Safety Headquarters] and put in an application. Three months later, he started the academy, and fell in love with the job,” Doss Sr. added.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said Doss Jr. “was everything that’s good about the city of Detroit.”

A GoFundMe page set up for Doss’s family stated that “Glenn chose a career serving the community because his willingness to help others was evident in everything he did.” It had raised more than $18,800 of its $5,000 goal by Sunday afternoon.

Doss leaves behind his 9-month-old son, Eli, and Emily Crouse, his girlfriend of nine years."

The suspect in the officer's shooting was later shot and killed by police after a chase.

Prince George's County police Chief Hank Stawinski said Officer Mujahid Ramzziddin was confronted by a man with a shotgun when he left his home in suburban Maryland to help a woman who lived a few doors away and knew Ramzziddin was a police officer.

""He stood his ground,"" Stawinski said at a press conference. ""He saved her life by giving his own.""

The man who shot Ramzziddin, identified by police as Glenn Tyndell, 37 of Brandywine, then fled the scene in a vehicle. Stawinski said the chase carried briefly into neighboring Charles County, and ended when the suspect was shot and killed by two Prince George's County officers.

State Route 210, a major highway in southern Maryland connecting Prince George's and Charles counties, was closed for several hours Wednesday near the scene of where the suspect was shot and killed, several miles (kilometers) from where Ramzziddin was shot.

Stawinski said the initial shooting occurred about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday in the Brandywine area, about 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of the nation's capital.

Ramzziddin, a married father of four, had been with the department for 13 years, and in 2006 received a Valor Award from the department, Stawinski said.

""Today was not the first time he demonstrated his heroism,"" Stawinski said.

The man who shot Ramzziddin had a history of domestic incidents, Stawinski said. Police later said he had three open warrants for assault, and court records list multiple civil and criminal complaints against him dating back to 2010. Many of them were ultimately dismissed.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is conducting its own investigation, but Stawinski said he has reason to believe that those domestic incidents should have barred the suspect from legally owning a firearm.

Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker said his sadness over Ramzziddin's death is mixed with pride for his willingness to help a member of the community.

""He didn't have to answer the door,"" Baker said. ""He didn't have to walk out that door."""

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a technology that could allow childhood vaccines—for everything from polio to measles, mumps, and rubella—to be combined into a single injection, reports the BBC.

The idea is that one shot would inject microscopic capsules of vaccine into a person, and those capsules would be designed to break down and release their contents at different times, per the Science study.

WHY DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY IS STILL OUT

A simpler application would be to deliver one vaccine and its necessary booster shots at one time. In tests on mice, researchers were able to time the release of the booster doses to exactly nine, 20, and 41 days after the initial shot.

The concept has not been tested in humans yet.

""For the first time, we can create a library of tiny, encased vaccine particles, each programmed to release at a precise, predictable time, so that people could potentially receive a single injection that, in effect, would have multiple boosters already built into it,"" MIT's Robert Langer says in a release.

In the developing world especially, this ""might be the difference between not getting vaccinated and receiving all of your vaccines in one shot,"" adds study author Kevin McHugh, whose research was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Much work remains: For one thing, scientists would need to figure out how to keep the doses, normally refrigerated, stable in a warm body, per the Guardian.

IDENTICAL TWINS GIVE BIRTH HOURS APART AT SAME HOSPITAL

They also are trying to further shrink the capsules so they can be injected directly into muscle, per New Scientist. (A vaccine for the common cold is in the works.)

Officer Ken Copeland, a veteran of the San Marcos Police Department since March 1998, was serving a warrant in the El Camino Real subdivison of the city when he was fatally shot, Police Chief Chase Stapp confirmed during a press conference Monday night.

Copeland — who was wearing a protective vest — and other officers were shot at by the suspect, ""much like in an ambush type of situation.""

He was taken to the Central Texas Medical Center immediately and was later pronouced dead at 3:50 p.m. local time, according to a press release from the city of San Marcos.

The shooting happened near Bowie Elementary School, Fox 7 reported.

A suspect is in custody after he surrendered to law enforcement following a shootout. The suspect was shot during the incident and was transported to a hospital in Austin, police said. It's unclear if the suspect was injured from a self-inflicted wound or if he was injured from police gunfire.

""Ken's a hero. Everybody here loved him,"" Stapp said, noting that Copeland's photo is hung throughout the police department.

Copeland was shot while working on his day off, the police chief added. ""He worked just about every day off to provide for his kids.""

Stapp said that Copeland is the first officer from the San Marcos force to be killed in the line of duty.

Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott tweeted the news, and said: ""We pray for the family of the San Marcos police officer killed in the line of duty. We remember the sacrifices our men and women in law enforcement make every day. #BackTheBlue.""

In a separate statement, the governor said, ""Today we grieve for the family of the fallen San Marcos police officer, and we vow swift justice for the killer.

fox46,fox,[],2017-12-31 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/31/deputies-down-after-being-called-to-suburban-denver-scene.html,"A man fired more than 100 rounds at sheriff's deputies in Colorado early Sunday, killing one and injuring four others, before being fatally shot himself in what authorities called an ambush. Two civilians were also injured.

Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said deputies came under fire almost immediately and were shot ""very, very quickly"" after entering a suburban Denver apartment and trying to talk with the suspect, who was holed up inside a bedroom.

""They all went down almost within seconds of each other, so it was more of an ambush-type of attack on our officers,"" Spurlock said. ""He knew we were coming and we obviously let him know that we were there.""

The Douglas County coroner identified the suspect as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl.

A YouTube user named Matthew Riehl posted a YouTube video Dec. 13, saying he wanted to replace Spurlock and railing against the sheriff and other officers in profane, highly personal terms.

The wounded deputies tried to pull the fallen officer, Zackari Parrish, out of the line of further gunfire but were unable to because of their own injuries and only managed to ""crawl to safety,"" Spurlock said.

The incident began around 5:15 a.m. at Copper Canyon Apartments, a landscaped apartment complex in Highland Ranch, 16 miles (28 kilometers) south of Denver.

Authorities had left the home barely an hour earlier in response to a complaint of a ""verbal disturbance"" involving two men, the sheriff's office said. One of the men told them the suspect ""was acting bizarre and might be having a mental breakdown"" but the deputies found no evidence of a crime.

When deputies were called back, a man who had left came by to give them a key and granted permission to enter the home, leaving again before shots were fired.

""The suspect was just making a ton of noise and annoying everyone around him,"" Spurlock said.

Four officers, including Parrish, were shot from a bedroom around 6 a.m., forcing the retreat. A SWAT team entered the apartment at about 7:30 a.m. in an exchange of gunfire that left the gunman dead and another officer injured.

Vira Cover, who lives in a building about 50 yards away from the shooting, was woken up by a phone call from her fiance, Steve Silknitter, who warned her about what was happening and urged her to stay inside. Soon afterward she said she heard about 15 to 20 very loud shots fired over about 30 seconds or a minute. She sat on the couch with her cats and called Silknitter back before turning on the television to try to find out more about what was happening.

""I couldn't believe this was happening in our backyard,"" she said.

Silknitter heard the shots fired too but from about a half mile away, stopped at a police roadblock as he tried to get back home from work. Then he said he saw police in tactical gear speed past him in a pickup truck.

Silknitter said he lived 2 miles away from the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado where 12 people were killed in a shooting in 2012. He said he never would have expected anything like this in his apartment complex, where the only noise you might normally hear is children running around upstairs.

""Where do I move to where I don't have to worry about someone shooting us?"" asked Silknitter, who is now considering getting a concealed weapons permit.

The suspect was well-known to authorities in the Denver area but had no criminal record, said Spurlock, who declined to name him until his identity was confirmed.

Riehl said in his Dec. 13 YouTube video, called ""Fire Sheriff Spurlock,"" that he would run as a libertarian, ending with holiday greetings and a vow to ""fire all these bums come early next year.""

Riehl is vague about his political beliefs and personal grievances, though his animosity clearly ran deep. He flashes the business card of an officer who, he says, shows up at homes after sunset with an attractive woman and ""will then ambush you from behind the door.""

A video posted on Nov. 28 shows a traffic stop by a police officer in the city of Lone Tree — apparently taken inside the officer's car — that Riehl said was done illegally. He alleges the officer clocked the wrong driver, identifying the officer by name in the video and calling him ""dirty.""

""Scumbag, dirtbag, liar,"" he says as the officer questions the driver. ""He's the boss, huh? He's the Nazi in charge with the stripes on his shoulder and the fake badge.""

The sheriff did not release any details about the weapons and ammunition used except to say the suspect had a rifle. He also did not know if law enforcement had any prior knowledge of firearms being in the home but the possibility always weighs on deputies' minds.

""We respond to every call anticipating that everyone has a gun. This is Colorado. Everybody has a gun,"" Spurlock said.

Parrish, the slain officer, was 29 and a married father of two young children. He came to the department seven months ago after working as an officer for the nearby Castle Rock Police Department. Spurlock called him a ""good kid"" who was eager to work.

""His wife told me today that he loved this job more than he had loved any job he ever had,"" the sheriff said.

Gov. John Hickenlooper ordered flags on all public buildings immediately lowered to half-staff until Tuesday evening in Parrish's honor.

The three deputies and one police officer injured were listed in stable condition. Authorities identified them as deputies Michael Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32; and Castle Rock police officer Tom O'Donnell, 41.

The two civilian injuries were not life-threatening.

Pelle is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. The sheriff shared a picture of him and two other family members by his son's hospital bed on his office Twitter account. All four, including Jeffrey Pelle, who underwent surgery, are smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture.

President Donald Trump expressed sorrow, writing on Twitter, ""My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @dcsheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all!""

The shooting occurred on the final day of a year that saw the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas.

Christian Thomas McCall, 47, was taken into custody, suffering from wounds after allegedly firing at deputies at about 3:30 a.m., police said. Four South Carolina officers — three York County Sheriff’s deputies and a K9 officer — were wounded and rushed to a hospital.

The York County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the names of the four officers in a tweet Tuesday afternoon.

Det. Michael Doty remains in critical condition, Sgt. Randy Clinton is awaiting surgery with non-life threatening injuries, Sgt. Buddy Brown is recovering from surgery and Sgt. Kyle Cummings of the York County SWAT team is also in recovery, Fox 46 reported.

""His situation is very critical at this time. That's all I can tell you at this time. We really could use your thoughts and prayers,"" York County Sheriff’s spokesman Trent Faris said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon about Doty.

McCall, a father of three children, was previously arrested in 1994 and was charged with assault, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry told WSOC.

Around 10 p.m. Monday, he allegedly assaulted his wife in their York home, about 25 miles southwest of Charlotte, when the incident escalated, McCall’s father-in-law told WSOC.

Authorities responded to a domestic call, but the suspect had already fled the scene on foot when they arrived, Faris said. K-9 units were sent to the scene when McCall fired his gun just after 1 a.m., striking one of the K-9 officers. McCall also allegedly shot at a police helicopter. The bullet struck the aircraft, but did not injure anyone, WSOC reported.

Three York County Sheriff’s deputies were shot about 3:30 a.m. while searching the woods. McCall had several ""long guns"" with him at the time, but police did not specify what type of weapons they were.

McCall’s father-in-law told WSOC-TV said it was “uncharacteristic” for McCall to act violently toward police. A neighbor, Roger Gilfillan, said he was stunned to find out who might be involved.

""This is baffling,"" Gilfillan said, noting McCall lived in the home with his wife and three children.

""They were real nice people. He just kept to himself,"" said Gilfillan.

McCall frequently walked around the neighborhood, but would only speak when someone spoke to him. McCall never appeared to cause any trouble, Gilfillan said.

The attack left at least eight people dead and several others injured in what Mayor Bill de Blasio called a “cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians.”

Nash, a five-year veteran of the police force, was outside the nearby Stuyvesant High School reporting to an unfounded call of a nonviolent, emotionally disturbed person before the deadly rampage began, The News reported.

When chaos broke out, Nash rushed to the bloody scene where he successfully subdued the suspect.

NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill commended Nash in a news conference Tuesday evening, saying the young officer “stopped the carnage moments after it began.”

A source told Fox News that 29-year-old Saipov was from Uzbekistan and had a green card. He remains hospitalized following the attack."

This time, the gun barrel exploded, knocking the farmer from Hampton, Iowa, backward, severely damaging his right hand and ear and burning his face.

Unknown to Hansen, the manufacturer of the rifle that injured him in 2014 had received other complaints of explosions and injuries over the prior decade. Customers repeatedly reported that the barrel of the stainless steel 10 ML-II muzzleloader exploded, burst, split or cracked, according to thousands of court documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

Lawyers for the company, Westfield, Massachusetts-based Savage Arms, were expected to appear Wednesday in federal court in Iowa to defend against a lawsuit filed by Hansen. He is seeking damages for his injuries, alleging the company failed to warn customers about the defect.

It's one of several lawsuits that have claimed the company recklessly kept the muzzleloaders on the market even as they kept occasionally mangling hands, damaging hearing and burning faces. At least three have been settled on a confidential basis since last year.

Martin Crimp, a Michigan State University metals expert who examined a 10ML-II that exploded and caused a hunter to lose multiple fingers in 2009, told the AP the barrel of that gun was ""metallurgically defective.""

An expert hired by Hansen's lawyers came to a similar conclusion, saying the steel used to make the rifle was prone to catastrophic failure after repeat firings.

Anthony Pisciotti, an outside lawyer for Savage Arms, said he wasn't authorized to comment. A spokesman for its parent company, Vista Outdoor, didn't return messages.

Savage Arms, which discontinued the gun in 2010 after thousands were on the market, has insisted it's safe when used properly, has no defects and was designed in accordance with industry standards.

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE

Savage Arms has argued that operator error is to blame for the explosions, saying users must have created too much pressure inside the barrel either by loading two bullets or using the wrong amount or type of gunpowder. It has issued a safety notice on its website warning owners to ""carefully follow the safe loading procedures"" in the product manual to avoid injuries.

Hansen's case highlights how gun makers, unlike manufacturers of other consumer products, have the sole discretion to decide themselves whether to recall potentially dangerous weapons. In 1976, Congress blocked the newly-created Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has broad authority to regulate everything from toasters to toys and BB guns, from restricting the manufacture or sale of firearms.

""It's an example of an industry that can essentially do whatever they want and there's no consequences other than being held accountable in a civil liability context,"" said Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center in Washington D.C.

Other companies have faced allegations that they allowed unsafe guns to stay on the market. Remington agreed to replace triggers in its popular Model 700 rifles — only after several lawsuits claiming that they were prone to accidentally discharging. Ruger was accused of marketing revolvers for decades that could fire when dropped.

Savage Arms recently agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Trent Procter, who was on a hunting trip with friends in October 2009 when the 10 ML-II he'd owned for years ""just blew apart"" when he shot at a target.

Procter, 48, missed nine months of work from his job as a power company lineman as he endured surgeries on his left hand and rehabilitation. He had to move to a different job and still experiences numbness due to nerve damage in his hand, where he's missing parts of his thumb and middle finger.

Photos of Procter's hand were shared on hunting websites after the explosion, and he said it was insulting that some suggested he and not a defective product was to blame.

""I'm surprised it was never recalled or a warning was put out that this was actually happening,"" he said. ""It's quite scary when you think about it.""

Last year, the company also settled a case brought by Michigan hunter Rodney Palatka and his wife, who was pregnant with twins and suffered a miscarriage after witnessing her husband's injuries.

James Putman of North Carolina alleges in a pending lawsuit that his Savage 10ML-II burst as he hunted last year in the George Washington National Forest, blasting his thumb off and forcing his early retirement as a firefighter.

Savage Arms started making the 10ML-II in 2001. It was designed to withstand the use of smokeless powder, which appealed to some shooters because it didn't require the same messy cleanup as black powder.

The company's knowledge of the barrel problems is becoming clear after years of lawsuits.

In Palatka's case, a federal magistrate in 2015 sanctioned the company for a ""purposeful record of obfuscation"" that included falsely claiming that it was aware of only two prior explosions while withholding information that showed otherwise.

The company acknowledged in Hansen's case that it received 45 legal claims related to burst or split barrels dating to 2004. Hansen's lawyers say documents show Savage Arms created a special ""muzzleloader return team"" and faced hundreds of warranty and service claims.

Some hunters were offered free replacement rifles after they were told their errors caused the damage.

Hansen, 50 and a lifelong hunter, testified in an August deposition that he followed the recommended procedures when he loaded his 10ML-II, which he bought in 2010 and had shot 200 times. He said he weighed and loaded 43 grains of the recommended powder and one bullet. He set a target at 50 yards, laid on a dirt pile, aimed and fired.

Hansen, who was rushed to the emergency room after the explosion, testified he still struggles to hear even with a hearing aid and cannot perform some farm chores due to his hand injury.

Savage Arms has suggested that Hansen used an improper mix of powders that caused too much pressure. Trial is set for next year."

Although months behind schedule, the State of California’s Department of Justice (DOJ) this week opened up its online registration for gun owners to enroll their bullet-button toting AR-15 rifles – now deemed to be “assault weapons” – in line with a controversial set of sweeping gun control laws signed into state law last year.

But gunmakers and owners say they already have come up with creative workarounds to be legally compliant but avoid giving the government even more personal information.

“The registration is seen by many as a trap to purge the owner since they ask for very specific information about acquisition of the original rifle that most owners don’t have or remember,” Steven Lieberman, a California-based attorney and founder of firearms training company Artemis Defense, told Fox News. “As a result, the ‘guesstimate’ as most would, they are potentially committing perjury.”

The registration process is considered by many to be “more intrusive” compared to prior registration processes. In the past, one simply needed to submit a list of serial numbers to the state’s DOJ.

This time, the level of information required includes everything from locating their receipts to confirm when they originally purchased their firearms, as well as multiple photos of each gun to be uploaded, and all on a website technology rather than mobile device optimized.

This leaves the California gun owner who chooses not to register with the option of opting for a “featureless” model – deemed an AR-15 that does not contain a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a vertical grip, or a flash suppressor. And, perhaps ironically, it has actually breathed new life into the otherwise declining gun sales.

California gun owners thus can bypass registration by either revising their current platform to the featureless style or buying a new one altogether.

“If there had been no change in the law, the California market demand for guns would have fallen just like it did in the rest of the country as demand for these types of firearms fell with the coming of the Trump presidency,” said California firearms instructor and risk analyst Dennis Santiago. He was referring to the drop in demand nationwide for guns, given that sales soared during the Obama era as gun proponents feared stringent gun control measures would be put in place.

“Instead, lawmakers just propped up demand again, and opened up the market for gun owners to convert their guns and manufacturers to make new guns that easily circumvent the law with a few cosmetic changes,” he added.

At the heart of the legislation is the outlawing of the AR-15’s “bullet button” – already a feature not used in other states and designed to slow down the reloading process given that it requires a tool to be pushed on the ‘button’ to eject a spent magazine before being able to reload. By focusing on detachable magazines, California lawmakers were endeavoring to make it an even more laborious reloading process.

Marc Levine, a Democratic State Assembly member who was a huge backer of the new gun laws, told Fox News: “By closing the bullet button loophole, it is slowing down the reloading mechanism. Lawmakers will continue to do whatever it takes to keep communities safe.”

But savvy designers, Santiago contends, have other ideas.

“Lawmakers were probably thinking that guns would require being taken apart to reload them as a result of their new law. They were mistaken,” Santiago explained. “Ironically, the next generation of unregistered semi-automatic rifles will be better; almost all new designs will have detachable magazines again.”

Chris Eger, a staff writer for Guns.com, pointed out that within days of the new legislation, there already were workaround devices and tweaks being concocted by “some clever person ... invented to defeat it.”

“We have covered several new inventions that have popped up just in the past few months, and you can imagine right now that there are rooms of people burning lean muscle tissue into the night trying to come up with more,” he said.

Manufacturers have redesigned their products to take advantage of the new law's ""featureless"" build definition.

“As long as states continue to pass feature-based bans and/or until the Supreme Court finally decides that all of these laws are unconstitutional,” Alan Thordsen, President of Thordsen Customs in California, said, “There will be companies like us and others designing ways to keep law-abiding citizens in compliance.”

Eger noted that the new way without the bullet button may end up making reloading more efficient.

“The new way can be faster, especially with some aftermarket attachments made to break open the receivers more quickly,” he said.

SALE OF FIREARMS THAT USE BULLET BUTTONS SURGE AHEAD OF NEW CALIFORNIA GUN LAW

CONCEALED-HANDGUN CARRY BILL TRIGGERS PUSHBACK FROM COASTAL MAYORS, POLICE CHIEFS

But despite the apparent outmaneuvering, California’s gun control proponents stand firm that the new legislation is still a step in the right direction.

“It’s no surprise that gun manufacturers are coming up with ways to try to get around reasonable restrictions,” said Levine, adding that they will continue to address the “workarounds” with legislation as necessary.

And Ari Freilich, an attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, concurred that although “workarounds have already been introduced,” they are confident that this legislation will “save lives and reduce the lethality of mass shooting events.”"
fox52,fox,['Allison Barrie'],2017-01-12 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/01/12/marines-get-groundbreaking-unstoppable-new-rifle-magazine.html,"A reliable weapon can be the difference between life and death for those serving in the military.

The Magpul Industries PMAG GEN 3 is a magazine for rifles that ensures the user stays lethal in a fight. More than 20,000 rounds fired? No problem. Still no magazine stoppages.

Why is that so important? Because every time a stoppage happens with a weapon, it means a lost opportunity to neutralize an enemy combatant. But the even bigger issue is that a stoppage can put the warfighter at risk and even lead to loss of life.

With AR, M4, and M27 weapons for example, magazine problems are a primary culprit in stoppages. But if a warfighter uses the PMAG, then the risk of stoppage is massively reduced.

The US Marine Corps has made the decision to ensure that all Marines have the best magazine available. Going forward, Magpul’s PMAG GEN 3 has become the official magazine, giving Marines that extra advantage to stay alive and lethal in a firefight.

This is the first commercial magazine adopted as the official standard for the Marine Corps primary service rifle, Magpul explained.

THE 5 COOLEST MILITARY INNOVATIONS OF 2016

Magpul has also introduced the PMAG GEN 3 in the “medium coyote tan” color. The black and medium coyote tan are now the only magazines authorized by the USMC for combat and training. The government-designed EPM USGI (aluminum) magazine will be used only for training purposes.

PMAG GEN 3 Basics

The PMAG GEN 3 would be ideal for the M4, M16, M27IAR (Infantry Automatic Rifle) and M249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon). And the magazine works with all types of bullets.

And in spite of tens of thousands of rounds, it won’t melt because of its special advanced material.

The military put the PMAG GEN 3 through years of testing, and thousands and thousands and thousands of rounds. And what did they find? No stoppages.

For example, testing found that even in 20,400 rounds of M855A1— a tricky ammo type— still there were zero stoppages.

How tough is tough?

Both the US and NATO have what’s called “rough handling” testing and Magpul’s PMAG GEN 3 passed all of it with flying colors.

What does mean? It is one rugged magazine. You can use it in extreme cold— as in -60 degrees Fahrenheit cold— all the way through to 180 degrees of extreme heat, and this magazine still cannot be stopped. It is reliable.

HOW SKYDIVING MILITARY SNIPERS HARNESSED TOP OXYGEN TECH ON MOUNT EVEREST

The magazine also easily passed military testing against things like dust, UV exposure and even salt fog. You can also throw whatever dirt and grime is around and it will still outperform other magazine options.

So how does it work?

The PMAG GEN 3 loads from stripper clips. It inserts rapidly on a closed vault with a full 30 rounds. There is a smart over-insertion stop to protect against hard-core magazine changes and drops.

When you’re shooting, there is a handy window that Magpul describes as working like a gas gage. As you fire, it will provide exact data on just how many rounds you have left by a quick glance at the orange coil.

THESE HACKERS COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE IN A DISASTER

This magazine drops free, making reload very quick and efficient. There’s a dust and impact cover, but you don’t need it to store the magazine loaded. It is really there to protect against major impact like dropping the mags out of aircraft, for example.

Unlike the USGI aluminum magazine, it is very easy to disassemble to clean.

Dominating the field and winning the Marine Corps contract

In battery after battery of military testing over the course of several years, the PMAG GEN M3 relentlessly dominated the competition. In tens of thousands of rounds, there were zero magazine-related stoppages and it performed better than any other magazine. The GEN M3 was pitted against both government developed USGI and commercial mags— but none could come close to rivaling the PMAG GEN 3’s relentlessly reliable performance.

Magpul is highly motivated to find top-notch solutions for warfighters. Founder Richard Fitzpatrick was Marine Reconnaissance, many at the company served in the Corps, and have children currently serving. This is a company that understands the needs of those serving in the US military and takes delivering excellence extremely seriously.

“Firearm performance is a passion for us at Magpul, whether for military weapon systems or for civilian arms for defense and recreation,” Duane Liptak, Magpul Industries’ product management and marketing director, said. “Very early in the company history, Magpul’s founders identified shortcomings in the USGI magazine, and we’ve been dedicated to making the most reliable magazines in the world because although it may seem like a simple box with a spring, people’s lives depend heavily on this item performing.”

What’s next for Magpul? For civilians, there will be some very big reveals at SHOT Show next week. To find out first, download the latest Tactical Talk and meet a former Marine Corps fighter pilot who will give you an exclusive peek at some of the exciting news.

Justin Timperio sued Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, seeking unspecified damages.

Authorities say a doctor who had been forced to resign from Bronx Lebanon Hospital two years earlier amid a sexual harassment claim opened fire inside the hospital on June 30, killing a doctor and hurting six others. Police say the doctor, Henry Bello, killed himself at the scene.

The lawsuit said the hospital had insufficient security to stop Bello from entering the grounds even though a nurse and a security guard were injured in a 2011 shooting there.

It also blamed the shooting on a Schenectady, New York, gun shop.

The hospital did not immediately comment on the lawsuit."
fox54,fox,['Perry Chiaramonte'],2017-10-05 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/05/bump-stock-rifle-modifiers-green-lighted-by-obama-administration.html,"So-called 'bump stock' recoil devices like the ones used by the Las Vegas gunman, were first approved under the Obama administration's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

In June, 2010, about 18 months into Obama’s first term, the ATF issued an opinion letter to stock manufacturer Slide Fire on the company's after-market device. The bureau gave the company approval, according to the Media Research Center.

“The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed,” reads the letter dated June 7, 2010. “In order to use the installed device, the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand. Accordingly, we find that the “bump-stock” is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.”

The National Firearms Act prohibits the sale, manufacture, and transfer of automatic weapons to the general public. Unless a person is a member of the military or a police agency, obtaining an automatic firearm is difficult and expensive. Potential buyers must first locate a gun dealer who is authorized to sell automatic weapons. Then they must submit applications to both federal and local agencies. If those applications are approved, the buyer must pay $200 for a tax stamp.

With the device, semi-automatic rifles can easily be modified to fire like fully automatic weapons. The devices allow the shooter to use the recoil of the gun to push the trigger against the stationary finger, allowing for a rapid succession of shots, similar to a fully automatic firearm. Other devices, like a trigger crank, can also modify these weapons so they fire in an automatic fashion at a very low cost and with no regulatory red tape.

The approval of these types of devices falls under what some lawmakers in Washington are calling an “automatic weapon loophole.” And even the gun lobby is in agreement.

""Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,"" the National Rifle Association said in a Thursday statement. ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.""

On Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., along with numerous Democratic senators, announced the introduction of a bill to close the loophole and ban devices that enable a semi-automatic weapon to fire fully automatic.

“Automatic weapons have been illegal for more than 30 years, but there’s a loophole in the law that can be exploited to allow killers to fire at rates of between 400 and 800 rounds-per-minute,"" she said. ""The only reason to fire so many rounds so fast is to kill large numbers of people. No one should be able to easily and cheaply modify legal weapons into what are essentially machine guns.”

Republicans on the Hill are also considering taking action against the sale of these weapons attachments.

Fox News has learned that Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., is writing a bipartisan bill to ban bump stocks and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, also opened the door to looking at the issue.

Even the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, opened the door to new restrictions.

""If somebody can essentially convert a semi-automatic weapon by buying one of these and utilizing it and cause the kind of mayhem and mass casualties that we saw in Las Vegas, that's something of obvious concern that we ought to explore,"" Cornyn told reporters.

fox57,fox,['Joshua Rhett Miller'],2010-11-24 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2010/11/24/armys-revolutionary-rifle-use-afghanistan.html,"Since the dawn of modern warfare, the best way to stay alive in the face of incoming fire has been to take cover behind a wall. But thanks to a game-changing ""revolutionary"" rifle, the U.S. Army has made that tactic dead on arrival. Now the enemy can run, but he can't hide.

After years of development, the U.S. Army has unleashed a new weapon in Afghanistan -- the XM25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement System, a high-tech rifle that can be programmed so that its 25-mm. ammunition detonates either in front of or behind a target, meaning it can be fired just above a wall before it explodes and kills the enemy.

It also has a range of roughly 2,300 feet -- nearly the length of eight football fields -- making it possible to fire at targets well past the range of the rifles and carbines that most soldiers carry today.

Lt. Col. Christopher Lehner, project manager for the semi-automatic, shoulder-fired weapon system for the U.S. Army's Program Executive Office Soldier, said that the XM25's capability alone is such a ""game-changer"" that it'll lead to new ways of fighting on the battlefield, beginning this month in Afghanistan.

""With this weapon system, we take away cover from [enemy targets] forever,"" Lehner told FoxNews.com on Wednesday. ""Tactics are going to have to be rewritten. The only thing we can see [enemies] being able to do is run away.""

And that would make it much easier for U.S. troops to put them in their sights, either with that same XM25 or another direct-fire weapon.

With this new weapon in the Army's arsenal, Lehner said, ""We're much more effective, by many magnitudes, than current weapons at the squad level. We're able to shoot farther and more accurately, and our soldiers can stay behind sandbags, walls or rocks, which provides them protection from fire.""

Lehner said the first XM25s were distributed to combat units in Afghanistan this month. The 12-pound, 29-inch system, which was designed by Minnesota's Alliant Techsystems, costs up to $35,000 per unit and, while highly sophisticated, is so easy to use that soldiers become proficient within minutes.

""That's how intuitively easy it is, even though it's high-tech,"" Lehner said. ""All a soldier needs to know how to do is laze the target. It decimates anything within its lethal radius.""

Once the trigger is pulled and the round leaves the barrel, a computer chip inside the projectile communicates exactly how far it has traveled, allowing for precise detonation behind or ahead of any target.

""We have found that this has really made our soldiers so much more accurate and being able to deliver this high-explosive round in about five seconds,"" said Lehner, taking into account the time it takes a soldier to laze, aim and fire the weapon. Once fired, Lehner said, the round will reach its target in a ""second or two,"" meaning the entire process from aiming to direct hit lasts less than 10 seconds, compared to 10 minutes or longer for traditional mortar fire.

A potential battlefield scenario, according to Army officials, might go something like this:

-- A patrol encounters an enemy combatant in a walled Afghan village who fires an AK-47 intermittently from behind cover, exposing himself only for a brief second to fire.

-- The patrol's leader calls for the XM25 gunman, who uses the weapon's laser range finder to calculate the distance to the target.

-- He then uses an incremental button located near the trigger to add 1 meter to the round's distance, since the enemy is hiding behind a wall.

-- The round is fired, and it explodes with a blast comparable to a hand grenade past the wall and above the enemy.

""This is revolutionary for many reasons,"" Lehner said, citing increased efficiency, safety and lethality. ""This is the first time we're putting smart technology in an individual weapon system for our soldiers. We feel it's very important to field this because it keeps us ahead of the technological curve of our potential enemies. We have a feeling other people will try to copy us -- this is the future.""

Lehner said the Army plans to purchase at least 12,500 XM25 systems beginning next year -- enough for one system in each infantry squad and Special Forces team.

The military isn't overly concerned that the weapon might be captured by the enemy, because they would be unable to obtain its highly specialized ammunition, batteries and other components. Lehner said he expects other nations will try to copy its technology, but it will be very cost-prohibitive.

""This is a game-changer,"" Lehner said. ""The enemy has learned to get cover, for hundreds if not thousands of years.

""Well, they can't do that anymore. We're taking that cover from them and there's only two outcomes: We're going to get you behind that cover or force you to flee. So no matter what, we gotcha."""

Shannon Jason Cables was killed by deputies responding to a domestic violence call at his Lake Wales home on Saturday, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.

Then, Cable's daughter came to her mother's defense.

""That's when the 19-year-old actually jumped on the suspect and wrestled and choked him,"" Judd said. He said the pair managed to get away, and Cables fled into some woods behind the house.

The women took refuge at a neighbor's home and called police.

Deputies searched the woods with police dogs and a helicopter for two hours while the women received medical care. When the women returned home with law enforcement, deputies spotted Cables carrying an assault rifle and a shotgun coming up behind the house, Judd said.

The sheriff's office says they ordered Cables, a 46-year-old white man, to drop the weapon, but he pointed it at deputies instead, so they shot him. The deputies' races were not released.

Judd told the newspaper that investigators found shells from Cables' assault rifle outside, indicating he fired the weapon. No deputies were injured.

The movie, starring Bruce Willis as Paul Kersey (a role that revived the long career of Charles Bronson back in the '70s), was set for release in November 2017, but was delayed until this Friday.

There was no way to know a mass shooting – one in which police and mental health authorities utterly failed to protect young students gunned down in a Florida school – would suddenly change the tone and tenor of the movie.

In the original, Paul Kersey is a mild-mannered architect, in love with his wonderful wife Joanna and their daughter Carol, living in Manhattan. One day, two hoodlums (one of whom is a very young Jeff Goldblum, starring in his very first movie) follow the women home from a grocery store. They beat Joanna to death and brutally rape Carol – leaving her in a catatonic state – in a scene considered very graphic for the day.

Kersey has abhorred guns his whole life: His father was killed in a hunting accident. Soon, he becomes frustrated with the slow pace of the police investigation. He takes long walks, and one night he takes along an antique .32-caliber gun given to him by a friend. When a mugger attacks him, Kersey shoots him dead.

The soft-spoken architect likes the feeling. He's doling out justice on the spot in the mean streets of New York City. Soon, he's taking nightly walks, killing several criminals – some of whom he provokes into attacking him. Before long he ends up – guess where? – Chicago! Yes, the city where 650 people were slain in 2017. The city, run by Obama crony Rahm Emanuel, has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation.

That's where the new ""Death Wish"" picks up. Willis plays Kersey, but this time he's a doctor. The rest of the plot is essentially the same – but different, given that now, people film him on their cell phones during his vigilante acts. ""Everybody's watching this viral video, this guy in a hoodie, they're calling him the grim reaper,"" says a radio DJ in the film's trailer.

""He stopped a carjacking. He's become a folk hero. Is he right for taking the law into his own hands?"" the DJ asks. At another point, a deep voice says simply: ""If a man really wants to protect what's his, he has to do it himself."" But when a friend tells Kersey: ""You're not a cop!"" he says ""Somebody has to do it!""

At another point in the trailer, a cop says: ""They called him a guardian angel.""

And that's where things get very interesting. A few years after the original film came out, the Guardian Angels were born.

Curtis Sliwa formed the organization to combat widespread violence and crime on the New York City subway system. Soon, more than 130 cities had Guardian Angels protecting citizens. They were trained to make citizen’s arrests for violent crimes.

Then ""Death Wish II"" came out, in 1982. Just before the release of ""Death Wish 3,"" Bernhard Goetz shot four muggers on a New York City subway train in Manhattan, seriously wounding all of them.

The New York City media dubbed him ""The Subway Vigilante,"" and his vigilantism struck a chord with city dwellers living in fear (crime was insane in New York back then, with 2,000 murders a year). Goetz was hailed by many as a hero, and at his 1987 trial, he was acquitted of attempted murder and assault and convicted on just one count – illegal weapons possession.

In his interrogation, Goetz told police of the muggers: “They were intending to play with me like a cat plays with a mouse. What happened here is, I snapped.""

And that's what happens to Kersey. In the original, he's not some gun nut – just the opposite, he was a conscientious objector during the Korean War who still served as a combat medic. But he arms himself and, forced to act, takes the law into his own hands.

There are some great – and suddenly very timely – exchanges in the Bronson movie. Ames Jainchill, the pal who gives Kersey the antique gun, says: ""There's so much g------ hoopla from the gun-control people, half the nation's scared to even hold a gun.""

Learning Kersey was a conscientious objector, Jainchill says: ""You're probably one of those knee-jerk liberals thinks us gun boys'll shoot our guns 'cuz it’s an extension of our penises.""

But then Jainchill explains: ""Well, maybe it is. But this is gun country. Can't even own a handgun in New York City. Out here I hardly know a man who doesn't own one. And I'll tell you something: unlike your city, we can walk our streets and through our parks at night and feel safe. Muggers operating out here they just plain get their asses blown up.""

At one point, Kersey watches a TV news program, which is covering one of his vigilante acts. The TV anchor says: ""The actions of the vigilante, as lawless as they may be, seem to be giving others new attitudes toward crime in the streets. Instead of helplessly allowing themselves to be mugged and robbed, a few are fighting back.""

Americans today are fearful about their safety. Thousands of people flocked to the Florida State Fairgrounds last week for a gun show event, shortly after the high school shooting that left 17 dead.

“Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights,” the manager of the show said.

The new Willis vehicle is already being slammed – and tied to President Trump.

""Like a Donald Trump speech on immigration, the unspoken threat against normal (white) American (white) families is articulated as practically inevitable. It’s less of a question and more of a statement: Bad people are here and bad things are coming. Will you just sit back and let this happen to you? Where is your weapon?"" writes The Daily Beast. ""The trailer stops just short of effectively selling a Trumpian fantasy, and instead exists in a confusing space that’s just plain not the world we live in.""

And more: ""Apparently you can make the movie today, but if you’re thinking that this still isn’t the right time for vigilante porn, you’re right. The horrible, chilling truth is that, as insensitive as it may seem to release this film at this moment, there never will be a 'good time' for Death Wish – not just because the politics of the movie are problematic at best but because, if we keep going the way we’re going, there will just be another tragedy around the time of the next release date.”

Whichever way you slice it, the new ""Death Wish"" is going to create a huge conversation. And it won't be pretty."

Brandon Minoff, an 18-year-old senior, said the media chose to target gun control advocates instead of focusing on the 17 lives lost in Wednesday's slaughter.

“I wholeheartedly believe that the media is politicizing this tragedy,” Minoff said. “It seems that gun control laws is the major topic of conversation rather than focusing on the bigger issue of 17 innocent lives being taken at the hands of another human.”

FLORIDA SHOOTING SURVIVOR: CNN GAVE ME ‘SCRIPTED’ QUESTION FOR TOWN HALL, QUASHED QUESTION ON ARMED GUARDS

Minoff said students at the school are well-meaning and passionate on both sides of the contentious gun issue. At least 100 students from the school were expected to march in front of the State Capital in Tallahassee on Wednesday to demand stricter gun laws. Dozens of his classmates have willingly approached reporters and anchors to advocate for what they see as solutions to stop the school shooting epidemic. But Minoff said not all of the students at the school share the same stance -- yet most of the coverage has ignored those who favor gun rights.

“I know many people who are pro-gun and others who support gun control but it seems that the media is specifically targeting those in support of gun control to make it seem as if they are the majority, and the liberal news outlets are the ones that seem to make the bigger effort to speak to these people, and I'm talking from experience,” said Minoff, who was interviewed on cable news in primetime.

Minoff, who had a class with shooter Nikolas Cruz during his sophomore year, was outside when Cruz started firing. Minoff's brother, Aiden, was inside and heard the shots.

But Minoff said as soon as the gunfire stopped, the gun control push began.

“After getting home Wednesday night, three hours after the shooting took place, sitting on the couch and putting on the news, it pained me to hear conversations of gun control laws as I had just luckily escaped one of the deadliest school shootings in US history,"" Minoff said.

MSNBC’s Brian Williams asked Minoff what he would do as a lawmaker to stop school shootings. Minoff immediately replied that banning guns just creates a higher demand for them, and contended the real issue is mental health reform.

The next day, Minoff said he watched as CNN again focused on gun control even as the shooter's troubling mental health history -- and missed warning signs -- began to emerge.

“And all day Thursday, CNN was interviewing gun experts and specialists to brainwash the audience that gun control is a necessity,” he said. “They even have an army of my classmates trying to persuade other students that guns are unnecessary and should be illegal.”

Minoff said he supports the First Amendment rights of his classmates, but he believes many of them are uninformed about guns and are just going along with the perceived popular opinion.

He pointed out that on the “March For Our Lives” website the mission statement says “We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the life of students.” But, he noted, an assault rifle is an automatic weapon, and there wasn’t an assault rifle used in the Florida shooting -- rather Cruz was armed with an AR-15.

Like many of his classmates, Minoff wants to make changes so this doesn’t happen again, and he hopes to meet with President Trump to discuss solutions.

Minoff supports some regulations when it comes to purchasing firearms, such as age restrictions and more extensive background checks that include police reports -- especially given the police were called to the Cruz residence nearly 40 times before the shooting occurred.

“I would also talk about the importance of arming security guards and other trained individuals in schools,"" he said. ""The only armed person in the school, the SRO, was reportedly nowhere to be found during the time of the attack and it shows in the fact that Cruz managed to vacate the school unscathed.""

FLORIDA TEACHER OF THE YEAR’S GUN VIOLENCE POST GOES VIRAL AFTER SCHOOL SHOOTING

He added: ""At the same time, [security guard and] Coach Aaron Feis had a face-to-face altercation with Cruz and was unable to do anything but use his body to shield others. The definition of security is ‘state of being free from danger or threat,’ but there is no freedom from danger or threat when security guards are unarmed.”"

In a flurry of tweets, the president hit back at media coverage of his comments about arming teachers the day before. He suggested his remarks were mischaracterized, but made clear he supports allowing some trained teachers to carry concealed weapons.

“I never said ‘give teachers guns’ like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving ‘concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience- only the best,” Trump tweeted.

“20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards,” Trump added. “A ‘gun free’ school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!”

The president’s tweets followed a listening session at the White House Wednesday afternoon with students, parents and teachers affected by the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting last week which left 17 dead. He also invited parents affected by the Sandy Hook and Columbine massacres.

During the almost two-hour session, Trump left the floor open for suggestions to prevent school shootings. One parent floated the idea of concealed-carry for teachers—an idea the president discussed at length with support, noting the administration would look “very strongly” at the option. His Thursday morning tweets seemed to double down on his earlier comments, even as he criticized media coverage.

At the same time, Trump made clear Thursday that he will urge several new gun law restrictions -- including raising the age for purchasing firearms, something sources said he was considering.

“I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health,” Trump tweeted Thursday. “Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue—I hope!”

TRUMP ON PREVENTING MASS SHOOTINGS: 'WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE'

But Trump especially sought to clarify and defend his comments about guns in schools.

Trump said Wednesday that “a gun-free zone to a maniac, they’re all cowards, is 'let’s go in and attack because bullets aren’t coming at us.'”

On Thursday, he tweeted: “History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/ coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!”

Minutes later, Trump added: “If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there…problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work.”

While top NRA officials on Thursday – at the Conservative Political Action Conference – pushed back on gun control calls, Trump said at another listening session late Thursday morning that the NRA “is ready to do things.”

Among those things, he said the NRA would back his call to raise the purchasing age to 21.

Thursday’s listening session was for state and local officials on how to improve school safety. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky and others attended, along with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

“We want to ensure that when we see warning signs, we act quickly. This guy was a sicko,” the president said at the beginning of the meeting. “There’s a tremendous feeling that we want to get something done … including at the NRA.”

The president noted that he has called “many lawmakers” in recent days.

“They’re into doing background checks that maybe they wouldn’t be thinking about [a few weeks ago],” Trump said.

Earlier this week, the president directed Sessions to create new regulations to ban firearm modifiers, including the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas massacre in October 2017.

Under current federal law, licensed firearm dealers cannot sell handguns to people under 21 and cannot sell long guns to people under 18, according to the Giffords Law Center, which tracks gun laws and advocates for more restrictions. Some states already impose laws with tighter minimum age requirements.

The National Rifle Association, which endorsed Trump in the 2016 presidential election, quickly rejected any talk of raising the age for buying long guns to 21.

“Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection,” the NRA said in a statement.

It is unclear at this point, however, whether Trump will push for a change in federal law or encourage a change at the state level."

If only reducing crime and suicides was so easy. In reality, gun control efforts in Australia have not been as successful as we’ve been led to believe.

In fact, the only proven policy to stop gun attacks is deterrence – by allowing law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and others, as President Trump correctly pointed out Thursday on Twitter and in remarks at the White House.

The president tweeted: “If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school.”

The president added: “Cowards won’t go there ... problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!”

European countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands have even stricter gun control laws than Australia does, but their mass public shooting rates are at least as high as those in the United States.

This effective action proposed by the president has been greeted with disdain by most of the media.

Instead, news organizations such as USA Today , the New York Times and the Washington Post have all run stories in recent days crediting Australia’s 1996-1997 gun buyback program with cutting the firearm homicide and suicide rates in half, and eliminating mass public shootings.

Our friends in Australia have been only too eager to offer advice telling us to follow their example.

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently offered to explain to Americans the best gun control regulations. Over this past weekend a church in Australia got international attention for putting up a sign saying: “When will they love their kids more than their guns.”

Responding, anti-gun politicians from Hillary Clinton to President Obama have pointed to Australia’s gun laws as a model that we should closely examine.

But looking at simple before-and-after averages of gun deaths in Australia regarding the gun buyback is extremely misleading. Firearm homicides and suicides were falling from the mid-1980s onwards, so you could pick out any subsequent year and the average firearm homicide and suicide rates after that year would be down compared to the average before it.

The question is whether the rate of decline changed after the gun buyback law went into effect. But the decline in firearm homicides and suicides actually slowed down after the buyback.

Australia’s buyback resulted in almost 1 million guns being handed in and destroyed, but after that private gun ownership once again steadily increased and now exceeds what it was before the buyback.

In fact, since 1997 gun ownership in Australia grew over three times faster than the population (from 2.5 million to 5.8 million guns).

Gun control advocates should have predicted a sudden drop in firearm homicides and suicides after the buyback, and then an increase as the gun ownership rate increased again. But that clearly didn’t happen.

For other crimes, such as armed robbery, what happened is the exact opposite of what was predicted. The armed robbery rate soared right after the gun buyback, then gradually declined.

Gun control advocates like to note that there has been no mass public shooting in Australia since the buyback. But they are simply picking out a country that happens to “prove” what they want it to prove.

European countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands have even stricter gun control laws than Australia does, but their mass public shooting rates are at least as high as those in the United States.

During the Obama administration, the per capita casualty rate from shootings in the European Union was actually 27 percent higher than the U.S. rate.

Even excluding fights over sovereignty and including the recent attacks in Las Vegas, the Texas church shooting in November, and the Florida school massacre, the number of mass shootings in the rest of the world has been much worse than in the U.S. since at least as far back as 1970.

Many point to the widely covered work by the University of Alabama’s Adam Lankford, who claims that 31 percent of mass public shootings from 1966 to 2012 have occurred in the U.S. But Lankford’s totals don’t line up with others, and he has refused repeated requests to release a list of his cases.

New Zealand also provides a useful comparison to Australia. They are both isolated, island nations, and have similar socioeconomics and demographics. Their mass murder rates were nearly identical prior to Australia’s gun buyback.

From 1980 to 1996, Australia’s mass murder rate was 0.0042 incidents per 100,000 people. New Zealand’s was 0.0050 incidents per 100,000 people. After 1997, both countries experienced similar drops in mass murders, even though New Zealand had not altered its gun control laws.

It would be just as misleading for gun control critics to cite only New Zealand as it is for gun control advocates to cite Australia.

The right approach is to look at a lot of similar places and see what gun control measures actually made a difference. To do just that, Bill Landes of the University of Chicago and I collected data on all multiple-victim public shootings in all the United States from 1977 to 1999.

We examined 13 different gun control policies, including: waiting periods, registration, background checks, bans on assault weapons, the death penalty, and harsher penalties for committing a crime with a firearm.

But only one policy reduced the number and severity of mass public shootings: allowing victims to defend themselves with permitted, concealed handguns.

Since 1950, all but six U.S. mass public shootings have happened in areas where general citizens were banned from having guns. And in Europe, every single mass public shooting has occurred where guns are banned.

Killers have good reason to avoid places where people have guns. In dozens of cases concealed-carry gun permit holders have stopped mass public shootings. In the Texas church shooting last year, the killer was killing the wounded when a man living near the church shot him.

Yet gun control advocates keep focusing on laws that won’t make any difference. None of the mass public shootings since at least 2000 would have been stopped by universal background checks.

Relying on Australia requires a misreading of the evidence, and requires that we ignore what has happened in all the other countries with strict regulations. The truth is that gun control hasn't worked for anyone."

“You don’t shoot up a high school without thinking about it for a very, very, very, long and dark time,” said Dr. Jordan Peterson, a psychologist at the University of Toronto. “You go places when you’re doing that that no reasonable person would ever want to go.”

After the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., many have blamed lax gun control laws and an inadequate mental health support system for why there is an uptick in mass shootings.

But experts say there are other factors to consider.

The phenomenon of mass school shootings, and the apparent uptick in them in recent years, occurs as violent crime rates have been declining.

A confluence of factors may be contributing to it.

For one, gender is a big factor.

“An epidemic of nihilistic hopelessness,” Peterson said. “Not just young men, young people in general, but young men are more likely to act it out in a violent manner.”

There is also a contagion effect of mass shootings. Killers know they’ll get the nonstop attention from media outlets — attention they so crave, and often miss out on, in life.

“It’s so spectacular. It gives particularly resentful people who are lost and aiming down, $100 million of free publicity. The stakes are very high. It’s not like they’re ill-informed about their predecessors. There’s an element of competition to this,” Peterson said.

He suggests media ban the names of such killers and limit the coverage of them to help stem the contagion.

Some believe the roots of the mass-shooting phenomenon may lie in the 1960s Cultural Revolution. That epochal time brought welcome change to discrimination against women and minorities. But many contend it led to the tossing out of deeply imbedded traditions of Western Culture from art, architecture, literature, family structure, and traditional roles.

“It’s almost impossible to express how much more important it is to be a mother or a parent who guides rearing and development of a child than it is to be a mere research scientist,” Yale University computer sciences professor David Gelernter said.

Gelernter is blunt about his belief that the ‘60s revolution replaced rigorous scholarship in the American academy with dumbed-down curricula — hurting even Ivy League students.

“They don’t know anything. We’ve given ourselves a pass in educating and rearing them as result of the Cultural Revolution,” he said.

Gelernter argues in his book, “America Lite,” that, as in totalitarian states like Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and Communist China, American academia underwent a purge of tradition which filtered down through secondary schools — through art, media, and even the family structure.

“We’ve done enormous destruction. We’ve wreaked havoc with our children and our children’s children,” he said.

Now, into a second generation of the students taught this way, secondary schools have more to contend with than they can handle.

“They’re called on to act as parents to those children whose parents aren’t acting like parents. They’re called upon to be psychologists and judicial agents and all of these things, and they simply can’t do it,” Peterson said.

Many feminist critics say the revolution hasn’t evolved enough — that young men and boys are governed by a “toxic” kind of masculinity.

“The man’s fear that he’s losing his power, and because minorities and women are taking higher positions and have more power (than) white men and men in general, they are afraid that they’re going to lose their strength and their virility,” Kathy Areu, publisher of Catalina Magazine, told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson recently.

Peterson and Gelernter believe gun control and mental-health debates that arise with inevitable predictability in the aftermath of a mass shooting can wait.

A higher priority, they say, is to fix the culture and broken boys with time-tested ideals of masculine role modeling, responsibility and sacrifice — as well as the Judeo-Christian ethic upon which Western Culture was built.

“The human need for religion is more desperate than it has ever been. Science, cosmology is every bit as relevant as it’s ever been, and yet we allowed cynics in philosophy and science to drive us away from our roots,” Gelernter said.

Peterson sends this plea to adults who would help disoriented youth: “They need to have one person in their life, one straight arrow that flies true to orient themselves properly. If they don’t have that, they can be easily lost.”

Peterson’s new book addresses this phenomenon, in part: “12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos” rocketed to No. 1 on Amazon on Jan. 16, its first day of release, and has remained in the top-two spots ever since."
fox66,fox,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",2018-03-02 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/02/school-shootings-prompt-more-teachers-to-consider-carrying-guns.html,"Kasey Hansen didn’t like guns.

The special education teacher from the Salt Lake City region didn’t grow up in a family with guns, and had never gone hunting. She certainly didn’t think guns had a place schools.

“I was honestly scared of guns. I thought that they would just randomly go off, and that they were dangerous,” Hansen told Fox News.

But the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, which left 20 students and six staff members dead, changed her mind.

“I did not go into teaching thinking about a shooting in my school,” Hansen said. “But holing up inside a classroom and hoping the shooter doesn’t see you didn’t seem like a good idea. So I decided to take a class to get a concealed carry permit.”

Sandy Hook affected other teachers and school officials across the country, and sparked a national debate around the idea of arming educators. That debate has reignited in the weeks since 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people with an AR-15 assault rifle in his former Florida high school.

“When you have these shootings it’s about the high number of casualties, and these shooters think they’re successful when more people die,” said a language arts teacher from rural Ohio, who asked not to be named. “But we can stop them and if I can save the life of just one student than I think it’s worth carrying a gun.”

Gun rights advocates say that since the Sandy Hook massacre, the number of individual teachers and school districts interested in arming themselves on campus has risen exponentially, with some programs having to put interested applicants on a waiting list to meet the demand. But if a teacher who gets a concealed carry permit can actually carry a weapon in school varies widely, depending on the state they work in.

There are about 10 states that allow concealed carry weapons on school campuses. In Utah, for example, state law allows Hansen to possess a concealed firearm, even though her school doesn’t officially condone it.

And while the majority of states have laws prohibiting anyone from carrying a gun on school property, there are a select few, like Ohio and Missouri, where school districts can supersede state law and permit their staff to carry guns.

“We looked at other options such as having a resource officer here fulltime but they were all cost prohibitive,” Aaron Sydow, the superintendent at the Fairview R-XI School District in Missouri, told Fox News. “We decided to go ahead with the program and now we love it and stand by it.”

Gun rights advocates argue a teacher with a gun is not only a deterrent to a school shooter, but also the first line of defense in protecting students.

“The general public thinks that we’re just standing outside the doors of schools handing out guns,” Dean Rieck, the executive director of the Buckeye Firearms Association, told Fox News. “But we’re not trying to turn teachers into cops. We’re looking to give them the tools to save lives before the professionals arrive.”

Rieck and other pro-gun advocates noted the training teachers receive goes far beyond that of most local law enforcement agencies. The training includes not just basic gun skills and target practice, but everything from how to make a tourniquet and stanch a bullet wound to unorthodox shooting stances and SWAT team maneuvers.

Depending on the school district, teachers undergo between 40 and 150 hours of training before they can carry a concealed weapon on campus. They must also be able to hit a target with 90 percent accuracy. Most local police forces require only a 70 percent rate.

“If people could see the training we do and the depth of what we learn, I think that they would think differently about arming teachers,” said the Ohio language arts teacher.

And to even qualify for the programs, a teacher must undergo a mental health evaluation with a psychiatrist, already have a concealed carry permit, and be able to pass random drug screenings.

“Teachers have to know how to be able to take care of a problem and how to use force,” Sydow said. “Even if the ultimate goal is that nobody has to use it in school.”

The idea of concealed firearms in schools has faced opposition from a diverse array of groups – including many teachers unions and law enforcement groups – who argue more guns in school will do nothing to prevent these shootings.

“There is just not enough evidence to support the idea that a teacher would be able to neutralize a threat,” Amy Klinger, the director of programs at the Educator’s School Safety Network, told Fox News. “What makes us think that a social studies teacher can do something that law enforcement has troubled doing?”

New York City Police Department Commissioner James O’Neill is one of the most high profile cops to speak out against arming teachers, calling the proposal “not a good idea” during a press conference last week.

“Let teachers teach,” he said, according to the New York Post. “Having a gun, it’s a big responsibility. You have issues of safeguarding the weapons, you have issues of training. This is what law enforcement does, and you should leave it to law enforcement to protect the children of New York City.”

Klinger seconded O’Neill’s comment and added there are other safety concerns that should be addressed before school decided to put guns in the hands of teachers.

Among the changes Klinger suggested were better mental health programs in schools, and implementing systems to identify students who potentially pose a threat, better building and perimeter security on campus and changing the arrival and dismissal procedures.

Teachers and school officials in districts that allow concealed carry firearms don’t disagree with Klinger that there are other issues at play. But they say arming educators is something that can immediately make a difference – particularly when other tactics fail.

“Guns are just one aspect of the 20 different solutions to this,” Hansen said. “We want to nip the problem in the bud before a shooting happens.

""But look at what happened in Florida. Everyone knew what he was capable of, and he still was able to get into the school and take innocent lives.”"

I don’t like to speak out at these times, because as Ecclesiastes correctly tells us there is “a time to every purpose under the heaven,” including “a time to mourn.”

But then someone kicks me in the shin.

This time it was CNN media reporter Brian Stelter, saying on CNN’s “New Day” program Wednesday that the National Rifle Association and gun owners don’t want to tell the truth about guns.

No, the truth that is many in the media refuse to cover the truth about guns and the gun cultures in America. They don’t want to admit there are two wildly different gun cultures in our country. One is the freedom-loving, gun-rights culture that upholds the responsible use of guns for hunting, sport and self-defense. The other is the criminal culture that thrives in the places where government restricts gun rights.

Not acknowledging that the two cultures exist separately, and instead pretending legal gun owners are responsible for crimes committed by the illegal gun culture in America, isn’t just a lie. It is getting good people killed.

In the most recent mass murder last week at a Florida high school, where 14 students and three adults were killed, the FBI failed in its responsibility – not guns or gun owners. That was hardly an anomaly. In many other cases a murderer should have been denied legal access to guns, but the bureaucracy failed us.

In other cases, from Columbine High School in Colorado to the Pulse nightclub in Florida, law enforcement opted not to charge in to stop the carnage. They had their own safety in mind, but nevertheless this tells a person who carries concealed that they can’t depend on law enforcement during such a scenario.

And no matter how good a job law enforcement agencies do, police cannot be everywhere at all times when criminals may decide to begin murdering innocents. Because of this, disarming responsible and law-abiding gun owners to take away their ability to defend themselves and others is dangerous, and can result in greater loss of lives.

Meanwhile, the big lie being pushed in the media is that guns and the freedom enjoyed by America’s more than 100 million law-abiding gun owners are somehow to blame for murders. That narrative alienates gun owners and misdirects resources away from solving real problems.

America’s gun owners aren’t the problem. They are allies in the fight to stop criminals who use guns.

Blaming guns also isn’t rational. First of all because guns don’t commit crimes all by themselves, but also because rifles of all types are used in less than 3 percent of murders each year in the U.S., according to FBI uniform crime reports.

Semiautomatic firearms aren’t even new – they are a late 19th century invention. The AR-15 (called an “assault weapon” in the media, though that is a meaningless political moniker) was first sold to U.S. citizens in 1963, the same year the U.S. Army began buying M16s from Colt.

Semiautomatic firearms – pistols, rifles and shotguns – are the most popular sold today for hunting, self-defense and target shooting. As the 1994 law banning assault weapons showed, there is no real way to even define what constitutes an “assault weapon,” other than by deciding to ban whatever looks scariest to some lawmakers.

So how do we stop more murderers?

First, by working with America’s many gun owners. Blaming freedom for the actions of criminals is just nonsensical. It also misdirects resources and, if that ideology gets its way, simply reduces the freedom of the law-abiding citizenry – not the criminals who by definition will break the law.

When we stop blaming legal gun owners and guns for murders we’ll be left, by the process of elimination, with those who are really to blame: criminals, some of whom are mentally ill.

We’ll also have to acknowledge that good citizens are being harmed because they aren’t allowed to carry arms for their own defense in some areas of this otherwise free country.

Such a change, which actually has been taking place, causes the big, responsible gun culture in America – the one that bought the millions of legal guns over the last decade as violent crime rates fell – to invade the areas where the illegal gun culture dominates, because laws prevent good citizens from utilizing their rights.

This would also allow us to stop wasting energy in this endless loop of blame. We do need to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The National Shooting Sports Foundation and the NRA are for this; in fact, there is bill right now working its way through Congress designed to do this.

Other things also need to be done, such as firing whoever didn’t pass the tip about the accused Florida killer being dangerous to the FBI’s Miami field office. Changes must be made to be sure agencies tasked with protecting us act more competently.

Of course we’ll never stop all murderers, whether they are committed by terrorists, bank robbers or the mentally ill. But it would help if we could channel our attention and resources toward criminals and the mentally ill who are a danger to themselves or others – not the good citizens who live across this great nation."

On Wednesday, Lawrence attended the New York preimere of her film, and she told the Associated Press that a division between the entertainment industry and politics is needed.

“I think that, you know, we’re the entertainment industry. At some point, there has to be a separation between politics and the entertainment industry or we’re going to suffer,” she said. “This is, it’s an art. And it’s an art to entertain and, as an industry, we will suffer and people need to take that responsibility on themselves.”

The ""Hunger Games"" actress went on to say, “The same kind of violence is in different parts of the country that don’t have as many problems as we do.""

Lawrence, who is no stranger to using firearms in films such as ""Winter's Bone"" and ""X-Men"" then clarified, “I think the problems is guns not the entertainment industry.”

Though the star decided to vocalize her opinion on gun violence, in the March issue of Vanity Fair, Lawrence admitted that she tries her best to stay away from politics.

“I’ve always thought that it was a good idea to stay out of politics,” the actress said in the spread. ""My family obviously hates every time I talk about politics because it’s hard to see your kid get criticized and they live in Kentucky, where nobody is really liking what I’m saying.""

But the actress recently announced that she plans to take a break from acting for the next year in order to focus on local political work.

""I'm going to be working with this organization as a part of Represent.Us ... trying to get young people engaged politically on a local level,"" the 27-year-old Academy Award winner told Entertainment Tonight in February. Lawrence went on to clarify that her involvement in the organization does not deal directly with party politics.

""It doesn't have anything to do with partisan [politics],"" she said. ""It's just anti-corruption and stuff trying to pass state-by-state laws that can help prevent corruption, fix our democracy."""

Kevin Torres, 18, was believed to have killed Tania Arbaiza, 37, before killing himself, Denver Police said.

The Denver Post reported Torres and Arbaiza appeared to have split days before the incident according to some cryptic social media posts.

Torres posted on Facebook Monday, “Sometimes you gotta give up on people. Not because you don’t care but because they don’t.”

Arbaiza shared a message on Facebook from another social media user on Feb. 20 that read, “When you have a good heart, help too much, trust too much, give too much, love too much, this is what happens.” The post also had an illustration of a boy with sharp objects drawn to his back.

The teen’s last Facebook post on Monday contained four drawings of grim reapers and read, “Sacred death will never abandon him and will be with him forever.”

Torres was slated to be sentenced Monday for a “felony trespassing conviction,” the Denver Post reported. He was arrested on May 26 on robbery charges and later pled guilty to “a reduced charge of trespassing.”

Torres’ death was ruled a suicide and Arbaiza’s a homicide, the Denver Medical Examiner’s Office stated. The two natives of El Salvador were found dead at the scene. Police were called to the scene after responding to a burglary report.

""He shot her, unfortunately, and then took his own life,” Sonny Jackson, a Denver Police Department spokesperson said. “If detectives confirm the officers’ belief that the case was a murder-suicide, the case will be closed”

“There’s nothing else we can do,” he concluded."

In South Carolina']",2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/how-do-gun-background-checks-work-look-at-current-system.html,"In the wake of the mass shooting at a Florida high school earlier this month, President Trump is seemingly open to strengthening federal background checks for gun purchases.

""While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday.

Sanders said the president has spoken to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, about a bill to “improve federal compliance with criminal background check legislation.”

Trump has said on social media he wants to “be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on Mental Health.” He's also said tackling background checks is an issue that needs both Republican and Democratic support.

During an emotional listening session at the White House this week with parents and students impacted by school violence, Trump promised to be “very strong on background checks.”

Here’s a look at how the federal background check system currently works, and what experts and activists have to say about it.

What happens when you want to purchase a gun?

In order to purchase a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer (FFL), a consumer must provide identification and pass a federal background check using the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ 4473 form.

The first page of the document requires basic information, including the buyer’s full name, address, sex, birthday and ethnicity. A Social Security number is encouraged, but not required.

The form also asks the buyer about criminal background, immigration status and mental health — information that could result in a consumer being denied. Those questions include:

Have you ever been convicted in any court of a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could have imprisoned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation?

Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug or any other controlled substance?

Have you been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions?

Have you ever been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence?

Lying on the federal form is a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, an ATF spokesperson confirmed to Fox News. That penalty is also listed at the top of the form.

Once the form is completed, the dealer will submit it to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) online or by phone. Then, almost immediately, the licensed seller will know how to continue with the sale:

Proceed: If NICS indicates the seller can proceed, then the sale can continue.

Canceled or Denied: Should NICS mark the form as “canceled” or “denied,” the seller cannot legally sell the firearm to the buyer. Michael Smith, the vice president of marketing and media for Upstate Armory Group, a firearm dealer in Simpsonville, S.C., told Fox News he generally provides the customer with contact information for a local lawyer who handles restoration of firearm rights in case the failed background check is erroneous. There have been times police have arrived at the gun shop to arrest the customer who legally cannot purchase a gun, Smith said.

Delayed: If the background check elicits a “delayed” response from NICS, the seller cannot complete the transaction for at least three business days. Unless a specific “denied” designation is issued, the seller will be able to complete the transaction with the customer after that period elapses, under federal law.

Even before a 4473 form is filled out, Robbie Wheaton, vice president of the Wheaton Arms Inc. gun shop in Piedmont, S.C., said he takes note of the customer. If a customer seems to be intoxicated or “shady” – talking, for instance, about a cheating spouse – dealers don’t have to sell that person a gun.

“A shop has a final right to say ‘no’ based on a person’s behavior whether they will sell a firearm to them or not.” - Robbie Wheaton, vice president of Wheaton Arms Inc. in South Carolina

“As a federal firearms licensee, we have the right to be able to refuse the transfer of firearms to someone,” Wheaton told Fox News. “A shop has a final right to say ‘no’ based on a person’s behavior whether they will sell a firearm to them or not.”

Smith praised the background check system, as it can flag other discrepancies for sellers, such as an age issue.

South Carolina law, for example, prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from purchasing a long gun (such as an AR-15) and anyone under 21 from buying a pistol, handgun or other firearm, he said. The background check can prevent sellers, particularly at hectic gun shows, from accidentally selling a firearm to someone who isn’t of age, Smith said.

Why do I have to complete the background check?

Thanks to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, the FBI created the NICS in 1998. The system is supposed to instantaneously let a firearms dealer know whether a buyer is legally allowed to purchase the gun.

According to the FBI, more than 230 million checks have been made by cashiers prior to a purchase and more than 1.3 million denials have been issued since the system was put in place.

Is this process the same in every state?

No.

In South Carolina, for example, consumers who already have a concealed weapons permit do not need to go through a background check in order to purchase a firearm in the state, multiple dealers in the Palmetto State told Fox News.

Also, state laws may be superseded by federal law. The 4473 form asks consumers about marijuana use. Those who use the drug, in states where recreational or medicinal use is legal, will be denied a firearm, Wheaton said.

In Hawaii, after the first legal medicinal marijuana dispensary opened in the state in 2017, local law enforcement agencies asked users who are also gun owners to turn in their firearms within 30 days, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.

Is this system strong enough?

It depends on who you ask.

Jonas Oransky, the deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, praised the background check system but said it has “significant gaps.”

Specifically, Oransky’s organization points to a “private sale loophole.” Federal law requires licensed dealers to complete background checks, but people can also purchase guns from a private seller – such as a friend or through online classifieds websites like ArmsList.com. (ArmsList.com prompts users to “accept” a terms of use document, which acknowledges the website doesn’t certify or investigate transactions and instructs users not to use the site for “illegal purposes.”)

“It doesn’t matter necessarily if people are selling at scale,” Oransky told Fox News. “It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller.”

Wheaton, who has been in the firearms business full time since 2007, said he and other licensed sellers try to persuade customers to transfer guns through a licensed dealer so a background check can be conducted.

Oransky also pointed to the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed – when NICS marks a document “delayed” but does not approve or deny it within three business days. He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers, citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency.

“The FBI should have the time they need to complete a background check. It’s more important than expediting sales to people who shouldn’t have a gun,” he said.

On the other hand, Second Amendment advocates argue that the background check system already does too much.

“We don’t think it’s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit, told Fox News.

“Our rights are listed in the Bill of Rights for a reason,” he continued. “People’s rights are being infringed upon and it’s resulting – in some cases – in death and in other cases extreme inconvenience in being able to purchase firearms.”

Pratt also said the background check system doesn’t do its job, as several of the more recent mass shooters in the U.S., including the suspect in the fatal shooting of 17 people in Parkland, Fla., were able to pass background checks.

fox71,fox,[],2012-12-28 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/28/teachers-in-utah-ohio-get-free-gun-training.html,"Gun-rights advocates in Utah offered six hours of training Thursday in handling concealed weapons for hundreds of Utah teachers in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.

The latest effort to arm teachers to confront school assailants was organized by the Utah Shooting Sports Council, which hosted the training session to help educators become eligible for concealed firearm permits, FOX 13 News reported.

More than 200 teachers flocked to the training class in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City. Raye Ann Blauer, a kindergarten teacher, told FOX 13 she is considering using her permit to carry a firearm at school.

“[A]fter everything that happened in Connecticut, I want to be aware of how I can help in the classroom and protect my kids and whatnot. Be aware,” Blauer said. “I think it’s really smart. Especially with everything that’s happened lately.”

English teacher Kevin Leatherbarrow holds a license to carry a concealed weapon and doesn't see anything wrong with arming teachers in the aftermath of the deadly Connecticut school shooting.

""We're sitting ducks,"" said Leatherbarrow, who works at a Utah charter school. ""You don't have a chance in hell. You're dead -- no ifs, ands or buts.""

In Ohio, a firearms group said it was launching a test program in tactical firearms training for 24 teachers. The Arizona attorney general is proposing a change to state law to allow an educator in each school to carry a gun.

The moves come after the National Rifle Association proposed placing an armed officer at each of the nation's schools after a gunman on Dec. 14 killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

There are already police officers in some of the nation's schools. Parents and educators, however, have questioned how safe the NRA proposal would keep kids, whether it would be economically feasible and how it would alter student life.

Some educators say it is dangerous to allow guns. Among the dangers are teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and accidentally or purposely shooting classmates.

""It's a terrible idea,"" said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education. ""It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.""

Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could, but legislators left them with no choice. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from imposing their own gun restrictions.

Educators say they have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate 1 percent of Utah teachers, or 240, are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many do so at school.

Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of deadly shooting that took place in Connecticut.

""We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls"" for an armed intruder, said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's leading gun lobby. ""They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter"" breaks into a classroom, he said.

The council said it would waive its $50 fee for the training. Instruction will feature plastic guns and a major emphasis will be for people who are facing deadly threats to announce they have a gun and retreat or take cover before trying to shoot, he said.

""Mass shootings may still be rare, but that doesn't help you when the monster comes in.""

At the class, teachers offered their fingerprints for a permit as an instructor in the ""psychology of mass violence"" kicked off the gun class.

""I just bought a bra holster,"" said Jessica Fiveash, a 32-year-old Utah teacher and wife of a retired Army sergeant who grew up shooting and said she had no hesitation packing a gun at school. ""Women can't really carry a gun on their hip.""

Utah is among few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws.

Leatherbarrow said he often felt threatened while working at an inner-city school in Buffalo, N.Y., where he got a license to carry a pistol. He moved less than a year ago to Utah, where he feels safer.

But he said gun violence can break out anywhere. He said he was highly trained in handling guns -- and was taking criticism from parents who don't appreciate his views on school safety.

""I'm in agreement not everybody should be carrying firearms in school. They're not trained. But for some parents to think we're cowboys, that frustrates me,"" he said. ""I wish parents would understand.""

Cavalier Knight applied for a gun permit from the New York City Police Department in 2014. He went to court when the application was denied. He claimed the NYPD violated his Second Amendment rights.

But in a decision posted Friday, a judge rejected that claim while upholding New York’s tough gun control law, the New York Daily News reported Saturday.

Manhattan State Court Judge Michael Stallings said the NYPD was not infringing on Knight’s constitutional rights by refusing to let him bear arms on sales calls.

The independent arms merchant argued that without a gun it would be easier for criminals and terrorists to steal his goods.

“That claim is based upon pure speculation, which is unsupported by any evidence,” the judge said.

Knight is a New York City resident and sells weaponry through Armored Mobility, a California firm.

The NYPD denied Knight’s application, saying that he had been selling firearms without incident for years and that he failed to show he’s in more danger than others in his profession."

1,992,219 checks were conducted through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, last month. The number represents an increase of nearly 200,000 checks, or more than ten percent, over September 2015. September is the 17th month in a row to set a new record within its month, a streak dating back to May 2015.

The FBI’s accounting of how many NICS checks were processed in a month is considered one of the most accurate metrics for judging gun sales. Virtually all sales made through licensed gun dealers must include a NICS check. Some states require sales between private parties to include an NICS check as well.

The number is not a one-to-one measure, however.

“These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS,” a note on the FBI report cautioned. “They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.”

3-D industrial printers that can create plastic models and prototypes can make workable guns that can't be picked up by metal detectors, and officials say they could pose a threat to countless government institutions, schools and other buildings.

A longtime ban on undetectable firearms is scheduled to expire Dec. 9 and two Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer of New York and Bill Nelson of Florida, have called for a ban on plastic guns. Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., also has introduced legislation on the issue.

""The expiration of this law, combined with advances in 3-D printing, make what was once a hypothetical threat into a terrifying reality,"" said Schumer. ""We are actively exploring all options to pass legislation that will eliminate the problem.""

In a meeting with reporters Wednesday, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said plastic guns present a special challenge for law enforcement agencies.

The agents said that in order to comply with current law, a person manufacturing a gun must use a certain amount of metal in the finished product so that the firearm is detectable by scanners at airports, federal buildings, sporting events -- any place where security screening is in place. If the law expires, someone could legally make and sell firearms that are undetectable.

A loophole in the existing law allows someone to make an illegal gun legal by simply attaching a removable metal piece to the weapon. That piece could be removed if someone wanted to sneak the weapon into a protected location.

Israel's legislation would require certain major components of a gun be made of metal.

The Wall Street Journal reports ATF agents said there are not any known instances of a person being shot with a plastic gun in the U.S., nor are there criminal investigations open involving one.

Additionally, officials do not believe there is a risk that street criminals will be able to mass produce guns using 3-D printing technology, as the printer required to produce a gun can cost more than $100,000 and quality varies.

""This is more for someone who wants to get into an area and perhaps be an assassin,"" Richard Marianos, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the Wall Street Journal. ""Or they want to go to a courthouse and shoot a witness.""

ATF spokesman Christopher Amon said that the agency does not comment on specific legislation, but provides technical advice and assistance to members of Congress and their staff on a variety of firearms-related issues.

The Justice Department has not weighed in on the issue.

As a firearm owner myself, I wear this description proudly.

Gun ownership is not a special privilege reserved for a select few. It is a constitutionally protected freedom to which the government should be completely colorblind.

I am not the only one. There are approximately 300 million privately owned firearms in the United States; a number that rises by 10 million annually. And those of us who clung to our Second Amendment rights before are keeping an even tighter grip today as the Obama administration continues its efforts to chip away at these fundamental freedoms.

Gun ownership is not a special privilege reserved for a select few. It is a constitutionally protected freedom to which the government should be completely colorblind.

In the years since President Obama made those telling remarks, he has proposed bans on so-called “assault weapons” and high capacity magazine clips; publicly opposed bipartisan, House-passed legislation to free up public lands for recreational hunting; and his handpicked Attorney General oversaw the illegal transfer of some 2,000 firearms across our border into Mexico as part of the failed “Operation Fast and Furious.”

Our conservative majority in the House of Representatives has stood firm in its opposition to proposals that would erode our Second Amendment freedoms. But we all know that, in the absence of help from Congress, the Obama administration has never been shy about using its infamous pen and phone to rewrite the rules on its own terms.

Such was the case with a quietly issued 2012 rule by the president’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to revise its Form 4473 – a document that must be completed by both the seller and buyer as a part of most gun sales. The modified form now requires customers to separately list their race and ethnicity.

Besides being highly intrusive, many find the similar back-to-back questions to be just plain confusing and, as a result, check one box or the other instead of both. This is considered an ATF violation and, when a gun dealer is audited, could result in the loss of their license.

Forcing gun retailers to collect racial data on every last customer – and issuing steep penalties to those that do not – is shameless backdoor gun control and a stunning privacy violation to boot. To make the situation even more insulting to gun owners, the ATF cannot rightly say what the information is used for in the first place.

When Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) wrote the ATF last year asking for what purpose the data was collected, its response was to note that it has required some form of race information since 1968 – in other words, “this is how we have done it all along,” and to pin responsibility for the latest change on a Clinton administration-era directive from the Office of Management and Budget that was supposed to be implemented nearly ten years earlier.

This year, the ATF fine-tuned its talking points, telling The Hill that the race and ethnicity data “can be helpful when tracing firearms used in crimes.” There’s just one problem with that logic – it directly contradicts the agency’s claims last year when it assured Americans that it has “never compiled or maintained [race information] in any database.”

Confused yet? You’re not the only one. This lack of explanation from ATF has even drawn the ire of traditionally left-leaning groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, and I believe it deserves a response from Congress as well.

Gun ownership is not a special privilege reserved for a select few. It is a constitutionally protected freedom to which the government should be completely colorblind. That is why, with the help of Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas), I reintroduced the Freedom from Intrusive Regulatory Enforcement of Arbitrary Registration Mandates (FIREARM) Act. This simple, one-page bill would prohibit the federal government from requiring Americans to disclose their race or ethnicity in order to purchase a gun.

Washington may not be able to agree on much these days, but protecting our Second Amendment should be an area of broad consensus. Law abiding citizens should never have to play a game of 20 questions with Uncle Sam just to access this basic right.

I hope my colleagues will give the FIREARM Act the consideration it deserves so that we can reverse this latest regulatory overreach and ensure that fairness and privacy are upheld in our nation’s gun laws.

Earlier this year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge's decision against the 2009 Montana Firearms Freedom Act. The law attempts to declare that federal firearms regulations don't apply to guns kept in the state where they were manufactured.

Other pro-gun states have passed similar measures.

The Justice Department has argued successfully that the courts already have decided Congress can use its power to regulate interstate commerce. Some gun-control advocates sided with the federal argument, saying ""firearm freedom acts"" would allow felons to obtain guns without background checks and make it harder to trace guns used in crimes.

Gun advocates have long said only the Supreme Court can decide the case because it will have to limit the reach of Congress to regulate guns. The Supreme Court is expected to decide next year whether to accept the request.

The advocates, led by the Montana Shooting Sports Association, have had legal support from the attorneys general from the pro-gun states of Montana, Utah, Alaska, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. States that have formally passed a version of Firearms Freedom Act include Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Tennessee, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.

MSSA president Gary Marbut has said he wants to manufacture a small, bolt-action youth-model rifle called the ""Montana Buckaroo"" for sale in Montana. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told Marbut such a gun would be illegal under Montana law, prompting a lawsuit by the group against the U.S. attorney general.

Marbut said high court decisions dating back to 1942 dealing with certain interstate commerce need to be reversed. The request to the Supreme Court argues the rulings have allowed more concentration of power with the federal government, creating problems like more national debt and the potential for abuses of power.

""Without the centralization of so much regulatory power in the federal government, tyranny would be a lot less likely to occur,"" the argument reads."

Cheese appears to have taken the kid-friendly chain’s “no guns” policy too far, refusing to serve a police officer who entered the restaurant with a firearm.

The gun-toting officer encountered the problem at the Chuck E. Cheese in the Greenwood Mall in the city of Bowling Green, prompting outrage from some people, including a sheriff from a neighboring jurisdiction, WBKO-TV reported Friday.

""I was upset,” Edmonson County Sheriff Shane Doyle told the station. “I was shocked for that officer and also for all the patrons there because you know if you have an obvious police officer and they're wearing police clothing, then I don't understand what the problem would be having someone like that with the training and experience of a police officer [coming] into an establishment.""

Chuck E. Cheese’s national headquarters called the situation an unfortunate misunderstanding.

""Our firearms policy does not apply to officers in uniform. We do have a no firearms policy for civilians and off-duty non-uniformed officers, but officers in uniform are always welcome to bring in their firearms,"" Chuck E. Cheese spokeswoman Alexis Lynn told the station.

But what constitutes a uniform? The officer refused entry was wearing a marked police polo shirt.

Doyle said that shouldn't have been an issue.

""I've seen Bowling Green officers in polos many times in my history working in law enforcement, and obviously I recognize that person as a sworn employee,"" he said.

Besides, the sheriff said, Kentucky state law permits police officers to carry their weapon in most locations regardless of whether they were on duty or not.

""The state law allows us to carry concealed anywhere in the state of Kentucky except for federal buildings, that's basically the only place,"" he said.

Doyle told the station he still plans to take his family to the Bowling Green Chuck E. Cheese, but he added that everybody “needs to understand that somebody who is trained and qualified to carry a weapon, they’re there to help people.”"

Compton’s debate centers on a new presence on city school properties this academic year – AR-15 semiautomatic rifles.

School board officials this summer approved a policy that allows school police who pass a screening to carry AR-15 rifles in their patrol cars during the time they are working, according to KPCC, a Southern California public radio station.

""This is our objective—save lives, bottom line,"" Compton Unified Police Chief William Wu told the board, according to KPCC.

Critics of the policy call it excessive. They say there is no justification for police providing security around schools to carry high-powered weapons.

""The school police has been very notorious in the community and in reality has never had to shoot anyone before,"" said Francisco Orozco, described by KPCC as a recent Dominguez High School graduate and founder of the Compton Democratic Club. ""So this escalation of weapons we feel is very unnecessary.""

The city of Compton is predominately Latino. Hispanics make up some 65 percent of the community, followed by African-Americans, who are about 33 percent.

Wu maintains that police can be helpless when faced with a mass attack, such as a terrorist one or a school shooting.

Perpetrators in such cases, Wu said, often wear body armor that is impervious to routine weapons. The AR-15, he added, is also more accurate.

""Handguns you'd be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards,"" Wu said. ""With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can be go 50, 100 yards accurately.""

A CNBC story from last year about the growing popularity of the AR-15 described it as the weapon that “is at the heart of the gun control debate.”

""The AR-15 is, essentially, a gun that was designed to inflict maximum casualties, death, and injury, in close to medium range. That's what it does,"" CNBC quoted gun control advocate Tom Diaz as saying. ""The real problem is that we allow that kind of firepower to come into a theater or into a first-grade class.""

But a defender of the AR-15, Steve Sanetti, president of the National Sports Shooting Foundation, told CNBC: ""It's a question of cosmetics. It's not a question of functioning. The rifles are sane, safe, reliable types of firearms used by millions of citizens for lawful purposes. They are not just killing machines.""

Orozco told KPCC that the district should devote more attention to more common security problems on school grounds.

He also expressed concern about a lawsuit by parents of district students that said that Compton school police profile minority students.

""The school police has not even earned the right to carry handguns,"" Orozco said.

In a Facebook exchange with the Compton Democratic Club, the Compton School Police Officers said they “are not planning to attack the Galaxy of Teachers and Students” with the AR-15 rifle. They also noted that some five other school districts in California allow such weapons.

“If we encounter an active mass murderer on campus with a rifle or body armor, our officers may not adequately be prepared to stop that suspect,” the message said. “School Police Officers will undergo a training course, followed by a shooting proficiency test on a firing range and a written exam… The safety of our Students, Staff, and Parents are very important to us.”

Police Chief Tammy Hooper told a Citizens Police Advisory Committee meeting that a 911 call reported three high school age males walking down a street with one of them waving a gun in the air.

High school teacher Melissa Hyman told the committee at Wednesday's meeting that she saw no value in an officer displaying a weapon capable of killing multiple people in seconds.

The races of those involved wasn't immediately known.

Stafford, 42, of upstate Schenectady, N.Y., won the assault rifle during a pre-announced raffle at the March 23 service at Grace Baptist Church in Troy, where pastor John Koletas preaches that the constitutional right to bear arms shall not be abridged.

On Monday, Stafford was on his way to pick up the gun -- valued up to $1,200 -- after a federal background check.

""I’ll plead the Fifth on that,” Stafford joked when asked if the AR-15 was his first gun. “I’m on my way to pick it up right now, and to meet the pastor.”

Stafford, who works in sales, said he went to the service “on a whim” and didn’t expect to be selected. Three other people were initially picked, but Stafford walked away with the gun because they had already left the service, which drew roughly 150 congregants.

“Actually, I went on a whim; I wanted to see what this was all about,” he told FoxNews.com. “I found out about it about a month ago and I wanted to exercise my God-given right.”

[pullquote]

Koletas, who could not be reached for comment, reportedly received death threats due to the giveaway, but won’t be deterred – he’ll actually be giving away another free AR-15 during a service late Monday.

“My peace I give unto you,” reads a flier promoting the event, quoting the Gospel of St. John. “Qualified attendees will receive a legally-modified AR-15 … All giveaways are absolutely free to enter (attendance required).”

All winning applicants will be subject to a federal background check, must be age 18 or older and provide a valid driver’s license. The church also reserves the right to deny anyone of “questionable character,” according to the flier.

“We have the Constitution to protect us,” Koletas told parishioners during the service, according to the Albany Times-Union. “But we have our liberty to protect ourselves.”

Koletas declined to elaborate on details of the alleged death threats he received and indicated he had not contacted authorities.

“I don’t need the police to protect myself,” he told the newspaper.

A large portion of the church’s budget was used to purchase the gun and to promote the event, said Koletas, who declined to give specifics.

Bob Gray, a retired pastor from Texas, spoke during Sunday’s service and is scheduled to appear again on Monday. Republican Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin also attended Sunday’s event, WNYT.com reports.

“Yes, it is unusual,” McLaughin told congregants. “Is it illegal? Absolutely not. And it’s not unethical either. And the people have every right to support the Second Amendment. I hope everybody does.”

Gray raised some eyebrows during the service when he told the crowd — some 75 of whom registered for the drawing — that he had a concealed weapon amid the pews.

“And listen up, reporters,” Gray said, according to the Times-Union. “It’s not registered.”

Some churches in Kentucky have also been using guns to attract new members. Earlier this month, churches in Paducah — where three students were killed during a school shooting in 1997 — hosted “Second Amendment Celebrations.” At Lone Oak First Baptist Church, roughly 1,300 people crammed into the church hall for a steak dinner and pep talk by gun expert Chuck McAlister, who was hired by Kentucky’s Southern Baptists to grow membership. Twenty-five guns were raffled off during the dinner and winners were required to pass a background check.

""I brought a gun with me tonight,"" McAlister told the group, according to NPR.org. ""I know that's very controversial.""

Mayor-elect Martin Walsh came out against the plan over the weekend. The Boston Police Department had been pushing for a limited number of officers to carry the high-powered rifles, in light of recent mass shootings as well as the Boston Marathon bombing earlier this year.

But after the incoming mayor initially stayed mum on the idea, a spokeswoman for Walsh said he's not on board -- not yet, anyway.

""Mayor-elect Walsh is opposed to the AR-15 rifles,"" spokeswoman Kathryn Norton told FoxNews.com in an email. ""Unless otherwise convinced by the Boston Police Department, he does not think they are necessary.""

Police officials had pushed for the rifle purchases in response to mass shootings like the one in Newtown, Conn. The Boston Marathon bombing happened after the plan was already in the works but nevertheless fueled the proposal.

One unnamed officer told the Boston Herald, which first reported Walsh's stance on the issue, that ""it gives you at least a fighting chance if you go into something where suspects have more firepower than you.""

Under the plan, according to MyFoxBoston.com, the city would buy 33 AR-15 rifles, at $2,500 apiece. They would go to two trained officers in all 11 districts of Boston.

But the plan needs the mayor's sign-off, and a number of critics had spoken out against the idea, questioning whether giving officers such rifles would increase the chances of innocent people getting shot.

""I don't believe arming them with assault weapons is going to make them any safer,"" City Councilor Charles Yancey said, according to MyFoxBoston.com."

Greg Evers, who is running in the Republican primary for the open seat in Florida’s 1st District, announced Monday he’s giving away a “Homeland Defender” AR-15 rifle on July 4.

But Monday night, Facebook pulled a post about the contest showing the rifle after receiving numerous complaints for ""promoting graphic violence"" and ""describing the purchase or sales of drugs, guns or regulated progress.""

Facebook flagged another post sowing the rules for entering the contest.

Last January, Facebook imposed a policy barring private individuals from advertising or selling firearms on the social media network.

Evers’ campaign said someone in California reported the post. Brian Burgess, a campaign spokesman, said they had anticipated someone would object but that likes and shares are still being tracked.

The original post received more than 1,100 likes and nearly 900 shares.

Evers said on his Facebook page Wednesday that he’s become a target for gun advocates.

The custom-built rifle will be given away at random person who shared and like Evers’ page or signed up on his campaign website. It’s open to only adults in the district who must pass all required background and security checks.

As of Wednesday, Evers' page had received over 4,800 likes and nearly 2,100 shares.

Evers' promotion came barely a week after a shooting at a gay nightclub killed 49 people in Orlando, a roughly five-hour drive from the Florida Panhandle district Evers seeks to represent. Gunman Omar Mateen used a semi-automatic rifle that was mechanically different from an AR-15 but had similar design features.

""The giveaway is tasteless, disrespectful and disgusting political pandering at its worst. He should be ashamed,"" said Stratton Pollitzer, deputy director of the gay and transgender rights group Equality Florida. ""Giving a complete stranger the same style assault rifle just used to murder 49 people, most of whom have not yet even had funerals, is grotesque.""

This is not the only contest involving an AR-15 in a congressional race. Tennessee state representative Andy Holt is giving away two rifles during an event Saturday with candidates for that state's 8th Congressional District.

In 2014, AR-15 rifles were part of giveaways in at least three U.S. House or Senate races.

Evers is one of five candidates running in the Aug. 30 Republican primary for the seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Miller. Evers has served in the Florida Legislature since 2001, including the Senate the past six years. The National Rifle Association has given him an A-plus grade for the past 15 years.

In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, ATF Director B. Todd Jones said all types of the 5.56 military-style ammo used by shooters pose a threat to police as more people buy the AR-15-style pistols.

""Any 5.56 round"" is ""a challenge for officer safety,"" he said. Jones asked lawmakers to help in a review of a 1986 bill written to protect police from so-called ""cop killer"" rounds that largely exempted rifle ammo like the 5.56 because it has been used by target shooters, not criminals.

His agency's move to ban the 5.56 M855 version was condemned by the National Rifle Association and majorities in the House and Senate and as a result was pulled back though not abandoned. At the hearing Jones said that nearly 90,000 comments on the proposal were received, many negative."

Fugate says the decision of whether or not to charge the Rev. Jeremy Lucas, of Christ Church Episcopal Parish in Lake Oswego, would fall to the local district attorney's office.

San Diego-based U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez ruled that the ban approved by the Legislature and voters last year takes away gun owners' Second Amendment rights and amounts to the government taking people's private property without compensation.

""Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of otherwise law-abiding citizens will have an untenable choice: become an outlaw or dispossess one's self of lawfully acquired property,"" Benitez wrote.

California law has prohibited buying or selling the magazines since 2000, but until now allowed those who had them to keep them.

He issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law from taking effect while he considers the underlying lawsuit filed by the National Rifle Association-affiliated California Rifle & Pistol Association.

“The State of California’s desire to criminalize simple possession of a firearm magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds is precisely the type of policy choice that the Constitution takes off the table,” the injunction read.

Meanwhile, a Sacramento-based judge on Thursday rejected a similar challenge by several other gun owners' rights organizations, creating what Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, called ""dueling opinions"" that may be sorted out on appeal.

""Unfortunately this law will be delayed but we are confident it will go into effect, and soon,"" he said.

He called the San Diego lawsuit and ruling part of an effort by the NRA ""to delay and dismantle California's law brick by brick.""

Had the ban taken effect, owners would have been required to get rid of their magazines by sending them out of state, altering them to hold no more than 10 bullets, destroying them or turning them into law enforcement agencies. Possession could have been punished by $100 fines or up to a year in jail.

Owners can now keep the magazines until a final ruling by Benitez or if an appeals court overturns his injunction, said Chuck Michel, attorney for the NRA and the California Rifle & Pistol Association.

""This court recognized that the Second Amendment is not a second-class right and that law-abiding gun owners have the right to own these magazines to defend themselves and their families,"" Michel said.

State lawmakers approved the ban last year as part of a package of bills adding to what already were some of the nation's strictest gun laws. Voters agreed in November when they approved Proposition 63, a measure that toughened the penalties by allowing violators to be fined or jailed.

Benitez said he was mindful of voters' approval and government's legitimate interest in protecting the public but added that the ""Constitution is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.""

Gun owner's constitutional rights ""are not eliminated simply because they possess `unpopular' magazines holding more than 10 rounds,"" he wrote in a 66-page decision.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra criticized the decision but did not say what he will do next.

""Proposition 63 was overwhelmingly approved by voters to increase public safety and enhance security in a sensible and constitutional way,"" Becerra said in a statement. ""I will defend the will of California voters because we cannot continue to lose innocent lives due to gun violence.""

Supporters say that magazines often holding 30 or 100 bullets are typically used in mass shootings and aren't needed by hunters or civilian owners.

""Clearly it escalates the lethality in any mass shooting when high-capacity magazines are involved,"" said Amanda Wilcox, a spokeswoman for the California chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence whose daughter was fatally shot.

Forcing assailants to change magazines more frequently gives victims time to flee or subdue the shooter, Becerra argued in court filings.

Moreover, the government wouldn't own the magazines in the way it would property seized for a new highway or public building, he argued, since the magazines would be destroyed by law enforcement agencies.

Becerra said opponents' Second Amendment challenge has repeatedly been rejected by other courts, allowing at least seven other states and 11 local governments to already restrict the possession or sale of large-capacity ammunition magazines.

The company, Black Rain Ordnance, said the rifle would eliminate features that were made illegal under the SAFE Act. The gun will not have a pistol grip and will include a non-threaded muzzle and a 10-round low-capacity approved magazine.

""With the continual trampling of the 2nd Amendment in New York, Black Rain Ordnance is proud to announce their 'New York Compliant' rifles,"" the company said on its website. ""These rifles feature all of the quality and craftsmanship of the standard BRO-lines, but with the added features that allow for legal possession.""

The Journal News reported that Just Right Carbines, a New York-based gun manufacture, has been producing a carbine rifle since August that complies with the SAFE Act. The grip was modified to comply with the law.

""Everybody is doing basically the same thing, which is basically adopting a stock that was originally produced for the California market and basically adopting that stock for the New York market,"" Testa told Gannett's Albany Bureau.

Testa added that the company has sold about 100 of the weapons since August. State police have not said that the modified weapon is non-complaint, according to the report.

Supporters and opponents of the law held dueling rallies in Albany on Tuesday, with Donald Trump and Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino declaring that the law prohibiting the sale of some popular guns like the AR-15 goes too far and should be scrapped.

The law bans the sale of some semi-automatic firearms and requires those who already own one to register them by April 15. It also bans high-capacity magazines, requires federal background checks on private gun sales and imposes felony penalties for illegal gun possession.

The new gun control proposals announced Tuesday include requiring gun owners to use gun safes or trigger locks when storing a gun, a 10-day waiting period before a buyer can take possession of a gun, and a rule that would prohibit anyone from buying more than one handgun a month.

The terror network managed to make its own tunnel-boring machine (see photo above), a hideous but effective part of the group's arsenal.

The discovery of the ISIS machine is credited to the Iraqi Army’s 9th Division, after which Devin Morrow, a technical adviser with Conflict Armament Research, analyzed the machine.

Most days Morrow dons a bulletproof vest and ventures to the front line of Iraq's battle against ISIS to inspect the latest spoils of a grinding and bloody war.

The 30-year-old Canadian woman is tasked with analyzing seized weaponry from ISIS -- piece by piece -- and uncovering its source and pathway to the terrorist network.

Much of the illegally traded weapons are small arms but some -- like the ISIS-made tunnel machine -- demonstrate a level of sophistication never seen before by such a group, according to Morrow.

""It's quite unprecedented, the level at which ISIS is able to create its own ammunition and weaponry,"" Morrow told Fox News.

""We don't see this quality of production in other conflict zones,"" said Morrow, whose U.K.-based company traces and documents illegally diverted weapons in conflict zones like Iraq, Syria, Somalia, South Sudan, Libya and Yemen.

Once a weapon is captured from ISIS, Morrow and her team begin their investigation -- snapping photographs of the items and examining each weapon's markings and serial number.

""We don’t rely on secondary information. We spend a lot of time out in the field,"" she said. ""It does get scary. Anything can happen at any time and it's important to remember that.""

Hundreds of seized weapons are variants of the AK-47, which Morrow described as highly versatile and easily trafficked.

""They last a long time. They’re very durable,"" she said of the high-powered assault rifles. ""Variants of the AK-47 are very widely used in the Middle East. The main producers are former Soviet countries and Russia. They have been around for decades and they're everywhere.""

Expand / Contract Mauser ammunition from 1935 Nazi Germany that was captured from ISIS near Kirkuk in 2014. (Conflict Armament Research )

Some of the ISIS items discovered by Morrow are old -- including ammunition found in northern Iraq in 2014 that was made in Nazi Germany.

""It just shows you how far that ammunition can go,"" she said.

Expand / Contract ISIS-produced bombs (Conflict Armament Research )

Other weapons and equipment are more recently produced, including those made by the terror network itself. Among such findings are ISIS-made mortars and IEDs.

Morrow and her team have also uncovered a ""suicide vehicle"" she referred to as the ""SVBIED."" ISIS fighters, she explained, are taking civilian cars and SUVs, loading them with explosives and then covering the vehicles with heavy metal plates that help them get close to the front lines.

""They’re taking these regular cars and trucks from civilian people in Mosul and doing extensive modifications on them to make them into suicide vehicles,"" she said.

The terror group also is using tunnel-boring machines to dig extensive tunnel systems between houses and underneath roads to confuse coalition forces, according to Morrow.

""They built that machine themselves,"" she said of the tunnel machine found in Hamdaniyah late last year.

The Battle of Mosul is a joint offensive by Iraqi government forces with allied militias, the Kurdistan Regional Government and international forces to retake the northern Iraqi city from the Islamic State. The offensive began in October 2016.

For Morrow, the tracking of illegal weapons is only one part – albeit a critical one – in defeating the enemy on the ground.

""Our group actively tries to document individual items. That’s the first step in decreasing the proliferation of illegal weapons,"" she said.

""By creating this database and by understanding corridors and trafficking among regions – where the weak parts are around the world – then we can create more robust and responsible international arms policies.""

Morrow – a Western woman in Iraq in a male-dominated field – said there is no other work she would rather be doing.

""It can be trying if you’re working with a bunch of guys – it can be a little bit stressful – but I feel very well respected and no one has ever questioned my role and my experience being there,"" she said. ""My team is incredibly supportive.""

The “Assault Weapons Ban of 2018” bill was formally introduced Monday by Democratic Reps. David Cicilline, of Rhode Island, and Ted Deutch, whose Florida district is where a gunman killed 17 people with the kind of semi-automatic rifle the bill aims to ban.

“Now is the time for action,” Deutch tweeted. “Let's start by ridding our streets of assault weapons. These are weapons of war made for the sole purpose of killing people. Most Americans support the assault weapons ban. It's time for Congress to listen to them and pass sensible legislation.”

The bill, as of Tuesday afternoon, was sponsored by 164 of the chamber’s 192 Democratic members, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other members of her leadership team.

Deutch has publicly urged House Speaker Paul Ryan to allow members to vote on gun-control measures. And he’s vowed to work with anyone in Congress -- “Democrats and Republicans, to take meaningful action on gun safety.”

The bill itself would seek to “regulate the importation, manufacture, possession, sale or transfer of assault weapons,” according to the text. The measure is just one of several introduced this week to curb gun violence.

However, Ryan on Tuesday appeared to rule out consideration of anything resembling a gun ban.

“We shouldn't be banning guns for law-abiding citizens. We should be focused on making sure those who shouldn't get guns don't get guns,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We want to listen to kids but want to protect people’s due process rights while making sure people who shouldn't get guns don't get them.”

The Wisconsin Republican vowed to still “have the conversations we need” with members to ensure “this doesn't happen again.”

House leaders on Tuesday also nixed an attempt by California Rep. Mike Thompson, who leads House Democratic efforts on firearms, to consider a special resolution to force the GOP-controlled chamber to “immediately consider gun-violence legislation.”

Ryan and his leadership team are also arguing the House has already passed legislation to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which flags dangerous gun buyers before they can make such purchases.

They point out that the chamber also has passed legislation dealing with mental-health problems, often a factor in mass shootings. Both of those measures are now being considered in the GOP-controlled Senate.

Still, Ryan and his team, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, on Tuesday directed much of their focus toward the breakdowns in law enforcement during the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla.

“There was a colossal breakdown,” Ryan said. “We need to get to the bottom of how breakdowns occurred -- from the armed officer in the school at the time to the FBI failing to follow up on a profound tip.”

Scalise, who is still recovering from gunshot wounds he suffered in a June 2017 mass shooting while practicing with colleagues for a charity softball game, said he has talked with some of the surviving Florida students.

“There was talk about breakdowns at various levels of government, but ultimately we talked about our shared experience,” said Scalise, whose life was saved by officers who killed the shooter in last year’s attack.

“What angers me most is when I see breakdowns with law enforcement. The FBI had [the shooter’s] name on a silver platter. He himself said he wanted to be a professional school shooter. It was posted under his name and turned over to the FBI,"" continued Scalise, R-La.

Ryan said that as a parent he supports the suggestion by President Trump to have trained teachers with a concealed weapon in classrooms, to prevent similar incidents -- but that the issue should be addressed by states, local governments, school boards and other parents."

The recording, first released by the Associated Press on Thursday, is reportedly one of several from Havana that first led investigators to believe a sonic weapon was involved.

Of Americans affected in Cuba, not all of them reportedly heard the sounds. But some who did said, while not identical, that the recording was relatively consistent with what they heard.

“That’s the sound,” one witness said.

US EXPELS CUBAN DIPLOMATS FROM EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON

The recording, which has not yet provided much insight about what is harming diplomats, has been sent to the U.S. Navy for further examination. The Navy has advanced capabilities for analyzing acoustic signals.

It is unclear whether the sounds are directly responsible for the attacks, which have been shown to cause hearing, cognitive, visual, balance, sleep, and other problems.

At least 22 U.S. Embassy workers were injured in the attacks that began last year in Havana.

As a result, the U.S. has pulled 60 percent of its government employees out of the country. It also expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the embassy in Washington D.C.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the move was made because Cuba had failed to protect American diplomats on its soil.

""Until the government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,"" Tillerson said.

US TOURISTS BACK FROM CUBA CLAIM SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO MYSTERIOUS ATTACKS

The Cuban government has denied all knowledge or involvement in the attacks, calling the U.S. move “hasty” and “irresponsible.”

The State Department also issued a warning to American tourists, urging them to stay away from Cuba, saying that the U.S. cannot guarantee that individuals staying at Havana hotels would not also be harmed.

Some U.S. tourists have since complained of symptoms similar to those experienced by government workers.

The recording was shared with workers at the U.S. Embassy in order to teach them what to listen for.

Because of the limited information available, the U.S. government has only been able to advise workers that if they think they’re being attacked, they should move to another area because the attack is unlikely to be able to follow them.

According to The Independent, she relies on homeopathic medicines and barley sugar - which can be bought from the high street for under $2, or around 1 pound — to get her adjusted to different time zones.

Barley sugar, taken in boiled sweet form, isn't a magic cure all, but it could help to kick-start the Queen's metabolism when she's abroad and get her hungry at the right times of day.

As general practitioner Nick Knight told The Telegraph, ""Carrying out your daily habits like eating and sleeping in line with your new destination's time zone — both en-route and on arrival — helps re-synchronise our body clock to our new environment.

""What the Queen is doing by having barley sugar is essentially using her body’s sugar metabolic pathways to help adjust her body clock.""

""Essentially, the same should happen if you were to have your breakfast, lunch and dinner at times that match your destination before you get there, regardless of whether you're hungry or not,"" Knight added.

It appears serene and picturesque, but those workers are rushing to salvage Iraq’s deteriorating Mosul Dam – which was once under ISIS control and straddles the Tigris River just 40 miles upstream from the city of Mosul.

Failure to reinforce and maintain the dam could mean unleashing what is, in effect, a potential weapon of mass destruction.

“When we started, the risk assessment regarding the potential fate of the dam was very high. And ISIS had stolen everything that was here,” Carlos Morales, deputy project manager for Trevi, the Italian company awarded the repair and maintenance contract to prevent catastrophe, told Fox News on a recent exclusive visit to Mosul Dam.

The dam, the largest in the country with the capacity to hold 3 trillion gallons of water, controls the flow of the Tigris River north of Mosul and supplies electricity to more than a million residents. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that if the dam ruptures, it will send floodwaters crashing more than 200 miles downstream – swallowing villages and much of Mosul City with waves as high as 80 feet. In addition, floodwaters could reach as far as Baghdad and potentially result in the loss and displacement of millions of lives and up to $20 billion in damages.

Furthermore, a 2015 study from the European Commission’s Science Center concluded that even a partial fissure that released just one quarter of its full capacity would be disastrous. The concern even prompted an urgent memo from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in March 2016, cautioning Americans to “avoid areas within three miles of the river and have a plan in case of emergency.”

Progress is being made. Since the emergency work began just over a year ago, some 15,000 metric tons of cement have been poured into the 370-foot structure and more than 150 miles of electrical grids have been installed. Also, some of the “critical grouting,” the pumping of a mixture of clay, water and cement into the dangerously soft bed of gypsum on which the dam wall rests has been completed. Another year of critical grouting is planned.

The dam, which has been a cause of concern since it was built in 1984 and known at the time as the “Saddam Dam,” was captured by ISIS in August 2014 in the early onslaught of the terror group. Although it only controlled the area for 10 days before being run out by Kurdish and Iraqi forces, the massive structure has deteriorated badly as it has not received mandatory maintenance from either ISIS or, subsequently, coalition forces.

AFTER ISIS CAMPAIGN, IRAN-BACKED FIGHTERS IN IRAQ VOW TO DRIVE OUT US TROOPS

The Trevi Group is calling its work a “success” -- so far -- yet the intense pace of its work must be maintained for the sake of scores of lives downstream of the dam. The Iraqi government has not yet officially renewed the group’s contract, which the Iraqi government says was worth about $300 million and funded in large part with a loan from the World Bank. That contract expires this spring.

Discussions are underway about continuing the Trevi partnership into 2019, as the Iraqi government has acknowledged ongoing risks to the dam, an officials with the Corps told Fox News.

“Some grouting results look promising, but uncertainty will remain until grouting efforts have progressed across the full length of the dam,” the representative of the Corps said. “The Ministry of Water Resources has concluded that a second year of grouting and training is necessary.”

The Trevi contract also came with the Italian government’s promise to deploy 450 troops to guard the vulnerable area while repairs are underway. Along with protecting workers, the soldiers – led by the Praesidium Task Force of the 3rd Alpine Regiment of the Italian Army – have been training Iraq’s counterterrorism forces and have implemented initiatives to support the local hospitals, schools and families inside the small villages that make up the Mosul Dam community.

“We’ve been cooperating with the Italian taskforce with the objective of protecting the dam and the people around it,” explained Iraqi counterterrorism leader, Maj. Ahmed. “But the idea long-term is for us not only to help in a military way, but in a humanitarian way, too.”"

Not just in the sheer number, but in the wide range of types of weaponry.

On the smaller scale, there were pistols and rifles. In two crucial historic shifts, the Army made a radical change in sidearms and introduced a new pistol and the Marines took the Armed Forces lead in adopting a new magazine that eliminates jamming and will save many Marine lives in the future.

There was also a boom in excellent concealed carry options for personal and tactical professional use. With several of the legendary American gunmakers celebrating anniversaries and iconic history, special editions of rifles with meaningful significance were also big alongside innovation for rifle use in law enforcement and military scenarios.

New Army pistol

In future battles, U.S. soldiers will have a new sidearm for personal protection. The Army’s new pistol may see more action than the last thanks to a design that has great potential for offensive purposes like close quarter combat.

The Sig Sauer 9mm XM17, and the more compact version XM18, are replacing the M9 as the Army’s service pistol. At the end of 2017, the Army began fielding the first Sig Sauer XM17 Modular Handgun System (MHS) sidearms.

This is the first change in about three decades since Beretta’s M9 was first introduced as the Army’s sidearm in the Cold War era back in 1986. For all the details: Meet the US Army's new pistol

The U.S. Army has revealed a new holster that soldiers will rely on when drawing their new pistols.

North Korea continues to threaten the United States with a nuclear attack. In the Cold War era, the deterrence approach could be described as the bigger the nuclear bomb, the better.

Are new mini nukes the right solution instead for today’s threats? Building a new type of nuclear weapon, mini nukes, is under consideration by the White House.

America’s nuclear arsenal

In 2017, America’s vast nuclear arsenal was regularly in the spotlight.

But what exactly does President Trump have at his disposal in terms of nuclear weapons?"

The man, who was being interviewed by the Minneapolis Police Department, started hurting himself with an “edged weapon,” Fox 9 reported. Officers tried “to subdue the adult male subject” but ultimately had to discharge their weapons, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said.

The interview room where the incident unfolded is reported to be the location of the department’s “investigation units.”

Minneapolis Police said the incident has been “contained” and noted “there’s no threat to the public.” Several officers involved in the incident have been put on paid administrative leave.

Paramedics reportedly took the man to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. His condition is unclear.

The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating the incident. Arrandondo said police obtained video of what transpired.

McMaster said Saturday the threat of North Korea launching a nuclear weapon at the U.S. or another rival nation is “impossible to overstate” and repeated that a preemptive military strike remains an option.

“It’s impossible to overstate the danger associated with a rogue, brutal regime,” McMaster told Hugh Hewitt on the conservative commentator’s MSNBC TV show.

“Are we preparing a plan for a preventive war? … The president has been very clear that he’s not going to tolerate North Korea being able to threaten the U.S. … So of course we have to provide all options to do that, and that includes a military option.”

Still, he said the United States would like to resolve the situation “short of what would be a very costly war.""

The retired Army general said President Trump has been ""deeply briefed"" on the strategy on North Korea.

Tensions have mounted with Pyongyang's two recent successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles. And Trump has sought help from China and South Korea toward de-escalating the situation.

In the interview, McMaster spoke about several problem spots around the world, including Iran and Venezuela, where residents fighting against an oppressive regime have also raised concerns about U.S. military intervention.

The U.N. Security Council was expected to vote on a new sanctions resolution that would increase economic pressure on North Korea to return to negotiations on its missile program.

McMaster said “democracy is now over in Venezuela” but significantly downplayed the potential of a military operation from neighboring countries or the United States.

“I don’t see an outside military intervention,” he said

McMaster also reiterated that Trump doesn’t like the so-called Iran nuclear deal, brokered by the former Obama administration and that eases billions in economic sanctions on the rogue nation.

The deal eases the sanctions in exchange for Iran scaling back its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

McMaster said Trump thinks Iran has already violated the spirit of the agreement, pointing to the country’s support of the Assad regime in Syria. However, he declined to say whether the U.S. will exit the agreement after an upcoming 90-day review.

Footage recently emerged of North Korea paratroopers jumping out of what seems to be two 70-year-old Antonov An-2 transport aircrafts.

While the concept of Pyongyang using these Stalin-era planes seems far-fetched considering the nuclear weapons at its disposal, the aircrafts could be North Korea’s most deadly weapon.

The dated aircraft raisesthe concern that they could be used to transport a nuclear bomb to be dropped quite easily without triggering any radar at any specific target.

According to several reports, the North Korean army has a fleet of 200 Antonov An-2 aircrafts. They were first “introduced” in 2015, but disregarded as obsolete by many.

However, what makes them so dangerous is that they have an incredibly low radar profile, meaning they are difficult to track using conventional aircraft.

The Drive reported the aircraft fly at such a slow speed and low altitude that modern surface-to-air missile systems would have a very hard time detecting and engaging them.

The aircraft, initially designed as a crop duster and utility transport, can land on short sections of a road that would make disembarking soldiers quite easy and sneaky.

According to the BBC, the Antonov An-2 first flew in 1947 as the Soviet Union was rebuilding after the end of World War II. Aside from its remarkable short take-off and landing, it can basically fly backwards.

“The reason the An-2 still flies is that there is really no other aircraft like it,” aviation writer Bernie Leighton, who has flown in an An-2 in Belarus, told the BCC. “If you need an aircraft that can carry 10 soldiers, people or goats, that can take off from anywhere and land anywhere ‒ it is either that or a helicopter.”

The Soviet Union built more than 10,000 airplanes before it fell in 1991."
fox98,fox,[],2017-04-04 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/04/timeline-syrian-chemical-weapon-use.html,"Chemical weapons have killed hundreds of people since the start of Syria's civil war, with the U.N. blaming three attacks on the Syrian government and a fourth on the Islamic State group.

Syrian rebels and opposition activists say pro-government forces have used chemical weapons and bombs containing chlorine on numerous occasions. They say a chemical weapons attack on a town in northern Syria on Tuesday killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied ever using such weapons.

Here is a timeline of events related to chemical weapons use in Syria.

Aug. 20, 2012: U.S. President Barack Obama says the use of chemical weapons would be a ""red line"" that would change his calculus on intervening in the civil war and have ""enormous consequences.""

March 19, 2013: The Syrian government and opposition trade accusations over a gas attack that killed some 26 people, including more than a dozen government soldiers, in the town of Khan al-Assal in northern Syria. A U.N. investigation later finds that sarin nerve gas was used, but does not identify a culprit.

WHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS 'HEINOUS' ATTACK IN SYRIA



Aug. 21, 2013: Hundreds of people suffocate to death in rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital, with many suffering from convulsions, pinpoint pupils, and foaming at the mouth. U.N. investigators visit the sites and determine that ground-to-ground missiles loaded with sarin were fired on civilian areas while residents slept. The U.S. and others blame the Syrian government, the only party to the conflict known to have sarin gas.

Aug. 31, 2013: Obama says he will go to Congress for authorization to carry out punitive strikes against the Syrian government, but appears to lack the necessary support in the legislature.

Sept. 27, 2013: The U.N. Security Council orders Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, following a surprise agreement between Washington and Moscow, averting U.S. strikes. The Security Council threatens to authorize the use of force in the event of non-compliance.

Oct. 14, 2013: Syria becomes a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting it from producing, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons.

HEARTBREAKING IMAGES FROM SUSPECTED SYRIA GAS ATTACK

June 23, 2014: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it has removed the last of the Syrian government's chemical weapons. Syrian opposition officials maintain that the government's stocks were not fully accounted for, and that it retained supplies.

Aug. 7, 2015: The U.N. Security Council authorizes the OPCW and U.N. investigators to probe reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, as reports circulate of repeated chlorine gas attacks by government forces against civilians in opposition-held areas. Chlorine gas, though not as toxic as nerve agents, can be classified as a chemical weapon depending on its use.

Aug. 24, 2016: The joint OPCW-U.N. panel determines the Syrian government twice used helicopters to deploy chlorine gas against its opponents, in civilian areas in the northern Idlib province. A later report holds the government responsible for a third attack. The attacks occurred in 2014 and 2015. The panel also finds that the Islamic State group used mustard gas.

Feb. 28, 2017: Russia, a stalwart ally of the Syrian government, and China veto a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing sanctions against the Syrian government for chemical weapons use.

April 4, 2017: At least 58 people are killed in what doctors say could be a nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held Idlib province. Victims show signs of suffocation, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and pupil constriction. Witnesses say the attack was carried out by either Russian or Syrian Sukhoi jets. Moscow and Damascus deny responsibility."

Andy Grimm ""had his camera in his hand"" when he was shot in his side by a Clark County sheriff's deputy in New Carlisle, which north of Dayton, The New Carlisle News said in a Facebook post.

He was rushed to Miami Valley Hospital for surgery and is expected to recover.

Grimm had left the newsroom around 10 p.m. on Monday to take pictures of a lightning storm, the paper said. While he was taking pictures, a traffic stop occurred on the same road, according to the article.

""I was going out to take pictures and I saw the traffic stop and I thought, 'Hey, cool. I'll get some pictures here.'"" he told the newspaper. He said he pulled into a parking lot in full view of the deputy, got out of his Jeep and started setting up his tripod and camera. ""I turned around toward the cars and then 'pop, pop.""

The newspaper speculated that the deputy may have mistaken the camera for a weapon. Grimm said the deputy, identified in reports as Jake Shaw, gave him no warning.

""I was just doing my job,"" he said. ""I know Jake. I like Jake. I don't want him to lose his job over this.""

Sources told the newspaper that there was “some confusion” surrounding the shooting.

“I just talked to Andy and he said that he is very sore, but in good spirits,” Dale Grimm, the photographer's father and publisher of the New Carlisle News, told Fox News. “He said the hospital expects to be releasing him Tuesday. He also stressed that he does not want the deputy to lose his job over this.”

The Dayton Daily News reports the case has been turned over to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

“This is a small town. Everybody knows everybody. It was just a terrible misunderstanding,” his father said.

Detective Sgt. Aaron Steensma was shot in the chest, and Trooper Daniel Thayer was shot in the chest and hand, state police confirmed in a news release. The officers were outside a home in Union Township around 11:15 a.m.

""When troopers announced their presence prior to making entry into the residence, the suspect leveled a long gun at the officers. They were attempting to take cover when the detective sergeant was shot in the chest and a trooper received a grazing wound to the hand,"" an earlier release said.

Detective Sgt. Steensma remains in serious but stable condition at Borgress Medical Center in Kalamazoo, where Michigan State Police Director Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue said he's ""doing remarkably well for the seriousness of his injury.""

Trooper Thayer, who was shot in the chest and hand, was saved by his ballistic vest. Michigan State Police said all officials who responded to the incident were wearing body armor when they came under fire.

Officials confirmed the suspect, who was not idenified, is deceased. It's unclear how the suspect died.

Gov. Rick Snyder earlier Wednesday tweeted to ""Please keep [Steensma], his family and his colleagues in your thoughts and prayers. Thank you to all the men and women in law enforcement who are working hard to protect all of us every day.""

The search warrant police were serving was related to an investigation surrounding 62-year-old Duane Finney's 2009 shooting death, Fox 17 reported.

Police Chief William McManus said shortly after the Sunday night shooting that the boy was shot in the leg and was expected to survive, but that two of the adults' injuries were life-threatening. He said investigators don't believe the shooting was random.

The child, two men and two women were sitting on a bench outside a Texas Roadhouse when they were struck by gunfire around 8:40 p.m., according to a preliminary police report released Monday

The suspect walked up to a nearby parking lot and fired multiple rounds from a handgun before fleeing, according to the report. Police said the suspect was about 15 feet (4.6 meters) from the front of the restaurant when he opened fire.

Police said the suspect hasn't been identified and remains at large.

The child and four adults were taken by emergency responders to University Hospital in San Antonio, while the fifth victim, a 27-year-old man, was later discovered at the hospital after transporting himself, according to the report. Police said the adults ranged in age from 22 to 50.

Despite the loud rhetoric from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, there are a core group of us who have served in multiple administrations, who hail from industries outside of Washington, who hold different points of view, who find ways to collaborate.

I am a registered Republican and have served four presidents, including one Democrat. And I also partnered with Michelle Obama’s office on Let’s Move anti-obesity campaign. Over the last 15 years as I built complex public private partnerships to help solve big problems, I succeeded by modifying Ronald Reagan’s 80/20 rule. I created my own 60/40 rule: if I agree with someone on 60 percent of the issues, we can agree to disagree on the 40 percent and focus our collective energy on areas of commonality.

I am by no means unusual among a strata of people who line up on one side of the aisle but find ways to work with the other side.

“Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it,” Mark Twain wryly noted. His observation is shared by many across the political spectrum with whom I have worked.

In 2009, 16 CEOs from consumer goods companies joined me as members of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation. Working collaboratively with public health agencies and the Obama administration, the conservatives and liberals among us joined forces to implement the largest voluntary food and beverage industry marketplace initiative, ultimately removing 6.4 trillion calories from the American diet by reducing the sugar and fat content of hundreds of products. In 2005, as U.S. Commissioner General I worked alongside governors – from both parties -- and the private sector. We overcame our ideological differences and many challenges and together launched the US Pavilion at the Aichi World EXPO, formerly known as the World’s Fair.

A similar approach is on display in any of a number of bipartisan commissions and blue ribbon panels that have toiled away on important issues as diverse as Social Security, biodefenses, tax reform and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Many are ongoing, at the state and federal level, even amid the rancor that permeates current politics. These efforts succeed because the end goal is what matters. Party ideology does not. Away from the fishbowl of D.C., the participants, whatever their affiliation, conclude that serving the nation eclipses serving as a party emissary.

“Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it,” Mark Twain wryly noted. His observation is shared by many across the political spectrum with whom I have worked.

The efforts I have worked on employ the principles of bipartisanship common in so many areas beyond politics -- in the office, at the doctor’s office, at the playground, at church and at home. We focus on personal consideration, listening and respect. We know that if we want succeed, we can’t expect others to approach the problem in the identical way, so it becomes imperative to do things differently. Turn the idea on its head. Think of new paths and be bold.

We politely keep commentary to ourselves unless it’s relevant to the discussion at hand. We focus on fixing the problem--no rat holes are allowed. Tension may reign at the beginning of each relationship as battle lines are quickly drawn and cynicism prevails, but soon data-driven progress brings a continuity of results, a collegial environment and a celebration of success. Over dinner or on the Acela, good humor prevails as we find ourselves sharing stories and learning about each other’s children, grandchildren, lives and challenges. We agree to disagree but commit to the facilitation of success. We become friends.

Ronald Reagan won the nation over with his sunny optimism. But we are in danger of losing the graciousness that Reagan epitomized in political discourse if we don’t pause and remember that the shouting on cable TV and the blogosphere is not the whole picture by a long shot.

Bipartisanship is not dead. It is alive, certainly not as well as it could be, and in need of further nurturing."

“I’m so grateful to be here. It wouldn’t be possible without the first responders and the amazing doctors and the love everyone has sent,” she said.

The high school junior sat just feet away from the doctors at Broward Health North Hospital in Deerfield Beach, who performed three surgeries on her within 48 hours, and the Coral Springs Fire Department lieutenant who was part of a team of five who triaged and rushed her to the hospital 11 miles away — an act that may have saved her life.

“I was sitting on my couch thinking of all the letters, love that was passed around. I wouldn’t be here without — I just want to send my love and appreciation,” Maddy said.

Her father agreed.

“I am grateful to be sitting here next to my daughter alive and well today, and there are a lot of people to thank for Maddy’s life, and four are right at the back of this room, these guys from the Coral Springs Police Department and Broward County Sheriff’s for pulling her out of the school and saving her life,” David Wilford said.

Maddy is one of more than a dozen students who were shot and survived the attack by former classmate, Nikolas Cruz. Seventeen other students, teachers and coaches died after police say Cruz opened fire with an AR-15 assault-style weapon, shooting more than a hundred rounds of ammunition in building 12. That building now is closed and is scheduled to be demolished.

Minutes after Maddy was shot, she was treated by Lt. Laz Ojeda, who after finding out her age, made a last-minute split decision to transport the teenager to Broward Health North, which is 20 miles closer than the hospital she originally was supposed to be transported to. It’s a decision that doctors say saved her life.

“When you see somebody in such a decompensated shock state, and you make the determination to take them to the closest trauma center and the doctor says that this saved her life, it validates the thought process of myself and the crew that was on that call,” Ojeda said.

“Maddy came in, she was pale, nonresponsive and in shock,” said Dr. Igor Nichiporenko, Broward Health North Medical director of Trauma Services. “Immediately she had to get a chest tube placement, because her wounds to her chest were very severe with massive bleeding.”

Despite three bullet wounds and three surgeries, Maddy is now out of the hospital and back home with her family. Doctors say besides occupational therapy on her right hand, Maddy physically could be ready to return to school next week. Doctors call it a miracle, but Maddy’s mom says her daughter’s resilience also may have saved her life.

“I can spend an hour talking about my daughter, I’m a little biased. She’s a fighter. She wants to heal, she wants to get better,” said Missy Wilford.

Maddy knows that’s her priority right now, and says she’s doing just that, thanks to support from her family, friends and community.

“Like my mom said, it’s times like these when I know we need to stick together. I’ve seen a lot of positive posts about what’s been going on at the school, and I’m so glad we are sticking together, that I am making a full recovery and everything’s been going so smoothly, and that’s all I have to say,” said Maddy, as her grateful father gently kissed her on the head."

The gunman's motive wasn't known but investigators believe it was an isolated incident.

""I want you to know right now that this has nothing to do with terrorism,"" Capt. Robert Plummer told reporters outside the scene of the shooting.

The shooting happened before 7 a.m. at Arizona Charlie's Decatur, which is located west of the Las Vegas Strip. According to police, the suspect, Christopher Olague, ran from the hotel-casino after the shooting and into a nearby neighborhood where he tried to enter two homes but the residents were able to keep him out.

Police found him in a laundry room accessible through a garage of the second home after he appeared to have shot himself in the head, Lt. Dan McGrath said.

According to McGrath, Olague tried to enter the first home with the intention of stealing a car and also tried to take a vehicle on the street.

Police described Olague's condition as a ""non-survivable wound.""

The victims' identities were not released. Police said the uniformed security guards were a man and a woman in their 40s and that one was armed. Their identities and their causes of death will be released by Clark County Coroner's Office.

McGrath said the circumstances of what happened in the hotel room still unclear.

The hotel-casino's office did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

The shooting comes a day before law enforcement officers expect tens of thousands of New Year's Eve revelers on the Strip and three months after the city dealt with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Officials have been trying to reassure residents and visitors that the city is safe, especially in the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting. A high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below. He then killed himself."

FBI spokeswoman Christina Garza told KPRC that multiple people, including two children, were inside the home in northeast Houston at the time the shots were fired. She declined to provide details of the shooting, citing an ongoing investigation.

An FBI agent involved in the shooting was placed on leave pending an internal investigation.

The Houston Chronicle reported that the unidentified victim was kidnapped from a home in Conroe Wednesday by two men with guns who forced their way inside. According to the paper, the victim's brother and 12-year-old son were bound with duct tape.

""[The kidnappers] were demanding money they were owed that nobody knew anything about,"" Conroe Police Sgt. Jeff Smith told the paper.

Smith added that the kidnappers claimed to have connections with a Mexican drug cartel, but noted there was no evidence that was the case.

""There are oftentimes claims of a cartel connection just to place a fear factor,"" Smith told the Chronicle.

After the victim's brother received a phone call demanding a ransom, police and the FBI were able to track the suspects to a Clear Lake hotel. Three people were detained and questioned, enabling police to locate the victim in the home.

Police told the Chronicle that a woman in the home was arrested and charged with aggravated kidnapping. Two men detained at the hotel were charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery. It was not immediately clear if more charges would be filed.

""This was not a random cartel thing,"" Smith said. ""It appears somebody connected to the family was involved.""

The dog, Gunner, had belonged to Bryan Vallandingham, a 14-year U.S. Army veteran in Richwood, Ky., who relied on the service animal for safety, Cincinnati's Fox 19 reported.

Gunner would alert Vallandingham’s family members whenever the disabled veteran was having a seizure.

“He would tell us by sitting in front of him by laying across him or just barking randomly at Bryan so he would notify us and give us time to get him in a safe situation so he wouldn’t hurt himself,” Vallandingham’s wife, Kimberly, told Fox 19.

The family said Bryan wasn’t doing well after learning of Gunner’s death, and has been having repeated seizures.

The family suspected Gunner had been stolen from their yard more than two weeks ago. One family member said they received text messages from a person who claimed to know where the dog was and demanded money, but the family refused.

Authorities are investigating if extortion is involved with Gunner’s disappearance and death."

Just minutes before the 10 a.m. shooting, Prentis Robinson had been to the Wingate police department and spoke with the chief about a cellphone that had been stolen from him, Wingate Police Chief Donnie Gay told WCCB-TV .

On a portion of the video, Robinson wore a hat and used a selfie stick to record himself talking and walking along a street in Wingate, which is about 30 miles southeast of Charlotte. At one point, he was heard saying ""You on live,"" apparently telling another person the conversation was being recorded.

The video showed Robinson was approached by someone who fired four shots with a long gun. The camera hit the ground after the shots rang out and showed sky and trees, and the gunman running away. A car pulled up and found Robinson.

Wingate University and Wingate Elementary School were placed on lockdown for a couple of hours after the shooting, although the shooting didn't occur on either campus.

Robinson's Facebook account described him as a musician who lived in Atlanta. According to public records cited by The Charlotte Observer , Robinson lived in Charlotte during the previous decade but spent much of his adult life in Wingate and graduated from a local high school."

Veteran officers Anthony Morelli, 54, and Eric Joering, 39, were killed in a gun battle with violent criminal Quentin Smith in the Columbus suburb of Westerville Saturday. The officers had responded to Smith’s home after a 911 hang-up call related to a domestic incident.

In subsequent 911 calls a female voice is heard crying as she identifies Smith as the man who shot the officers, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.

The caller says “please help, please help” and “my husband shot the police officers,” the paper reported.

She also says, “my daughter is in there.”

When she is asked where she is, the woman says she is hiding in the bushes.

Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said Sunday at a press briefing that Morelli and Joering exchanged gunfire with Smith after making contact with him.

Authorities said Smith was wounded and was being treated at a hospital. Late Sunday, they announced that he was charged with two counts of aggravated murder in the deaths of Morelli and Joering.

“The groups that we have been thinking about over the past 24 hours, of course have been the families of both officers,” Morbitzer said at police headquarters in front of makeshift-memorial for the officers.

Police released incident reports late Saturday showing police had been to the Smith home or had dealings with him several times since 2017, some for alleged domestic violence involving a woman identified in the reports as his 33-year-old wife, Candace Smith.

In a Nov. 29 incident, Candace Smith went to a police station and asked about protection orders because she said she and her husband weren't getting along and she discovered she had a sexually transmitted disease. She also told police that when she ""threatens to leave Quentin, he tells her that he would kill her, their daughter, and himself,"" the report said.

Candace Smith told police her husband ""has a gun that he carries all of the time, and if it isn't on him, it is close by."" Police were called to the home later that night to investigate a report of domestic violence.

TWO SLAIN OHIO OFFICERS WERE 'TRUE AMERICAN HEROES,' POLICE CHIEF SAYS

Police had been called to the home as recently as three weeks ago for a reported disturbance, the Enquirer reported. The home’s residents, however, told police at the time there was nothing wrong.

Smith had a rap sheet that included indictments for violent crimes like burglary, domestic violence and felony assault when he lived near Cleveland about a decade ago, Fox 28 Columbus reported. He had pleaded guilty to the burglary and domestic violence charges, and spent some time in jail, pending trial.

Joering had been a Westerville officer for 17 years. Morelli had been a member of the force for 30 years.

At Sunday’s news conference Morbitzer lashed out at people who were trying to benefit from the tragedy by establishing phony GoFundMe pages to solicit funds.

Chief Morbitzer also said people have been calling the police department screaming threats, obscenities and vulgarities. ""Quite frankly, there's a special place in hell for those people,"" he said. ""And my wish is that it comes very soon.""

Long Gun Beginnings

Even before there was actually a ""United States"" there was what could arguably be considered the first true ""American rifle."" Known as the Pennsylvania rifle, the Kentucky rifle or simply the long rifle, it was designed for hunting and was characterized by an unusually long barrel, a unique development that was uncommon in the European rifles of the era.

Military history consultant and former United States Marine Corps Captain Dale Dye told FoxNews.com that, in the flintlock era, the long gun was the first to have grooves in the barrel. ""These grooves, or rifling, along with the longer barrel, made the guns much more accurate than the British Brown Bess musket,"" he said.

HISTORY OF REMOTE WEAPONS IN PICTURES

The long rifle wasn't ever produced in large enough numbers to truly make a difference during the American Revolution, but its use by sharpshooters – such as members of Morgan's Riflemen at the 1777 Battle of Saratoga established the reputation of the American marksman.

The first truly big leap forward in long gun design came with the Caliber .54, Model 1841 Rifle, which was the first to utilize a percussion ignition system. The Model 1841 is sometimes called the Mississippi Rifle due to its use by a Mississippi rifle regiment during the Mexican War between 1846 and 1848. The regiment was commanded by future Confederate States President Jefferson Davis.

Davis, who served as Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce, also authorized the production of the .58 Caliber Musket, or Springfield Model 1861, the first rifled weapon to be produced for general issue by the U.S. Army. The Springfield Model 1861 would go on to be the most widely used U.S Army weapon during the Civil War.

HISTORY OF THE 'JEEP' IN PICTURES

The rest of the 19th century saw other innovations in rifle design including the Springfield Model 1873 ""Trapdoor"", a single shot weapon that was not without its problems, and later the Model 1896 Krag-Jorgensen, a reliable but underwhelming bolt action rifle.

Truly American Rifles of the 20th Century

The real change came with the Springfield Model 1903 – an American take on a European classic.

""The Springfield was patterned after the (German-made) Mauser action,"" said Dye. ""It didn't have an overly deep magazine, but it was accurate to 800 yards and could be fitted with a scope and used as a sniper version.""

HISTORIC TANKS IN PICTURES

The Springfield M1903 was the standard infantry rifle for all branches of the military during World War I, and was used widely during the early phases of World War II. It was replaced by what has been called one of the finest weapons of the 20th century, the M1 Garand, named after its inventor John Garand.

""This was the first successful semi-automatic used by any military,"" Dye told FoxNews.com. ""It is extremely rugged, extremely accurate.""

The M1 Garand, which will celebrate its 80th anniversary next year, was a significant improvement over the bolt action rifles of the day, which required that the weapon was manually cocked between each shot.

HISTORIC AIRCRAFT CARRIERS IN PICTURES

""This was really a game changer as it was semi-automatic and held eight rounds,"" R. Lee Ermey, better known as the ""Gunny"", former United States Marine Corps staff sergeant and host of the Outdoor Channel's “Gunny Time”, told FoxNews.com. ""It could be argued it helped win World War II.""

After the war the military planners sought to find a one-size fits all rifle, and the result was the M14, which was actually developed to replace four different weapons systems that included the M1 rifle, the M1 Carbine, the M3 ""Grease Gun"" submachine gun, and the M1918 Browning Automatic Bar (BAR). The upsized M1 had its fans, including the Marine Corps, which still issued one to each platoon in the Vietnam War.

""The M14 could hold its own against the bad guy gun, the AK-47,"" added Ermey. ""The problem is that it went with a smaller round than the M1, so it lost some of its punch.""

HISTORIC BOMBERS IN PICTURES

The M14 utilized the 7.62x51mm NATO round, or .308 caliber, which was too powerful for use in fully automatic mode as a replacement for a submachine gun, but yet too light to serve as a replacement for the BAR. In the end, however, the problem wasn't so much the gun, but rather the situation.

""It was a little too late for the changing tactics of the conflict,"" said Dye. ""The select fire didn't work out as well as planned. It had too heavy a cartridge for close-quarter fighting, and it made for a heavy weapon. While you are willing to trade weight for firepower, the rifle was not ideal for the situation in Vietnam.""

The irony is that the weapon that replaced the M14 proved not to be ideal at first either. The M16 had a rough baptism of fire, largely due to the fact that it was erroneously billed as self-cleaning and issued without cleaning kits.

SHOT SHOW 2016 IN PICTURES

""It had a turbulent introductory period,"" said Dye. ""The problem for the M16 is that it was introduced while fighting was going on, and this didn't allow for the familiarization period that small arms really need. As a result it cost lives, and that is what you don't ever want to do.""

The other problem with the M16 was the fact that military planners switched the ammunition to one that produced more fouling, and this resulted in jams. The rifle, however, was refined with the M16A1 version.

""The Americans don't have a good track record of backing up,"" Dye told FoxNews.com. ""With the M16 this meant improving it and it proved to be a reliable weapon.""

AUSA 2016: TANKS, TRUCKS AND MORE TECH

As the battlefield changed, the military adapted as well with the introduction of the M4 Carbine, a shorter and lighter variant of the M16A2. This has replaced the M16 in most U.S. Army and Marine Corps combat units as the primary infantry weapon today.

""Lightening the load has been the constant quest and the result is the slimmed down M16,"" said Dye. ""Engagement tactics said we didn't need the long-range weapon for combat.""

The other refinement of the M4 has been its modular design, which allows it to be fitted with numerous accessories including bipods, laser pointers, telescopic sights and even grenade launchers. However, even in the M4A1 version the military may not have found the definitive rifle for the next battlefield. While the M4A1 may be more lethal at close range, there is still a need for taking out targets at distance.

""The next challenge is going to be that long range rifle,"" said Dye. ""This isn't about arming everyone with it, or even making it a sniper rifle, but there is a need for long range shooting and that is going to be the challenge to find the next great long range weapon for the U.S. Army."""

“Let it be absolutely clear,” the organization said in a statement. “The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.”

The statement came two days after Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s executive vice president, delivered a fiery speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland.

The NRA, which represents about 5 million members, has faced public outcry following a mass shooting Feb. 14 in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people. That outcry has mostly taken the form of calls for gun control legislation and for boycotts of companies that partner with the NRA on discount offers and other consumer inducements.

On Saturday, United and Delta Airlines joined the list of companies separating themselves from the gun group. Previous companies to do so include MetLife, Symantec and rental car companies Hertz, Budget, Avis and Enterprise.

Those moves prompted Saturday's response from the NRA, which asserted that those corporations had “decided to punish NRA membership in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.”

NRA BACKLASH: THESE ARE THE COMPANIES CUTTING TIES

The NRA's statement argued that other factors besides gun ownership were to blame for events like the Parkland massacre.

“The law-abiding members of the NRA had nothing at all to do with the failure of that school’s security preparedness, the failure of America’s mental health system, the failure of the National Instant Check System or the cruel failures of both federal and local law enforcement,” its statement said.

However, the Washington Post reported that the NRA fought the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers, suing the federal government once the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was up and running. The NRA had argued that the entire law, including the NICS provision, be struck down as unconstitutional, the report said."

Deputies found Scott Edmisten, 43, of Johnson City, carrying a .357-caliber Magnum, a loaded .45-caliber semi-automatic, a .223-caliber fully automatic assault rifle, a .308-caliber fully automatic assault rifle, more than 900 rounds of ammunition, and survival equipment, Washington County Sheriff Ed Graybeal said.

Graybeal asked the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to help investigate, since the automatic weapons aren't registered and lack serial numbers. He told The Johnson City Press that Edmisten had apparently modified the AR rifles to make them automatics.

""Anytime you have several firearms and several hundred rounds of ammunition in a vehicle, that always causes a concern,"" said Michael Knight, an ATF spokesman.

Authorities still haven't determined why Edmisten was carrying all that firepower, but they ""don't see a connection"" to recent mass shootings, Knight said.

The arrest came a day after Stephen Paddock killed 59 people and wounded more than 500 in Las Vegas, firing down on a music festival crowd from a high-rise hotel suite. Some of the 23 guns in the suite were equipped with devices that enable a rifle to fire continuously, like an automatic.

""It's not connected to any of the other national incidents, but timing obviously was a concern,"" Knight said.

Knight said investigators are tracing where Edmisten's weapons came from.

""Our priority is reducing violent crime on the front end, so that's the other thing we're looking at, along with motive: Were these items going to be used for a criminal act or were they just being transported from one area to another area?""

Graybeal said Edmisten threatened his arresting officer and lunged toward investigators trying to question him. He's jailed without bond on charges of possessing prohibited weapons, speeding, and felony evading arrest. It's unclear if he has a lawyer.

The Winchester 1873 rifle was discovered in the Great Basin National Park leaning against a juniper tree in November. But the strange discovery has triggered more questions than answers.

“You have this gun that no one really knows what happened to it and it gets so much attention because of that,” said Ashley Hlebinsky, curator at the Cody Firearms Museum, in Wyoming.

“You have this gun that no one really knows what happened to it and it gets so much attention because of that.” - Ashley Hlebinsky

The gun was carefully collected and shipped to the museum, where its weathered wood was stabilized with an alcohol solution. A team of researchers carried the firearm to a local hospital to be X-rayed under the patient name “Rifle.”

Museum workers determined the rifle, which was massed produced and is billed as the “gun that won the west” was made in 1882 -- but there are no records to show who owned it.

Adding to the mystery, the gun’s lifter was removed so it was only capable of firing a single shot at once.

Researchers told FoxNews.com the area in Nevada where the gun was found doesn’t help the case either. There was never a recorded fire in the region, which would help them date the gun's presence at the tree, had it survived the flames. Archaeologists scoured the nearby soil for related clues but found nothing—especially not a body.

The Winchester rifle is currently being preserved and is on display at the Cody Firearms Museum, where it sits among 7,000 other guns. Hlebinsky said the Winchester is the star of the show.

“I think a lot of it has to do with the allure and the mystique,” Hlebinsky said. “Why was it leaning up against that tree, how long has it been there, who left it and why.”

And, folks are coming up with all types of scenarios about how it got there.

“A personal favorite of mine is ‘my ex-wife hid it and took it from me,’” she said.

The museum won’t estimate how much the rifle is worth, but gun experts at Las Vegas’ famous Gold and Silver pawn shop say the added backstory of the rifle would likely increase its value.

“It definitely can fetch a higher price, probably a few thousand dollars I would say,” said Travis Benton, store manager.

Eventually the Winchester rifle will be shipped back to the Great Basin Park for permanent displa, it’s tattered body and the secret of how it ended up in the desert forever protected by a wall of glass.

The gun, its stock split, gray and faded like driftwood, and its steel barrel rusted brown, blended in perfectly against the tree in a remote part of the Great Basin National Park until a National Parks Service employee spotted it.

""Perhaps it belonged to a lone cowboy riding the high range."" - Winchester publicist Scott Engen

“The rifle, exposed for all those years to sun, wind, snow and rain, was found leaning against a tree in the park,” said Nichole Andler, chief of interpretation at Great Basin National Park.

An engraving on the gun marks it as a ""Model 1873,"" and Andler said further research showed the serial number on the lower tang, or portion of the grip, matched up with records held at the Center for the West at the Cody Firearms Museum in Cody, Wyo. with a manufacture and shipping date of 1882, Andler said. According to Morgan, Utah-based Winchester Repeating Arms, 720,610 of the rifles were manufactured between 1873 and 1916. In 1882 alone, more than 25,000 of the 1873 models were made.

The gun sold for $50 when they first came out -- nearly $1,000 in today's dollars. By 1882, they were selling for half that price and touted as an accessible “everyman’s” rifle.

The discovery was enough to fire imaginations about the fate of the gun's owner. An article on Winchester's website offered a few theories.

""Perhaps it belonged to a lone cowboy riding the high range,"" wrote Winchester publicist Scott Engen. ""Perhaps it was set aside by a sourdough prospector in his search for a vein of rich ore. Whatever the actual story, it has the makings of a great campfire tale.

On Great Basin Park's Facebook page, the same questions are being bandied about.

“Who left the rifle? When and why it was leaned against the tree? And, why was it never retrieved?” reads a post on the page.

The park's cultural resource staff is combing through old newspapers and family histories hoping to solve the mystery. But posters to the site had their own suspicions.

""No big mystery,"" wrote Kenneth Larson. ""A hunter left it. Set it against the tree, took care of the deer, drug it or packed it out on a horse. Got to the bottom and realized he'd left the rifle and said screw it. Or went back and couldn't find it.”

Park officials will exhibit the rifle before it is sent to conservators to stabilize the wood and apply museum conservation techniques to prevent further deterioration.

San Bernardino is recognized as the same city where 14 people were killed and 24 were injured in a December 2, 2015 terror attack. The performance took place just hours after at least 26 people were murdered inside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when a gunman opened fired.

“In an era where mass shootings have become a nearly daily occurrence, this was an act of theater in an attempt to make a statement about how easily accessible semi-automatic weapons are and how seeing them has become normalized,” the 48-year-old shock rocker said in a statement sent to Variety Monday.

“My art has always been a reaction to popular culture and my way to make people think about the horrible things that happen in this world,” he added. “My performance was not meant to be disrespectful or show any insensitivity.”

TMZ reported Monday the “Beautiful People” singer was in a wheelchair, due to a leg injury, while he carried the fake firearm. He pointed it at the crowd while singing “We Know Where You F-----g Live.” Manson moved the fake gun around and pointed it throughout his controversial concert.

“The prop microphone I used on stage was handed to me with the approval of a police officer,” said Manson. “My empathy goes out to anyone who has been affected by the irresponsible and reprehensible misuse of REAL guns.”

However, Douglas York, an attorney for the family of 47-year-old Ulises Valladares, is attributing his death to a series of bungling errors that show ""a roadmap of mistakes,"" by authorities.

""We're not saying the guy went there with malice in heart so that he could kill a duct-taped hostage,"" York said. ""But once they got there, they failed to protect the very person they were designed to do. And when you're holding a deadly weapon, I think you owe a duty to the hostage not to kill him.""

Police said Valladares was kidnapped from his home in Conroe, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Houston, on Jan. 24. His 12-year-old son called police, who called the FBI for assistance.

The FBI tracked down two male suspects to a motel near Houston. The suspects directed FBI agents to a house in Houston where another suspect — a woman — was located along with Valladares.

At around 3:30 a.m. on Jan. 25, a SWAT team from the FBI began entering the house. While one team of agents entered through the front of the home, two other agents began entering by breaking through a back window. When the tool one agent was using to break the window fell into the home, he started using his M4 rifle to break the glass, Acevedo said.

Someone then started to pull the agent's rifle and the agent, fearing the weapon could be used against other agents entering the home, fired twice, Acevedo said. One bullet hit Valladares, who died later at a hospital.

The agent didn't know that Valladares, situated right by the window, was the person pulling at his rifle, Acevedo said. The room was dark and the agents breaching the window didn't use any lights because they didn't want to blind the entry team coming in through the front of the home, Acevedo said.

""Everyone involved, their heart breaks,"" he said. ""Those agents that morning went there with the best of intentions.""

While Valladares' hands had been bound with tape to the front of his body, he was apparently still able to grab the weapon, Acevedo said.

Agents at the scene were yelling ""FBI"" and Acevedo suggested the victim, who is from Honduras, might not have understood what the agents were saying.

However, Valladares' brother, Ernesto, said his brother spoke perfect English and he doesn't believe investigators' claims that his brother pulled the agent's rifle.

""How is he going to grab the rifle when his hands were bound?"" Ernesto Valladares said.

York was critical of the agent's decision to fire his weapon in the dark.

""I'm positive he was not trained just to start firing his weapon into an area he can't see because why? You're going to shoot somebody who is an innocent victim,"" York said.

The police investigation into the shooting is ongoing and once it's concluded, its findings will be presented to prosecutors, Acevedo said.

In a statement, Perrye Turner, special agent in charge of the FBI Houston office, said he couldn't provide additional details because of the ongoing investigation but his agency ""takes very seriously any shooting incident.""

Two men and one woman have been charged by authorities in Montgomery County, where Conroe is located, with aggravated kidnapping. The men also are charged with aggravated robbery.

Ulises Valladares' 12-year-old son was placed in foster care after his father's death. York said Ernesto Valladares has filed a lawsuit to get custody of his nephew as the boy's mother died a couple of years ago from cancer and he has no other relatives in the Houston area.

The College Station Police Department said in a news release that starting defensive tackle Zaycoven Henderson, 23, and Terry Florez Jr., 24, were arrested after officers were called around 2:30 a.m. to the Campus Village Apartments.

""Officers learned that the passenger [Henderson] in the vehicle pointed a rifle at one of the victims and also threatened the other two victims by stating he would kill them,"" police said in a release.

Authorities were originally contacted after several residents reported two men in the apartment complex pointed a gun at them.

Officers then pulled the pair over as they were driving out of the complex and found marijuana in their possession, in addition to a discarded rifle in the nearby woods. The firearm matched the exact description given by the victims, KXXV reported.

Henderson has been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, tampering with evidence, and possession of marijuana, while Florez Jr. is charged with possession of marijuana.

A Texas A&M spokesperson told The Dallas Morning News that Henderson has been suspended indefinitely per athletics department policy.

Police had been responding to a call from an addiction-recovery home to assist with a man showing signs of psychosis, Whitney told the paper.

The man gained access to the patrol car after police placed him inside the vehicle while waiting for an ambulance, according to the paper.

“He was able to get access from the rear passenger side to the front side …and a high-powered rifle,” Whitney told the paper.

Kivona, as she requested to be called, was working at the fast food chain in Dearborn, MI, early Monday morning when she said a drive-thru customer ordered a frappe, Fox 8 reports.

Kivona informed the customer, described as a black male in his 30s, that the machine was broken. She told Fox 8 the customer then became furious with her.

“It wasn't like I was being nasty or anything. I just took his order, and I guess he wasn't satisfied with the answer he had gotten,” Kivona said.

Kivona says when she opened the drive-thru window to take the man’s money, Fox 8 reports, he shot her in the face with a paintball gun and drove away.

“I was in shock, and I was holding my face. I thought I got shot by a real gun,” she said to Fox 8, stating that the paintball gun looked like a real handgun.

A White House source told Fox News that Trump is open to a number of measures to address mass shootings, including supporting a rise in the minimum age for owning certain firearms – a proposal that could face resistance from gun rights groups, like the National Rifle Association.

According to the Giffords Law Center, which tracks gun laws and advocates for more restrictions, licensed firearm dealers under federal law cannot sell handguns to people under 21 and cannot sell long guns to people under 18. Some state laws already impose stricter minimum age requirements.

It’s not clear if Trump would seek changes to federal laws, the source said, or if he would advocate for a change at the state level.

The Washington Post reported that Trump is considering arguments that the minimum age for buying any semiautomatic weapon should be raised from 18 to 21. Axios also reported that Trump has been telling associates that he “doesn’t think high school kids should be able to buy guns.”

During Tuesday’s White House briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about raising the age for buying AR-15s and said, “I think that's certainly something that's on the table for us to discuss, and that we expect to come up over the next couple of weeks.”

She said the administration is working to determine what can be done at the federal level.

“I know there are currently laws in place in certain states that restrict that,” she said. “In terms of whether or not we make that federal policy, that hasn't yet been determined.""

TRUMP URGES BAN ON ‘BUMP STOCKS’

The NRA has not yet publicly commented on the trial balloon. But the discussion could be a test for Trump’s loyal base, as many of his supporters generally oppose new restrictions that would affect law-abiding gun owners. Yet Trump has flouted traditional conservative positions in the past, and could be testing whether he could sway certain wings of the party.

At the same time, he may be wary of going too far.

The talks come as the NRA’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, is expected to address conservative activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington this week.

Trump, who was backed by the NRA during the 2016 election, has expressed support for the Second Amendment and said he’s against reflexive gun control measures that wouldn’t stop tragedies.

But since last week’s shooting, the president has begun to embrace new gun restrictions.

Trump on Tuesday directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft new regulations to ban firearm modifiers including the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas massacre.

A memo, released by the White House on Tuesday, directs the DOJ to propose a rule “banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.”

Sanders said the White House hasn’t “closed the door on any front” when it comes to trying to stop mass shootings and said Trump supports efforts to improve the federal background system.

Trump on Tuesday tweeted, “Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!”

The president on Wednesday is hosting parents, teachers and students at the White House to discuss efforts to ensure safety at schools.

Among those attending will be members of the Parkland community and those affected by the Sandy Hook and Columbine school shootings, the White House said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And I'm a fan of the NRA. There's no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. They want to do it.

These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we agree on everything. It doesn't make sense that I have to wait until I'm 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18. I don't know. So, I was just curious as what you did in your bill.

You don't address it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We didn't address it, Mr. President.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: You know why? Because you're afraid of the NRA. Right?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

NEIL CAVUTO, ""YOUR WORLD"" HOST: All right. That did not sit well with Pennsylvania Republic Pat Toomey. And it did not sit well with a number of Republicans, who didn't like the president saying that, as a party, maybe and other congressmen as well, are afraid of the NRA, afraid to take on the NRA.

Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole is one of them.

You didn't like that, did you?

REP. TOM COLE, R-OKLAHOMA: Well, look, I just think it created some uncertainty whether they didn't need to be any.

We are going to clearly be able to pass a background check improvement. And that's a good thing. We're clearly all lined up against bump stocks, NRA included on both those issues, by the way. And that's a good thing.

And I think most of us, at least on the Republican side, think we need to take measures literally as the president suggested to harden the targets, that is, to make schools and school personnel better able to resist a random act of insane violence like this.

So, we have got a lot more in common than we do that divides us. We ought to work on those things and see what we can do to address the problem.

CAVUTO: The due process thing with the president, where he would just take your gun first, that didn't sit well with many in that room, including some Democrats, who thought it was a bit extreme, in other words, take guns, deal with due process later.



COLE: Well, I wouldn't have put it that way.

Now, there are -- there is legislation to allow immediate intervention if police think there's a dangerous situation. It's been passed at the state level in several places. Things like that are worth considering.

And certainly if you know you have made a mistake -- look, in this case, there were massive failures. It's not a matter what the law was, when 39 times local police officers are coming to intervene with the a particular individual, when you have got credible tips to the federal law enforcement people that the this guy needs to be checked because we think something's about to happen.

That was a huge failure. And legislation had nothing to do with it. So you got to look at implementation as well.

CAVUTO: Do you sense that the opportunity is still there, Congressman, to get meaningful reform done?

The president threw this out there I think as much, and some of these other ideas that would normally be anathema to many in your party, to get more debate going and to sort of crack down on sacred cows.

What do you make of that?

COLE: Well, I think when there is a great opportunity.

Look, the House has already passed the Cornyn bill, the so called Fix NICS bill. And we also put some things with it Democrats might not like, concealed carry reciprocity. But the point is, we can do this one way or another. They can pass just a background check. We will go to conference, work out the differences. That can be done.

The president -- we have bump stocks were made legal by administrative action in the Obama administration.

CAVUTO: So, can he make them with the swipe of a pen -- I just want to be clear on this process. He say he's going to issue an order -- I think that was the gist of it out -- and end that.

COLE: I personally believe he can. There are others that are very well- informed that think it will take a law.

Either way, there's overwhelming consensus to do it. So if we need to do both to make sure, that would be fine by me. So, again, I think actually Leader McConnell had it pretty good last week. Let's focus on -- earlier this week -- let's focus on the things we agree on, and start getting those things done.

And let's also remember we have partners here. Look, state governments are free to do an awful lot themselves. We're seeing that happening in Florida right now and probably it will happen in other states as well.

So it's going to take a concerted effort. But let's just start doing the things we agree on. We will get a long way down the road.

CAVUTO: The president has espoused positions that typically are not those of a Republican president on the gun issue that you have got into, Congressman, also on these trade tariffs that many in your party and others are concerned about.

Are you worried?

COLE: No.

Look, I think this is a president that delivered to the largest tax cut in a generation, who is involved in the largest defense buildup since the 1980s, who has done more to deregulate the economy than any president in decades.

So he's an unconventional president. He doesn't always agree. He's not a party-line Republican. I actually respect that. And I think that's one of the reasons he got elected.

But on the broad issues, actually, he's governed very much like a traditional Republican. And he's delivered I think big time for the American people.

CAVUTO: Congressman, thank you very, very much. We appreciate it.

COLE: Thank you.

“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump told lawmakers at the White House. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”

During the meeting, which also included prominent Democrats, Trump told House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who was gravely injured in a mass shooting this summer, that a comprehensive gun bill would not pass if it included a concealed carry reciprocity proposal desired by Republicans.

“You know, I’m your biggest fan in the whole world,” Trump told Scalise. “I think that bill maybe one day will pass, but it should pass as a separate. If you’re going to put concealed carry between states into this bill, we’re talking about a whole new ball game.”

Trump added: “I’m with you, but let it be a separate bill.”

His comments come as Fox News has learned the White House plans to roll out specific policy proposals on Thursday aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Among the proposals are some that may put him at odds with the NRA, the powerful pro-gun organization that was a frequent topic during the meeting.

At one point during Wednesday’s session, Trump told Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who has previously sponsored background check legislation, “You are afraid of the NRA.”

A spokesman for Toomey, Steve Kelly, responded in a statement to Fox News, saying: “Senator Toomey has not received a dime from the NRA since joining the Senate. Senator Toomey has demonstrated that he is not afraid of the NRA or any other special interest group.”

At the beginning of the meeting, Trump said he wanted the lawmakers around the table with him “to come up with some ideas” and put them into “a very bipartisan bill.”

“It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody could support as opposed to, you know, 15 bills,” he said.

Trump has been pushing some new gun restrictions in the wake of this month’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in which 17 people were killed. He emphasized his commitment to strengthening background checks for gun buyers and dealing with the mentally ill.

“What surprises me more than anything else is that nothing’s been done for all of these years,” Trump told the lawmakers. “Because I really see a lot of common ground where there's Democrat, Republican.”

According to sources, the White House proposal will include raising the minimum age for buying long guns to 21 from 18 -- a proposal that Trump acknowledged is opposed by the NRA. Trump will also call for training and arming certain members of school faculty and staff, either through federal grants to states or a federal training program.

During Wednesday's meeting, Trump said “we must harden out schools” against attacks, calling for arming some staff at schools.

Speaking of the Pulse nightclub shooting in September 2016 that killed 49 people, Trump said: “If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn't have happened. Or certainly not to the extent it did, where he was just shooting and shooting and shooting and they were defenseless.”

On Thursday, Trump is also expected to reiterate his support for a bill that bolsters the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. He also will back the STOP School Violence Act, which gives the Justice Department grants for preventing school violence.

The president said Wednesday he will get rid “bump stocks,” saying they will “be gone shortly.” The firearm modifiers, which can make a semi-automatic weapon fire nearly as rapidly as a fully automatic machine gun, were used in the Oct. 1, 2017, Las Vegas massacre, in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured.

Trump will also call for fixing the FBI’s tipster program, amid revelations that the bureau received multiple tips about the youth accused of shooting up the Parkland school ahead of that massacre but failed to stop him.

In addition, the president is also expected to encourage states to create laws for extreme-risk protective orders, which would allow parents and law enforcement to petition courts to take weapons away from anyone threatening to harm themselves or others.

Republicans lawmakers at the meeting included: John Cornyn of Texas; Steve Danies of Montana; Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Marco Rubio of Florida; Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania; Orrin Hatch of Utah; Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee; Brian Mast of Florida, John Rutherford of Florida and Steve Scalise of Louisiana.

Democrats included Dianne Feinstein of California; Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Chris Murphy of Connecticut; Ted Deutch of Florida; Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut and Stephanie Murphy of Florida.

Lawmakers pitching their ideas on gun control told Trump their proposals could pass if he expressed his support. The president contrasted himself to past presidents, accusing former President Obama of not being “proactive” in getting a bill passed.

“It's time that a president stepped up… I'm talking Democrat and Republican presidents,” Trump said. “They have not stepped up.”

Trump expressed a willingness to be open to proposals from Democrats that Republicans usually reject outright, telling Feinstein he would review her assault weapons ban legislation. But he remained non-committal when pressed by Feinstein, telling her to discuss her plans with her congressional colleagues."

The gun show over the weekend attracted almost 7,000 attendees to the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa, just two weeks after the deadly Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that killed 17 people.

“Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights,” gun show manager, George Fernandez, told WTSP.

Florida Sen. Bill Nelson called for stricter gun laws on the so-called “gun show loophole,” allowing people to purchase a gun at one of these events without getting a background check – in addition to an assault weapons ban.

Nelson told the local news station that the number of deaths has increased since the NRA killed the law in 2004.

Fernandez took issue with Nelson’s push because he said it wouldn’t have stopped the massacre in the Parkland school shooting. He said the shooter had mental health issues and should’ve been identified by law enforcement from the beginning.

He added that 95 percent of the vendors at the show were required to run background checks because they are licensed dealers, but the other five percent are private citizens.

The company canceled their gun show next month in Fort Lauderdale after Mayor Jack Seiler asked that it be shut down out of respect to the Parkland victims, but they plan to sponsor another Tampa show in late April or early June."
fox123,fox,['Jeremy Hunt'],2018-02-27 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/02/27/would-universities-stand-up-for-pro-gun-students-free-speech-rights.html,"In a rare act of solidarity, several universities are voicing their support for applicants who participate in protests for stricter gun control.

Schools like Yale, MIT, Boston University, and others have issued statements explicitly stating that those who stage demonstrations against pro-gun laws will not have their admissions jeopardized, should their high schools penalize them for peaceful protests. In a now-viral tweet, The Brown University Office of College Admission stated:

@BrownUAdmission Applicants to Brown: Expect a socially conscious, intellectually independent campus where freedom of expression is fundamentally important. You can be assured that peaceful, responsible protests against gun violence will not negatively impact decisions on admission to Brown.

Quite plainly, several admissions departments seem to have picked a side in the gun control debate:

@UMassAmherstUA Students: If you participate in peaceful protests against gun violence and receive school discipline for walking out, staging your protest, etc., please rest assured that you can report it to UMass Amherst, and we won't hold it against you. #ParklandStudentsSpeak

@ApplytoBU Admission to BU will not be jeopardized should your school levy a penalty for participating in peaceful protests, such as the National School Walkout Day. See Dean of Admissions Kelly A. Walter's full statement here: http://spr.ly/6012DRTEk BU_Tweets #StudentsStandUp

This comes as survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and other high school students are organizing rallies, media interviews, and school walkouts to protest gun violence.

In response, several high school administrations issued warnings to students that any participation in such demonstrations, such as the National School Walkout Day, during school hours will result in disciplinary action. In fact, the Needville Independent School District in Texas promised three days of suspension for those who decided to protest.

But students need not fear; they now have universities on their side.

While it’s encouraging to see “universities” and “free speech” in the same headline, only half the work is done if college administrations don’t go to the same lengths to protect speech with which they might disagree.

It’s refreshing that colleges are finally standing up for free speech. It’s disconcerting that they only tend to do so for students who share their political views. Many of these same universities have stood idly by as conservative groups have found their First Amendment rights put on the backburner.

In several cases around the country, several schools have discovered creative means to muffle free speech when it comes to conservative students. The University of Minnesota could potentially face a lawsuit for banning conservative icon Ben Shapiro from speaking at any of their large campus venues—banishing the event to their “cow campus” in St. Paul.

Just last month, the Department of Justice filed in support of conservative groups suing the University of California, Berkeley for discriminating against their activities on campus. In one case, the Berkeley administration instituted a bizarre 3pm curfew for one of their events causing a conflict with classes.

Several other universities have come under fire for barely punishing students who violently disrupt events involving right-leaning speakers. Administrations have mastered the art of issuing empty statements voicing their disapproval of violent activities, while doing very little to stop them from happening.

That’s why you shouldn’t buy all these virtue-signaling announcements from universities claiming to support the First Amendment rights of high school applicants. In fact, if you read them a little closer, several statements are pretty specific about not penalizing pro-gun control activists in particular. I have a hard time believing that a staunch NRA-supporting, Second Amendment activist would be guaranteed such protections.

But true adherence to constitutional rights doesn’t stop with only your political allies. Colleges and universities should be bastions of free speech—even when it’s inconvenient.

A recent study conducted by Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) and YouGov found that “very liberal students are 14 percentage points more likely to feel comfortable expressing their opinions in the classroom than their very conservative peers.” For all of the talk about embracing diversity on campus, it’s clear that too often that doesn’t include diversity of thought.

While it’s encouraging to see “universities” and “free speech” in the same headline (without being followed by “lawsuit”), only half the work is done if college administrations don’t go to the same lengths to protect speech with which they might disagree. After all, isn’t that what they taught us is the point of the Constitution?"

Pasadena police Lt. Vasken Gourdikian was arrested Friday morning and charged with illegally selling more than 100 firearms between 2014 and 2017.

The weapons included some that are outlawed in California, the Pasadena Star-News reported.

Gourdikian, 48, was released on a $100,000 bond after pleading not guilty Friday in federal court in Los Angeles. His attorney, Mark Geragos, said the charges were ""misguided and truly an abuse of the supposed discretion of the government.""

He has been placed on unpaid leave, the Star-News reported.

As a police officer, Gourdikian was able to purchase so-called ""off-roster"" handguns, which aren't available to the public and aren't listed in a catalog of certified handguns maintained by the state, authorities said.

Pasadena's Police Department issued seven waivers to the officer, allowing him to bypass 10-day waiting periods on purchases of six pistols and an assault rifle at gun shops in Los Angeles and Orange counties, the Star-News reported.

Gourdikian posted on online gun message boards that he had weapons that were brand new and still in the box, court documents said. The indictment alleges Gourdikian sometimes sold weapons in bulk across Southern California and advertised on the website Calguns.net, the Star-News reported.

The investigation against Gourdikian began during a routine analysis of sales and trace reports by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to Bill McMullan, special agent in charge of the ATF field office in Los Angeles.

ATF agents raided Gourdikian's home last year and seized 62 firearms, including an unregistered short-barreled rifle, officials said.

He was also charged with possessing an unregistered gun and falsely claiming on federal firearms forms that he was buying a gun for himself, even though he had already agreed to sell the weapon to someone else, prosecutors said.

Gourdikian, who had been on paid leave for about a year, will no longer be paid by the police department, officials said. An internal review is now ""on hold pending the outcome of the criminal investigation,"" police said in a statement.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."

“Okay, I’ll be the bad guy and say what no one else is brave enough to say, but wants to say,” Kelly Guthrie Raley, who was named Eustis Middle School Teacher of the Year 2017-2018 last month, said in a now-viral Facebook post following the mass shooting that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Raley said she’ll “take all the criticism and attacks” for her opinion because, as a teacher with two decades of experience, she has to worry about an active-shooter situation on a daily basis.

The middle school teacher said over her almost two decades as an educator that she’s seen an increase in violence and a lack of compassion among students.

“Until we, as a country, are willing to get serious and talk about mental health issues, lack of available care for the mental health issues, lack of discipline in the home, horrendous lack of parental support when the schools are trying to control horrible behavior at school (oh no! Not MY KID. What did YOU do to cause my kid to react that way?), lack of moral values, and yes, I’ll say it – violent video games that take away all sensitivity to ANY compassion for others’ lives – as well as reality TV that makes it commonplace for people to constantly scream up in each others’ faces and not value any other person but themselves, we will have a gun problem in school,” the sixth-grade language arts teacher wrote.

Raley, who loves hunting and four-wheeling in her spare time, added that she grew up with guns in her home.

“But you know what? My parents NEVER supported any bad behavior from me,” Raley said.

She said when she began teaching 20 years ago, she never had to worry about calling a student’s parents and getting cussed out, told to go to hell, or threatened with a public shaming all because she was calling out their child’s behavior. Something, she said, has got to change.

“Parents, it’s time to step up!” Raley urges. “Be the parent that actually gives a crap! Be the annoying mom that pries and knows what your kid is doing. STOP being their friend. They have enough ‘friends’ at school. Be their parent. Being the ‘cool mom’ means not a damn thing when either your kid is dead or your kid kills other people because they were allowed to have their space and privacy in YOUR HOME.”

She doubles down that she had guns in her home.

“But you know what? I never dreamed of shooting anyone with his guns. I never dreamed of taking one! I was taught respect for human life, compassion, rules, common decency, and most of all, I was taught that until I moved out, my life and bedroom wasn’t mine...it was theirs. And they were going to know what was happening because they loved me and wanted the best for me.”

Raley concludes her post by adding that she never brought up gun control.

“This post wasn’t about gun control,” she said. “This was me, loving the crap out of people and wanting the best for them. This was about my school babies and knowing that God created each one for greatness, and just wanting them to reach their futures.”

Raley said the only thing she holds dearer than teaching students is her faith and family, and that her father, a military hero, and her mother, a retired school teacher, inspired her to be who she is today."
fox126,fox,['Perry Chiaramonte'],2017-01-18 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/18/california-snafu-releases-personal-info-nearly-4000-gun-safety-instructors.html,"The private information of thousands of California firearms instructors was accidentally released by the state late last year in response to a journalist’s Freedom of Information request.

The data request was made in August, when a reporter for Southern California Public Radio (KPCC), an NPR affiliate, sought all information on Firearms Safety Certifications available from the California Department of Justice.

The information was released in October, and a clerical error gave the reporter wide access to the personal information of 3,424 firearms instructors -- whose dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and California identification numbers were handed over, according to NRA-ILA, the legislative arm of the National Rifle Association.

The error was caught two months later, and the California DOJ sent out a letter to all of the Golden State’s instructors letting them know their personal information had been compromised.

“The Department discovered the data breach on October 17, 2016, and notified the requestor of the error and asked that the information be destroyed and that no further dissemination of it occur,” said the letter, sent by the Office of the Attorney General Kamala Harris. Harris is now a U.S. senator.

The letter also recommended the firearm instructors place a fraud alert on their credit. Since driver's license numbers are appealing to identity thieves, a fraud alert could prevent criminals from misusing someone's personal data.

NRA officials blasted the California DOJ for its data breach and questioned why it took the department so long to alert the thousands who were affected.

“This privacy breach is just another example of the California Department of Justice’s disregard for the rights of gun owners,” Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs for the NRA, said to FoxNews.com. “There’s no reason why the private information of firearms instructors should have been released – the DOJ redacts information all the time.""

Baker also questioned the length of time it took the state to inform victims of the breach.

Expand / Contract Nearly 4,000 gun safety instructors in California received this letter by the DOJ two months after the breach was discovered.

“It’s time the California government start awarding gun owners the same respect as it does non-gun owners.”

Some security experts said that while it wasn't a significant data breach, there is still cause for concern.

“The main concern, if any, would be identity theft, simply because it is so prevalent,” police consultant and retired Los Angeles Police Lt. Raymond Foster said to FoxNews.com. “I don’t think anyone would threaten these instructors, but one concern is that many of them are retired police officers and that could put them at an additional risk. Most of them when they are off-duty like to lie low and blend in.

“But I’d imagine that NPR would never publish this info and would likely just rip it up.”

The reporter, who the NRA-ILA identifies as Aaron Mendelson, acknowledged in his FOIA request that part of his request would be redacted.

“…Please inform me of the redaction and the legal justification for it,” said the request, which was obtained by FoxNews.com.

Since receiving the data, it appears that none of the information has been published in any recent stories. In its letter to firearm instructors, the California DOJ said that it had asked the reporter to destroy the information he received and if he did not do so he would face legal action.

Neither Mendelson nor officials for Southern California Public Radio immediately returned calls for comment.

Gun instructors in California took the news of their information being released in stride. Dennis Santiago, an independent gun safety instructor in the Los Angeles area, who received the DOJ letter, told FoxNews.com he at first thought it was a hacking incident.

“I was speaking with other instructors at a gun shop about it and they didn’t seem too concerned,” Santiago said. ""They took it as being the cost of being in America.”

Lott']",2016-09-08 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/08/gun-ownership-is-up-in-america-so-why-isnt-media-telling-about-it.html,"Two weeks ago, the PEW Research Center released a survey showing that gun ownership by households is up to 44% — a 7-percentage point increase in the past two years. Another 5% of households won’t reveal whether they own a gun. Yet, not a single mainstream American media headline has announced the increase.

In fact, the media goes out of its way to find polls claiming that Americans are turning away from guns. In their War on Guns they want to give the impression that gun owners are a small, fringe group. Maybe they are hoping that this will have an impact on policy. As General Social Survey director Tom Smith told me, a large drop in gun ownership would “make it easier for politicians to do the right thing on guns.”

In June, the Washington Post and Time magazine trumpeted a CBS News poll with this headline: “American gun ownership drops to lowest in nearly 40 years” and “The Weird Reason Why Gun Ownership in America Is at Its Lowest Point Since the 1970s.” Last year, an Associated Press headline announced: “Gun ownership in U.S. drops to record low.” Recent headlines in the New York Times and CNN declared: “Share of Homes With Guns Shows 4-Decade Decline” and “Fewer US gun owners own more guns.”

The Washington Post falsely assured readers, “The downward trend in gun ownership remains consistent across the national polls.” Bizarrely, if the Washington Post and CNN had relied on their own polls, their headlines would claim that gun ownership has remained constant over the years. But neither organization has run such headlines.

Only two surveys actually show a drop in gun ownership. They are by CBS News and the General Social Survey (GSS). According to the GSS, the percentage of homes with a gun has fallen from approximately 50% in the late 1970s to 32% in 2014. The CBS poll claimed that ownership had fallen from 51% in 1978 to 36% this year.

But many other surveys have obtained very different results.

According to Gallup, household gun ownership has ranged from 51 percent in 1994 to just 34 percent in 1999. In 2014, household gun ownership was at 42 percent – comparable to the 43-45 percent figures during the 1970s.

There was absolutely no news coverage of a 2011 Gallup poll headlined, “Self-Reported Gun Ownership in U.S. Is Highest Since 1993.”

The ABC News/Washington Post poll shows an even more stable pattern, with household gun ownership rates of 44-46 percent in 1999. In 2013, the ownership rate was 43 percent.



A CNN poll from January showed 40% of Americans living in a household that owns a gun. Nine percent of respondents were unwilling to state an opinion, implying that the true ownership rate is greater than 40%.

Furthermore, polling is not the only indicator of gun ownership. The number of concealed handgun permits has soared from about 2.7 million in 1999 to over 14.5 million in 2016. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) shows that the number of gun purchases has exploded, almost doubling from 2008 to 2015.

In Illinois, a Firearm Owner Identification (FOID) card is required. The number of people with those cards dramatically increased from slightly over 1 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2015.

There are some other strong reasons for believing that polls underestimate the number of gun owners. A recent Zogby Analytics survey posed the question, ""If a national pollster asked you if you owned a firearm, would you determine to tell him or her the truth or would you feel it was none of their business?” Thirty-five percent of current gun owners said that it was none of the pollsters’ business. This answer is especially common among those who claim not to be gun owners.

We also know that current events influence people’s willingness to acknowledge gun ownership. After mass shootings, a sudden drop can be seen in the polling numbers. But there is no evidence of people getting rid of their guns. Indeed, gun sales actually soar.

But this isn’t the only limitation of gun ownership polls. Take the fact that, compared to married women, married men are much more likely to admit to having a gun in the home. Either the men are hiding guns from their wives or women are more reluctant to tell pollsters that they own a gun. If the latter, the GSS survey results should be about 4 percentage points higher.

The media's selective use of polls may provide gun control advocates with talking points and let them try isolating gun owners. But hard numbers clearly show a huge increase in gun sales and in the percentage of Americans who carry guns.

Already parents of three, the couple is in the process of formally adopting a daughter through the state foster care system and is fighting Department of Children and Family Services rules they say severely restrict their gun rights. The couple charges that the firearm restrictions aimed at safeguarding foster children violate their constitutional rights and threaten their ability to keep their family safe.

“Our family has always owned and used firearms,” said Kenneth Shults, 37, who is a firearms safety instructor and a machine shop manager. “No foster parent should have to forfeit their constitutional rights in order to be a foster parent.”

Prospective Illinois foster parents must either certify that there are no firearms in their home or complete a form called the Foster Family Firearms Arrangement. That document requires a list of all guns and ammunition in the home and locations where they are stored. Would-be foster parents also must certify the guns have trigger locks and are stored unloaded, separate from ammunition and in locked containers accessible only with a key kept off the premises or on the owner’s person.

The rules can be enforced by involuntary home inspections, according to the lawsuit.

The state’s rules defeat the purpose of keeping a firearm for protection, said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Washington-based Second Amendment Foundation, which has joined the suit as a plaintiff along with the Illinois State Rifle Association.

""When seconds count, having your gun unloaded, locked up and ammunition stored somewhere else makes you a likely victim of a violent crime,"" Gottlieb said.

The Shultses claim to have a legitimate need for the protection afforded by an accessible, loaded gun. Colleen, a nurse at the Illinois Department of Corrections’ Danville Correctional Center, was warned in March by her employer that prisoners were seeking home addresses of prison staff, including correctional officers and nurses. The letter warned that she and other prison employees should take unspecified precautions.

The Shultses have complied with the state policy so far, but now believe they need guns at the ready “for self-defense and defense of family.”

“This lawsuit is important not just for foster families in Illinois, but all across the nation,” said Gottlieb. “What we are challenging is the denial of the fundamental right to defend yourself and your family.”

The suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, accuses the director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services of deprivation of civil rights under color of law. The complaint maintains the constitutional Second Amendment rights of foster parents were violated because Illinois Department of Children and Family Services policy effectively prohibits current and prospective foster parents from possessing firearms for the purpose of self-defense.

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services told FoxNews.com that the agency had no comment because it had not yet received and reviewed the lawsuit.

The suit is one of a series filed by the Second Amendment Foundation challenging gun laws in the state of Illinois over the last several years. One of the most publicized was McDonald v. City of Chicago, in which Otis McDonald, a maintenance worker and grandfather living in Chicago, claimed he was unable to protect himself and his family in a dangerous neighborhood because of an ordinance banning the possession of handguns.

The landmark case went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010, when, in a 5-4 decision, the justices held that the right of an individual to ""keep and bear arms"" in every state is protected by the Second Amendment.

In another Illinois lawsuit, the foundation forced the State Legislature to adopt a conceal-carry statute.

“One would think the state would have wised up by now,” Gottlieb said. “But here we are again, to make sure that the state cannot discriminate against foster parents who merely wish to exercise the rights we’ve restored in Illinois.”

In the beginning of the evening we talked about all kinds of things; one of these was my new Springfield Champion .45 ACP. When I mentioned my newest acquisition, my neighbor Gary said, ""Oh, I would like to see that.""

After I retrieved it, I gave it a quick safety check then dropped the empty magazine and racked the slide open. At this point my neighbor quickly commented to his wife, ""Tammy, see how he did that."" This was in response to my safe handling of the firearm. As a 1911 style semi-auto, this empty and locked open slide quickly transferred the message that the firearm was safe to handle, and as an experienced gun owner himself he verified my work before handling the gun himself.

I learned to shoot and to handle firearms safely as a teenager. My father was a police officer and also competed on the police force's pistol team. I can remember always having guns around the house. My brothers and I were all taught the safety fundamentals at an early age. I still feel that education is the best tool for keeping weapons safe.

Households that have very young children, however, need to take additional firearm storage measures, as curiosity often trumps learning and common sense. The fact that we got to handle and shoot them, removed a lot of the mystery that guns hold for those whom are less familiar or curious. Like my father before me, I have begun to introduce my two daughters to safe handling and shooting as well. It is a process and occurs with highly supervised and measured steps.

Cabinets, Safes and Locks

One way to ensure that firearms are safe is to lock them away in safes, or lockable cabinets, or install locking devices on the guns themselves. These are the preferred methods for those who have small children in the home, or the potential to have children visit.

Another equally effective way to prevent accidental discharge is to lock away the all the ammunition. (It is very clear that both the gun and ammo are needed to be able to fire.)

One common concern with people who keep guns for home security is the availability and speedy access if needed. I recently saw an advertisement about firearms and home protection that caught my eye. The ad's copy read. ""When seconds count, help is only minutes away."" This reality is all too true in many urban areas where police or rescue personnel cover dense populations, or in more remote locations were considerable distances are involved. Your 911 call may not be as fast as you hope, and your safety may rely on your own skills and preparations. In cases where a home intruder may be present, or a marauding wild beast, ready access and usability may outweigh more secure firearm storage. There are a number of firearm storage configurations that can provide both. Some are even designed with ""bio-metric"" systems that can read fingerprints. With these types of firearm storage units, the need to remember a locking code in a high stress environment is eliminated.

Burglar-Proof Firearm Storage

Defending a home is only possible if you are there, though it may be a frightening experience. Preventing the theft of firearms in an empty home is another reason to own a gun safe. Guns can be expensive things and some folks' collections can be quite extensive. I'm just getting started and my collection pales in comparison to one of my neighbors'. They have two gun safes that are each bigger than my decent sized refrigerator. Keeping your firearms protected in a burglar-proof location, like a large gun safe, which can be to big to carry or is firmly bolted in place, can offer peace of mind. Many of these firearm storage safes also provide some degree of fire protection.

Unlike a basic cabinet which may have a lock to keep children out, a true gun safe offers far more security. When I was growing up, my father (a skilled but amateur remodeler in Detroit) constructed a secret room in our basement to house his collection. Any potential burglar would have had a hard time finding it. A 500 pound gun safe may yell, ""This home has guns,"" but the chance of a burglar actually moving it, or getting in, is pretty impossible.

My new Springfield uses the ""ILS"" Integrated Locking System, and a basic cable lock secures my wheel guns. Now that my collection is starting to grow, I need to find a permanent firearm storage unit for them....though they will still come out to play as needed.

But despite her extensive self-defense training, she found herself in a life-threatening scenario where her martial arts background wasn’t enough.

""Owning a firearm...was life changing for me because women for sure, but even men too can be in a very, very vulnerable position with no options if you have intruders or any scenario where you're being dominated physically,"" Carlson told FOX411. ""[A firearm] is the only equalizer you have.""

The 39-year-old revealed a person in her past began stalking her in 2012 and even hired people to break into her home and tap her phones. After several break-ins and being followed on the streets, she contacted law enforcement who were not sympathetic to her situation.

“Law enforcement, they didn’t take me seriously. probably because I’m an actor but also because my situation was a little crazy,” she admitted.

One good thing came out of the scary ordeal: Carlson met her husband Dan after hiring him to teach her counter-surveillance.

""I had learned self defense for many years but I just knew around that time I needed some help,"" she admitted. ""My attorney and I were interviewing some people that provide security but no one that we interviewed understood counter-surveillance."" Carlson ended up calling a friend on the East Coast who recommended someone who could help her.

""He recommended Dan, who is my husband now,"" she said. ""I mean, it's a happy ending because I lived through it but more so I did meet my husband. He couldn't have been a better trainer and he's such a good teacher and he didn't ever question my scenario.""

Carlson understands why a person may ""fear firearms,"" but she explains ""it's crucial for people to look at it from a logical standpoint and take the emotions out of it because one needs to have that option to save them.""

The actress believes she has the perfect platform to advocate for firearm use and safety not only because of her celebrity, but also because she has a family member who was murdered by firearm.

“I wanted to tell my story because it's unique where I’ve had a family member be murdered from a firearm and not for a second did anyone think in my family to champion stricter gun laws.”

The Minnesota-born model said that if her view on firearms has hurt her Hollywood career, she doesn’t care.

“It probably has and I don’t know it...I don’t care.” According to Carlson, “people think Hollywood is very anti-guns but California is huge and we have way more support than people think and I’d like people to know that...that was surprising to me and I was happy to know there’s such a huge [firearm] community and that you have a lot resources for safety training.”

Carlson tells her story on an episode of Outdoor Channel’s “NRA: All Access” airing on July 15. She decided to share her past experiences because she’s “a woman who has a little bit of a public platform.”

“If this happened to me, it's happened to millions of women. I have the responsibility to educate people about firearms and also share my story,” the 39-year-old said. “I'm not telling people to just go get [a firearm], they’re not for everybody. While my message is supportive, I also very much emphasize on training and safety because it is a dangerous weapon. It’s a lifestyle and it can save your life.”

A bill working its way to President Trump’s desk could change that, by allowing gun owners who are allowed to carry concealed guns in their home states to exercise the rights in any other state that does not prohibit concealed carry.

“Our Second Amendment right doesn’t disappear when we cross state lines,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said last month when he introduced a Senate bill that closely tracks one introduced in the House.

“Our Second Amendment right doesn’t disappear when we cross state lines.” - Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas

Cornyn’s Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 is aimed at allowing legal gun owners to carry concealed firearms “freely between states without worrying about conflicting state codes or onerous civil suits,” he said.

The National Rifle Association said confusing and conflicting state laws can ensnare law-abiding gun owners.

“The current patchwork of state and local gun laws is confusing and can cause the most conscientious and law-abiding gun owner to run afoul of the law when they are traveling or temporarily living away from home,” said Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA-ILA.

The proposed law would not supersede state laws or establish national standards for concealed carry, advocates assure. A companion bill in the House of Representatives was introduced by Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C.

Some 40 states already offer some form of reciprocity with other states.

Critics claim reciprocity laws will undercut states that believe public safety is linked to strict gun control.

“Reciprocity would have a profound impact on state public safety, making the state with the weakest standards into the law of the land, and letting criminals and other dangerous people carry concealed guns in every state in the country,” the gun control group Every Town for Gun Safety said in a statement."

Jason McLemore, 44, who owned McLemore Gun Shop, and his 17-year old son Jacob, were killed after a disagreement with two customers, Pearl River County Sheriff David Allison told the station. Both were pronounced dead at the scene.

Authorities say that Audy McCool, 52, and his son, Michael McCool, 29, went to the gun shop to pick up a weapon Saturday afternoon. The men were told the gun had not yet been repaired, and one of the men reportedly became angry that he had paid a $25 service charge but did not yet receive his firearm.

Jason McLemore’s wife reportedly witnessed the encounter, and called her husband and son in an effort to keep the incident from escalating.

""During this argument, we believe there might have been some pushing and shoving,"" Chief Deputy Shane Tucker said, the Sun Herald reported. ""One of the customers and one of the owners produced firearms. We don't know who shot first.""

Jason McLemore reportedly had an unholstered 9-mm. handgun by his side when he was shot.

Michael McCool is the alleged shooter, according to WLOX, which cited authorities, and is suspected of shooting both victims using a 40-caliber pistol. No charges have yet been filed.

According to WLOX, the elder McCool was found bleeding from a wound to his back when law enforcement authorities arrived, and the younger McCool was in the intensive care unit at a New Orleans hospital.

The shooting is still under investigation."
fox133,fox,[],2014-11-19 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/11/19/utah-issuing-thousands-concealed-carry-firearm-permits-to-people-from-other.html,"Tens of thousands of gun owners from around the country are taking advantage of Utah's concealed firearm permits each year — often taking a required class given by instructors licensed by Utah but who live in other states.

About two-thirds of the nearly 577,000 permits Utah has issued in the last two decades have gone to residents from other states. More than 81,000 out-of-staters obtained permits from Utah in fiscal year 2014, accounting for 80 percent of the cards issued, shows a new state report issued this week.

Utah's permit is attractive to out-of-state residents because it's recognized in 35 states and allows them to travel more widely with it, said Rep. Curt Oda, a Republican lawmaker from Clearfield and a concealed-carry permit instructor.

Utah ranks alongside Arizona and Florida as being the most popular for out-of-state permit seekers not because it's easy to get one, but because of the widespread acceptance around the country, said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun lobby.

The requirements are fairly simple: Anyone 21 or older who passes a criminal background check and takes a firearms course taught by an instructor certified by Utah can get the permit. Most of the 2,300 current instructors — 72 percent — don't live in Utah. Not all states allow classes to be taken from out-of-state instructors, adding another layer of simplicity for permit-seekers, Aposhian said.

Utah runs background checks on a nearly daily basis, and permits can be suspended or revoked if holders are convicted of crime that take away their eligibility, Aposhian said.

Illinois, Oregon, New York and California account for states with the most Utah-issued permits, state records show. That's likely because permits from those states aren't widely recognized, so gun owners get a second card from Utah for travel, Aposhian said. Because Utah's permit isn't recognized in those states, it's easier to get a Utah card because residents there don't have to first get a permit from their own state.

Utah is one of more than a dozen states that issue concealed-carry permits to residents of other states. Each state has its own rules for issuing the cards, and Utah's application process is not the weakest, said Allison Anderman, attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

For instance, Utah requires that people from states that recognize the permit get a concealed carry from their home state first and submit it with the Utah application. ""It's not like you can get denied in your home state and get a permit in Utah,"" Anderman said.

Utah issues cards to people around the country even if their home state doesn't recognize the permit, putting the burden on the card holder to know what each state law allows. Washington and Wisconsin are tops for permit holders among the states where the card is recognized.

""It makes no sense to us,"" said Gary Sackett, board member for the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah. ""It's not clear to us why we want to make it easy for people from other parts of the country when we have such a weak form of approval.""

Oda said Utah has the right idea in making the process less strenuous than other states. Other states often require live-firing as part of a permit course, while Utah only requires classroom time and familiarity with the basics of a gun, he said.

""Why should proficiency be a prerequisite to that right of defending yourself?"" Oda said. ""Just because they happen to live across the border, doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to defend themselves as well.""

Self-defense is ""passive"" and should not require training, Oda said.

Representatives from the Bureau of Criminal Identification presented the report to a Utah legislative committee on Wednesday. There were hardly any questions asked by lawmakers and minimal discussion. In Utah, the program is old news and hardly generates any backlash.

The total of 101,640 permits issued in the recently completed fiscal year is more than any year from 2004-2012. But it is fewer than in 2013, when nearly 134,000 permits were given out.

Applications cost $41 for Utah residents and $51 for non-residents. The permits last five years and cost $15 to renew.

During the record year of 2013, the permits brought in $2.3 million for the state. This year, however, the state lost $58,000 in administering the program. Part of that loss was caused by the cost of buying a new card-printing system, said Alice Moffat, chief of the Bureau of Criminal Identification.

Flanagan, who reported on-air under the name Bryce Williams, purchased the Glock 9 mm pistol in July from a federally licensed gun dealer in Virginia.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokesman Tom Faison told The Roanoke Times on Thursday that Flanagan said a background check was conducted on Flanagan before the purchase was finalized. The check didn’t reveal any of the criteria that would have prevented him from owning a gun, such as felony conviction or a history of court-ordered psychiatric treatment, the newspaper reported.

Faison said Flanagan purchased multiple guns but didn’t say how many guns he purchased. It’s unclear whether the gun Flanagan used to shoot himself was the same one used to kill WDBJ reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward and wound Smith Mountain Lake Chamber of Commerce leader Vicki Gardner. The Roanoke Times reports at least one of the guns was the same make and model as the one Virginia Tech school shooter Seung-Hui Cho used to murder 32 students in 2007 before killing himself, Faison said.

“He could be as mentally ill as the day is long,” Faison said, “but unless someone has been legally adjudicated as such, they can purchase a firearm.”

Flanagan, 41, was ordered by his bosses at the WDBJ station to seek help for his frequent problems with co-workers, according to a July 30, 2012 memo obtained by The Guardian.

""You are required to contact Health Advocate, the employee assistance program,"" the memo, from then-station director Dan Dennison, said. Flanagan was given four days to make the call. ""This is a mandatory referral requiring your compliance. Failure to comply will result in termination of employment.""

Flanagan apparently followed up with Health Advocate, since he wasn’t terminated from WDBJ until February 2013.

There are 19 different factors that could disqualify someone from buying a gun in Virginia. Convicted felons, people who have been committed to mental health programs, illegal drug users and illegal immigrants are among the criteria that would prevent someone from getting a gun, according to The Roanoke Times.

The Virginia State Police says about 405,000 checks were made last year and 2,661 attempted purchases were denied.

Lori Haas, state director for the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence told the newspaper she’s not aware of any background check system that could have prevented someone like Flanagan from purchasing a gun.

“Even the best background system in the world would not have prevented this shooting,” Andrew Goddard, legislative director of the Virginia Center for Public Safety, told The Roanoke Times.

Flanagan initially planned on getting away with the murders of Parker, 24, and Ward, 27. After shooting and killing himself in his getaway car, police who searched his vehicle found the Glock pistol with multiple magazines and ammunition, a white iPhone, letters, notes, a to-do list and a brief case that contained multiple license plates, a wig, shawl, umbrella, sunglasses and black hat, according to The Associated Press. Flanagan never used any of the disguises as he was tracked down by police on Interstate 66 around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.

A representative for Flanagan's family issued a statement on Thursday expressing ""condolences"" for the loved ones of the dead.

“It is with heavy hearts and deep sadness that we express our deepest condolences to the families of Alison Parker and Adam Ward,” the statement said. “We are also praying for the recovery of Vicky Gardner. Our thoughts and prayers at this time are with the victims’ families and the WDBJ7 NEWS family. Words cannot express the hurt that we feel for the victims. Our family is asking that the media respect our privacy.”

Biden made the recommendation during a Facebook chat on Tuesday, saying he has advised wife Jill to stand on the deck of their rustic home and fire the family's double-barreled shotgun in the air, should she sense an intruder.

“It was poor advice, and it comes off a little sexist,” Kate Ernest, the woman who got the advice, told Fox News Channel on Friday.

Said Biden: “You don’t need an AR-15 — it’s harder to aim, it’s harder to use. You don’t need 30 rounds to protect yourself. Buy a shotgun.”

Biden used the social media event to garner public support for President Obama’s attempt to tighten federal guns laws, following a series of mass shootings.

Among the recommendations are to ban assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

Ernest purportedly has a small cache of firearms that includes an AR-15. She said a double-barrel shotgun holds only two shells, which would make a shooter a “sitting duck” and that he or she might easily fumble while reloading should somebody be attacking them.

Ernest said Biden’s advice also sounded like: “Let me tell you what you need versus arm yourself and protect yourself with what is necessary.”"

Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City was examined at a hospital for unknown injuries.

""I think there's those people who would say, 'You know what, I wish you'd killed him,'"" Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner said at a news conference Friday evening. ""Now, that's not who we are. We are not him. We did our job.""

Marquez, 34, and a woman also taken into custody were questioned by investigators about their motives late Friday night, said Sacramento County sheriff's Sgt. Lisa Bowman said.

It wasn't immediately clear when they would be formally booked.

More On This... Sacramento deputy dead

The deadly chain of events began around 10:30 a.m. when Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range as he checked out a suspicious car in a Motel 6 parking lot, authorities said.

Oliver, 47, was the first county deputy killed since 2008. The 15-year veteran left a wife and two daughters.

""He was not able to return fire or do anything"" but his partner was able to shoot back, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones said.

The car, which had a man and woman inside, then drove about a mile and the couple tried to carjack a driver and shot him in the head when he refused to give up his keys, authorities said.

Anthony Holmes, 38, of Sacramento, was listed in serious condition at a hospital Friday night, the Sacramento Bee reported

The attackers then stole another car and finally took a red Ford pickup from Jose Cruz, who was gardening outside a client's house in Sacramento.

Cruz told the Bee that a man in a white Ford Mustang convertible told him: ""I need a favor.""

""What's the favor?"" Cruz asked.

""Your keys,"" the man said. ""Hurry up, because they're chasing me...I don't want to hurt you.""

Cruz said the man pointed a gun at him and had a bloody shirt wrapped around his other arm.

The couple then fled to neighboring Placer County, about 30 miles north of Sacramento, authorities said.

In Auburn, the truck briefly pulled over to the side of a road and two Placer County deputies spotted it and approached.

The gunman shot them with an AR-15-type assault weapon, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said.

Homicide Detective Michael David Davis Jr., 42, died at a hospital - 26 years to the day after his father, for whom he was named, died in the line of duty as a Riverside County deputy sheriff in Southern California.

Davis was a 15-year veteran of the department and a father of four.

The wounded deputy, Jeff Davis, is a 17-year veteran who was shot in the arm. He was released after treatment at a hospital.

""This guy was on a one-man crime spree today. He has no idea of the damage he did,"" Erwin said.

Dozens of deputies flooded the area but the gunman fled into a neighborhood near a high school and ran into a home.

Police finally used tear gas to flush Marquez from the basement of the home, witnesses said.

The long manhunt involved hundreds of officers from multiple agencies backed by search dogs, helicopters and armored vehicles. Residents nearby were told to stay indoors, and schools were locked down during the search.

Flags at the state Capitol were ordered flown at half-staff and Gov. Jerry Brown issued a statement extending his sympathy to the families of the slain officers.

Their ""brutal murders,"" Brown said, ""...are a tragic reminder of the sacrifices we demand of our peace officers and the incredible courage they display as they protect our communities.""

The slaying of the deputies was the single deadliest day for California law enforcement since February 2013. In separate incidents that month, former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner killed two law enforcement officers, and two Santa Cruz police detectives were shot and killed."

The Chicago Tribune reports (http://trib.in/29jQ9lo ) Second Amendment Sports in McHenry, Illinois, called off the raffle following questions about whether it would be legal. Under Illinois law, only nonprofit groups may hold raffles.

Bert Irslinger Jr. and his father own the shooting range and gun store. They were selling $5 tickets to win an AR-15 rifle similar to the weapon a gunman used to open fire in a gay nightclub June 12, leaving 49 people dead and 53 injured.

Irslinger says employees have received death threats since the Tribune first reported the raffle.

He says they may partner with a nonprofit organization to conduct the raffle in the future.

A number of armed American citizens have also used their firearms to stop or limit mass killings.

The former National Rifle Association instructor who lives next door to the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring, Texas, grabbed his AR-15-style rifle after hearing the gunfire and went over to investigate. Confronting the shooter, Devin Kelley, Willeford shot him in the leg and torso before Kelley dropped his weapon and fled the scene in his SUV.

As horrific as Kelley’s rampage was, it could have been much worse if it wasn’t for Stephen Willeford.

“I thank my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done,” Willeford told local media on Monday. “I just wish I could have gotten there faster.”

Willeford has quickly become an example for pro-gun advocates to point to when defending their argument that the best defense against mass shooting is a better-armed and better-trained civilian populace that is ready to defend itself, anytime and anywhere.

But – while not as common compared to the overall number of mass shootings in the U.S. – Willeford is certainly not the first “good guy with a gun” to stop a mass shooter’s killing spree in recent years.

Experts may disagree on how the number of mass shootings stopped by civilians is counted. Do off-duty police officers count as civilians? What about military members? And how many people need to be killed or injured for it to be considered a mass shooting? But there are a number of incidents over the last 20 years where an armed bystander helped prevent further tragedy.

Here are a few examples of such incidents:

-- In 1997, the assistant principal of Mississippi’s Pearl High School, Joel Myrick, used the .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol he kept in his truck to detain 16-year-old Luke Woodham after the teenager stabbed and bludgeoned to death his mother at home and killed two students and injured seven at the high school.

-- A decade later, in 2007, Matthew Murray killed four people at Colorado Spring church before being shot by church member and volunteer security guard Jeanne Assam.

-- Last April, an Uber driver with a concealed-carry permit shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people in Chicago’s Logan Square.

-- This September, an usher at a Tennessee church used his personal firearm to subdue a masked gunman who had already killed one woman in the church’s parking lot and injured six others inside.

Gun-rights advocates say that not only do these gun-carrying civilians prove that an armed populace can help mitigate the death toll of a mass shooter, but could also prevent mass shootings as a whole from happening.

“These killers all say they target places where people normally don’t carry guns,” John Lott, the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, said. “So concealed-carry acts as a deterrent to these killers and would also stop these shootings from being much worse.”

Those in favor of limiting access to firearms, however, argue that many of these mass shooters should not have had access to a gun in the first place – given some of their criminal and mental health records – and that the “good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun” argument is unsupported by facts or research.

“If having more guns in society worked to deter shootings, then America would have the lowest rate of gun violence of any developed country,” Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign, said in a statement provided to Fox News. “Put simply, the myth that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun is unsupported by facts or research. The killer in this mass shooting should never have had access to a gun in the first place, given his criminal record.”

James Jacobs, a professor at New York University’s School of Law who has written extensively about gun laws in the U.S., said that there are flaws in the arguments of both supporters and opponents of gun control – noting that there are already thousands of guns in the country that are unaccounted for and those could easily end up in the hands of someone who wanted to commit mass murder.

“I’m skeptical on the ability to clamp down on guns. That horse has already left the stable,” Jacobs said. “Most people who are highly dangerous don’t go to a legal gun dealer. They go on the internet or the black market or just get someone else to buy a gun for them.”

Jacobs added that instead of having one law governing firearms on a national – or even state – level, whether or not civilians should be able to carry a gun in public should come down to individual counties or even communities.

“There is not a one-size fits all solution to this issue,” he said. “What works in Alaska or rural Wyoming will not work in cities like Chicago or Detroit.”

EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story indicated Willeford used an AK-47. He has said it was an AR-15-style rifle."

As promised, President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation, targeting the top-selling rifle in the country, the AR-15 style semi-automatic, with a ban on one of the most-used AR bullets by sportsmen and target shooters.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this month revealed that it is proposing to put the ban on 5.56mm ammo on a fast track, immediately driving up the price of the bullets and prompting retailers, including the huge outdoors company Cabela’s, to urge sportsmen to urge Congress to stop the president.

Wednesday night, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, stepped in with a critical letter to the bureau demanding it explain the surprise and abrupt bullet ban.

Authorities say Zachary Peters was home alone when he shot Maxwell Cook, Jacob Redfern and Jakob Woodruff with an AR-15 rifle on March 27 at his home just outside the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow.

""It is the opinion of this office that Zachary Peters acted justifiably ... when he used deadly force to defend his home,"" said Wagoner County Assistant District Attorney Jack Thorp. ""It was clear he operated completely within the law when he used deadly force,"" Thorp later told The Associated Press.

The spellings of the names and the ages of the teens differ in some public records, but Wagoner County Deputy Nick Mahoney said the latest information is that Cook and Redfern were 18 and Woodruff was 15.

Wagoner County Sheriff Chris Elliott said he supports the decision not to charge Peters.

""We support the right of our citizens, the right to bear arms and to defend their homes,"" Elliott said. ""In this such case, we feel strongly that's what took place here.""

Oklahoma is one of 24 states which have laws allowing citizens to shoot someone if they believe the person threatens their safety, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

However, an Oklahoma City pharmacist was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2009 fatal shooting of a 16-year-old robber inside the pharmacy. Prosecutors said the teenager was left unconscious by one shot from the pharmacist, who then chased another robber outside the store before returning inside, picking up a second gun and shooting the still unconscious teen several more times.

Thorp also said Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, 21, of Oologah, was charged Monday with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of burglary in the case and is jailed without bond. Oklahoma law allows a person to be charged with murder if they take part in a crime in which people are killed, even if the person does not take part in the slaying.

Court records do not list an attorney for Rodriguez, but she has acknowledged driving the three to the home and waiting in a vehicle outside, and said while she understands Peters was protecting his home, she believes he could have shot the three in the legs.

""I won't take responsibility for the murders, I won't. I feel guilty, but I don't feel responsible,"" Rodriguez said in an interview last week with ABC's ""World News Tonight with David Muir.""

Elliott said the three were wearing masks, hoodies and gloves and that brass knuckles and a knife were found among their possessions.

Elliott said the group had gone to the property earlier the same day and stole liquor and electronic equipment from a garage apartment, then returned to steal more items.

""We do know at this time that Rodriquez had some indirect knowledge of the Peters' home and she believed there were expensive items inside the house,"" Elliott said, while declining to elaborate.

Rodriguez has said another person was with her outside the home, but would not identify the person.

Mahoney said investigators have found and questioned that person, but have made no arrest."
fox143,fox,['Perry Chiaramonte'],2015-03-30 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/03/30/powerful-3d-printed-rifle-fires-nato-rounds.html,"A group of gunsmiths just 3D printed a bigger, better caliber rifle.

PrintedFirearm.com , a website devoted to 3D printing of guns, announced that one of its members successfully developed a lower receiver for a Colt CM901 rifle. The receiver for the CM901—which is considered to be a much stronger brother of the popular AR-15 assault rifle—was crafted on a XYZ Da Vinci printer, which normally costs around $500 - considered cheap in the 3D printer world. While they were not the first to 3D print a lower receiver, it seems as if Printed Firearm has taken an evolutionary step.

“This is the FIRST EVER 3d Printed AR-10 (CM901/LE901) lower receiver by JT,” reads a blog post on PrintedFirearm.com. “OH YES WE DID!!!!!!! Yes people its pure awesome sauce and it has been tested, fired with little to no issues.”

The CM901 has a similar design to the AR-15 but can fire a heavier and more powerful 7.62 millimeter round, which results in higher range and stopping power. The standard NATO rifle cartridge has a 7.62 mm diameter and a 51 mm case length.

“Is it as strong as metal, no, is it as strong as wood, probably not, is it strong enough to work, yes and it has proven just that.” - PrintedFirearm.com blogger who asked that his name be withheld

The rifle is also a modular weapons system, which allows for multiple modifications, so it is also capable of firing lighter 5.56-millimeter rounds as well.

Printed Firearm posted a five-second GIF of the lower receiver in action at a firing range. Like most 3D printed objects, the part is made from a plastic-like filament so it is not clear how many shots could be fired before it breaks or becomes damaged.

“This receiver is durable enough to work,” The Author of Printed Firearm’s blog, who asked that his name be withheld, told FoxNews.com. “The reality is the lower receiver in an AR style weapon does not need to be that strong.

Expand / Contract Schematics for the lower receiver. (printedfirearm.com)

“Is it as strong as metal, no, is it as strong as wood, probably not, is it strong enough to work, yes and it has proven just that.”

The blogger adds that the creator of the part claims to have fired over 100 rounds of ammunition without any issues of visible wear and tear.

Blueprints for parts like a lower receiver for the AR-15, have been available on the web to download for several years but this is the first instance where it has been drafted with an affordable printer and has raised the question among some in the community that an affordable rifle — from barrel to stock — will eventually be as simple as hitting the print button.

Others say it will be a long while before that is a reality.

“It’s good for the narrative for the improvements in 3D printing,” Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed, another group that made what was considered the first working 3D printed handgun back in 2013, told FoxNews.Com “But it’s going to be a long time before a rifle can be made on an affordable 3D printer.”

Makeshift gunsmiths have focused mostly on printing lower receivers because it is the only part of the rifle that has federal regulations. Every other part, such as the barrel or the handgrip can be purchased without any sort of permit.

Under current law, there are no federal restrictions on making a gun for personal use - so long as it is under the parameters of both the Gun Control Act and the National Firearms Act.

Officials for the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco,Firearms and Explosives told FoxNews.com that they are monitoring developments in 3D printing technology.

“[The] ATF routinely collaborates with the firearms industry and law enforcement to monitor new technologies and current manufacturing trends that could potentially impact the safety of the public,” Dannette Seward, a spokeswoman for the ATF said in a written statement.

Printed Firearm says that the reaction of this latest lower receiver and the low cost will increase the number of hobbyists but would do little in terms of advancing technology.

“At $500 it is something a hobbyist like myself can potentially own,” The blogger said. “The reality is most of us involved in this area of technology are doing it simply to understand what is possible.

“If one wanted to create a stronger, more reliable, item 3D printing would not likely be the best tool to use.”

Gabrielle Giffords, after Kelly said he had intended the purchase to make a political point about how easy it is to obtain the kind of firearms he's lobbying Congress to ban.

Kelly's March 5 purchase of an AR-15-style rifle and a 45.-caliber handgun at Diamondback Police Supply sparked a frenzy of reaction from both sides of the debate after he posted to Facebook a photo of himself shopping.

A background check took only a matter of minutes to complete, Kelly said in the Facebook post, adding that it's scary to think people can buy similar guns without background checks at gun shows or on the Internet.

But Kelly couldn't immediately take possession of the rifle because the shop had bought it from a customer. As a result, the store is required by a Tucson ordinance to hold the gun for 20 days to give the city enough time to make sure the weapon wasn't used in a crime.

Store owner Doug MacKinlay said Monday in a Facebook post of his own that he ""determined that was in my company's best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store.""

""While I support and respect Mark Kelly's 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use,"" MacKinlay said in the statement.

He added that the store will return Kelly's money, donate the rifle to the Arizona Tactical Officers Association to be raffled as a fundraiser and make an additional contribution of $1,295 -- the value of the rifle -- to the Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program.

Kelly's purchase of the guns sparked accusations of hypocrisy from gun-rights supporters, with many on Facebook focusing on his motivations and the rules for purchasing such guns. Kelly, a former astronaut, said he intended to eventually hand in the rifle to Tucson police but planned to keep the handgun.

Kelly and Giffords started a gun control advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, amid the wave of recent mass shootings. They have been touring the country in recent months in support of expanded background checks for gun purchases.

Kelly bought the guns at a Tucson shop the day before he appeared with his wife at the supermarket where she was wounded during a shooting rampage that left six dead and 12 others injured two years ago. Giffords resigned from Congress last year as she continues to recover from her injuries.

fox145,fox,[],2017-10-24 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/24/north-koreas-perfect-weapon.html,"North Korea is capable of unleashing a chaotic attack on Australia or the United States without launching a single missile.

Instead the secretive nation could potentially unleash chaos with a cyber attack targeting critical infrastructure such as an electricity grid.

That’s according to Dr Greg Austin, a professor in the Australian Centre for Cyber Security at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, who said North Korea’s cyber capabilities could have a big impact.

He said the possibility of Pyongyang shutting down Sydney’s electricity grid through cyber power remained highly unlikely but protecting key infrastructure against such an attack was something the government should be prepared for.

Dr Austin stressed North Korea didn’t have the technology to launch a sustained cyber war against our critical infrastructure.

“If North Korea decided to launch an attack against Australia, it could shut down the Sydney power grid for a couple of days, but that’s about it,” he said.

“This remains highly unlikely, but for the same reason we have 12 submarines in the event that we go to war, the government must also plan to protect key infrastructure.”

His comments come as aNew York Times editorial describes hacking as “the perfect weapon for a small, impoverished, isolated, totalitarian state”.

While the world is concerned over North Korea’s missile program, the editorial highlighted that if Kim Jon-un actually used them it would mean the end of his country.

Instead Kim could target his enemies in cyberspace often without fear of reprisal.

“Cyber weapons, by contrast, offer a degree of stealth and deniability and a broad range of uses,” the Times editorial read.

“Mr Kim’s total control over his country gives him his pick of the best young brains to train as hackers; the cost is relatively low, and effective retaliation has so far proved very difficult.”

North Korea has used it for digital bank robberies, score settling and even assaults including the WannaCry ransomware attack, it noted.

Such attacks could also be carried at low cost and without the possibility of sanctions with many taking place outside of North Korea’s borders.

“North Korea represents a different sort of threat, more akin to terrorist networks, which are less susceptible to counter-attacks and sanctions that might deter a conventional government,” it said.

Dr Austin said North Korea didn’t possess the technology or resources for a sustained cyber attack.

“It’s important not to overplay North Korea’s cyber power,” Dr Austin said. “The relationship between a country’s ability to create a cyber weapon and execute cyber power is a complex one.”

UNIT 180

If North Korea does launch such an attack, chances are it stems from the secretive unit known as 180.

The unit, which forms part of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) and its main overseas intelligence agency, and was widely blamed as being behind the WannaCry attack which affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries in May this year.

Speaking after delivering the seminar Korea’s Cyber War Vortex in Canberra, Dr Austin said Unit 180 was just one number given to the North Korean spy agency’s cyber cell.

He said Pyongyang knew it couldn’t get into a direct war with the West, yet it could attack via a series of smaller wars.

Trump was restating a long-standing U.S. position but suggested that China now concurred with Washington that a ""freeze-for-freeze"" agreement was unacceptable.

China and Russia have proposed that as a way to restart long-stalled negotiations: that the North could freeze its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for the U.S. and its close ally South Korea stopping regular military drills that Pyongyang considers as preparation for invasion.

China has not made a public disavowal of the proposal. China said Wednesday that it would send a high-level special envoy to North Korea amid an extended chill in relations between the neighbors.

Trump was speaking a day after he returned from a 12-day trip through Asia that included a state visit to China, where he was hosted by President Xi Jinping.

""President Xi recognizes that a nuclear North Korea is a grave threat to China, and we agreed that we would not accept a so-called freeze for freeze agreement, like those that have consistently failed in the past,"" Trump said.

He said that Xi pledged to implement U.N. sanctions that aim to deprive North Korea of revenues for its weapons programs ""and to use his great economic influence over the regime to achieve our common goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.""

China is North Korea's traditional ally and accounts for about 90 percent of the isolated nation's external trade — including virtually all its oil supplies.

Speaking at the White House, Trump cast his Asian sojourn as a ""tremendous success,"" saying the United States was feted by foreign leaders and asserted its strength in the world.

""America's renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now,"" Trump said, detailing his stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump said he had three goals on the trip: to unite the world against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, to strengthen alliances in the region and to insist on ""fair and reciprocal trade.""

Trump pledged to work ""as fast as possible"" to eliminate sizable trade deficits with U.S. trading partners. He said it was ""unacceptable"" that the U.S. trade deficit with other nations stands at about $800 billion a year and promised to ""start whittling that down as fast as possible."" He did not say how he planned to achieve that goal.

Earlier, Trump used social media to spar with media coverage of his trip.

He tweeted criticism at The New York Times. He said the paper ""hates"" that he has good relationships with world leaders and ""they should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing."" He called the paper ""naive (or dumb)"" on foreign policy.

The president also tweeted Wednesday that he was ""forced"" to watch CNN during the trip and ""again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is.""

While North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un has a reputation for bizarre behavior, the nuclear arsenal and aspirations of the Republic are being taken seriously.

North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the past 11 years, the last several being the most destructive – and now they are threatening a sixth.

North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper also said in a front-page editorial that its military is prepared ""to bring to closure the history of U.S. scheming and nuclear blackmail.”

The editorial said, ""There is no limit to the strike power of the People's Army armed with our style of cutting-edge military equipment including various precision and miniaturized nuclear weapons and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.”

It is that miniaturized nuclear weapon that is the biggest concern to the United States, and the rest of the world.

“They have expressed the intent to [miniaturize a nuclear weapon],” Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News. “It raises the stakes and increases the risk of missile threats to the region and the U.S. homeland.”

North Korea would need that smaller nuclear weapon to deliver it long-distance. According to the New York Times, “As Dr. [Siegfried] Hecker, a man who has built his share of nuclear weapons, noted last week, any weapon that could travel that far would have to be 'smaller, lighter and surmount the additional difficulties of the stresses and temperatures' of a fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. By most estimates, that is four or five years away. Then again, many senior officials said the same four or five years ago.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats are expected to update senators on the North Korea situation Wednesday afternoon.

President Trump told a meeting of United Nations Security Council ambassadors on Monday they must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korea. “This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,” Trump said.

Obtaining reliable intelligence on North Korea has always been difficult. Kim Jong-un rules the country with an iron fist. The nation is so cut off from the world that is has been dubbed the ‘hermit kingdom.’

In March of last year, North Korea released photographs of Kim Jong-un inspecting what appears to be a miniaturized implosion device, but that photo op was met with skepticism. “No reason to believe that is true, or to disbelieve it. No reason to dismiss it or to panic,” Karako said. He added, “I think that our insight into these programs is relatively modest. I think the posture of our military is to assume the worst.”

This has the U.S., and the world, on high alert. The Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, published an editorial on Tuesday stating, “The game of chicken between Washington and Pyongyang has come to a breaking point. If North Korea carries out a sixth nuclear test as expected, it is more likely than ever that the situation will cross the point of no return.”"

The Latest on the situation in Syria (all times local):

2:35 p.m.

The global chemical weapons watchdog says it is investigating recent allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said its fact-finding mission is ""investigating all credible allegations"" and reporting its findings to the organization's member states.

The mission, however, does not have a mandate to apportion blame for chemical attacks in Syria.

Earlier Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told BFM TV that ""all indications show us today that the Syrian regime is using chlorine gas at the moment"" in attacks on rebel-held areas.

On Tuesday, a U.N.-mandated investigator said his team was probing reports that bombs allegedly containing weaponized chlorine have been used on two recent occasions in Syria

France says the Syrian government is likely using chlorine gas in its latest attacks on rebel-held areas.

Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told BFM TV on Wednesday that ""all indications show us today that the Syrian regime is using chlorine gas at the moment.""

The government and its ally Russia have been pounding a besieged rebel-held area outside Damascus for the last two days with airstrikes, killing dozens of people.

A U.N.-mandated investigator said Tuesday his team was probing reports that bombs allegedly containing weaponized chlorine have been used on two recent occasions in Syria.

""An investigation has been opened on that matter by the United Nations,"" Le Drian said. ""The threat of using chemical weapons remains, this is a very serious situation."""
fox149,fox,['Cody Derespina'],2016-02-03 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/02/03/pentagons-secret-weapon-maker.html,"A department deep inside the Pentagon that officials “don’t often talk about” is churning out 3D-printed micro drones, self-driving boats and an electromagnetic railgun that can shoot a projectile at 4,500 mph – all in the name of combatting the growing global threat from Russia and China.

Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Tuesday unveiled some of the latest contraptions developed by the Strategic Capabilities Office during a preview of the DoD’s budget proposal. Carter, who created the SCO in 2012 when he was deputy secretary, described the department’s aim as reimagining existing fighting systems “by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.”

The man currently responsible for doing the confounding is an Oxford-trained physicist who admitted to “reciting digits of pi when waiting in line,” according to a 2002 profile after he was named a Rhodes Scholar.

SCO Director William Roper said then that he knew 1,000 digits of the unending strain.

“But I don’t wait in lines that long,” he said.

Roper’s resume reads like character backstory from “The Big Bang Theory.” He graduated summa cum laude from Georgia Tech with a master’s degree in physics and earned a doctorate in mathematics at Oxford. He was a Rhodes Scholar, Truman Scholar and received a presidential commendation for founding and directing a tutoring program that served 400 Georgia schools.

Roper started at the Missile Defense Agency in August 2009 and by May 2010 he was the agency’s chief architect. He won an award for Contractor of the Year, a Technology Award for unmanned airborne systems and an Innovation Award for European Phased Adaptive Approach. As the SCO's director since August 2012, he has added another Innovation Award and an Award for Excellence.

Oh, and Roper is a published poet and essayist, second-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and has performed in a chamber choir.

At SCO, however, the renaissance man leads a crew developing systems that sound straight out of a science fiction flick, such as the “swarming” micro drones that can either “fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9” or be “thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert,” according to Carter.

“And for the water, they’ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk,” he said.

Carter’s comments could have been aimed at numerous U.S. antagonists. For one, Iran captured 10 Navy sailors last month when their boats drifted too near to Farsi Island. They were released after a day, but not before being videotaped kneeling with their hands on their heads and apologizing. Another future consideration could be the wariness with which the U.S. is viewing China’s construction of an artificial island in the South China Sea. Sending unmanned ships near the mass could be a safer method to monitor its development.

The railgun also is being viewed as an answer for “gun-based missile defense,” Carter said. The hypervelocity railgun projectiles would be fitted onto guns already in the Navy’s inventory.

SCO has “grown from this little hobby shop into this major defense organization,” a source familiar with the organization told USNI News. “They have money and can spend it without a lot of red tape.”"

The KCNA news agency said glitches detected in an earlier test have been ""perfectly overcome,"" paving the way for the weapon to be mass produced and deployed nationwide, according to SkyNews.

State media reported the new weapon system is designed to ""detect and strike different targets flying from any location.""

The latest test was attended by Kim Jong Un, in addition to three men believed to be the top officials in the reclusive country's missile program.

The three men were identified by Reuters as Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of the Academy of National Defense Science, a weapons development and procurement center.

North Korean state media said the weapons system would stop hostile nations ""boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty.""

On Friday, officials said the Pentagon will try to shoot down an intercontinental-range missile for the first time in a test this week. The goal is to more closely simulate a North Korean ICBM aimed at the U.S. homeland, officials said.

North Korea is now the focus of U.S. efforts because its leader has vowed to field a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching American territory. He has yet to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, but Pentagon officials believe he is speeding in that direction.

Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said last week that ""left unchecked,"" Kim will eventually succeed.

The Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, which is responsible for developing and testing the system, has scheduled the intercept test for Tuesday.

An interceptor is to be launched from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and soar toward the target, which will be fired from a test range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. If all goes as planned, the ""kill vehicle"" will slam into the ICBM-like target's mock warhead high over the Pacific Ocean.

The target will be a custom-made missile meant to simulate an ICBM, meaning it will fly faster than missiles used in previous intercept tests, according to Christopher Johnson, spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency. The target is not a mock-up of an actual North Korean ICBM.

""We conduct increasingly complex test scenarios as the program matures and advances,"" Johnson said Friday. ""Testing against an ICBM-type threat is the next step in that process.""

The program included a feature nicknamed ""Greyball"" internally that identified regulators who were posing as riders while trying to collect evidence that Uber’s service was breaking local laws governing taxis.

To stymie those efforts, Uber served up a fake version of its app to make it appear the undercover regulators were summoning a car, only to have the ride canceled. The San Francisco company mined the data that it collects through its real app to pinpoint the undercover agents.

The New York Times revealed Greyball's existence in a story published Friday based on information provided by four current and former Uber employees who were not named.

Uber acknowledged it has used Greyball to counter regulators working with the company's opponents to entrap its drivers.

Greyball is part of a broader program called VTOS, shorthand for ""violations of terms of service,"" that Uber says it developed to protect its service.

""This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service — whether that's people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret 'stings' meant to entrap drivers,"" Uber said.

Although Uber is becoming more widely accepted than in its early years, the company says it still uses Greyball as a tool in some cities that it declined to identify.

The Times reported that Uber has targeted regulators in Boston, Paris and Las Vegas, among other cities, as well as a litany of countries that include Australia, China, Italy and South Korea.

The cat-and-mouse game with regulators is the latest example of the aggressive tactics that Uber has adopted while upending the heavily regulated taxi industry. In doing so, Uber has built a rapidly growing company valued at more than $60 billion by its investors that is frequently accused of bending the rules.

Among other things, the company has faced lawsuits for classifying its drivers as independent contractors to save money and allegedly stealing the technology for a fleet of autonomous cars that it is currently testing. In the past two weeks, a former female engineer alleged Uber routinely ignores claims of sexual harassment and a video surfaced of CEO Travis Kalanick profanely berating a driver who confronted him about steep cuts in its rates for a premium version of its service.

Uber’s rise also has raised tensions in cities that have sometimes gone to extreme measures to crack down on a service that they contended was operating without the proper permits. In Las Vegas, local taxi regulators confronted an Uber driver while wearing ski masks. And in Florida, Hillsborough regulators coordinated with taxi and limousine companies on an undercover operation that lured out Uber drivers so they could be assessed $700 fines."

He suffered gunshot wounds to his elbow and shoulder and was taken to the hospital when South Korean soldiers found him about 25 minutes later on the southern side of the Joint Security Area, a strip of land where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face, the military said, according to the South’s Yonhap News Agency.

""He crossed from a North Korea post towards our [South Korean] Freedom House,” the South said in a statement.

It’s unclear what the soldier’s conditions are or why he decided to defect to the South. The South Korean military said he was unarmed and was wearing a combat uniform for a law ranking soldier.

South Korean military said there was no armed conflict after the incident, but they are “increasing alertness” for a possible provocation from North Korea.

""Currently, there are no unusual signs in the North Korean military, but we are increasing alertness against the possibility of North Korean provocations,"" officials told Yonhap News Agency.

About 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the Korean War, but most travel through China. An estimated 1,000 people flee Kim Jong Un’s volatile regime each year, but going through the DMZ — fortified with land mines, barbed wires and machine guns — have been extremely rare because of the dangerous conditions. This year, North Korean defectors successfully escaping the regime fell by 12.7 percent, according to the Telegraph.

The soldier’s successful escape makes only the fourth defection by a North Korean soldier through the DMZ in the last three years, the BBC reported. Yonhap News agency said Kim’s military officials reportedly “cherry-pick” loyal soldiers who are stationed at the DMZ.

At Panmunjom, once an obscure farming village inside the 2 1/2-mile-wide DMZ that separating the rivaling countries, North Korean soldiers wearing lapel pins with the images of late North Korean leaders often use binoculars to monitor visitors from the South. They stand only several yards away from tall South Korean soldiers wearing aviator sunglasses and standing motionless like statues.

Panmunjomis where an armistice was signed to pause the Korean War. Jointly controlled by the American-led U.N. Command and North Korea, the DMZ is guarded on both sides by hundreds of thousands of combat-ready troops, razor-wire fences and tank traps. More than a million mines are believed to be buried inside the zone.

The defection came during escalated tensions between the North and the South and nearly a week after President Trump visited Seoul for his five-country Asia tour. American presidents often visit Panmunjom and other DMZ areas during their trips to South Korea to reaffirm their security commitment to the South. Trump planned to visit the DMZ to underscore his stance against North Korea's nuclear program when he came to South Korea last week as part of an Asian tour, but his plans were thwarted by heavy fog that prevented his helicopter from landing at the border area.

Areas around Panmunjom were the site of bloodshed and defection attempts by North Koreans in the past, but there have been no such incidents in recent years.

The most famous incident was in 1976, when two American army officers were killed by ax-wielding North Korean soldiers. The attack prompted Washington to fly nuclear-capable B-52 bombers toward the DMZ in an attempt to intimidate North Korea.

In 1984, North Korean and U.N. Command soldiers traded gunfire after a Soviet citizen defected by sprinting to the South Korean sector of the truce village. The incident left three North Korean soldiers and one South Korean soldier dead. In 1998, a North Korean solider fled to South Korea via Panmunjom.

Rosemary Billquist, a 43-year-old hospital worker, hospice volunteer and marathoner, was killed Thanksgiving eve while walking her two yellow Labradors, Stella and Sugar, behind her home in the town of Sherman about 5:30 p.m., under an already dark early evening sky.

Hunter Thomas Jadlowski told police he fired a single round from his hunting pistol at what he thought was a deer the length of two football fields away. He heard Billquist cry out, ran to her and called 911. Jadlowski was applying pressure to Billquist's wound when first responders arrived in the field.

Billquist's husband, Jamie Billquist, told reporters he was inside his house when the barking of his dogs, who had come home on their own, stirred the first signs of dread.

He rode with his wife in an ambulance to a hospital 30 miles (48 kilometers) away in Erie, Pennsylvania, where she died.

""She was like an angel,"" Jamie Billquist told WIVB-TV. ""She would help anybody and do anything you know for anybody before she would do anything for herself.""

The rifle hunting season was not yet a week old when investigators from the state Department of Environmental Conservation and Chautauqua County Sheriff began investigating the death. One key factor is timing, since the shooting happened about 40 minutes after sunset.

It is illegal to hunt big game after sunset or before dawn in New York state.

Chautauqua County District Attorney Patrick Swanson said his office would ask a grand jury to consider charges of criminally negligent homicide or reckless conduct that resulted in Billquist's death. Either felony charge could result in several years in prison.

""Two lives were lost at that moment,"" Sheriff Joseph Gerace said.

Jadlowski could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A telephone listing was not in service.

The sheriff said it is not uncommon, nor illegal, for hunters to use the type of higher-power pistol Jadlowski had. Some of the weapons are holdovers from before rifle hunting of deer and bear became legal in the county in 2011, he said. He described the gun as ""like a rifle without a stock.""

While noting the majority of hunters are responsible, Gerace said he and neighboring counties in the rural westernmost corner of the state see their share of hunting incidents.

Two days after Billquist's death, Gerace's office charged an Ohio man with reckless endangerment for opening fire on a brown pick-up truck he believed was a deer. One round from a high-powered rifle struck the truck but missed its two occupants.

""Occasionally we have people use horrible judgment and negligence and it ends up in tragedy,"" the sheriff said.

In the days since Billquist's death, her husband and others have recalled acts of kindness they said were typical, recounting for reporters how she brought pets to hospice patients and placed a bench outside a local hospital where she worked after seeing a man laboring to stand. She stenciled on it: ""In a world where you can be anything, be kind.""

A funeral was scheduled for Wednesday at Sherman Community Church, following a wake Tuesday.

At a vigil on Thanksgiving, dozens of neighbors left their homes to sing ""Amazing Grace"" at a vigil.

""She could've really made a difference in a lot more people's lives,"" Jamie Billquist said. ""In just the short time she was here, obviously she touched a lot of lives."""

After several assault rifle development-dominated years, companies large and small have unveiled a more balanced spectrum of new options for the upcoming year at the 2018 SHOT Show.

From better fits for young hunters to enhanced power for big game, outdoorsmen will have a wide crop of exciting new rifles with different focuses and features to choose from.

Here are six of these new options from Weatherby, Mossberg, Winchester, Browning, Savage and Wilson Combat.

Weatherby - Mark V CarbonMark

Family-run Weatherby is one of the younger companies in the field, but the Mark V’s extraordinary craftsmanship and performance immediately made it a family heirloom that has already passed from generation to generation during the past six decades or so.

This year, Weatherby has enhanced this Mark V classic with some high-tech additions. The carbon fiber-wrapped barrel made by Proof Research is designed to provide supreme accuracy, reduce weight by a remarkable 64 percent to comparable steel barrels, and dissipate heat faster than all-steel barrels.

The nine-lug magnum action and signature LXX trigger are two more key advantages on the hunt with the 7.75-pound Mark V CarbonMark. With Weatherby or premium factory ammo, these rifles are guaranteed to shoot .99-inch or less 3-shot groups at 100 yards.

The suggested retail price for this American beauty is $4,100.

THE BEST GIFTS FOR CAMPERS, HIKERS AND OUTDOORSY TYPES

Mossberg - Patriot Synthetic Cerakote

For rugged durability and lightweight accuracy, the new bolt-action Mossberg Patriot Syntetic Cerakote hunting rifle is a great new option at an easy-on-the-wallet price.

Mossberg launched the Patriot three years ago and it became an instant hit. Find yourself hunting in tough weather? With this model, the Sythetic Cerakote's stainless finish will provide protection so you don’t need to worry about damage to your rifle.

Like the other Patriot rifles, this latest version includes Mossberg’s bladed Lightning Bolt Action trigger, which is adjustable from two to seven pounds. It also measure 42.25 inches long and weighs just 6.5 pounds.

The optic mounting process is easy since it ships with two Weaver bases installed, giving you a stable platform for your scope.

The suggested retail price is $440.

Fit is so important, and this new Winchester XPR Hunter Compact is an excellent new option for younger shooters and women. The shorter barrel and shorter length of pull will deliver a better fit and better accuracy, while the low weight (6 pounds, 12 ounces) will make long hunts easier for someone of smaller stature.

Winchester has incorporated their “inflex technology recoil pad.” This helps reduce felt recoil by directing energy down and away from your cheek.

Their M.O.A. trigger system is specially designed to give hunters excellent accuracy by preventing factors like creep, over-travel and take-up.

The Mossy Oak Break-Up Country camo and Permacote matte surface help reduce glare, too, preventing game from spotting you and getting spooked — but it also looks fantastic.

There’s a range of calibers to suit your needs. Suggested retail prices start at $599.99.

PODCAST: INSIDER’S GUIDE TO SHOT SHOW 2018 WITH A MARINE RECON TURNED HUNTER

Hunting predators? Or big game, like moose? For long range performance in high mountain and big game hunts, Browning launched the X-Bolt Pro Long Range.

The X-Bolts were first introduced about 10 years ago, and this latest addition that adds a rotary magazine and Browning’s crisp, feather adjustable trigger for 2018. A muzzle brake also delivers reduced recoil.

This new X-Bolt rifle features a carbon-fiber stock, stainless steel receiver and a 26-inch heavy-sporter fluted threaded barrel with a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish.

Browning’s barrel lapping process is designed to improve accuracy. And as an added bonus, cleaning is easier because it also reduces fouling.

This lightweight rifle weight just over 6 pounds, too.

Available in a wide range of chamberings, the X-Bolt Pro Long Range comes with a suggested retail price of $2,099-$2,179.

Savage - 110 Predator With AccuFit

From coyotes through to squirrels, the Savage 110 Predator can tackle a wide range of hunting with an enhanced fit. Better fit helps to handle recoil, improves trigger control and should, in theory, give a shooter better accuracy.

The new Savage 110 Predator AccuFit stock allows users to customize their Predator for the best fit with several interchangeable combs and pull spacers.

The 8.25- to 8.69-pound rifle has a synthetic stock is covered in Realtree MAX-1 camo and heavy-contour carbon steel fluted barrel with a threaded muzzle.

Other key features include an oversized bolt knob for fast cycling with gloved hands, as well as an adjustable bladed AccuTrigger, the AccuStock, and two-piece Weaver bases, so scope mounting is fast and easy.

Suggested retail for the Predator is $899.

For hunting any big game found in North America, one new option for 2018 is the Wilson Combat .458 HAM'R Tactical Hunter.

Wilson Combat built the rifle to be the hardest-hitting and most powerful AR-platform on the market with the .458 HAM’R designed to exceed the energy of common big-bore cartridges like the .50 Beowulf.

The Tactical Hunter measures 34.25 inches long when the stock is collapsed, and weighs 7 pounds, 11 ounces.

The suggested retail price on the Tactical Hunter starts at $2,905."

The M4 is an updated version of the M16, which was designed for close quarters combat in Vietnam. But while the weapon is better suited for the kind of urban warfare common in Iraq, some have questioned whether it is deadly and accurate for Afghanistan – where U.S. troops often find themselves in long-range combat.

An Army study found that the 5.56mm bullets fired from the M4s don’t retain enough velocity past 1,000 feet to kill an enemy. In Afghanistan, forces are often up to 2,500 feet apart.

“It just makes no sense,” said Maj. Gen. Robert Scales Jr., a Fox News military analyst.

Scales said the M4 is “unsuitable” for Afghan terrain and “notoriously unreliable” in the first place. The Army Times reported on an Army weapons test three years ago that found the M4 performed worse than three other newer carbines when subjected to an “extreme dust test.”

Problems with the M4 locking up were also cited in a study last year on a July 2008 firefight that left nine U.S. soldiers dead in eastern Afghanistan.

The Taliban are meanwhile using heavier bullets that allow them to fire at U.S. and NATO troops from distances that are out of range of the M4.

To counter these tactics, the U.S. military is designating nine soldiers in each infantry company to serve as sharpshooters, according to Maj. Thomas Ehrhart, who wrote the Army study. The sharpshooters are equipped with the new M110 sniper rifle, which fires a larger 7.62mm round and is accurate to at least 2,500 feet.

As for what could ultimately replace the M4, the Army’s center for small-arms development is trying to find a solution.

Col. Douglas Tamilio, program manager for U.S. Army firearms at the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, said the M4 has the advantage of more-rapid firepower.

“The 5.56 caliber is more lethal since it can put more rounds on target,” he told The Associated Press. But he acknowledged the weapon is much less effective at 2,000 feet out.

A possible compromise would be an interim-caliber round combining the best characteristics of the 5.56 mm and 7.62 cartridges, Tamilio said.

Scales said the U.S. military simply needs to engineer a better weapon – he said the M8, a weapon that was under development before being halted several years ago, could be revived and improved for Afghanistan.

“We’re the world’s largest superpower. Why don’t we just make one,” Scales said. “This isn’t rocket science. We’re not putting a man on the moon here.”

Callaway, who grew up around guns and is president of the school’s Students for the Second Amendment club, first sensed the campus-wide opposition to her hobby when the group applied for an extracurricular grant for ammunition. They were denied, then appealed and eventually received a $500 stipend. The victory was short-lived, however, as outraged students successfully pressed school officials to explicitly prohibit ammo funding going forward.

“The majority of our student body does not support our group,” Callaway told FoxNews.com, adding that classmates perceive members of the club as “crazy gun kids” who intend to “shoot up the school.”

The purpose of campus clubs like Callaway’s is to promote safe and responsible handling of firearms. Once a staple of collegiate athletic departments and intramural scenes, pistol and riflery clubs and competitions have come under fire in recent years.

Mass shootings and increasing politicization of the gun debate have left the activity marginalized, especially at eastern schools “staffed by liberals who have never touched a firearm in their lives,” according to the Young America’s Foundation spokeswoman Emily Jashinsky.

“[As gun issues] become a hotter topic and the more conservatives voice their opinions, the more liberals will try to stifle them,” Jashinsky said, adding that universities are “the most insulated bubbles of leftist thought.”

Expand / Contract Members of the Colorado State University Shotgun Sports Club at the National Shooting Complex in San Antonio, Texas.

Members of student shooting teams may turn to off-campus sources of financial help when university officials withdraw ammunition funding. The NRA, which provides funding to nearly 70 universities, saw an 8 percent increase in requests between 2015 and 2016 for programs including shooting sports teams and clubs.

“Funding from the [NRA] Foundation often fills the gap when school budgets are not able to do so,” NRA spokesman Jason Brown told FoxNews.com in an email.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation has provided about $1 million in funding to shooting teams to alleviate travel and ammunition costs. That also has prompted criticism from students and faculty, who say groups that lobby against gun control should have no influence on campus.

Organization officials insist its student grant program is entirely separate and non-political.

“This has nothing whatsoever to do with concerns about campus carry or unfortunate, tragic incidences that have occurred on university campuses,” said NSSF spokesman Michael Bazinet.

Bazinet insists the sole intention of the NSSF, which provides $100,000 per year to universities, is to increase student participation in recreational shooting sports, which are present at the Olympic Games and the “polar opposite” of criminal activity.

Expand / Contract Members of the University of Delaware Students for the Second Amendment Club state their case on campus

A former shotgun club president, whose team was awarded $7,500 from the NSSF in 2009 and continues to receive financial support from the NRA, declined to be named out of fear his university would punish the group.

“Our school is not fond of our team because of guns,” he told FoxNews.com of his state university, which prohibits the group from spending school funds on ammo and refuses to provide the same scholarships allotted to other programs.

“It’s sad that we must worry about repercussions because of talking about our Second Amendment rights,” he said, adding pro-gun organizations have never imposed political opinions on the team and provide funds solely for sport, since a single event costs the team about $120.

The NSSF also provided $5,000 to Oklahoma State University’s shotgun club in 2012. Without outside funding, the team’s practices and competitions would be prohibitively expensive, club president Cody Sutton said.

“The health of these shooting programs is extremely important for the development of responsible firearms enthusiasts and competitors,” he told FoxNews.com.

Ernest Eckenrode, captain of the trap and skeet team at Washington College, in Chestertown, Md., agreed, stating his group uses grant money to educate new shooters about gun safety.

“Every gun club has safety as a top priority,” he told FoxNews.com, insisting the NSSF has never attempted to politicize the team. “The fund money in no way funds harmful actions with weapons.”

A ban on financial aid from organizations like the NSSF is a typical strategy utilized by universities to obstruct conservative clubs from obtaining funds, according to Jashinsky.

Yale University’s Pistol Club and Skeet and Trap Club each received $5,000 from the organization in 2012. The pistol club credited the NSSF in a report, saying its “generous grant money was vital in [our] ability to participate” for the first time in the National NRA Intercollegiate Pistol Championships.

But Yale now prohibits lobbying organizations like the NSSF from providing funding to student groups.

“I can assure you that club funding from shooting or firearm-related organizations is not permitted,” Yale spokesman Thomas Conroy told FoxNews.com in an email.

Conroy reasoned that accepting funds from such organizations requires a vetting process and that internal funding to the team is sufficient.

Politicizing university shooting clubs is a “great disservice to society as a whole,” according to Bazinet, who stressed students learn important life skills when participating in an organized team in a safe environment.

“It’s not as if they take their firearm to class with them,” he said."

World Peace and Unification Sanctuary in Newfoundland said it planned the Feb. 28 ceremony months ago, well before last week's massacre at a Florida high school. Authorities say the alleged gunman used an AR-15 in the attack that killed 17.

Tim Elder, the Unification Sanctuary's director of world missions, said Tuesday the church believes the AR-15 symbolizes the ""rod of iron"" mentioned in the Bible's apocalyptic book of Revelation.

The church website directs couples to show up to the ceremony with an AR-15 ""or equivalents such as an AK semiautomatic rifle, representing both the intent and the ability to defend one's family, community ... ""

The church is down the road from Wallenpaupack South Elementary School, and some parents expressed alarm at the planned ceremony.

""It's something I would consider keeping my child home. It's scary,"" parent Liz Zoccola told WNEP-TV.

""I wish they wouldn't have it at all. I don't think there's a good time to have it, especially this close,"" Kendra Hanor, another parent, told the station.

Elder told the AP that the weapons will be unloaded, secured with zip ties and checked at the door. He said the church did not consider canceling or moving the ceremony.

""Now more than ever, good people need to stand up and claim for themselves the tools that can be used to stop that kind of evil,"" he said.

State police are aware of the event but do not plan to send any troopers to it, since the church is breaking no law, Trooper Mark Keyes said Tuesday.

The Unification Sanctuary's leader, the Rev. Sean Moon, is the son of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, a self-proclaimed messiah who founded the Unification Church, which is often described as a cult.

The Pennsylvania offshoot is a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment. Unification Sanctuary operates a group called Rod of Iron Ministries, which is hosting a ""President Trump Thank You Dinner"" on Saturday — a fundraiser for Gun Owners of America.

The Rev. Sean Moon's brother founded Kahr Arms, a gun manufacturer."

""The number one myth is these are machine guns. They're not machine guns. They're semi-auto, meaning I pull the trigger one time, I get one bullet,"" said Jeff Serdy of AJI Sporting Goods near Phoenix.

Serdy is among those who claim the features that allow these guns to qualify as ""assault"" weapons have little to do with how deadly they are. They include ""a telescoping stock, pistol grip, ability to accept a magazine, and a flash-hider.""

He said: ""This AR-15 is no more dangerous than this hunting rifle which is used for woodchucks all across the East.""

A bill similar to what Obama is calling for is expected to be introduced soon by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who also helped author the last assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004. The National Academy of Sciences determined that effort had ""no clear impact on gun violence,"" though groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence say the ban did have some impact on crime.

But Feinstein's new bill reduces the allowable number of ""military characteristics"" from two to one and does not allow gun makers to include cheap work-arounds like flash suppressors and bayonet lugs. The result is a proposed ban that could be more sweeping.

It also bans any magazine whose capacity is greater than 10 rounds and 'bullet buttons"" -- which are simple devices used to allow an owner to quickly change magazines.

Gun control advocates say those changes will make the new bill more effective.

""The combination of improved and expanded background checks, effective bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and stronger anti-trafficking laws will work together to prevent another Newtown and to stem the daily gun violence that tears apart too many families and communities,"" according to a statement released Wednesday from the Violence Policy Center.

The new Feinstein bill will also specifically ban 120 weapons, including the popular AK-47 and AR-15, often called the Barbie Doll of guns because it is so easily accessorized. The AR-15 is the most popular gun sold in the U.S. today, with almost one-half of users saying they use it for target shooting.

Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, took to Twitter on Friday to say that he and other residents in the Cornhusker State “love our constitutional rights” and welcome the convection in their state.

Kansas' Secretary of State Kris Kobach has also invited the group.

“I’ve already reached out to the @NRA and urged them to bring the #NRA convention to #KS.,” Kobach tweeted Friday. “Kansans love our right to keep and bear arms. Kansas is the most pro-gun state in America. Our right to keep and bear arms const. amendment passed by greater margins than any other state.”

Their remarks follow Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway, who in the aftermath of the deadly Valentine’s Day shooting at a Florida high school, said the NRA should “reconsider” coming to his city because “there will be marches and demonstrations.”

Seventeen people died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., when accused gunman Nikolas Cruz, 19, opened fire with an AR-14 rifle.

The NRA has been criticized in the aftermath of the massacre by those who say the gun rights group is keeping lawmakers in Washington and across the country from passing measures that would curb gun violence.

Since the shooting, several companies have severed tied with the group, including Delta Airlines, Enterprise Holdings, First National Bank of Omaha, Symantec and MetLife. The First National Bank of Omaha said it would no longer issue NRA-branded VISA credit cards.

The annual NRA convention, which features meetings and exhibits over three days, routinely draws thousands of gun enthusiasts. This year’s event is set for May 4-6 at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center in Dallas.

Following Caraway’s remarks, the NRA said after Caraway’s remarks that it will not consider moving the convention.

“Our members work in fire stations and police departments,” the group said. “They save lives in local hospitals and own businesses in communities urban and rural throughout this country. No politician anywhere can tell the NRA not to come to their city. We are already there.”

At the Conservative Political Action Conferences outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday, the gun right group’s chief executive Wayne LaPierre slammed critics.

“They don’t care about our schoolchildren,” LaPierre said Thursday. “They want to make all of us less free,” adding that Democrats are pushing a “socialist” agenda to deprive gun owners of their weapons.

“Socialism is a movement that loves a smear,"" he added.

For a range of budgets and objectives, here are five highlights of the best rifles unveiled for 2017.

Browning BAR Safari Rifle

Considering investing in a rifle with some meaningful military history behind it? Then Browning has a special limited-edition option for you. Unveiled at SHOT, the rifle will be tough to nab because they are only producing a mere one-hundred pieces.

Before World War I, the US Army commissioned John Browning to design a next-level rifle. He created the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) in a remarkable three months – such a brilliant design that it withstood the test of time. The BAR continued to be used by the military through World War II until Vietnam. John Browning’s grandson then introduced a sporting twist on this iconic weapon and teamed up with FN to leverage their expertise as well.

JOHN WAYNE GUNS FOR BEGINNERS REVEALED AT SHOT SHOW

In honor of the 100th anniversary, Browning is introducing the BAR Safari 100th Anniversary model with some special features. The stock is high-end Grade V Turkish walnut with oil finish. And military and hunting scenes will be engraved on the steel receiver and highlighted with gold.

It weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces, and is 44 inches long including the 22 inch barrel length. This semi-automatic sporting classic BAR rifle will be available for around $2,699.99.

Remington Model 700 American Wilderness Rifle

Speaking of anniversaries and safaris, another iconic American company, Remington, has reached 200 years and revealed their new big game rifle – the Model American Wilderness Rifle (AWR).

It is designed to be very durable and performs extremely well in tough outdoor conditions while looking good at the same time.

The Model 700 AWR has a stainless steel action and a black Cerakote coated 24-inch free-floated 5R barrel to withstand any abuse your remote adventures might throw at it.

The rifle also has a very robust Grayboe stock with high fiberglass content to provide further durability against weather you may come up against in the wilderness.

And the trigger? There’s an X-Mark Pro that is externally adjustable.

The AWR will be on sale in 2017 for about $1,225.

Ruger 10-22 Takedown Lite

Whether you need to react and move quickly or are just keen on a highly capable, accurate rifle that you can store and carry easily, the new 10-22 Takedown Lite is a big reveal at SHOT for 2017.

The 10-22 Takedown Lite is a rapid takedown separating the action from the cold hammer-forged barrel. And where does the Lite come in? This new rifle weighs 4.5 pounds, making it a great option for long days at the range, for women who prefer a lighter weight, and for professionals who want to stay light, fast, and agile.

Just how easy is it to takedown? Thanks to the very smart design it is incredibly easy. You just lock the bolt back, push the recessed lever and twist the subassemblies pulling it apart. That’s it. It is literally that fast.

The design incorporates a threaded muzzle with a thread cap that can be easily removed to use muzzle accessories. It also features the Ruger Modular Stock System with a standard pull length and low comb.

There’s a detachable 10-round rotary magazine with a cutting-edge rotor that enhances feeding reliability. The 10-22 Takdown Lite comes with the option of a high comb standard pull length module too and will be available for about $659.

Winchester XPC

Another new chassis-based precision rifle for this year is the Winchester XPC. Designed for extreme accuracy, the action is based on their popular XPR, and there’s a threaded muzzle with target crown.

The free-floating barrel features a Permacote black finish. The design incorporates a cerakote fully machined alloy frame chassis and the Magpul PRS Gen 3 fully adjustable butt stock. There’s an M.O.A. trigger system and two-position thumb safety.

The ten-pounder, bolt-action XPC is very accessory friendly. There’s a 20-MOA scope base, full-length top Picatinny rail and an M-LOK accessory rail.

This new rifle is expected to be available for about $1,599.99.

Saint shines at SHOT Show

The Saint made by Springfield Armory is definitely another standout. It was introduced at the very end of last year and made its first appearance at SHOT, drawing a whole lot of buzz.

Fit for fighting and for the range, this new AR-15-style rifle has a mid-length gas system, Bravo Company’s slim contour Polymer KeyMod handguard, an enhanced trigger, well-balanced weight, excellent accuracy and much more.

At Range Day, while testing this rifle out, folks raved about Springfield's Accu-Tite Tension system that tightens up the space between the lower and upper receivers. The new Saint retails for about $899.

Fayetteville police officers responded to the Sprint store around 7:25 p.m. Monday night after the clerk reported the crime.

Police said the woman, who is seen wearing a green tank top and black pants with a tattoo on her right shoulder blade, walked into the store with the large rifle demanding cell phones from the clerk. She did not attempt to conceal her face.

The store employee complied with the requests before the suspect fled the store in a dark blue Mazda.

Police said only two cell phones were stolen during the robbery and nobody was hurt, NBC News reported.

The police department released three surveillance photos of the alleged suspect and have asked the public for help.

Spike’s Tactical in Apopka etched its new $1,395 AR-15 with a Bible verse that says “Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle,” MyFoxOrlando reported.

Company spokesman Ben Thomas, a former Navy SEAL, said the scripture is something of an insurance policy to keep it out of the hands of terrorists. The idea came to him during the weapon's development. At the time, the U.S. government was preparing to arm rebel groups in Syria.

“When you make a rifle, you have to understand that it could be used for ill deeds if it got in the wrong hands,” Thomas told the station.

The gun went on sale this week and was quickly denounced by the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Florida, according to MyFoxOrlando.

“Sadly, this manufacturer’s fancy new gun won’t do anything to stop the real threat in America: the escalating problem of gun violence,” the council told the station. “This is just another shameful marketing ploy intended to profit from the promotion of hatred, division, and violence.”

Thomas defended the Crusader, saying he would like to take a weapon with scripture etched on the side into battle and that the gun is not meant to be racist.

“We didn’t say ‘No Muslims,’” he said.

The scripture is etched on one side of the magazine. Etched on the other is a symbol of a cross that dates from the Crusades of the Middle Ages.

Thomas told the Orlando Sentinel the company's owners did not intend to insult or antagonize Muslims.

He told the paper the owners believe America and much of the world is threatened by Islamic terrorism and the weapon is a symbol of shared Christian values and the right to defend themselves.

Thomas also told the paper the safety selector that controls the Crusader's trigger has three settings: Peace, War and God Wills It.

“Let’s make a deal DO NOT come to Florida for spring break unless gun legislation is passed. These [politicians] won’t listen to us so maybe [they’ll] listen to the billion dollar tourism industry in FL,” tweeted David Hogg, a 17-year-old senior and student reporter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida.

Hogg — who has been a major player in the student-activist movement staging protests in Florida calling for stricter gun laws — sent the tweet to his followers, which now number more than 300,000.

Hogg — whose Twitter bio describes him as a “film maker, entrepreneur, surfer” — co-founded the student mobilization group Never Again MSD, creating the #neveragain hashtag online and calling for a ban on certain weapons and improved care for the mentally ill since a shooter slaughtered 17 people at the Parkland high school on Valentine’s Day. “MSD” refers to his Parkland school.

Alleged teen gunman, Nikolas Cruz, used an AR-15 and had a history of emotional problems, according to investigators. Cruz was arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.

Wendy Glaab, 60, of Fonthill, Ontario, Canada, was among the first to respond to his tweet. “I like many Canadians travel to Florida from time to time to escape our winter. I can’t speak for others but I will not be returning until meaningful gun control legislation is in place.”

Glaab told The Associated Press on Saturday that her sister owns property in Fort Lauderdale and she is able to visit any time she chooses.

“Better Idea: Spend your spring break in Puerto Rico, it’s a beautiful place with amazing people. They could really use the economic support that the government has failed to provide,” Hogg followed up in a separate tweet.

It’s too soon to tell how significantly the aftermath of the massacre might sway the country’s wider gun debate.

National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference that people advocating for stricter gun control were exploiting the Florida shooting.

President Donald Trump has suggested some teachers could be armed so they could fire on any attacker. However, Trump also has called for raising the minimum age for purchasing semi-automatic rifles, a move the NRA has opposed.

In the aftermath of the Valentine’s Day school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead, the president has pledged to make schools safer and reduce gun violence. After raising the idea of banning “bump stocks” and curbing young people’s access to guns, he has spent much of the past week endorsing the arming of some trained teachers and school officials to stop ""savage sicko"" shooters, an approach the gun lobby supports.

In a tweet on Saturday afternoon, he reiterated that position: “Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept & have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.”

But some gun owners, who supported Trump in a big way in 2016, want to make sure their viewpoint is heard, too.

""Out in the firearms community there is a great feeling of betrayal and abandonment because of the support he was given in his campaign for president,"" Tony Fabian, president of the Colorado Sports Shooting Association, said Friday, according to The Associated Press.

The comments highlight the deft maneuvering needed by Trump and the GOP to act decisively while also paying attention to a politically potent constituency.

Just the preliminary act of floating proposals that defy the National Rifle Association and other groups drew threats of political retribution and legal action. This, despite the fact that in recent days, the NRA has come over increasing pressure, with several companies ending their ties to the group in the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre in Florida. Four major companies, Enterprise Holdings, First National Bank of Omaha, Symantec, and MetLife are among the first to call it quits after a #BoycottNRA hashtag started to pick up steam online late Thursday.

The confrontation presents Trump with a special opportunity, some say.

""The president has a unique ability right now to maybe

really do something about these school shootings,"" said Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., told The AP ""Nobody is more popular in my district — and I know in a lot of other people's districts — than Donald Trump. He's more popular than the NRA. ... So it's up to him whether or not anything happens with guns.""

Gun Owners of America issued an alert earlier this past week urging its 1.5 million members to call the White House and ""Tell Trump to OPPOSE All Gun Control!"" The organization said anti-gun activists aided by congressional Democrats are trying to convince the president he should ""support their disastrous gun control efforts,"" the message said, as reported by the wire service. ""And sadly, it may be working.""

Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for the Virginia-based

group, told The AP the organization doesn't hesitate to oppose Republican incumbents and candidates whom it deems not sufficiently ""pro-gun."" Motivating gun owners to go to the polls is the source of the gun lobby's strength, according to Hammond.

""When they feel gun ownership is threatened, then

they're going to respond as if that's the pre-eminent issue,"" he said.

Benjamin McDowell, 30, pleaded guilty Monday to being a felon in possession of a weapon, according to reports by multiple news outlets. He also could be fined $250,000 when he's sentenced at a later date.

Authorities first began investigating McDowell in December 2016 when he threatened a Myrtle Beach synagogue on Facebook. Local officials were already keeping tabs on him because he made friends with white supremacist groups and got tattoos associated with racist groups while in prison on a felony burglary charge, according to the FBI.

McDowell then said he wanted a gun and told an undercover FBI agent who offered to get him one that he planned to attack somewhere in the name of white power and write on the building ""in the spirit of Dylann Roof,"" according to court records. Roof was sentenced to death last year for a racist shooting that killed nine black worshippers at a Charleston, South Carolina, church.

""I seen what Dylann Roof did and in my heart I reckon I got a little bit of hatred,"" the undercover agent recalled McDowell saying.

McDowell, who couldn't legally own a gun because of the burglary conviction, was arrested after the purchase. Agents said McDowell bought the gun — which had the firing pin shaved down so that it would not work — and ammunition for $109, which he had borrowed from his grandfather."
fox177,fox,['Matt Finn'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/22/ohio-school-districts-train-teachers-to-handle-guns-are-our-safety.html,"Two school districts near Dayton, Ohio have trained a confidential team of teachers and staff to fire back at an active shooter.

""Our staff members are trained to go to the threat and address the threat. Not to run away,” said Mad River Schools Superintendent Chad Wyen.

The Sidney and Mad River school districts have guns hidden in safes throughout its schools which can be opened only by staff on the armed response team. Each member of the team is vetted, selected by the district, and must have a license to carry. The team goes through “rigorous” monthly training.

“These teachers are trained and trained as well in the use of firearms as the average police officer,” said Sidney Middle School armed guard and veteran tactical officer, Rick Cron. “I made sure that that would happen. I didn’t want someone who wasn’t trained to come to my aid. I wanted people who understood tactics.”

As the gun debate plays out across the country following the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. – and many arguing over whether teachers should be trained and armed – some school districts are already taking bold steps to prevent a tragedy on campus. Schools in Texas, Indiana and even California started arming up after the fatal shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

The state of Ohio currently offers funding for schools to train their staff to respond in emergency situations. There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff who are trained to fire back, or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds.

In Ohio, many of the students seem to agree with some of their teachers being trained to use firearms.

“To have people inside the school who know what they are doing and who can protect us, I mean, that's amazing and I don't think there's really any room for complaints,” said Liberty Flynn, a 10th-grade student at Stebbins High School in Riverside, Ohio.

“When we are inside those four walls, they are our safety. That's our safety for the day,” said Stebbins High School sophomore, Will Rodriguez.

The school’s programs are not without controversy. It took years for the programs to get off the ground and be finalized. There are parents and members of the community that still disagree with armed staff.

“There’s a lot of pressure on teachers already. We got to get these kids into college and ready for life. Being trained with weapons and stuff like that is just not something they are prepared for,” said David Herzog. “Let the teachers teach and let the law enforcement take care of the laws.""

Sidney Police Chief William Balling said he’s not against the armed staff but worries it could interfere with his first responders.

“Because now you take away a possibility of one or two people with guns to six or seven people with guns without us having assurance who's the good guy or the bad guy,” Balling said.

The Shelby County Sheriff told Fox News he developed the plan for Sidney schools while watching the Sandy Hook tragedy unfold. He realized his schools were not prepared and took action.

""We cannot depend on the state or federal government,” said Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart. “We can't depend on psychologists to figure out why people hurt each other.""

Cron says he considers each trained staff member a certified backup and said they can significantly reduce critical response time.

“I would not do this job by myself,” Cron said. “Without the teachers, the response team teachers, I wouldn’t do it.”"

He has introduced the bill annually since he was elected in 2014, The Washington Times reported. Previous attempts have been turned down.

Neville, a Republican, told The Times the current law “creates a so-called gun free zone in every K-12 public school.”

Under Colorado law, concealed-carry permit holders may bring firearms onto school property, according to The Times, but must keep them locked inside their vehicles.

“Time and time again we point to the one common theme with mass shootings, they occur in gun-free zones,” Neville told The Times.

He added law-abiding citizens should be able “to defend themselves and most importantly our children from the worst-case scenarios.”

The massacre on Valentine’s Day of last week in Florida has renewed a nationwide debate about gun violence and how to prevent mass shootings.

Nikolas Cruz, 19, was suspected of opening fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where he was a former student, killing 17 people and injuring more than a dozen others.

Neville has contended, according to The Times, that more of his classmates would have survived the attack if faculty had been armed. In April 1999, two teens killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves inside Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colorado.

Most recently, the White House said President Trump backs efforts to improve the country's background check system. His abrupt involvement could be the nudge for action in a Congress divided on virtually every issue.

“We want to make sure that the background check process is fully staffed and that all information gets in,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said Monday on ""Fox & Friends,"" describing the current system as a ""patchwork.""

Trump specifically has taken interest in bipartisan Senate legislation that would bolster the National Instant Criminal Background Check System -- a nationwide database for gun sellers that helps prevent the purchase of guns by criminals, the mentally ill and others considered too dangerous to own a firearm.

The Republican-controlled House already passed a measure to strengthen or fix the so-called NICS system, as part of legislation approved in December 2017 that also would allow gun owners more freedom to take a firearm across state lines.

“The House passed legislation to enforce existing law, improve compliance with the federal background check system, address the bump stock issue, as well as strengthen the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,” North Carolina GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, whose gun-reciprocity plan was included the measure, told Fox News on Monday.

The reciprocity provision is a conservative priority that might not attract bipartisan support in the Senate.

The Senate version, as originally introduced last fall, mostly focused on the background check system. Trump spoke last week with Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican and co-sponsor of that ""Fix NICS"" measure.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that their discussion focused on efforts to “improve federal compliance” with criminal background check legislation. She said the president is “supportive” of such efforts but cautioned that “discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered.”

Cornyn has been working on a version of the bill since at least last year and suggested well before the Florida massacre that it had “good bipartisan support.” The plan also tries to ensure that federal and state authorities submit critical information like criminal convictions to the database.

The National Rifle Association, considered the country’s most influential gun-rights group, also is backing congressional efforts to improve the system.

Whether this leads to congressional action, or political point-scoring, remains to be seen.

Both the NRA and Trump were hammered by gun control advocates in the wake of last week's massacre, where the shooter had an AR-15-style rifle. Trump took heat for his initial comments focusing largely on the issue of mental health.

He, in turn, has hammered the FBI after the bureau admitted it failed to follow up on clear warnings about the shooter.

“Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable,” he tweeted, accusing agents of being distracted by the Russia probe.

Other presidents have put their support behind efforts to stop gun violence, only to see such initiatives fail in Congress, most notably after gunman Adam Lanza killed seven adults and 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012.

“As a country, we have been through this too many times,” then-President Barack Obama said afterward. “We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.”

However, the Senate, then controlled by the president’s fellow Democrats, couldn’t pass any proposals to change gun laws.

The gun control debate has played out after virtually every mass shooting since April 1999, when two teens killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves inside their Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colo.

But the most-recent calls for action could escalate the pressure -- including nationwide rallies planned next month by students who survived last week’s shooting in Florida. Seventeen people were killed in the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla.

Trump is scheduled Wednesday to host students and teachers at the White House to talk about school safety. And he plans to meet Thursday with state and local officials on the issue.

A frequent Trump critic, Ohio's moderate Republican Gov. John Kasich, has publicly urged Trump to lead efforts to curb gun violence.

“Mr. President, America needs real leadership. We need to take common sense steps NOW to protect our kids. From one father to another, let’s protect them,” he tweeted over the weekend.

Kasich says he remains a strong Second Amendment supporter but is calling for changes – perhaps at a state or local level – such as improving background checks and increasing attention on the connection between mental illness and gun violence. (A pro-gun section on his political website reportedly was scrubbed amid his new calls for changes to the law.)

While Kasich's view is unlikely to shape presidential policy, other factors are at play. Al Hoffman Jr., a prominent Republican political donor, reportedly has vowed to withhold contributions from candidates who don’t support a ban on the sale of assault weapons. And he suggested he would rally other GOP donors to follow his lead.

Such an ultimatum would be an unexpected turn in the Washington debate over guns laws, and it's unclear how much support Hoffman might get from fellow donors.

A major argument from Second Amendment advocates is that tougher laws won’t keep guns away from potential mass killers and others committing or trying to commit crimes.

Another reason why gun legislation in difficult to pass in Congress is that Republicans, particularly from rural or other conservative districts, could face tough primary challenges if they vote for stricter laws.

As for Cornyn's plan, Hudson said he’s yet to see the text of the legislation but encouraged senators to consider his Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017.

Hudson submitted his measure after 25 people were killed in November 2017 at a Texas church by a former Air Force member.

The Air Force later admitted it had failed to enter into a federal database that the killer had been convicted in 2004 of domestic violence, a charge that could have prevented him from buying a gun."
fox180,fox,['Howard Kurtz'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/trumps-early-move-on-guns-could-bridge-partisan-gap.html,"Donald Trump could be the president who pushes Congress to do something about gun control, even if those steps are modest.

Perhaps only a Republican president—and one elected with the full backing of the NRA—would be positioned to take such steps.

But rather than welcoming Trump's move in their direction, gun control advocates are initially dismissing his efforts as inadequate.

For a quarter century, virtually any effort at regulating the sale of guns has fallen victim to Washington gridlock. Ever since Congress let Bill Clinton’s assault-weapon ban expire in the 1990s, the issue has been seen as politically radioactive, not just by Republicans but by moderate Democrats as well.

Even after the school shooting in Newtown, even with Barack Obama and Joe Biden mounting a sustained push for some gun-control measures, Congress did nothing. There was no way the Republicans were going to give Obama even a minor concession on the issue.

Then came last year's Las Vegas massacre, and an outcry over the shooter's use of bump stocks to boost the speed of his attack. But nothing happened.

And yet the Florida school shooting, and the gruesome spectacle of children being gunned down, seems to have brought the issue to a potential tipping point.

When the conservative, pro-Trump New York Post is running such banner headlines as ""MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE ACT"" and yesterday’s ""HOPE FOR GUN CONTROL""—with a photo of protesting Florida students--it's clear that the national mood is changing.

Even Pat Robertson, the onetime GOP presidential candidate, said on his ""700 Club"": ""I am a gun owner. I have hunted. I have shot skeet,"" Robertson said. ""But for heaven's sakes, I don't think that the general population needs to have automatic weapons.""

Trump has ordered the Justice Department to speed up an existing review and issue regulations banning bump stocks. He has also signaled he is open to arguments about tighter background checks and raising the age limit for purchases of such weapons as an AR-15 rifle, the one used in Parkland.

This comes from a president who embraced the Second Amendment during the campaign and said of the group that backed him financially: ""To the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.""

Of course, after yesterday's gut-wrenching session with students, teachers and parents who went through mass shootings, Trump also said that arming people in schools could be part of the solution--an approach favored by the NRA.

A Quinnipiac poll out yesterday said that 97 percent (!) of Americans favor universal background checks for gun purchases. Some 66 percent favor stricter gun laws, and 67 percent favor a ban on assault weapons.

There is a partisan divide, with only 34 percent of Republicans supporting stricter gun laws, but 43 percent back an assault weapons ban.

Washington's paralysis on these issues speaks to more than the clout of the NRA. Many lawmakers are just afraid of alienating gun owners, who are passionate and highly motivated voters.

Now it's true the NRA doesn't oppose some of these measures, such as regulating bump stocks (though it doesn't want legislative action on the matter).

But Trump does have a Nixon-goes-to-China opportunity here. He could detoxify the issue for many Republicans, bringing enough along to join with liberal Democrats in passing modest legislation.

It's just as possible that, like immigration, this issue will become embroiled in partisanship and the moment will pass.

Trump has already remade the Republican Party in his image, drawing considerable criticism from those who don't like him or his policies. But what if, in the wake of the Florida tragedy, he moved the party toward a more centrist and popular position?"

Authorities responsible for protecting the school, Dalton High School, where Jesse Randal Davidson worked, said they were not aware of the episode until this week, The Associated Press reported.

Davidson was taken to the hospital for a mental evaluation and his rifles were seized for safe-keeping after he torched the Mitsubishi Outlander on Aug. 13, 2016.

The report also showed Davidson has been hospitalized at least three times in recent years as people worried about his state of mind.

GEORGIA TEACHER WHO FIRED GUN IN CLASSROOM PREVIOUSLY TOLD POLICE HE HIRED HITMEN, REPORT SAYS

Davidson, 53, did not hit anyone when he allegedly fired a handgun out his classroom window Wednesday but it caused chaos and immediate calls to abandon the idea of arming teachers as a solution to school shootings. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have endorsed arming teachers following the killings of 17 people at a Florida high school last month.

Davidson faces six charges including aggravated assault; terroristic threats and acts; and having a weapon on school property.

The additional details about Davidson's past run-ins with law enforcement emerged as the school reopened Friday.

A deputy saw heavy smoke and flames pouring from the Mitsubishi as he pulled up to Davidson's home in the small community of Rising Fawn, Georgia, the sheriff's report said. The deputy told Davidson's wife Lisa and their daughter Megan to seek safety in his patrol car.

Davidson's adult son, Johnny, told the deputy that his father ""was not acting like himself and was sitting down with a rifle in the back yard watching the vehicle on fire.""

GEORGIA TEACHER IN CUSTODY AFTER ALLEGEDLY OPENING FIRE IN CLASSROOM, POLICE SAY

Davidson’s son was able to talk his father into giving up the gun and two other weapons were also seized.

In another incident, Davidson reportedly walked into the lobby of the Dalton police headquarters and allegedly made up a story about someone who was murdered. Detectives could not verify Davidson’s claim and he was taken to the hospital after he expressed thoughts about killing himself.

In another incident, school employees and a police officer began searching Dalton High in January 2017 after Davidson went missing. He was later found sitting on the curb along a street a few blocks from the campus, being propped up by two school staff members, police said.

Davidson’s family faced financial hardship recently, federal court records showed. The family filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in late 2015. As part of that case, the teacher listed six rifles and one shotgun on a list of assets he owned.

School officials say they can't talk about mental health issues of specific staff members. But Dalton High Principal Steve Bartoo told reporters that ""as far as I know he was fit to be at work.""

""We don't allow anyone in a classroom unless they are capable of doing their job and fit for their position,"" school system spokeswoman Pat Holloway said.

But school officials might not have been aware that his guns had been taken the day his family car was burned.

""I very seriously doubt that they knew about that incident,"" Dade County Sheriff's Sgt. Chad Payne said Friday.

""It resulted in him being transported for a mental evaluation,"" Payne said. ""Once he's in that ambulance and on the way to the hospital, his medical care becomes private so I doubt that they would know anything about it.""

Thousands of students, parents and teachers attended rallies over the weekend in support of stronger gun control legislation. And many of them blamed politicians – particularly those who have accepted donations from the National Rifle Association (NRA), a nonprofit that supports gun rights.

Here’s a look at what 15 Republican senators have said about gun control in the aftermath of the deadly shooting on Feb. 14.

John Boozman, Arkansas

When Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., was a student in Arkansas, he said it wasn’t uncommon for “young people to actually bring their rifles to school during deer season.” But, he told KARK-TV, “nobody at that time entertained the thought of doing such a horrendous thing” as shooting individuals in a school.

Boozman says the ""heart of the problem"" facing the U.S. is a mix of drugs, gangs, mental health and the “break-up of the family,” which, he argued, can be the catalyst behind these recent tragedies.

""Throwing money at the problem or passing a law that simply would not make any difference is not the answer – even though it might make us all feel better."" - Sen. John Boozman

“My understanding is, if you look at all the instances like these that have happened in recent history, that all of the things that have been proposed in Congress to counter them would not have made any difference,” Boozman told KARK. “Throwing money at the problem or passing a law that simply would not make any difference is not the answer – even though it might make us all feel better.”

He said he wants to see the country be able to more easily identify “these young white males that are definitely mentally ill, very unstable,” and be able to “somehow restrain them.”

Susan Collins, Maine

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told the Bangor Daily News that she’s sponsored several bills in Congress that would prohibit people on a no-fly list from purchasing guns as well as strengthen background checks.

“What happened [in Florida] is not only so horrific a tragedy, but it also has happened far too many times in this country,” she said.

John Cornyn, Texas

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has spoken to President Trump about a bipartisan bill designed to strengthen the FBI database of prohibited gun buyers, according to the White House.

The bill, which he introduced last year alongside Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., would penalize federal agencies that fail to provide the necessary records and reward states that comply with federal grant preferences and other incentives.

Ted Cruz, Texas

Appearing on Fox News, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, criticized Democrats for what he said was their attempt to “politicize” a tragedy – including by advocating to “take away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.”

Cruz mentioned the mass shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017 and said the survivors told him “gun control is not the answer.”

“The answer is to focus on criminals, to focus on violent criminals,” Cruz said.

The former presidential contender has also battled CNN in the wake of the shooting. The cable news network accused Cruz, along with other Republicans, of being “unwilling” to appear on CNN to talk about gun control.

Cruz pushed back on Twitter, saying he did a 15-minute interview with CNN “about proactive solutions to prevent gun violence,” but said the network “aired NONE of it.”

Joni Ernst, Iowa

After the shooting, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said there should be a balance between supporting existing gun laws and not restricting Second Amendment rights.

“While we must enforce current federal gun laws to prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands, we can and must do so in a way that respects our Constitution,” Ernst told KCCI-TV.

""The root cause is not that we have the Second Amendment; it is that we’re not adequately addressing mental illness across the United States."" - Sen. Joni Ernst

She also told reporters on a conference call that the problem isn’t guns, but societal issues that can be helped with better access to mental health services, the Des Moines Register reported.

“The root cause is not that we have the Second Amendment,” Ernst said. “It is that we’re not adequately addressing mental illness across the United States. We need to focus on that, and we need to focus on substance abuse.”

Cory Gardner, Colorado

Like other Republicans, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., has said the school shooting should serve as an example for lawmakers to better improve mental health initiatives.

“Now is the time to have a discussion about what we can do to break down the barriers that prevent help going to people who need it – whether that’s a substance abuse issue or whether that’s a mental health concern,” Gardner said, according to the Denver Post.

Gardner called for a probe into whether authorities took earlier complaints about the alleged gunman seriously enough.

“We need to understand why those reports weren’t investigated or further action wasn’t taken,” he said.

Chuck Grassley, Iowa

After the shooting, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told fellow lawmakers he planned to sit down with some of them to discuss gun legislation, CBS News reported.

The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman responded to a request from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and said he would to talk to her and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.

Both senators have introduced legislation pertaining to gun control. Feinstein, in particular, is seeking to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase rifles.

Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., accused gun control advocates of attempting to “take a tragedy and try to capitalize on it.”

“Every time there’s an incident, people somehow think if you take away guns from law-abiding citizens, the criminal element will give up their guns voluntarily,” Inhofe told WJLA-TV. “It doesn’t make sense to me.”

John Kennedy, Louisiana

According to Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., the “first way to stop a shooter is to shoot back.”

Kennedy is advocating for active shooter drills and trained security personnel on hand in schools. He told WVUE-TV he's not going to support ""more gun control.""

“I don't think gun control keeps guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have guns,” Kennedy said. “I think criminals and those who are mentally ill obey gun laws pretty much like politicians keep promises.”

“I think our problem is not gun control; it’s idiot control,” he quipped.

James Lankford, Oklahoma

While he’s not on board with a ban of so-called assault weapons, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called for stronger background checks in the wake of the Florida school shooting.

“The problem is not owning an AR-15, it’s the person who owns it,” Lankford told NBC News, adding that he doesn’t believe the AR-15 should be more difficult to buy.

He pushed for reform to strengthen background checks on individuals purchasing firearms, especially in some “rural departments or federal entities.”

Lankford strongly advocated for the “Fix NICS Act,” from Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn. The bill ""penalizes federal agencies who fail to properly report relevant records and incentivizes states to improve their overall reporting,"" Cornyn described in a post on his website.

Lisa Murkowski, Alaska

Like some of her Republican colleagues, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, focused on mental health efforts in the wake of the shooting.

“I think we all know that there is no one single initiative that is going to be able to stop what happened in Florida or what has happened in — unfortunately — far too many other areas, where, again, you think there’s a level of safety and security and there’s not,” Murkowski told Vox.

She added that Alaska has a “very serious deficiency when it comes to mental health providers.”

Mike Rounds, South Dakota

In an interview with NPR, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., encouraged people not to get too caught up in the type of firearm used in the school shooting.

“You can call any type of a series of different types of guns assault weapon, and suddenly then they become a demonized item,” Rounds said. “And then suddenly it sounds like we've done something. The reality is there's a whole lot of different types of weapons that can be utilized whether you're talking about a handgun, or you're talking about a shotgun, or you're talking about a rifle…”

Rounds said Congress “could do a better job,” but added that he supports the Second Amendment.

“All we have to do is take away one particular type of weapon – that suddenly becomes the discussion point. And suddenly we all feel good about having done something. And in reality, we haven’t done something,” he said.

Marco Rubio, Florida

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has borne the brunt of criticism in the wake of the school shooting in his state, given his positions on gun control. He said the issue is ""complicated,” but “not unsolvable.”

“If a bill makes things better, we should vote for it and keep working,"" Rubio told WFOR-TV. ""But we’re in an era now where everybody wants to get 100 percent of what they want or they’ll just walk away.""

""There’s this false narrative out there that says just because you want to deal with mental illness means you don’t want to deal with the gun part."" - Sen. Marco Rubio

Rubio said it should have been “impossible” for the alleged gunman in Parkland to have been able to obtain the firearm he did, though he added that he respects law-abiding citizens who want to own a weapon like an AR-15 for sport or protection.

“There’s this false narrative out there that says just because you want to deal with mental illness means you don’t want to deal with the gun part. I’m willing to deal with the gun part. I don’t think people like this guy or people like him should be able to have any gun, not an AR-15, any gun. We need to create a system that keeps them from getting it,” Rubio said.

Rubio also embraced a Democratic bill in the Florida legislature to allow courts to temporarily prevent people from having guns if they are determined to be a threat to themselves or others.

Tim Scott, South Carolina

After the deadly Florida shooting, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said the “system in place simply was not followed.""

“We all say, ‘If you see something, say something,’” Scott told CBS News. “In [the] Parkland community, we saw people reporting there were 20 calls to the sheriff's department, they responded. The FBI received a legitimate, credible tip and it was not followed up upon.""

Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania

On social media, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., assured the public of his commitment to “improving our federal background check system.”

“I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them – criminals, the dangerously mentally ill and terrorists,” Toomey said.

After all, if you can print solid objects that work in three dimensional space, the possibilities seem endless – and those come with a huge responsibility. What if you make a mistake in your designs, and what you had intended to be a table ends up as some kind of arcane killing device?

Maybe you were trying to make something relatively innocuous like a shoe, but end up adding in a trigger, targeting scope, and place to insert bullets? Well, that last worry is a thing of the past, thanks to a 3D printer company that has invented a “firearm component detection algorithm.”

According to a press release by Danish company Create It REAL, the company’s new software will “prevent 3D printing of guns” by recognizing not designs for specific guns, but instead specific components that would be used in the construction of the firearms.

“There have been debates in the media on how to stop people from printing guns on their 3D printers,” the release explains. “Banning the technology would mean a huge regression towards what The Economist called the ‘third industrial revolution,’” the release continues, adding that “Banning the files which contain the 3D information of a gun does not seem to be possible in the times of digital file sharing.”

Instead, the company announced, it has created “smart software” that “upon opening a 3D file… scans the model and tries to match its characteristics with the characteristics of a firearm. If certain features align, the software will not allow the user to view and print the model.”

There are, of course, some obvious drawbacks to this model of 3D printing control (or censorship, as a harsh way to put it). For one, it relies upon specific characteristics of a weapon to be present before the design gets blocked, which is a somewhat scattershot – pun only slightly intended – way to go about things. What if someone designed a 3D printer gun that lacked traditional characteristics? Or, on the flip side, what about other non-gun objects that may match the characteristics by accident? Will those objects be similarly blocked by the software? For what it’s worth, Create It REAL CEO Jérémie Pierre Gay said that “printing other, non-firearm models is of course still possible.”

The new software is, at best, a well-meaning development that could give concerned parties some relief. Whether it can truly prevent someone determined to make their own 3D-printed gun is less obvious. After all, the only way around this barrier is to use a printer that doesn’t already have this software pre-installed."

The corporate statement was sent in response to the teen-aged gun control activists after the Parkland high school shooting.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims and their loved ones. But thoughts and prayers are not enough,” the statement read.

The popular sporting goods retailer said they will no longer sell firearms to anyone under 21 years of age, and will no longer sell “assault-style” weapons in their stores and their Field & Stream stores. They also banned the sales of “high capacity magazines.”

They admitted in their statement to selling a shotgun to the Flordia shooter in Parkland.

“It was not the gun, nor type of gun, he used in the shooting,” the statement read. “But it could have been.”

The corporate statement also urged elected officials to follow their lead for “common sense gun reform” arguing that if “even one life is saved, it will have been worth it.”"
breitbart1,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/28/trump-nra-gun-control/,"President Trump made clear Wednesday that he is moving forward with certain gun controls despite NRA opposition.

CNN quoted Trump saying, “Half of you are so afraid of the NRA. And you know what? There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

A senior administration official confirmed that the big sticking point between Trump and the NRA is Trump’s plan to raise the minimum age for rifle purchases from 18-years old 21-years old. But the White House did caveat that intention by suggesting the increased age may only be on “certain firearms.”

Either way, the NRA opposes it, and NRA leadership made this clear during meetings with Trump over the weekend.

But Trump remains determined. In addition to raising the minimum age for long gun purchases Trump is also rallying behind new gun laws for our background check system. These new laws were put forth by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and John Cornyn (R-TX), in legislation called “Fix NICS.” The legislation was introduced after the Air Force failed to report the Texas church shooter’s criminal conviction to the background check system, thus allowing him to legally acquire a gun.

Ironically, while Trump’s support Cornyn’s action on background checks, Cornyn is not excited about Trump’s effort to raise the minimum age for long gun purchases. Cornyn doubts whether raising the minimum age for long gun purchases would save lives.

breitbart2,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/28/president-trump-2/,"President Donald Trump embraced Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) gun control bill but rejected Rep. Steve Scalise’s (R-LA) push for national reciprocity during a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers Wednesday afternoon.

After listening to Sen Chris Murphy (D-CT), Trump looked at toward the end of the table and asked Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) to detail their gun control bill.

The Manchin/Toomey gun control bill is the same universal background check legislation supported by Barack Obama in the wake of the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. It the very bill that was defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate on April 17, 2013.

Toomey described it for Trump, saying the bill “strengthens the reporting of information into the background check system” and “requires background checks on all commercial sales.” This is code-talk for requiring background checks on private gun sales, which Toomey described as sales at gun shows and online (even though online sales already require a background check).

Manchin then spoke and suggested that West Virginians will support the Manchin/Toomey gun control bill if Trump will support it. He did not mention that the Manchin/Toomey bill would not have prevented the Florida attack — just as it would not have prevented the Sandy Hook attack that spawned it.

Trump spoke of the using the Manchin/Toomey bill “as a base” to which other gun bills can be added, and then continued taking comments from various senators and representatives in attendance.

When it was Rep. Scalise’s time to speak, he highlighted the crime-fighting value of concealed carriers and the need to pass national reciprocity legislation. National reciprocity was introduced in the House on January 3, 2017, and passed in the House on December 6, 2017. It was introduced in the Senate on March 1, 2017, and it has yet to come up for a vote nor has Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a word in support of it.

Trump shut down Scalise’s reciprocity push, suggesting the gun control package being pieced together would never pass if national reciprocity were added to it.

Trump looked at Scalise and said, “You know I’m your biggest fan in the whole world. I think that maybe that bill will someday pass, but it should pass as a separate bill. … You’ll never get this passed. If you add concealed carry to this, you’ll never get it passed. Let it be a separate bill.”

Trump added, “We want to get something done.”

After Vice President Mike Pence referenced gun violence restraining orders, Trump stated, “Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court. Because that’s another system. Because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early. Like, in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida, he had a lot of firearms — they saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So, you could do exactly what you’re saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.”

For those too young to remember, the “rope-a-dope” was a tactic invented and used by Muhammad Ali. It was a way he made his opponents believe he had no fight left in him so that they, in return, would punch wildly and wear themselves out.

Ali would back up against the ropes, put up his guard, and let his opponent land blow after blow after blow. The opponent, in return, would grow confident of victory and risk recklessness. The unacquainted sports fan would watch in disbelief as the great Ali appeared close to going down while the seasoned Ali fan eagerly awaited the moment when Ali would drop the charade and beat his opponent into submission.

The moment would come at the height of the opponent’s confidence, which happened to coincide with the point where the opponent had spent his energy punching an Ali who really was not that tired after all. Ali would then grin, start punching again, and win the match.

A better analogy for what President Trump may be doing to Democrats right now is hard to imagine.

After all, he campaigned against expanding background checks, yet he showed interest in Sen Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) background check gun controls and asked Manchin to put them forward.

Trump also campaigned against an “assault weapons” ban, yet he asked Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to add her “assault weapons” ban to Manchin’s gun control bill.

Furthermore, Trump spoke in favor of national reciprocity on the campaign trail, stressing his conviction that “concealed carry [is] a right, not a privilege,” yet he rejected Rep. Steve Scalise’s (R-LA) attempt to add national reciprocity to the other gun bills being discussed in the wake of the Florida school shooting.

The totality of it all makes Trump look like he is on the ropes and nearly finished fighting for the Second Amendment.

But we must ask ourselves: is Trump really done fighting, or is he just sucking in the Democrats, letting them grow overconfident of victory before unleashing a flurry that stops their gun-grabbing plan in its tracks?

Gun control “rope-a-dope.”

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) partnered with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) Wednesday to push more gun control for “assault weapon” sales in America.

The two senators are sponsoring a bill that would make 21 the minimum age to purchase an AR-15, AK-47, or related rifle.

Flake explained the proposed gun control:

If the law says someone under the age of 21 is too young to purchase a handgun, than it ought to say they’re too young to purchase an assault weapon. This bipartisan fix is long overdue, and would’ve made as much sense before the tragedy in Parkland as it does after. I hope we can work together to get this passed and signed into law without delay.

Feinstein echoed him:

Under current law, licensed gun dealers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21, but they are allowed to sell assault rifles like the AR-15 to anyone over 18. This policy is dangerous and makes absolutely no sense. If you can’t buy a beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy a weapon of war. While we need to do much more to reform our gun laws, ensuring teenagers can’t legally buy weapons of war is a commonsense step forward.

Flake and Feinstein’s bill is in response to the fact that the Florida school shooter legally purchased his rifle at age 18, the same age at which our country outfits young men with fully automatic weapons and sends them off to war.

This gun control push is addition to Feinstein’s other legislative push for an all-out ban “assault weapons,” Sen Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) push for new regulations on gun shows and private gun sales, Rep. Ted Deutch’s (D-FL) push to ban bump stocks, Rep. Brian Mast’s (R-FL) push for Trump to issue an immediate, temporary ban on the sale of AR-15s, and Rep. Carolyn Maloney’s (D-NY) call to ban “massacre machine gun magazines.”

DICK’S Sporting Goods announced Wednesday that it, too, would no longer sell guns to persons younger than 21 and would no longer sell “high capacity” magazines or “assault rifles.” This announcement marked the second time DICK’S had quit selling “assault rifles.”

Walmart released a statement on its policy shift. USA Today published an excerpt from it, which said, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales. Going forward, we are raising the age restriction for purchase of firearms and ammunition to 21 years of age.”

The New York Times reports that Walmart will also end sales of Airsoft guns that resemble an “assault rifle” and they are also ridding shelves of toy rifles that resembles AR-15s or AK-47s.

Walmart quit selling “assault rifles” in 2015. The retailer does sell handguns, expect in Alaska, and it does not sell “high capacity” magazines.

breitbart7,breitbart,['Joel B. Pollak'],2018-02-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/28/trump-guns-nra-white-house-meeting-gun-policy/,"President Donald Trump took on the National Rifle Association (NRA) — and politicians who support it — in a free-wheeling, bipartisan, televised discussion on gun laws with members of Congress at the White House Wednesday.

Trump has held several such meetings since the beginning of the year, beginning with a meeting on immigration in January. The events are virtually unprecedented in showing Americans a civil and open exchange of views on contentious issues among leaders — and, occasionally, ordinary citizens — on both sides of the political divide.

This meeting was different, however, in that the president was not just listening, but driving policy in a particular direction.

And that direction — perhaps to the dismay of some of Trump’s core supporters — is toward gun control.

At one point, Trump dismissed a suggestion by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) — who was wounded last summer in a mass shooting targeting Republicans — to allow national reciprocity for concealed carry permits.

Trump told Scalise bluntly: “I think that maybe that bill will someday pass but it should pass as a separate bill… You’ll never get this passed. If you add concealed carry to this you’ll never get it passed. Let it be a separate bill.”

Trump defended the idea of raising the minimum age to purchase a rifle — at least, the AR-15 used in the Parkland, Florida shooting earlier this month — to 21, pointing out that handguns already had such an age requirement, but that the shooter had still been able to buy the rifle he used.

Trump acknowledged that the NRA was opposed to the proposal. “I’m a fan of the NRA. There’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA … These are great people, these are great patriots,” he said. “They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.”

Then, in an exchange that captured the attention of the mainstream media, Trump told Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) that they were “afraid of the NRA” after they told him that their bipartisan bill to expand background checks had not included a provision to raise the minimum age to purchase a rifle.

Toomey responded by defending the view that adults over 18 should be able to own rifles: “My reservation about it, frankly, is that the vast majority of 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds in Pennsylvania who have a rifle or a shotgun — they’re not a threat to anyone. They’re law-abiding citizens. They have that because they want to use it for hunting or target shooting. And to deny them their Second Amendment right is not going to make anyone safer.”

The president acknowledged that argument, but went on to argue that Republicans should add Democrat ideas into one compromise bill. His emphasis was on expanding and improving background checks, but he was clearly open to more ambitious proposals — or at least wanted to be seen open to other ideas. He dismissed the idea of “gun-free zones,” describing them as dangerous — but he also wanted to push gun control legislation forward.

How much of Trump’s performance was theatre is anyone’s guess. When asked by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) whether he would actually sign a bill to raise the minimum age for purchasing a rifle, Trump dodged carefully: “I’ll tell you what: I’m going to give it a lot of consideration, and I’m the one bringing it up, and a lot of people don’t even want to bring it up, because they’re afraid to bring it up.”

It is possible that Trump simply wanted to be seen as fighting the NRA, while at the same time bringing out the NRA’s arguments — such as Toomey’s response — in the mouths of other people. That way, Trump could cast himself as a leader on the issue, without committing to legal changes that would alienate a core part of his base.

But conservatives will, no doubt, worry about his apparent concessions to Democrats — and how far they could go.

Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) urged her colleagues to ban “massacre machine gun magazines” Tuesday in the wake of the February 14 Florida school shooting.

The immediate problem with her position is that Nikolas Cruz did not use a machine gun to attack the school, he simply used a common semiautomatic rifle.

Business Insider‘s Joe Perticone tweeted:

Rep. Carolyn Maloney just said we need to ban “machine gun magazines.” — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) February 27, 2018

The Media Research Center published Maloney’s full quote, saying, “We really need to act in a number of ways. We need to pass an assault weapons ban. We need to ban the massacre machine gun magazines, and we need comprehensive background checks.”

When Democrats push for “comprehensive background checks,” they are talking about universal background checks. Such checks outlaw private gun sales by requiring every sale–public or private–to be conducted via an FBI background check. The problem with this push is that the Florida gunman passed a background check to acquire the rifle he used in the attack.

The grocery chain sells guns and ammunition at its Fred Meyer stores in the western U.S. Those sales will continue but persons under the age of 21 will be prohibited from purchase.

CNN Money reports that Kroger released a statement, saying, “In response to the tragic events in Parkland and elsewhere, we’ve taken a hard look at our policies and procedures for firearm sales. Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers.”

Kroger doe not sell AR-15s or similar weapons, but has allowed such weapons to be special ordered at Alaska store locations. They are ending the special order option for such guns as well.

On Wednesday Dick’s Sporting Goods ended “assault rifle” sales for the second time since the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. They also announced they will no longer sell “high capacity” magazines and they raised their minimum long gun purchase age to 21.

Also on Wednesday, Walmart made clear it will no longer carry toy guns that resemble AR-15s and announced it will not sell guns to anyone under the age of 21.

breitbart10,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-01-16 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/16/fake-news-cnn-claims-gop-trying-remove-200000-tax-firearm-suppressors/,"During a January 14 report on Republican efforts to reduce restrictions on firearm suppressors, CNN said one of the GOP’s goals is to eliminate the “$200,000 tax” on the devices.

CNN intimated that the GOP wants to get rid of the “lengthy background check” associated with suppressors as well.

In fact, the tax is $200 dollars–not $200,000–and the background check is one of the only current requirements that the GOP plans to keep in place for suppressors. What they want to get rid of is the bureaucracy of the purchase, whereby law-abiding citizens are required to be photographed, fingerprinted, and then to register their suppressor with the government. And yes, the GOP also wants to get rid of the $200 tax.

CNN referenced the tax correctly later in the segment, but the mention of a “$200,000 tax” was how they launched it.

Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) introduced legislation on January 9 that will accomplish all these things. Their bill is the Hearing Protection Act and it is focused on the hearing benefits shooters and outdoorsmen receive from suppressed firearms.

CNN’s Victor Blackwell addressed the Hearing Protection Act and said opponents of suppressors see any hearing benefits claims as a “facade.” He then showed movie clips from Casino Royale and No Country for Old Men and a narrator said, “A gun silencer, shooting enthusiasts call it a suppressor. It’s an assassin’s must have in movies.” The narrator says that opponents of the Hearing Protection Act say the real goal is “about militarizing weapons, not about hearing,” and that suppressor ownership “will allow mass shooters to kill stealthily.”

In reporting this way, CNN shows the Democrats’ hand–as far as opposition to suppressors is concerned. They plan to fight against them the same way they fight against thumb-hole stocks, flash hiders, and collapsible stocks via “assault weapons” bans. And they will try to shame pro-suppressor lawmakers into inaction by suggesting that suppressors make it possible to attack innocents without detection. Americans who are paying attention will quickly realize that the people making these arguments need to quit forming their opinions on suppressors from Hollywood films.

breitbart11,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2014-09-24 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/09/24/how-gun-control-made-england-the-most-violent-country-in-europe/,"Gun control in Britain passed in stages, beginning just after World War I and continuing in a reactionary fashion with increasing strictness through the 1990s.

When the final stage arrived in 1997, and virtually all handguns were banned via the Firearms Act, the promise was a reduction in crime and greater safety for the British people. But the result was the emergence of Britain as the “most violent country in Europe.”

Britain began placing restrictions on gun ownership after World War I with the Firearms Act of 1920. The passage of this act was emotionally driven, based in part on the public’s war-weariness and in part on the fear that an increased number of guns–guns from the battle field–would increase crime.

The Firearms Act of 1920 did not ban guns. Rather, it required that citizens who wanted a gun had to first obtain a certificate from the government. We see this same stage taking place in various places in the United States now, where a person who wants a firearm has to get a Fire Owner Identification Card (Illinois) or has to be vetted by police (Massachusetts) or both.

Thirteen years after the passage of the Firearms Act, British Parliament passed the Firearms and Imitation Firearms Bill, making the possession of a replica gun or a real one equally punishable unless the owner of either could show the lawful purpose for which he had it. (Sounds like California?) This was followed by the Firearms Act of 1937, which author Frank Miniter says “extended restrictions to shotguns and granted chief constables the power to add conditions to individual private firearm certificates.”

In the U.S., police departments in Massachusetts play the role Britain’s chief constables played and have final say on who can or can’t own a firearm. On July 25, Breitbart News reported that that Massachusetts police were pressing for “sole discretion” on who could own a long gun; they already had such discretion over who could own a handgun. On August 1, they received the power they sought.

Britain continued to issue firearm certificates as World War II set in. But by the time the war was over, the gun control mindset had permeated society to a point where self-defense was no longer a valid reason to secure a certificate for gun ownership.

Guns were simply for sport or for hunting.

In 1987, Michael Ryan shot and killed sixteen people in Hungerford, including his mother. He wounded fourteen others, then killed himself. According to the Library of Congress, Ryan used “lawfully owned” rifles to carry out the attack. Nevertheless, his attack prompted the passage of more laws in the form of the Firearms Act of 1988. This act “banned the possession of high-powered self loading rifles” and “burst-firing weapons,” and imposed “stricter standards for ownership” to secure a government certificate to own a shotgun.

In 1996, Thomas Hamilton walked into an elementary school in Dunblane, Scotland, and shot and killed “sixteen small children…and their teacher in the gym before killing himself.” He brought two rifles and four handguns to carry out the attack. All six guns were legally owned: Hamilton had fully complied with gun control statutes.

The Firearm Act of 1997 was passed while emotions ran high. Gun control proponents push for an all-out ban on private gun ownership, in the much the same way that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) reacted to the heinous crime at Sandy Hook Elementary by trying to ban approximately 150 different guns.

Yet the Firearm Act did not ban all guns, “but served to essentially prohibit the ownership of handguns in Britain” and to make the acquisition of certificate to possess a long gun an onerous and time-consuming one. Much the same as the onerous and time-consuming process now burdening law-abiding DC residents seeking a gun in the home for self-defense.

And what has been the outcome of passing more laws in Britain to remedy the fact that other laws were ignored or broken? It has not been good.

In 2009, twelve years after the Firearms Act of 1997 was passed, Daily Mail Online reported that Britain was “the most violent country in Europe.” They also reported that Britain’s home figures showed “the UK [had] a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and South Africa.”

breitbart12,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-01-02 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/02/gun-control-legacy-91-percent-of-chicago-homicides-committed-with-firearm/,"Chicago and gun control are so intertwined that the legacy of one is the legacy of the other. With that said, it is worth noting that “about 91 percent” of Chicago homicides in 2016 were committed with a firearm, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Think about it–Chicago has played host to decades of gun control experiments, including an all-out handgun ban from 1982-2010. Yet 2016 witnessed 779 homicides in the city, and over 9 out of 10 of those were firearm-related. And even after the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down Illinois’ ban on concealed carry in December 2012, city leaders fought to make implementation of concealed carry as difficult as possible. For example, on September 15, 2013, American Thinker reported that Mayor Rahm Emanuel was fighting to block off sections of the city where concealed carry permit holders would be barred from carrying guns for self-defense.

These and other gun controls ultimately do one thing–they make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to acquire and carry the guns they need for self-defense, while doing nothing to curtail the behavior of criminals, who will always acquire and carry the guns they use in crime.

Fast-forward to 2016 and Chicago’s gun-control legacy–779 homicides, more than 9 out of 10 of which were committed with a firearm.

On January 2, 2017, the Chicago Tribune pointed to a recent study from the University of Chicago Crime Lab which shows “that of the five largest U.S. cities by population, including New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Houston, Chicago has seen the largest single-year homicide increase of the last 25 years.” Moreover, whereas “Los Angeles’ homicides committed with guns averaged 72 percent from 2011 to 2015, and 60 percent in New York City,” the rate is Chicago is now “about 91 percent.”

University of Chicago social service administration professor Jens Ludwig stressed that the growing use of guns for homicide in Chicago does not necessarily mean there are more guns in Chicago now than in the past. Rather, the situation may simply be that criminals feel less compunction about using guns to take lives in cold blood; therefore, more firearm-related homicides are showing up.

It is interesting to note that the rate of firearm usage in homicides was “about 76 percent” in 1998. That climbed to “88 percent” on Obama’s watch during 2015, and now sits at “about 91 percent.” This is the legacy of gun control.

Serrano (D-29) is pushing legislation that will require retailers to label a traditional gun which lacks a disabling device as a “child operated firearm.”

The legislation–Senate Bill S3444–then bans the sale of any “child operated firearm.”

According to the official New York State Senate website, S3444 “Proscribes persons, firms or corporations engaged in retail business of selling firearms from selling, delivering or transferring child operated firearms.”

The summary of S3444 says:

Prohibits persons, firms or corporations engaged in the retail business of selling firearms from selling, delivering or transferring child operated firearms; defines “child operated firearm” to mean a pistol or revolver manufactured 1 year after the effective date of these provisions which does not contain a childproofing device or mechanism incorporated into the design of such pistol or revolver.

The test for whether a pistol or revolver is child-proofed is whether the gun has a “childproofing device or mechanism incorporated into [it]” which is sufficient to prevent “an average five-year-old” from operating the firearm.

The devices and mechanisms to make traditional guns acceptable are to include “the capacity to adjust the trigger resistance to at least a 10 pound pull, the capacity to alter the firing mechanism so that an average five-year-old’s hands are too small to operate the pistol or revolver, or the capacity to require a series of multiple motions in order to fire the pistol or revolver.”

S3444 does not stipulate how law-abiding citizens in life and death situations are supposed to compensate for the additional time needed go through “a series of multiple motions” before firing a gun in self-defense.

The bill, AB1927, is presented as a way that people with suicidal thoughts can take away the option of acquiring a firearm with which to carry out their intentions.

The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Bonta’s bill comes despite the fact that California has a 10-day waiting period for firearm sales. That waiting period was ubiquitously put in place to prevent people from acquiring firearms with which to impulsively harm themselves or others. But Bonta pointed to a study which indicated Californians who take their own lives are simply doing so in the first week after the gun purchase is finalized.

Under Bonta’s bill, Californians who bar themselves from gun purchases would be able to recover their Second Amendment rights by demonstrating “they were no longer a danger to themselves or others.” He did not say what such a demonstration would entail.

Gabby Giffords’ gun control group cheered Bonta’s bill, saying, “We support legislation that would empower people struggling with suicidal urges to promote their own health and safety in moments of calm and clarity by voluntarily adding their names to confidential gun background-check databases for a temporary period.”

In addition to a 10-day waiting period for gun purchases California has an “assault weapons” ban, universal background checks, gun registration requirements, gun confiscation laws, Gun Violence Protection Orders, a “good cause” requirement for concealed carry permit issuance, ammunition controls, and a soon-to-be requirement that all ammunition buyers pass a point-of-sale background check for a box of bullets. Despite these and numerous other controls, Bonta believes California needs another gun law.

The advocate — Kirsten Powers — spoke to the Elmhurst city council, seeking assurances that those taking the course would not be bringing firearms with them.

NRATV’s Cam Edwards tweeted:

According to the Chicago Tribune, Powers said people who previously attended the concealed carry class said they were “required to bring a firearm” and were “required to shoot on the last day of class.” But Elmhurst police chief Michael Ruth made clear that the truth was otherwise — the classes in Elmhurst will be gun-free and the shooting portion, which is required, will be conducted “at a firing range outside the city.”

The classes are held Saturday and Sunday in the Knights of Columbus Hall at 537 S. York Street in Elmhurst. Following the Sunday class, attendees can drive to the range and satisfy the shooting requirements. Ruth said those attending the shooting portion must have a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card, and their weapons must be “broken down and not easily accessible from within the vehicle” during transport.

The Deerfield Patch reports that Illinois “[requires] 16 hours of training” for a concealed carry permit. And Illinois does not recognize concealed carry licenses from any other states.

Breitbart News previously reported on a 2012 Congressional Research Service study showing gun ownership jumped from 192 million privately owned guns in 1994 to 309 million in 2009. At the same time, the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” of 6.6 per 100,000 Americans in 1993 fell to 3.6 per 100,000 in 2000 and as far as 3.2 per 100,000 in 2011.

Now, newly released Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) numbers show the firearm-related murder rate maintained this low rate through 2014 — the most recent year in which the CDC has numbers to report. CNS.news quoted CDC numbers showing the “firearm homicide rate” at 3.43 per 100,000 in 2014. At the same time, gun sales continued at a record-setting pace.

For example, Breitbart News reported that 2013 gun sales broke the previous annual gun sales record by a large margin. There were 21,093,723 background checks for gun buyers in 2013 alone. Gun sales continued apace in the following year, with Black Friday gun sales booming. CNN reported “almost three background checks per second” on Black Friday 2014.

In summary, the 192 million privately owned guns in 1994 swelled to 309 million privately owned guns in 2009 and continued to grow by leaps and bounds thereafter. An estimate of 330 to 340 million privately owned guns by the end of 2014 is no stretch. And while the theories of the left would suggest such a massive jump in gun ownership must result in more bloodshed, empirical evidence shows that more guns actually correlated with a sharp decline in the firearm-related homicide rate between 1993 and 2014.

The information was released as part of the response to a Southern California Public Radio (KPCC) reporter’s Freedom of Information Act request. The reporter was seeking information on state Firearms Safety Certifications.

Fox News reports that information on “3,424 firearms instructors” was inadvertently released. That information contained “dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and California identification numbers.” On December 28, 2016 — over two months after the release of information was discovered — “the California Department of Justice sent out a letter to all of the Golden State’s instructors letting them know their personal information had been compromised.”

California Attorney General Kamala Harris also used the letter to “[recommend that] firearm instructors place a fraud alert on their credit. Since driver’s license numbers are appealing to identity thieves, a fraud alert could prevent criminals from misusing someone’s personal data.”

The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) is asking why it took the state two months to alert the firearms instructors about the leak.

NRA-ILA’s Jennifer Baker said:

This privacy breach is just another example of the California Department of Justice’s disregard for the rights of gun owners. There’s no reason why the private information of firearms instructors should have been released – the DOJ redacts information all the time.

The use of suppressors is legal in 42 states and certainly provide protections to the environment and the human ear. But the path to acquiring a suppressor is circuitous because the items are regulated under the auspices of the National Firearm Act (1934).

This means acquisition of a suppressor requires finger prints, photographs of the purchaser, a background check, a $200 federal tax, and registration. Such regulations not only raises the price of suppressors but also increases the time it takes to purchase one.

A waiting period of 4 to 6 months is not uncommon.

Under President Trump this can change. Donald Trump Jr. made this clear during a September 26 interview with SilencerCo, in which he said:

I’ve had the privilege of being able to hunt in Europe, where some of the strictest gun laws in the world exist. And guess what, virtually every hunting gun there is suppressed. It’s about safety. If you have that kind of noise levels in any of industry, like you do shooting sports, OSHA would be going crazy. It’s about safety.

Don Jr. went on to describe the regulation surrounding suppressors as “just another rule the government wants to put in place for no reason.” He added, “If Europe can do it, America better well be able to do it.”

SilencerCo’s CEO Joshua Waldron stated that “it’s crazy to be behind the curve” on suppressors, when contrasted with Europe. And Don Jr. concurred, saying it is the result of “arbitrary policies [made] by people who don’t know what they’re talking about.”

Waldron then brought up Representative Matt Salmon’s (R-AZ-5) Hearing Protection Act; a legislative push that would remove suppressors from National Firearms Act oversight so Americans could more easily acquire them for hearing protection while target shooting or hunting. He asked if President-elect Trump would support such changes once in office, and Don Jr. said, “We want to go through Congress, want to do it the right way, but if you line up those votes he is obviously going to be for it.”

The incident occurred around 4:15 a.m.

According to KSAL, 51-year-old Mark Kind got up to investigate sounds of someone allegedly trying to break in. When he made it to the front of the house he reportedly found 38-year-old Jason Allen Wooderson in his truck. He called police and held Wooderson at gunpoint until officers were on the scene.

Police discovered Wooderson was allegedly in possession of “marijuana, methamphetamine and other paraphernalia.”

He faces numerous drug-related charges and one charge of “criminal trespass.”

On August 10, Breitbart News reported that a concealed carry permit holder intervened and held a robbery suspect at gunpoint in a neighbor’s drive in Broadman, Ohio. On August 11, Breitbart News reported on 24 different incidents where armed citizens used guns to save lives over a six-week period.

But on January 12, 2017, the New York Times editorial board claimed, “The grim truth is that concealed-carry permit holders are rarely involved in stopping crime.”

His response came in response to an audience member who was asking how Democrats can justify pushing gun control when it was clearly the presence of a gun in the hands of Willeford that ended the attack.

On November 6 Texas officials credited Willeford with ending the attack.

Willeford, who is a former NRA instructor and current NRA member, ran out of his house barefoot with an AR-15 in hand, took cover behind a vehicle and shot killer Devin Kelley when he walked out of the church. Kelley then fled the scene, only to crash and die roughly 15 minutes later. Breitbart News reported that Senate Democrats responded by introducing a ban on the type of gun Willeford used to end the attack.

On Today, audience member Brianna asked, “How do you justify the Democrat view on gun control when the shooter was stopped by a man who was legally licensed to carry a gun?”

Biden replied, “Well, first of all, the kind of gun being carried he shouldn’t be carrying.” He then specifically mentioned “assault weapons” and said, “I wrote the last serious gun control law that was written, it was law for 10 years. And it outlawed assault weapons and it outlawed weapons with magazines that had a whole lot of bullets, as you can kill a whole lot of people more quickly.”

He added, “Number two, it’s just rational to say certain people shouldn’t have guns. Now the fact that some people with guns are legally able to acquire a gun and they turn out to be crazy after the fact, that’s life. There’s nothing you can do about that.”

Again, Brianna was asking how Democrats can justify pushing more gun control in light of the fact that an armed citizen used a gun, an AR-15 in this case, to stop the Texas church attack.

Breitbart News reported that the Broken Arrow homeowner’s 23-year-old son shot and killed three suspected home intruders with an AR-15. According to Tulsa World, Wagoner County Sheriff’s deputy Nick Mahoney said the three suspects “were wearing all-black clothing, masks, and gloves” and allegedly “forced their way into the home through a glass door in the back.” The homeowner’s son was asleep at the time and awoke to “loud bangs” as the suspects made entrance. The son grabbed the AR-15 and opened fire when the intruders walked into the hallway.

Deputy Mahoney said “investigators found a knife on one of the deceased in the kitchen and brass knuckles on the other.”

ABC 8 reports that Leroy Schumacher, grandfather of deceased 17-year-old suspect Jacob Redfearn, says what the boys “did was stupid” but they did not deserve to die.” He added, “Brass knuckles against an AR-15, come on, who was afraid for their life.”

He said the use of the AR-15 meant “his grandson didn’t have a chance.”

Investigators believe the homeowner’s son acted in self-defense, but Schumacher does not believe the son’s actions should be legal. He said, “There’s got to be a limit to that law, I mean he shot all three of them; there was no need for that.”

John Kasich (R) removed pro-gun content from his website Sunday and asked if Americans would really lose anything if the government took away their AR-15s.

The pro-gun content consisted of descriptions of pro-Second Amendment bills he signed as Gov., as well as “photos illustrating how he opposed former President Barack Obama’s gun control efforts.”

According to Cleveland.com, adviser John Weaver explained that Kasich emerged from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting with “new views” on guns.

Weaver tweeted:

.@JohnKasich is a supporter of the 2nd Amendment, but like many Americans – if not most – his views have evolved with the dramatic increase in school shootings & mass killings. We want our leaders to be unafraid to observe, listen & learn. We urge the ""president"" to follow suit. — John Weaver (@JWGOP) February 18, 2018

In addition to erasing pro-gun content from his website, Kasich suggested gun owners’ rights would not be harmed if the government took away their AR-15s.

Cleveland.com quoted Kasich from a CNN appearance, in which he said, “What would you lose?” Kasich said on television. “Would you feel as though your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn’t buy a God darn AR-15? These are the things that have to be looked at, and action has to happen.”

Kasich added, “If you’re a strong Second Amendment person you need to slow down and take a look at reasonable things that can be done to answer these young people.”

The alleged invasion occurred around 12:30 pm on Clearwater Drive.

According to the Tulsa World, Wagoner County Sheriff’s deputy Nick Mahoney said the three home invasion suspects “were wearing all-black clothing, masks and gloves” and allegedly “forced their way into the home through a glass door in the back.” The homeowner’s 23-year-old son was asleep at the time, but awoke to “loud bangs” as the suspects made entrance. The son grabbed the AR-15, took position, and opened fire when the intruders walked into the hallway.

Two of the suspects collapsed and died in the kitchen, a third suspect managed to get out of the house but collapsed and died in the yard.

Two of the deceased individuals were “16 0r 17” years old. One of the suspects was “18 or 19.” Deputy Mahoney said “investigators found a knife on one of the deceased in the kitchen and brass knuckles on the other.”

Later on Monday, 21-year-old “Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez of Oologah” went to the Broken Arrow Police Department and turned herself in. She confessed to being the getaway driver for the dead trio and was arrested. She was charged with “three complaints each of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary.”

An unidentified neighbor who heard the homeowner’s son open fire said, “The shots were so loud — loud enough that I ran to the window to see what had happened. Something in me knew it was gunshots, but I didn’t know what had happened until I went to leave my house and saw all the police officers.”

Pat Roberts (R-KS) supports banning that “bump magazine” and raising the minimum purchase age for an AR-15 to 25.

By “bump magazine” Roberts is referring to a bump stock, which numerous lawmakers supported banning on October 2, 2017, although they did not even know the accessories existed on September 30, 2017.

CJOnline.com reports that Roberts received hundreds of thousands of dollars and a “consistent ‘A’ [rating]” from the NRA in the past.

He said, “I don’t think there’s any reason we can’t get rid of that bump magazine. Then there’s the talk about the AR-15, or the AK-47 if you really want to go back a ways, limiting that to the range. If people want that, then they’re going to have to be older. Obviously, they’re going to have to have training. Hunters don’t use that, or if they do, they shouldn’t.”

When asked specifically about a minimum age for purchasing AR-15s, Roberts said, “I’d raise that to 21. Hell, I’d raise that to 25.”

The NRA is opposed to raising minimum ages for firearm purchases. CNN quoted the NRA’s Jennifer Baker:

Federal Law prohibits adults under the age of 21 from purchasing a handgun from a licensed firearm dealer. Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection.

Sen. Roberts responded, saying, “I think the NRA’s going to be a little flexible on this. I think it would be in their best interest.”

The ruling came in Kolbe v. Hogan.

The NRA-ILA reported that the 4th Circuit described “assault weapons” as “exceptionally lethal weapons of war.” The court ruled that the differences between the wildly popular AR-15 and actual battlefield guns like an M-16 are only “slight.” Of course, one of those “slight” differences is that the M-16 is a fully automatic firearm, which means it shoots continuously when the trigger is pulled. An AR-15 is a semiautomatic rifle that only fires one bullet each time the trigger is pulled.

According to Reuters:

The 4th Circuit… [ruled] the military-style guns used in a disproportionate share of the mass killings in the U.S. are outside the aegis of the Second Amendment because they are most suited for military use.

This is problematic inasmuch as AR-15s are not used in an disproportionate number of mass public attacks in the U.S. Consider the following:

Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (January 6, 2017) – Handgun

Burlington Mall attacker (September 23, 2016) – .22 Rifle

NY bombing susptect (September 16, 2016) – Glock Handgun

the Orlando attacker (June 12, 2016) – AR-15-style rifle

the UCLA gunman (June 1, 2016) – Handgun

the San Bernardino attackers (December 2, 2015) – Handguns, AR-15-style rifles

the Umpqua Community College attacker (October 1, 2015) – three Handguns and an AR-15-style rifle (ABC News)

Alison Parker’s attacker (August 26, 2015) – Glock Handgun

the Lafayette movie theater attacker (July 23, 2015) – Handgun

the Chattanooga attacker (July 16, 2015) – Shotgun, AK-47-style rifle, Handgun (NBC News)

the alleged Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker (Jun 17, 2015) – Glock Handgun

the Las Vegas cop killers (June 9, 2015) – Four Handguns and a shotgun (New York Daily News)

the Santa Barbara attacker (May 23, 2014) – Handgun

the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014) – Handgun

the Arapahoe High School attacker (December 13, 2013) – Shotgun

the D.C. Navy Yard attacker (September 16, 2013) – Shotgun

the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012) – AR-15-style rifle

Gabby Giffords’s attacker (January 8, 2011) – Glock handgun

the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009) – Handgun

the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) – Glock Handgun

Out of those 20 high-profile public attacks, AR-15-style rifles were used five times. You could stretch that figure to six by including the AK-47-style rifle used in the Chattanooga attack, but there is still no way to make the argument that AR-15-style rifles were “used in a disproportionate share of the mass killings.” That designation clearly goes to handguns, which are much more concealable and therefore much easier to carry into crowded locations for an attack.

It is interesting to note that the 4th Circuit’s ruling comes in the wake of a “white paper” in which ATF Associate Deputy Director Ronald Turk argued against ongoing importation bans on “assault weapons.” Turk argued on the grounds that such weapons are increasingly popular for sport shooting and are actually “standard for hunting activities.” The Washington Post published the paper in which Turk said continued opposition to the weapons is based on an “almost 20-year-old study.”

But the 4th Circuit described the sporting and hunting rifles as “exceptionally lethal weapons of war.”

Bill Nelson (D-FL) indicated that the he wants to ban over 200 different rifles in response to last week’s Florida school shooting.

The Florida school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, used an AR-15, so Nelson wants to ban semiautomatic Kalashnikov’s too.

Nelson stood during the town hall and said:

The bill that I have co-sponsored defines very specifically “assault rifle.” It lists 200 different “assault rifles.” It lists, for example, the Kalashnikov AK-47 that, did you know, is manufactured in [Florida]. Did you know that the state of Florida, the Governor’s office, gave financial incentives for them to come into the state and manufacture?

He continued:

I’ll tell you another [gun] that is listed in that list of over 200 rifles. It is the Sig Sauer MCX. That is the one that Omar Mateen, despite the fact that he had been on the terrorist watch list and was off, went into a gun shop and purchased that high powered “assault rifle.” And on that list it also includes the AR-15. And did you know, that the state of Florida, the Governor’s office, gave financial incentives for the Colt company to come to [Florida] to manufacture AR-15s.

Notice Nelson’s quiet admission that Omar Mateen was not on a terrorist watch list when he bought his rifle at a gun shop. In other words, Mateen legally purchased his rifle, but Nelson is trying to build momentum for terror watch list gun control instead of admitting that background checks are impotent to stop determined attackers.

Breitbart News reported that Sen. Nelson took time on February 15 and 16 to claim the AR-15 is “not for hunting” but for killing. Because of this, he intimated that AR-15 does not enjoy Second Amendment protections.

But ATF Associate Deputy Director Ronald Turk says the AR-15 is “now the standard for hunting activities.” In fact, Turk says the use of AR-15s for hunting is so widespread that the ATF should revisit previous studies on the gun and amend them.

On January 20, 2017, the Washington Post published a “White Paper” wherein Turk wrote:

The use of AR-15s, AK-style, and similar rifles now commonly referred to as “modern sporting rifles” has increased exponentially in sport shooting. These firearm types are now standard for hunting activities. ATF could re-examine its 20-year-old study to bring it up to date with the sport shooting landscape of today, which is vastly different than it was years ago.

Nelson seeks to ban over 200 rifles due to the criminal misuse of one rifle, an AR-15, on February 14. Along the way he makes claims about the AR-15 that are demonstrably false.

breitbart28,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-06-12 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/12/ar-15-users-guide-ignorant-media-pundits/,"Every time someone who passed a background check uses an AR-15 to open fire in a gun-free zone, ignorant media pundits and their ready surrogates in Hollywood and D.C. talk about the need to ban automatic weapons.

But the AR-15 is not an automatic weapon — it is a semi-automatic weapon. In other words, it does not shoot multiple rounds each time the trigger is pulled. Rather, it fires one. That’s right — one round per trigger pull. But this seems to be lost on a growing number of outlets, celebrities, and politicians. So, Breitbart News thought it best to present this handy AR-15 users guide for those who simply don’t get it.

The AR-15 is a rifle that shoots .223 and/or 5.56 rounds. Americans love it because it is reliable, accurate, and numerous accessories are available for it. Those accessories range from lights to special grips, stocks, optics, sight packages, and beyond. Because of this, the AR-15 has become the Colt 1911 of rifles. Like the 1911, you can always buy the part you need to make it better or repair it in the event that something breaks.

The gun is great for women as well as men — for petite-framed people as well as large — because the stock absorbs the recoil. So even though the rifle shoots a .223 or 5.56, it does so with less recoil than a .410 shotgun and just slightly more than a .22 rifle.

The gun shoots one round every time the trigger is pulled — period. Yet following the terror attack on Pulse nightclub in Orlando, UK’s The Telegraph described the rifle as “controversial” and claimed that it “[allows] a rogue gunmen [sic] to kill dozens of people in a matter of seconds.” What The Telegraph is alluding to is the spray-and-pray tactic of shooting whereby a gunman simply squeezes the trigger repeatedly, rattling off as many rounds as he can, hoping some of them find their target. Although such an approach to shooting appears to be wildly popular with gun control advocates — many of whom may have never shot a gun — it is not an accurate or efficient way to shoot an AR-15. It is not reality.

Knowing the rifle — the same way a concealed carry permit holder knows his or her handgun — is crucial, and this is because shot placement is crucial. Perhaps this would not be so if shooting an AR-15 were the kind of thing leftists depict in their movies, where “assault weapons” often fire fully automatic, and the ammunition magazine appears to be limitless. But in the real world, every shot has to count.

Regardless of these things, some of the early reports on the Pulse Orlando nightclub shooting included references to an automatic weapon. Many of those references disappeared as the day went on, but they were there nonetheless.

Additionally, celebrities like Seth McFarlene tweeted things like: “These shootings are a regular occurrence. You don’t get to be “shocked” anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons.”

These shootings are a regular occurrence. You don't get to be ""shocked"" anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons. — Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016

And during the June 12 airing of Meet the Press, Bernie Sanders said, “We should not be selling automatic weapons.”

Sanders’s statement is nothing new for Democratic office holders. Breitbart News previously reported Hillary Clinton’s penchant for referring to AR-15s as “automatic weapons.”

So far, Clinton, Sanders, McFarlene, The Telegraph, and so many other outlets that don’t know any better, let’s say it together — an AR-15 is not an automatic weapon. It is a semi-automatic rifle that Americans own for target shooting, hunting, and self-defense.

The AR-15 was donated by Black Rain Ordinance Inc., and tickets cost $5 apiece.

The Kansas City Star reports that team coach Levi Patterson has received numerous harsh and negative messages since launching the raffle, but noticed that ticket purchases increased with the vitriol. Negative posts on Facebook convinced people as far away as Colorado to buy tickets in order to fund the Missouri team.

One of the negative messages was posted to Patterson’s Facebook page by someone going by the name Dan Weaver after the Florida school shooting. Weaver wrote, “Are you all tone deaf? AR-15 kills seventeen so you raffle a gun for child sports? Lord, people wake the hell up. Justify all you want but you are wrong, period.”

Others complained that children were being forced to sell raffle tickets for a “killing machine.”

Patterson responded to the naysayers, writing, “We appreciate your ‘concern’ but please understand, we are not, have not, and will not force one of our boys to sell raffle tickets for the Black Rain AR15 Spec 15, if they are uncomfortable doing so.”

The raffle was planned before the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last week, and normal background check procedures will still apply for the prize winner.

The winner of the rifle will be announced March 17.

The California DOJ was forced to turn over documentation related to the changes because of public records request that the Firearms Policy Coalition and the California Rifle and Pistol Association made.

Guns.com obtained and then published the regulatory changes, which include a revamped online registration system to allow Californians to register their “assault weapons” prior to January 1, 2018, when California’s latest “assault weapons” ban takes effect. The Firearms Policy Coalition reports this ban requires registration of all “assault weapons” outfitted with “bullet buttons” for magazine release.

The catch is that the online “assault weapons” registration site notifies people in bold blue letters:

The ability to register an Assault Weapon pursuant to Assembly Bill (AB) 1135 and Senate Bill (SB) 880, is not yet available. Pursuant to AB 1135 and SB 880, Assault Weapon registration regulations must be effective before any registrations can take place. At this time, the regulations are still pending, however they should be effective in the very near future.

But once the online system is working, residents registering their weapons online will have “to upload four clear digital photos of the firearm including of the magazine release, of each side of the receiver and of the barrel.” People registering homemade firearms “will have to send in photos of the now-mandated DOJ-supplied serial number after it has been permanently applied to the gun.” In both cases, the fee for registration will be $15.

This confusing and ever-changing maze of gun control regulations is a testimony to the train wreck that results when gun control is passed for the sake of gun control, when an honest pursuit of safety is exchanged for an equally honest war on the Second Amendment.

The 60 pages of regulatory changes can be viewed here.

A similar approach, Operation Choke Point, was used by the Department of Justice during Barack Obama’s second term in office and has been targeted for closure under the Trump administration.

On August 17, 2017, Politico quoted House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlette describing Operation Choke Point as “a misguided initiative.” Goodlette observed, “Law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor.”

But NYT says banks and credit card companies could continue such policies by simply banding together against certain aspects of the firearms industry.

NYT reports: “PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.”

They floated this possibility:

Visa, which published a 71-page paper in 2016 espousing its “corporate responsibility,” could easily change its terms of service to say that it won’t do business with retailers that sell assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, which make semiautomatic rifles fire faster. (Even the National Rifle Association has said it would support tighter restrictions on bump stocks.)

They continued, “If Mastercard were to do the same, assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system.”

The message is clear–if Senators and House Members stand for the Second Amendment instead of gun control, then circumvent those Senators and House Members via a monolithic approach to banking that omits any financial opportunity related to “assault weapons.”

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and about two dozen other Democrats could mean prison time for anyone who loans an AR-15 rifle to a friend.

She introduced her ban on November 8, just three days after the heinous attack in Texas, marking the umpteenth time she has introduced such a ban since the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School.

As is typical for gun control introduced by Feinstein, her “assault weapons” ban does much more than ban assault weapons. It also bans “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and creates a punitive system whereby AR-15 owners could face prison time for loaning their rifle to a friend. According to the NRA-ILA, owners of “grandfathered” AR-15s would have to seek out a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL) and have their friend undergo a background check in order to legally loan the gun. Data of the transaction would be recorded on the backside of that transaction, thereby contributing to the compilation of a gun owner’s database.

This is the second time in roughly five weeks that Feinstein has pushed an “assault weapons” ban. And she admits that she is introducing it over and over again in the event that a shift in the make-up of the Senate makes it feasible to secure a vote. Until such a shift occurs, she wants her liberal constituents to see her pushing gun control.

The Hill quoted her saying, “We’re introducing an updated Assault Weapons Ban for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.”

It should be noted that the Texas church attacker did not acquire his guns by borrowing them from a friend but by passing background checks.

Think about it–a terrorist ran over eight people, killing them, and wounded another 15, yet Kristof’s response is that it could have been worse were it not for gun control.

Kristof tweeted:

The NYC terrorist had a pellet gun and a paintball gun. Good thing that in NYC he couldn't buy assault rifles, or the toll would be higher. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) October 31, 2017

Keep in mind that Kristof works for the same New York Times that responded to the June 14 Alexandria attack by trying to temper Americans’ desire to be armed to stave off mass public attacks. The NYT editorial board admitted that “all people in that situation, unarmed and under fire, would long to be able to protect themselves and their friends.” But after admitting the desire to be armed for self-defense, they criticized the idea of a society where people are actually armed to protect themselves:

Yet consider the society Americans would have to live in–the choices they would have to make–to enable that kind of defense. Every member of Congress, and every other American of whatever age, would have to go to baseball practice, or to school, or to work, or to the post office, or to the health clinic–or to any other place mass shootings now take place–with a gun on their hip.

These things only demonstrate how out of touch the NYT editorial board and Kristof are. The board fails to understand that millions upon millions of Americans carry a gun for self-defense every day in places where their Second Amendment rights have not been curtailed by Democrat politicians. On the other side of this coin, Kristof fails to note that an Islamist with a paint ball gun can more easily terrify law-abiding citizens in Democrat-run cities where Second Amendment rights are suppressed – cities where citizens cannot shoot back.

Far from making the case for gun control, the threat of Islamic terrorists attacking with vehicles and paintball guns actually makes the case for being armed with a real gun for self-defense.

It is a characteristic of the left to live in the theoretical, rejecting the actual in order to embrace the world as they wish it could be. This knee-jerk reaction leads them to talk about “assault weapons” after a vehicular terror attack. It leads them to criticize people who want to exercise their Second Amendment right to self-defense after being unarmed and vulnerable.

This is the same mindset that drove the Brady Campaign to campaign against campus carry the day after Ohio State students were terrorized by a Somali terrorist who drove into pedestrians, then chased unarmed students with a knife.

Photographs of firearms (or hunting expeditions) always draw a number of haters.

What do you do on your bye week? You get your first bow buck! Thanks @DougBurgum for the help!!! #ndlegendary #Sitka pic.twitter.com/QQQCN6TL70 — Carson Wentz (@cj_wentz) September 29, 2016

Although the response was overwhelmingly positive, Wentz was not without followers who called him a “murderer.”

On February 24 Axios published a statement from Bank of America:

We are joining other companies in our industry to examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings, and an immediate step we’re taking is to engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.

This statement follows a February 19 New York Times’ column which explained how banks and credit card companies could team up to limit finances for companies manufacturing and/or selling “assault rifles.”

For example, NYT reported that “PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.”

They added:

Visa, which published a 71-page paper in 2016 espousing its “corporate responsibility,” could easily change its terms of service to say that it won’t do business with retailers that sell assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, which make semiautomatic rifles fire faster. (Even the National Rifle Association has said it would support tighter restrictions on bump stocks.)

The pressure being placed on financial institutions is subsequent to a PR campaign designed force other companies to cut ties with NRA. On February 24 Breitbart News reported that over a dozen companies have severed relations with the NRA, discontinuing discounts for the NRA’s 5 million members.

Those companies are:

First National Bank of Omaha

Enterprise Rent-A-Car

Symantec

Metlife

Delta Airlines

United

Best Western

Alamo Rent a Car

Avis

Allied Van Lines

Budget

Chubb Insurance

Hertz

North American Van Lines

Paramount Rx

SimpliSafe

TrueCar

breitbart36,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-01-16 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/16/washington-ag-pushes-high-capacity-mag-ban-permits-assault-weapon-possession/,"Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D) is pushing a ban on “high capacity” magazines and a permit requirement for “assault weapon” possession.

SeattlePI reports that Ferguson is also seeking a 10-day waiting period for permitted “assault weapon” purchasers and enhanced background checks to acquire the rifles.

Gun control proponents seek to justify their gun control campaigns by pointing to high-profile crimes in which AR-15s or AK-47s were used. Yet ironically, a close examination of one of the most heinous attacks–that one on Orlando Pulse–reveals that the gunman complied with the very gun controls being pushed in Washington state.

Omar Mateen went through an enhanced background check, inasmuch as he was vetted and acquired a Florida state license to carry a gun as a “security officer.” Moreover, he passed a regular background check when acquiring his rifle and a 3-day waiting period for his handgun. He then opened fire on unarmed civilians in the nightclub.

Why should law-abiding citizens be punished for the crimes committed by Mateen?

And why should we be expected to overlook the danger those civilians faced by being trapped, unarmed, in a gun-free zone to begin with? After all, it was the gun-free zone that gave Adam Lanza over nine minutes without armed resistance as he plied his heinous trade on December 14, 2012.

Nevertheless, the Daily Herald reports that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) supports Ferguson’s gun control desires, which also include “stricter storage rules” that could result in punishment if someone obtains a gun owner’s weapons and “[causes] injury or death.”

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to add her “assault weapons” ban to the overarching school safety bill during a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday.

Feinstein’s bill, which is an enhanced reintroduction of a bill she has put forward again and again, bans over 200 different firearms.

During Wednesday’s White House meeting, Trump showed support for the gun control pushed by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). The Manchin/Toomey bill is a gun control bill that the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected on April 17, 2013. But Trump chalked that failure up to Barack Obama’s lack of leadership, and talked of using the Manchin/Toomey bill as a base to which other bills could be added.

The goal was to create a body of gun legislation, ubiquitously for the purposes of school safety.

Sen. Feinstein talked about her bill and described the AR-15 as one of “the latest and newest weapons” to hit our streets. However, Eugene Stoner designed the AR-15 in the 1950s and Armalite began producing the gun during the 1960s. Are weapons from 60 years ago now considered “latest and newest”?

Nonetheless, Trump listened to Feinstein, heard from a few more gun control proponents—including Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL)—then looked back at Feinstein and told her she should add her bill to the Manchin/Toomey bill for consideration.

His criticism came during a visit to a company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to tout the benefits of his tax cut plan.

He noted that while he cited the lowest unemployment numbers for black and Hispanic Americans in history, Democrats refused to react positively.

“Dead silence. There was not a smile,” he said. “That means they would rather see Trump do badly than our country do well. That’s what it means. It’s very selfish.”

Trump said that during his address, he stopped watching the Democrats because it was “bad energy” for his speech.

“They were like death – and un-American,” Trump said.

He also said someone called their behavior “treasonous.”

As the crowd applauded, Trump continued. “Can we call that treason? Why not?” he asked. “I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.”

The president also ridiculed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for calling his tax cut “crumbs.”

“Well, she’s a rich woman who lives in a big beautiful house in California, who wants to give all your money away,” Trump said.

Trump compared Pelosi’s comment to Hillary Clinton’s description of his supporters as “deplorable.”

“She’s our secret weapon. I just hope they don’t change her!” Trump said. “There are a lot of people that want to run her out. She’s really out there.”"
breitbart39,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-08-11 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2017/08/11/senator-kamala-harris-past-time-ban-private-ownership-assault-weapons/,"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) tweeted on Thursday that it is “past time” to ban private ownership of “assault weapons.”

Harris suggested public safety is her motivation, which is strange when one considers that “assault weapons” are used so infrequently by criminals that the FBI reports nearly three times more people are stabbed to death than are killed with rifles (of any kind) and shotguns combined.

The FBI’s 2015 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) showed the number of people killed with rifles (of any kind) and shotguns in 2015 totaled approximately 548. Nearly three times that many, approximately 1,573, were stabbed or hacked to death.

And do not miss the fact that the number of “assault weapon”-related deaths would have been but a fraction of the 548 total deaths from rifles (of any kind) shotguns combined. Yet Sen. Harris is pushing an “assault weapons” ban for the benefit of public safety.

She tweeted:

It’s long past time we renew the assault weapons ban in this country. It is in the best interest of keeping all of us safe. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 10, 2017

The United States had a federal “assault weapons” ban from 1994 to 2004 without any noticeable impact on crime. Moreover, it is evident that most Democrats who call for the reimplementation of such a ban do not realize that the ban did not even ban “assault weapons.” Rather, it banned “assault weapons” with certain cosmetic features–i.e., it was all a ruse; another example of the Democrats claiming they did that which they did not do.

Even the New York Times detected this and ran a column explaining that the very term “assault weapons” is a myth the Democrats created in the 1990s.

According to the NYT, the United States was “suffering from a spike in gun crime…in the early 1990s” so “Democrats created and banned [an entire] category of guns.” The ban lasted from 1994 to 2004 and although crime fell during that time, a “detailed study found no proof” the decline was due to the ban.

The suspect was also shot, according to reports.

A San Marcos, Texas, police officer attempted to serve a warrant on a suspect in the El Camino Real subdivision. The suspect allegedly opened fire on the officer shooting several times, according to KSAT ABC12. The officer was reported to be with other officers while serving the warrant.

Police Chief Chase Strapp told reporters the suspect fired on officers “much like an ambush situation,” KSAT reported. The suspect is reportedly wanted for a violent crime, police officials stated.

Police officials identified the deceased officer as San Marcos Police Officer Kenneth Copeland, KXAN News tweeted.

Despite wearing protective gear, the shots struck the officer. He was rushed to Central Texas Medical Center where he died from his wounds.

A statement from the San Marcos police department reports that the as yet unidentified suspect has also been shot. Police have not yet disclosed the condition of the suspect.

The suspect is said to be in an Austin-area hospital. It is not known at this time if the suspect’s wounds are self-inflicted or if other officers shot him while returning fire.

A Hays County SWAT team assisted the San Marcos Police Department during the standoff with the suspect, officials stated.

Katie Hall, an Austin American-Statesman reporter tweeted a message reporting that Officer Copeland was supposed to be off work today but was called in to serve the warrant.

The City of San Marcos shared the following message on its Facebook page:

Governor Greg Abbott responded to the death of the officer through the following statement:

Today we grieve for the family of the fallen San Marcos police officer, and we vow swift justice for the killer. The men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line every day to protect and to serve our communities, and we will never forget their sacrifices. Cecilia and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the officer’s family and to the entire San Marcos Police Department.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also released a statement:

Along with everyone learning of a San Marcos police officer’s murder today, I am deeply troubled and saddened. Officers around our state courageously serve and deserve our utmost honor and respect, especially during this time. Please join Angela and me as we pray for the officer’s family, the people of San Marcos, and for our law enforcement officers around the state.

Officer Copeland reportedly leaves behind a grieving widow and four children. He is also a former Coast Guard veteran, according to the San Marcos city manager who spoke at a press conference on Monday evening.

This is a developing story and will be updated with further information as it becomes available.

Officer Copeland is the first San Marcos police officer to be killed in the line of duty. He is the 119th law enforcement official to be killed in the line of duty this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page."

KSAT’s Erica Hernandez said she arrived at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs to see “emergency personnel” surrounding the church. She arrived before law enforcement had the opportunity to put up crime scene tape.

Hernandez said she went across the street where neighbors were gathered and they told her the gunman shot outside the church then went inside and opened fire as well. She said, “First, [he] started shooting from outside the church, and then went inside the church. They said he may have dropped anywhere from three to eight clips as he was firing. He had a lot of ammo on him, he had a mask and he was in full gear.”

Hernandez said church neighbors “were running for cover” because the gunman was firing at people who were watching him. She said an unidentified church neighbor “returned fire” and that is when “[the gunman] got back into his vehicle and left the scene.”

Hernandez works for KSAT and said she happened to be in Sutherland Springs when the attack happened because she had come “to visit family for breakfast.”

breitbart42,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-08-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/21/gun-controlled-chicago-least-63-shot-eight-killed-weekend/,"At least 63 individuals were shot and eight were killed over the weekend in gun-controlled Chicago.

According to the Chicago Tribune, over half the shootings occurred within “13 hours from Saturday to early Sunday.” This was followed by the shooting of 16 people during the day on Sunday, and three of the victims were shot on the same street—South Austin.

The weekend violence brings gun-controlled Chicago’s homicides to 451 for the year, which is only 16 homicides short of where Chicago was this time last year. Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 800 homicides and roughly 4,400 total shooting victims.

The weekend violence also makes August 18-20 second only to the Fourth of July weekend for bloodshed and mayhem this year. Breitbart News reported more than 100 people were shot over the Fourth of July weekend and the Chicago Sun-Times reported that 36 of those victims “[were] shot across the city in an 8-hour span of violence between 8 p.m. Tuesday and 4 a.m. Wednesday.” Six of the victims shot during that eight-hour span lost their lives.

To date, Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s (D) response to the violence and death has been to push for more gun control and to fight concealed carry for law-abiding citizens. On April 25, 2017, the Washington Times reported that Emanuel was pushing more regulations for Federal Firearm License holders (FFLs). These FFLs are gun store owners or operators who go through a lengthy background check process to acquire a license from the federal government allowing them to sell guns. In turn, they are required to conduct a background check on every gun they sell. By targeting them, Emanuel makes it appear that criminals are walking into brick and mortar gun stores to buy their weapons.

Amid Chicago’s gun crime epidemic, Emanuel is also fighting against national reciprocity for concealed carry. Although national reciprocity would allow law-abiding citizens to be armed for self-defense in more places, Emanuel opposes it because he worries it would erode local gun controls.

But as of January 4, a total of 54 people had already been shot in Chicago during the new year.

Moreover, on January 3 — just three days into the new year — 12 people were shot in 13 hours in gun-controlled Chicago.

According to the Chicago Tribune, there were 54 shooting victims between January 1, 2017, through January 4, 2017. Of those, seven were shot fatally.

Two of those fatalities occurred around noon Tuesday when the Tribune reports that 16-year-old Malik McNeese and a 17-year-old Stevie Jefferson were shot and killed. Both boys were on a sidewalk “in the 3400 block of West Fulton Boulevard” when a “black SUV” rolled up and someone in the vehicle opened fire. A 65-year-old woman was also struck by the gunfire too, but she is expected to survive.

Twenty-three-year-old Simmison McGruder was also shot to death on Tuesday. He was “in the 3200 block of West Lexington Street, just down the street from the Harrison District police station” when he was killed shortly after 11 pm.

During the January 3 airing of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence’s (CSGV) Joshua Horowitz refused to admit that the carnage and bloodshed in Chicago prove the failure of gun control. Instead, he said of CSGV, “We really believe the evidence is showing that, in fact, a group of gun violence prevention laws, in fact, do lower the homicide rate.”

Police arrested Brandy Lerma, 31, of Boynton Beach, Saturday on charges of child neglect and driving under the influence, WPLG reported.

Authorities stopped Lerma around 4:15 p.m. as she was driving south on Haverhill Road, according to a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s report.

Another driver placed a 911 call to report Lerma and followed her until deputies could intervene.

Deputies discovered Lerma in the driver’s seat with a toddler standing up without a seat belt on in the backseat.

The arresting deputy noted in his arrest report that Lerma’s breath smelled of alcohol, her hair “was a mess,” her “right bra strap was hanging out from under her sleeve,” and she appeared to be “disheveled and dirty.”

“The driver was unable to walk or stand without assistance,” the report said. “The driver fell to the ground twice during the roadside tasks.”

Lerna told officers that she mixed two shots of Fireball whisky with Percocet and Xanax.

Police described Lerna’s attitude during the arrest as “vulgar, defiant, combative, and uncooperative.”

She was released from jail the following day on $3,000 bail.

Other alleged drunk drivers have had some interesting mug shots, as well.

A Connecticut man accused of drunk driving wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “Hold My Beer and Watch This” in his mug shot in April. A Pennsylvania man suspected of DUI wore a shirt that read “Drunk Lives Matter” in his mug shot in March."

• Because Scalise is House Majority Whip, Capitol Hill Police officers were already present and engaged the gunman for several minutes

• The suspect — James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois — was taken into custody and has died from his wounds

• Five individuals total were shot by the assailant: Scalise, two police officers, a lobbyist and a congressional staffer

• Wounded staffer works for Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX). An early report incorrectly said that Williams himself was shot

• Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) told a reporter the shooter “was there to kill as many Republican members as possible.”

• Hodgkinson’s apparent social media pages reveal intense hatred for President Trump and Republicans

The incident occurred near the Milwaukee Machine Tool Corporation

According to Fox 6, police indicated the suspect, “identified as 21-year-old Carlos Martin, was shot and killed when he attempted to rob a man, 24.”

MPD Captain Andra Williams noted that carjackings and automobile thefts are “out of hand,” and he hopes Martin’s death might lead others to rethink their behavior.

Williams said, “This is the worst thing that could possibly happen to someone. This should be a wake-up call to everyone in the community that this is not a game. This is very serious.”

Alderman Cavalier Johnson represents the neighborhood in which the failed carjacking occurred. Fox News quoted Johnson saying, “That young man didn’t have to die today. He didn’t have to lose his life, but he made a bad decision and he did.”

He added, “This isn’t a game. This isn’t live-action ‘Grand Theft Auto.’ You don’t respawn after you’re dead.”

On January 12, 2017, the New York Times editorial board wrote against expanding the opportunities for citizens to be armed for self-defense. The paper claimed, “The grim truth is that concealed-carry permit holders are rarely involved in stopping crime.”

The Chicago Tribune reports that the deadly Saturday shooting occurred just “half a block north of Mount Sinai Hospital.” The victim was shot in the head and back. A 19-year-old was also shot and wounded in the incident.

In the shootings that followed, gunmen opened fire on individuals and groups alike. A single gunman opened fire on a pedestrian while driving down the road while families gathered on 31st Street Beach were targeted by others.

Throughout the violent 18 hours, witnesses reported hearing rapid fire gun shots in different areas. Some of the victims were as young at 14 years of age.

This latest run of gun violence comes just months after Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 4,400 shooting victims and nearly 800 homicides. And the first two months of 2017 saw increases in the number of shootings and fatalities over the same time period in 2016. In fact, the Tribune reported that 513 people were shot January 1 through February 27 alone, which was an increase of 37 victims over the 466 who were shot during the same time period in 2016.

The number of homicides January 1 through February 27 was 103, an increase of two victims over the 101 who were murdered during the same time period in 2016.

On January 28 Breitbart News reported an Independent Police Review Authority video that captured the sounds of gun-controlled Chicago during a shootout with a suspected murderer. The sounds are those of a war zone.

Concealed Nation reports that the patrons were all off-duty police who were in the store shopping.

Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) from LiveLeak shows four individuals in plain clothes standing in line to check out when a door opens and the would-be robber enters the business with his gun drawn.

The robber is shot immediately by one of the off-duty officers who is off-camera at first, then comes into the picture when the robber goes down. The other men all draw their guns as well, some pointing at the robber and others walking toward the door to be sure accomplices are not on their way in:

The condition of the would-be robber is unknown, but he did not appear to move after falling to the ground.

The failed robbery was caught by a CCTV camera in another location inside the store. This second angle lets the viewer see the officer who fired the initial rounds at the suspect:

Police shot one of two suspects. The second is in custody.

UPDATE 7:05 p.m.: Police Chief William McManus told reporters Thursday evening that one of his wounded officers is in grave condition not expected to survive, FOX29 reported. The other officer sustained handgun wound to the chin as he stepped out of his car to talk to a pedestrian. He is expected to recover from his wound but is still listed in critical condition. All San Antonio outlets are now reporting the suspect died from his wounds after he was shot by police officers.

McManus said the officer who sustained the wound to his face is in “grave, grave, condition,” and is not expected to survive. He told reporters, “He’s being sustained by the doctors and nurses right now,” the San Antonio Express reported.

UPDATE 5:47 p.m.: Some outlets in San Antonio initially reported that one of the suspects had been killed by police. They have now updated that information to report the wounded suspect is in grave condition at University Hospital, KSAT reports. Medical officials list the two officers as: one in grave condition, the other in critical condition.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott Tweeted, “Our prayers are with these 2 San Antonio police officers in critical condition after shooting.”

UPDATE 5:18 p.m.: A witness filmed the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The video shows one officer who has just dragged his partner out of the line of fire. The image of the officer is blurred. Fox29 San Antonio posted the video on their website.

A Tweet from Fox4 reporter/anchor Randy Beamer reveals an image of the surviving suspect in custody.

ORIGINAL STORY CONTINUES:

“It happened so fast, one was down, one was in custody immediately. There was no further danger,” Chief William McManus told reporters. “It’s not a good feeling to know two officers were shot during active patrol.”

The two officers attempted to make contact with two people on the street near San Antonio College, the San Antonio Express-News reported. As the officers stepped out of their vehicle, one of the suspects pulled a weapon and began firing. He struck one officer in the face. The other officer received a shot in the stomach area, the chief reported. That officer pulled the other wounded officer to a safe area.

McManus report that both officers are in “very critical” condition at a local hospital. He said the officers were working “directed patrol” in the area to help reduce crime.

Police shot one of the suspects. The second person is in custody. No motive for the shooting is known at this time.

McManus said both officers are seven-year veterans, KSAT reported.

Both suspects are reported to be in their late 20s to early 30s, the chief described. He said he had no other information on the suspects or their motives at this time.

San Antonio College is reported to be on lockdown at this time as a precautionary measure.

One witness told the San Antonio newspaper he witnessed one officer attempting to resuscitate another officer.

The chief told reporters the incident “is over.” He said one suspect is dead and the other is in custody at the department’s homicide division offices.

In November 2016, a San Antonio police detective was shot and killed while he was working uniformed patrol duty. Breitbart Texas reported. The following day, police arrested Otis Tyrone McKane and charged him with murdering Detective Benjamin Marconi. When asked by reporters why he shot the detective, McKane responded, “I was upset.”

This is a developing story. More information will be added as soon as it is available.

Certain search terms like “AR-15” and “revolver” still display no results. The original article follows.

Google has removed search results for any product that contains the word “gun” in it, including water guns, toy guns, the band “Guns and Roses,” and even “burgundy” from its shopping section.

Google has removed results in its shopping tool for a wide range of terms related to firearms, unwittingly censoring completely unrelated items such as music groups and movies whose titles matched filtered terms.

Google Shopping allows users to search for products from a wide range of online shopping sites to compare prices and offerings. The Internet giant has removed search results for a wide variety of terms, which was discovered by social media users this week.

Searches for “gun,” “guns,” “pistol,” “pistols,” “AR-15,” “rifle,” and “revolver,” in the shopping section of Google’s search engine will now fail to return any results, while other searches which have nothing to do with firearms but include the keywords similarly provide no results, including “toy guns,” “water guns,” “glue gun,” “Guns and Roses,” “Gundam,” “Top Gun,” “Naked Gun,” the Man With the Golden Gun,” “Shogun,” “Sex Pistols,” and even “burgundy.”

The fact that words including “gun” as part of the title have led many to suspect Google is running a filter specifically to remove any search result including those letters, as opposed to filtering by product category or vendor.

Google shopping now blocks all search queries with the English word ""gun"" in it, which can be something of an issue as you can imagine. pic.twitter.com/NL4V00y079 — Best Mom Eva (@mombot) February 27, 2018

Example 3:

If you're a music lover and wanted to buy merchandise related to the musical band ""Guns and Roses,"" too bad. Google's shopping tab will tell you nothing is available. pic.twitter.com/pPelmGUbFQ — Nick Monroe (@nickmon1112) February 27, 2018

How long has Google been censoring shopping results for the search term, “gun?” https://t.co/WZflX3wmmh — Mark Kern (@Grummz) February 27, 2018

Searches for “flamethrower,” “knives,” “machete,” “arsenic,” “bombs,” “ammo,” and various gun parts are still returned, however.

So yeah. Google is fine with all sorts of things that'll likely get you on a federal watch list, but video games with the word ""gun"" in them are a no-no. pic.twitter.com/qP2rSUK62l — Nick Monroe (@nickmon1112) February 27, 2018

Search engine Bing has also removed search results for “pistol” and “rifle,” but does not censor other products with the word “gun” in them.

Google Shopping was the focus of an EU antitrust case against Google that resulted in a record $2.7 billion fine against the company.

Breitbart Tech reached out to Google for comment, but has not received a response.

Update — After this story published, Google replied to Breitbart Tech this this statement:

We are experiencing an error in our Shopping results and we are working to address this issue. We have not changed our policy on the promotion of guns, gun parts or gun components.

The spokesperson also provided a link to the policy, which can be read here."

And, frankly, not to have due process would be wrong.”

Esty said that the “real proof” of President Trump’s commitment to gun legislation will be “does he line up, does he lean in, and push to make this happen?” She added that she supports the president trying to ban bump stocks, but thinks the move will have to go through Congress.

After hearing a clip of President Trump’s statement in favor of taking guns from dangerous people and then going through due process, Esty stated, “Well the fact is, you do need to have due process. I’m one of the co-authors of a bill we’ve just introduced that would have one of these gun violence restraining orders, GVROs, that, in extreme cases, like in Florida, would empower local officials to actually remove weapons before anybody hurts somebody. Well, that’s really important. They don’t have that law in Florida. Every state should have that law. But you’ve got to have due process. And, frankly, not to have due process would be wrong. And you’re certainly going to run into a buzzsaw of all kinds of people if you don’t do that.”

breitbart52,breitbart,['Jerome Hudson'],2018-03-01 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/03/01/will-these-pro-gun-control-celebrities-make-another-film/,"Last week, actress and star of NBC’s The Black List Megan Boone tweeted that her character on the popular crime drama would “never carry an assault rifle again.” The tweet — which was in response to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that saw Nikolas Cruz kill 17 people with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle — posed a glaring question.

Will other pro-gun control Hollywood actors and directors who’ve used firearms in films for years pledge to lay down their guns in future films?

It’s a question that could be asked of the likes of legendary director Steven Spielberg, whose has written, directed, or produced dozens of movies and TV series that have featured the use of guns.

George Clooney pledged to give $500,000 to a gun control march but his career is littered with film roles (at lease a dozen) in which his characters wielded a gun. Will he now pledged to leave guns out of his future projects?

The same question can be asked of actors Jim Carrey, Mark Ruffalo, and Matt Damon, who have all portrayed gun-wielding characters in popular movies but have also advocated for the enactment of more gun laws — reforms that will invariably make it harder for law-abiding citizens to purchase or sell firearms.

Below is a list of Hollywood stars and preeminent filmmakers who used guns on screen while calling for more gun control.

Jim Carrey

Jim Carrey has spent years making films with characters using guns. But in 2013, Carrey called defenders of the Second Amendment “heartless motherfuckers.” Recently, he has pushed for gun control by sharing original artwork with his 17 million Twitter followers.

George Clooney

George Clooney has starred in at least 10 films, from The Peacemaker to Ocean’s Eleven to Monuments Men, that saw his character use a gun. But the veteran star is now a vocal advocate for gun control, donating $500,000 to the upcoming student march for gun control, March for Our Lives.

Jennifer Lawrence

Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence has starred in several films featuring her character using firearms — including Winter’s Bone, X-Men: Days of Future Past, and Joy — but has praised the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student pushing for gun control and said gun violence in America has nothing to do with the entertainment industry.

Samuel L. Jackson

Samuel L. Jackson has spent 30 years wielding guns onscreen in more than 35 films. While the Avengers star has long-advocated for the Second Amendment, he called President Donald Trump a “muthefucka” and mocked his proposal to arm teachers; a proposal that nearly half the country believes is a good idea.

Emma Stone

Emma Stone was among the many celebrities urging Americans to “reject the NRA” in the wake of the Las Vegas mass shooting last October.

Steven Spielberg

Director Steven Spielberg has written, directed, or produced more than 60 movies and TV series that have featured the use of guns. But Spielberg, following George Clooney’s lead, is now among the many stars to donate $500,000 to the upcoming student march for gun control, March for Our Lives.

Matt Damon

Matt Damon may be best known around the world for his iconic role as gun-wielding CIA agent Jason Bourne but the star has spent years railing against Americans’ right to own guns. Damon praised Australia’s gun ban in 2016 for how it was implemented in “one fell swoop” and said, “I wish that could happen in my country, but it’s such a personal issue for people that we cannot talk about it sensibly.”

Jessica Chastain

Actress Jessica Chastain’s 2016 gun control film Miss Sloane bombed at the box office but that didn’t stop her from tweeting last October in a now-deleted tweet, “Welcome to America where you’ll wait 6 months for an X-Ray but hey, you can buy an AR-15 in 5 minutes flat.”

Elizabeth Banks

Actress Elizabeth Banks called for gun control in December 2015 after the deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The Pitch Perfect star tweeted after last year’s Las Vegas mass shooting: “It would be wise to ban assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and silencers. None of which is excessive.”

Alec Baldwin

Actor Alec Baldwin called for a national registry of all gun owners in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting. “You are more likely to use a car or emergency vehicle in saving a life. We license/register those cars and their drivers. More likely to need a prescription. We license those who distribute such drugs. We license doctors. Electricians. Lawyers. It’s time to register all guns,” Baldwin wrote on Twitter.

Lady Gaga

Pop superstar Lady Gaga said after last year’s deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas Lady Gaga that “blood is on the hands of” Congress and President Donald Trump if they don’t unite and enact gun control legislation. She pushed gun control again after the Parkland, Florida, shooting.

Amy Schumer

Amy Schumer urged her 6.5 million Instagram followers to vote NRA-funded Congressman out of office, after the Parkland, Florida, shooting. She also asked her fans to donate to the Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety in lieu of wedding gifts.

Alyssa Milano

Allyssa Milano is one of Hollywood’s most pro-gun control advocates. The Charmed star called for “Sensible gun control NOW” after last year’s Vegas mass shooting and currently pushing an effort for to force Amazon to drop the National Rifle Association’s online video channel from its streaming service.

Michael Keaton

Michael Keaton has been pushing for gun control for years. The Batman actor signed a letter in 2016 intended to urge Congress to vote on former President Barack Obama’s gun control proposal. Earlier this month, Keaton called Republicans and National Rifle Association members “weak, disgusting cowards.”

Julianne Moore

Julianne Moore said in 2016 that gun control “is not a Second Amendment issue! It does not deserve to be hotly debated as such! It is a safety issue!” In October, Moore said she believes there should be “limitations on the amount of firearms you can own” and urged her fans to joined the upcoming march for gun control.

Don Cheadle

Don Cheadle is a gun owner and has starred in films wielding guns since the 80s but has spent years pushing for more gun control laws. The Avengers star was among the litany of celebrities to join gun control group Everytown’s 2015 push for more gun laws.

Sharon Stone

Actress Sharon Stone called Parkland, Florida, student activist for gun control Emma Gonzalez a “hero” and called for #GunReformNow.

Mark Ruffalo

Mark Ruffalo joined celebrities calling for gun control by mocking those praying for the victims after the deadly Parkland, Florida, shooting tweeting, “Prayers without accordant action are silent lies told to oneself, heard by no God, amounting to nothing. Action is the language of truth, the prayers of the Saints.”

Jeffrey Wright

Actor Jeffrey Wright has been a very vocal supporter of gun control, tweeting last week: “Start to talk abolishing the 2nd amendment entirely, then maybe the gun fetishizers will want to compromise.” He called for more gun control mere hours after the Parkland, Florida shooting.

Ron Perlman

Actor Ron Perlman is both vocal and vile in his support for gun control. The Sons of Anarchy star tweeted and mocked those praying for the victims of last year’s Vegas mass shooting, , “We are rushing to our own funerals. We are eager to blow ourselves up. We are doing all this to ourselves. Think and pray on that!” While Perlman is calling for more gun control almost daily in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting, he’s used guns on screen for years.

Debra Messing

An outspoken supporter of gun control, Debra Messing has joined celebrities calling for a March 1 boycott of the NRA, writing on Twitter: “Since Parkland, 20 corporations have severed their ties to the NRA. @Amazon, @Apple, and @FedEx have not. This Thursday, join us in a nationwide, 24 hour #March1NRABoycott of all three. Don’t shop, don’t stream, don’t ship.”

Kevin Bacon

Veteran actor Kevin Bacon has taken to social media and urged his hundreds of thousands of followers to vote out any congressional lawmaker “beholden to the gun lobby.”

Sally Field

Iconic actress Sally Field took to Twitter and said, “The NRA and the GOP is complicit in every one of these horrifying shootings. They are holding this nation hostage.”

Actor and activist John Leguizamo has taken to social media of late applauding companies like Bravo for boycotting the NRA and calling for #SensibleGunReformNOW.

Martin Sheen

The veteran actor called the NRA a “Bullying organization” in and said the Kennedy administration would “have confronted those bastards and they would have made it real clear that this is not gonna go down.”

Tom Arnold

Always vocal about politics, actor Tom Arnold has-longed urged gun control and has ramped up his push after the Parkland shooting. After the suicide of his nephew in 2016, Arnold wrote that “there are people in this country who consider guns to be living, breathing things. They represent liberty to some people, and the Constitution itself. Some even equate guns to religion. A gift to Americans directly from God himself. That sounds crazy to me. It should be on the gun test: If you truly believe your metal tool/explosive device is a gift from above, then you should be deemed insane and unfit to legally own a gun.”

breitbart53,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-10-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/30/gov-jerry-brown-signs-bill-removing-penalty-using-gun-crime/,"At the end of the latest legislation session Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed a bill removing mandatory enhanced sentencing for criminals who use guns in the commission of their crimes.

He did this at the same time that he signed other legislation making it illegal for teachers to be armed on K-12 campuses for self-defense.

Liberal logic–teachers are not allowed to shoot back if under attack and criminals face no mandatory sentence enhancement for using a gun in carrying out an attack.

Assembly Bill 424 made it illegal for teachers to be armed for self-defense and Senate Bill 620 removed the mandatory enhancement for using a gun for crime. SB 620 removed the mandatory enhancement from the Penal Code and placed it at the discretion of the judge presiding over the case.

The ChicoER observed, “So on one hand Brown and the Legislature make it more difficult for a teacher to protect children against gun-wielding criminals, while on the other they reduce potential penalties for gun-wielding criminals.”

Bills like AB 424 and SB 620 were the result of lawmakers scrambling to find any remaining areas where gun bills could be passed. After all, California Democrats passed so many laws in 2016, via Gunpocalypse, that the bills they passed this year served to either extend extant controls or repeal mandatory gun penalties for criminals, as in the case of sentencing guidelines.

Yet as with older gun controls, these new controls only impact law-abiding citizens. We saw proof of this in “the wave of legal purchases” that preceded the implementation of the laws contained in Gunpocalypse. Law-abiding citizens were getting out and buying everything they could while doing so was still legal.

The ChicoER noted such purchases “tell us that new gun laws have their greatest effect on law-abiding shooters, not those bent on criminal or violent misuse. Gang members and other gun criminals, by their nature, don’t make legal purchases. Rather, they acquire weapons and ammo surreptitiously, in ways that don’t leave paper trails of ownership.”

The poll shows that Republicans may be better off focusing on immigration and border security in the midterms to energize the party’s base, as immigration/border security was the top issue for Republican voters (17% compared to 9% for Democrats) while gun control/Second Amendment was the top issue for Democrats (17% compared to 9% for Republicans). The third issue that was most important to voters was taxes. Though House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has derided the tax cuts as “crumbs,” many Americans have been seeing the benefits of the tax cuts in their paychecks.

Not even 1% (.5%) of those surveyed said Russia/election meddling was the top issue even though the media keep hyping it while majorities even believed that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, will continue to do so, and President Donald Trump has not been forceful enough addressing the issue.

Impeaching Trump polls poorly as well, with just 1.4% of those surveyed saying “Oppose/ged rid of/impeach Trump” was their top issue.

The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from February 20-24, and its margin of error is +/- three percentage points.

The poll also found that a huge majority (75%) disapproves of Congress. Forty-eight percent do not view the Democrats favorably while 60% have an unfavorable view of the GOP. In addition, the poll also found that “when it comes to electing House members, 47 percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote for a Democrat, while 32 percent said they would choose a Republican.”"

Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she is a supporter of the Second Amendment because guns helped her father and neighbors protect their families in the South during segregation.

Rice said, “Let me tell you why I’m a defender of the second Amendment. I grew up in Alabama in the late ’50s, early ’60s. There was no way that Bull Connor and the Birmingham police were going to protect you. When knight riders would come through our neighborhood, my father and friends would take their guns and fire in the air if anybody came through. I don’t think they actually hit anybody. But they protected the neighborhood.”

She added, “I’m sure if Bull Connor had known where they were he would have rounded them up. I don’t favor some things like gun registration.”

Nelson said that the White House didn’t invite him to the meeting on purpose. He continued, “I’m not unhappy about it. I think it shows the excessive partisanship of, if not the president, at least those around him, which is so silly.

The year was 1993. I was young, had money burning in my pocket, and my buddy needed cash. And so, for a couple hundred bucks I owned a 9MM handgun, which immediately went under the bed, mostly forgotten, a totem to my spendthrift ways.

Another 15 years would pass before that investment paid off.

When we moved to Los Angeles in 2003, the gun came with me, and I again slipped it under the bed because that is where it had always been. Five more years passed.

I don’t want to say that our Los Angeles neighborhood changed, because I don’t know that for a fact. Maybe our luck changed. All I know is that things went to hell pretty quickly.

I worked out of the house. My wife commuted. It was February, so it was dark when she got home. One night, before she had even taken off her coat, we heard gunshots followed by a car crash. Trust me, only in movies do people confuse a car backfiring with gunshots.

I’ll never forget the conversation with 9-1-1.

“Did you actually see the gunshots or just hear them,” the operator asked?

I told her I had only heard the gunshots.

She hung up on me.

We were on our own.

Suddenly my forgotten handgun became the most important thing in the house.

When the police did show up, we learned that this had happened. Not 20 feet from where my wife had been just a minute earlier, one of our neighbors — who lived just two houses down — was pulling in to park when she was ambushed by her estranged husband. After being shot in the head more than once, she died instantly and her car coasted into another.

My closest neighbor, believing there had been an accident, ran out to help only to have a gun pointed at him. Thankfully, the murderer ran off. But now he was on the loose, and the best guess was that he was desperate, armed, and somewhere close hiding out in the thousands of places available in the jumble of homes on our block.

All night long helicopters patrolled overhead with their spotlights. The most L.A. moment of our 10 years in L.A. happened that night — watching a live helicopter shot of our own house on the local news.

It was an awful night, but one that would have been even more agonizing without an effective way to defend myself and my wife. Three weeks later the police finally captured the guy.

It was sometime after this that my next door neighbor, an LAPD officer who worked in the gang squad, was targeted for retaliation at his home. This hung over us for months.

Then came the full-blown gunfight just up the street that resulted in two cop-shooters on the loose and a shelter-in-place order.

On Easter Sunday, no less, we spent hours sitting on the floor waiting for the all clear — hours that would have been unimaginable without a loaded pistol within reach.

Earlier that same afternoon, my wife and I walked home from church in the very same spot where the gunfight took place and two bystanders were hit.

The last straw came in the form of an armed robbery. My wife was just about to leave when two masked gunmen stormed into her doctor’s office demanding money. They herded my wife and three others into the small copy machine room and made them lie on the floor. My wife felt a gun barrel at the back of her head. Sure she was about to die, she prayed out loud to the Virgin Mary until the gunman told her not to worry.

She found out later that the police had arrived right away but refused to go inside fearing a gang was setting them up for an ambush.

Before another year passed, we returned to our mountain home in North Carolina. The gun is still under the bed, only now it is cleaned regularly, I have practiced with it at the range, and joined the NRA.

What is the moral of this story? Well, there are two. To begin with, over 25 years, I have only needed that gun twice, but at the time I would have given away everything in exchange for one.

Second, the police only show up after someone’s dead.

You must be able to defend yourself and your loved ones.

My reasons for buying a gun might have been irresponsible, but not owning one would have been even more irresponsible.

Finally, my awakening towards the necessity of owning a gun and the vital importance of the Second Amendment and the NRA — things I had given almost no thought to beforehand — had nothing to do with culture, tradition, or politics.

All it took was one harrowing night of having a gun when I needed a gun.

Cicilline (D-RI) and numerous Democrat colleagues in the House are pushing an “assault weapons” ban that would prohibit “high capacity” magazines and 205 different firearms.

The Providence Journal reports that Cicilline’s bill, HR 5087, “would prohibit the sale, transfer, production, and importation of semi-automatic rifles and pistols that have a magazine or can accept a magazine that can hold more than 10 bullets, and any ammunition-feeding device that can hold more than 10 bullets.”

Cicilline’s bill describes an “semiautomatic assault weapon” as a firearm with a “detachable magazine” and a “pistol grip,” “forward grip,” “folding stock,” “rocket launcher,” or “threaded barrel.” The list includes pistols made by CZ, Daniel Defense, America Spirit, Heckler and Koch, Centurion, and DPMS, among others. It includes rifles made by Kel-Tec, Springfield Armory, Heckler and Koch, Barrett, Beretta, Stag Arms, Remington, Rock River, Mossberg, Diamond Back, Daniel Defense, Colt, Bushmaster, Armalite, and Norinco, among others.

Cicilline’s bill bans “all AK types” even though the Florida gunman used an AR-15.

HR 5087 describes “high capacity” magazines as a “large capacity ammunition feeding device,” making it “unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a large capacity ammunition feeding device.”

Ironically, a Virginia Tech Review Panel that examined the April 16, 2007, firearm-based attack on the gun-free Virginia Tech campus found that a ban on “high capacity” magazines would not have mitigated the terrible outcome of the attack. Thirty-two people were killed by a killer armed with a handgun and 15-round magazines. But the killer had the one thing needed most–time. No one could shoot back, so whether he had magazines holding 10-rounds or 15, he had all the time in the world to reload and ply his trade.

breitbart59,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-06-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2017/06/21/babin-bill-gives-congress-firearm-carrying-opportunities-national-reciprocity-would-not-give-ordinary-americans/,"On June 20 Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX-36) introduced legislation that will allow Congressional members to “supersede” concealed carry laws and have a gun with them for self-defense “in nearly every conceivable scenario.”

This comes as Americans have been yearning for Congress to take up national reciprocity so that the common man can simply have a gun with him as he crosses state lines. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC-8) introduced national reciprocity on January 3, 2016, and the common man has been waiting.

Breitbart News has already highlighted this bill’s strategic flaws in that it would empower politicians while not helping all Americans. In response to that first piece, Babin’s office provided Breitbart News with the following quote from the Congressman:

Rep. Babin is a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment who fully supports reciprocity rights for every American. He is a proud cosponsor of Rep. Hudson’s national reciprocity legislation and believes all law abiding American citizens should be able to conceal carry across state lines.

But that quote does not address the fundamental extra protections this bill would seek for members of Congress in addition to what national reciprocity would provide to ordinary Americans.

Babin’s bill, titled “Bill to Enhance Safety and Protection of Members of Congress,” would give Congressional members “the ability to attempt to qualify for a concealed carry permit – either through their home state or a training program created by the United States Capitol Police (USCP).” It would then:

Direct the USCP to grant Members of Congress the ability to concealed carry in nearly every conceivable scenario – including federal parks and buildings, the national mall, to and from their offices, at schools and military bases – with only a few limited restrictions. These would include National Special Security Events, other areas under the direct jurisdiction of the Secret Service and commercial airliners.

So Babin’s bill gives special carry privileges to members of Congress–privileges the common man will never have–but Americans are just yearning to exercise their God-given, constitutional right to bear the arms they keep for the purposes of self-defense. As of now, a citizen with a concealed carry permit from Texas can only carry a gun for self-defense in his home state and scattered states that recognize the Texas permit. The same is true for residents of Utah; they can carry a gun for self-defense in their home state and scattered states that recognize the Utah permit. But residents from Texas or Utah would face criminal charges if they carried a gun for self-defense in California.

National reciprocity would fix this convoluted mess by guaranteeing that a permit from any one state is valid in every other state.

In other words, national reciprocity means the common man with a concealed carry permit can be armed for self-defense even if he drives coast-to-coast in this great land.

Babin’s bill will allow Congressional members to “supersede any other federal or state law regarding concealed carry.” This, too, is something the common man will never get to experience.

Breitbart News reported that the alleged gunman, Kevin Janson Neal, killed four on Tuesday. However, the Associated Press now reports that investigators found the body of Neal’s wife under the floor of their home, which raises the number of innocents killed to five.

Neal’s shooting spree lasted about 45 minutes and covered numerous locations, after which time he was killed by police.

A judge barred Neal from possessing firearms after he “was charged with stabbing a neighbor” this year. And Neal’s attorney, Leo Barone, indicated that he “should have been unable to legally purchase guns because of the court order.” But Neal had two rifles and two handguns, all of which he acquired illegally.

Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston indicates that Neal had two rifles and two handguns. The rifles were “homemade” and the handguns were “registered in someone else’s name.” Neighbors told law enforcement that Neal “had been firing off hundreds of rounds of ammunition day and night.”

California has Gun Violence Restraining Orders, which amount to court-ordered confiscation of an individual’s firearms, and they have universal background checks, gun registration, 10-day waiting period on gun purchases, a gun safety certificate requirement, a “Good Cause” requirement for concealed carry, an “assault weapons” ban, a limited state-approved roster of guns that are legal to own, a ban on campus carry, a ban on teachers being armed in K-12 schools, a ban on open carry, and many other controls as well. Yet Neal was able to possess and use two rifles and two handguns to carry out his treachery.

The transfer fee is $19, out of which $5 is used to “fund enforcement efforts against illegal firearm purchases.” The suit revolved around NRA and the California Rifle and Pistol Association Foundation’s (CRPA Foundation) efforts to stop the state from taking that $5 to fund disarmament efforts.

According to Reuters, a three judge panel of the Ninth Circuit ruled unanimously in favor of upholding the fee. The court ruled that the law requiring the fee “advanced California’s interest in disarming people who are forbidden from possessing guns and rifles.” They ruled than any burden the fee places on the Second Amendment is only “minimal.”

The NRA and CRPA Foundation claimed the fee amounted to “unconstitutional tax on a fundamental right.”

Chief Ninth Circuit Judge Sidney Thomas wrote, “The government has demonstrated an important public safety interest in this statutory scheme, and there is a reasonable fit between the government’s interest and the means it has chosen to achieve those ends.”

The other $14 of the $19 transfer fee is used to pay for the background check and paperwork involved in a firearm transfer.

On June 9, 2016, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Americans have no right to carry a concealed handgun in public for self-defense. The court’s majority opinion was written by Judge William Fletcher, who said, “We hold that the Second Amendment does not preserve or protect a right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.”

The number of heroin deaths was 12,989 and the number of firearm-related homicides was 12,979.

The Washington Post published the CDC numbers, which show the deaths from all opioids combined topped 33,000 in 2015. That means opioid deaths outnumbered firearm-related homicides nearly 3 to 1.

Opioids include heroin and prescription drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and oxymorphone.

In November 2015 Breitbart News reported Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) numbers which showed the death rate from all drugs combined–opioid or otherwise–was 46,471 in 2013. For that same year, the death firearm-related death rate–including homicides, suicides, and accidental deaths–was 33,636. So drug-related deaths surpassed all types of gun deaths by nearly 13,000.

Car-related deaths surpassed gun deaths in 2013 as well. There were 33,636 gun-related deaths that year and 35,369 car-related deaths. And Breitbart News reported that Duke University researcher Chris Conover explained that car deaths, when viewed as a percentage, were so much higher than gun deaths that evidence showed that owning a car is “80 percent” riskier than owning a gun.

Conover explained this by pointing to the fact there were nearly 100 million fewer cars than guns in 2013. Yet even with 100 million fewer cars the number of people killed in or by cars surpassed the number of people who died in a gun-related death.

In August, Breitbart News reported that Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS)—the gun control group founded by Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly—began pushing temporary confiscation as part of its bid to find something that would resonate with the American people and give the group some traction.

At that time, the Arizona Republic reported that ARS was pushing for “Gun Violence Restraining Orders” which would “authorize law enforcement to remove access to guns, with court oversight and plenty of protections to prevent abuse of this authority.” They also wanted a prohibition barring “persons involuntarily hospitalized [from] purchasing or possessing firearms.”

So on March 18, Giffords was in New Jersey to discuss Democrat proposals for expanding gun prohibitions on firearm possession so that it not only covers those who are guilty of domestic violence, but also those who might be under a restraining order while awaiting trial for domestic violence.

According to MSNBC, the proposals to ban firearm possession include confiscation by mandating the “surrender” of firearms for those guilty of domestic violence or “if a domestic violence restraining order is in effect.”

Gov. Christie met with Giffords behind closed doors, and his office did not reveal specifics of their conversation.

The NRA tweeted about the new anti-gun rules, which will soon be effective in Rotary International’s “Code of Policies”:

Rotary International Gives the Boot to Gun Owners, Cites “Reputation Risk” In New Firearms Ban https://t.co/tv3cR7BpLI #2A — NRA (@NRA) April 3, 2017

Rotary International Director Bradford R. Howard posted a letter containing a summary of the new rules, which include prohibitions against:

Rotary clubs, districts and other Rotary Entities from transferring ownership of weapons.

[Rotary] clubs, districts and Rotary Entities from conducting or sponsoring gun shows.

[Rotary] clubs, districts and Rotary Entities from using any visual that includes weapons.

Licensing by Rotary International of guns or weapons.

Moreover, the new rules even “[prohibit] clubs, districts and Rotary Entities from accepting sponsorships from gun/weapon companies or stores, and preventing use of Rotary’s logo with the name or logo of a gun/weapon company or store.” This begs the question–what happens if a renowned gun maker is involved in an event to benefit a local community and that involvement includes the use of their logo? Would this mean the local Rotary Club would be barred from involvement in the event altogether or would it simply mean the club would be prohibited from using its logo in the event because of the gun maker?

Even more confusing is the fact that Howard used his letter to let Rotary Clubs know they “are still permitted to conduct sporting events that may include guns. (e.g., turkey shoots, skeet shoots, etc.).”

Howard explained the reasoning behind Rotary International’s new anti-gun stance:

In early 2016, Rotary, and the Board discovered that there is a lack of clarity around RI’s policy governing Rotary clubs, districts, and other Rotary Entities when participating in activities involving guns, weapons, and other armaments, and when interacting with gun companies, including for sponsorship purposes.

On March 13, a Tucson, Arizona radio host published a photograph of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords holding an AR-15 rifle at a gun range. Giffords has since confirmed that the photograph is authentic.

James T. Harris, blogging at the website of “101.4 FM The Truth,” wrote:

What is wrong with this picture? Absolutely nothing, and prior to the aggressive progressive opportunistic fear mongering in the wake of Sandy Hook, this picture would have raised no eyebrows and garnered little public attention. However, in response to the exploitative political scheming of Mark Kelly, persons connected to Congresswoman Giffords released this photo in response to what they perceived to be her husband’s hypocrisy.

Subsequently, Breitbart News confirmed the authenticity of the image through law enforcement sources in Arizona, and obtained a copy of the photograph from a source who requested anonymity.

The latter source was present when the photograph was taken, and said that Giffords had requested it for campaign purposes during October 2010.

According to the source, the image sent to Breitbart News was cropped to protect the identity of the person on the right-hand side of the original photograph (to Giffords’s left).

The source, who is a member of the law enforcement community, told Breitbart News:

“We were told she wanted to toughen her image. She asked to come out and she wanted to shoot a rifle. She had one of our guys out there to show her how to shoot an AR-15.”

In January 2011, Giffords suffered near-fatal wounds in a mass shooting while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The perpetrator used a 9mm Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol.

Giffords and husband Mark Kelly have since formed an organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, to press for policy changes such as limiting the sale of “assault weapons, ” including the AR-15.

Breitbart News reported last week that Kelly attempted to purchase an AR-15 from a gun store in Tucson earlier this month.

Likewise, the AR-15 that Giffords is shown holding in the image is a standard, semi-automatic civilian weapon, according to the source who saw it being taken.

The source saw a campaign official take the photograph, which was later provided to law enforcement personnel as a courtesy, according to the source.

The source says the existence of the photograph has been known in the local law enforcement community for a while: “I’m not the only one who knows about this photo.”

Multiple law enforcement sources in Arizona told Breitbart News that Mark Kelly’s campaign against “assault weapons” has generated resentment within the law enforcement community–and a desire that the photograph be made public.

The source who witnessed the photograph put it this way:

“Giffords and Kelly came across with a different demeanor in 2010. To me, it seems like they’ve done a complete 180 because of what happened. And with the latest controversy–with Mark Kelly doing what he did with the AR-15 stunt–this photo needs to be put out.”

While Kelly declined to comment, Americans for Responsible Solutions spokesperson Jen Bluestein told Breitbart News: “Looks like the photo is cropped.”

Bluestein noted that there are “many images of Gabrielle Giffords with guns,” though she said she had not seen the image of the AR-15 before.

At 1:14 p.m. PDT, Giffords posted two images on her Facebook page with the following statement:

Here are two photos of me that a conservative blog has dug up. I remember both of these days fondly. The first is at the Tucson Police Department firing range. They invited me to test rifles and tasers that they bought with federal funds, which I helped secure. The second was in Afghanistan while I was visiting with our troops serving abroad. My work as Southern Arizona’s Congresswoman frequently put me in close contact with some of the world’s most powerful and deadly weapons – supporting police departments, advocating for the Border Patrol, standing up for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and supporting my constituents’ and my own Second Amendment rights. I grew up with guns, and I like owning them. So does my husband Mark. It’s an interest we’ve shared ever since we met. It’s part of my heritage as an Arizonan and it’s my right as an American. Being able to shoot a gun is something I haven’t been able to do since I was shot – because my right arm is paralyzed, and I’m less mobile than I was. As I member of the House Armed Services Committee, I proudly spent a lot of time with our military, border patrol and state and local law enforcement. I guess the intention of those who have publicized these photos is to somehow call into question my belief that military style assault weapons should be more strongly regulated with background checks and other safeguards. I have never wavered in my support for those who serve our country. I fought to make sure they have the weapons and safety gear needed to carry out their mission, and proper health and mental care when their service ends. Both sides of the gun violence debate usually miss the point. We don’t have to choose between owning, using, and enjoying guns, on one hand, and preventing gun violence, on the other. Both sides need to come together to support commonsense solutions to gun violence, like keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like the young man who shot me. That’s why I’m fighting this fight. That’s why I’m working to bring people together to support gun rights and reduce gun violence. I hope you join me.

He says he learned of the block via a notification informing him he had “posted something that violates Facebook’s policies.”

On September 28 Petersen published an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, which said in part:

In my campaign for the United States Senate, I have made Facebook a centerpiece of my outreach efforts. I have used both my Personal Profile and my Official Page to connect with friends, family, and supporters, and to share and express our views about the future of the country. That’s why, on September 22, I was so shocked to receive a notification from Facebook informing me that I had been “blocked” from using Facebook for thirty days because I “recently posted something that violates Facebook’s policies.” Believing this to be a mistake, my campaign reached out to Facebook for more information. Today — six days later — I still have not received an explanation, and the block remains in effect. At the same time the block was affected, a Facebook Live video I had posted to my Official Page promoting my campaign’s AR-15 giveaway was removed. A few days later, a Status Update posted to my Profile referencing the same giveaway was also removed.

Petersen went on to express his confidence that the AR-15 giveaway is not against Facebook policies, as “several posts promoting the giveaway, including paid ‘Dark Posts,’ remain visible on [Petersen’s] page.” He observed that the continued visibility of the posts make it “unclear” why the giveaway “would warrant an immediate takedown and thirty-day ban.”

While awaiting a response from Zuckerberg, Petersen is working around the Facebook block by using Tweeter to let supporters know they can still win the firearm:

The ""offensive"" rifle that triggered my facebook ban can be won here: https://t.co/3Ybm7vvabl pic.twitter.com/AgLfjchjoJ — Austin Petersen (@AP4Liberty) September 24, 2017

In another portion of the open letter to Zuckerberg, Peterson wrote, “It’s difficult to ignore that this action comes during a period of heightened tension regarding Facebook’s role in our elections, and its perceived bias against conservative voices.”

Their father is a Harris County Precinct 1 deputy constable, and the boy knew what he had to do to keep himself and his sister alive. Around 2:30 PM, two men tried to break in, with one going through the front door and the other in the back.

The boy grabbed the AR-15 and shot at them. The two later showed up at a Tomball hospital. The adult was hit three times and was flown to Memorial Hermann hospital, while the juvenile was taken back to the crime scene.

“We don’t try to hide things from our children in law enforcement,” Lt. Jeffrey Stauber said. “That young boy was protecting his sister. He was in fear for his life and her life.”

More stories are coming out about armed citizens defending their lives and property with legally owned firearms. In the span of a week, Breitbart News has reported how a mother used a .38 revolver against an intruder, a man used his weapon to protect his 2-month old son, and a Colorado man invoked the Make My Day law in Colorado in using lethal force to defend himself against three intruders.

Senator Dianne Feinstein and others are trying to push through major gun control laws that would include banning the AR-15, the same gun used by the teenage boy."
breitbart69,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-08-25 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/08/25/ca-ar-15-owners-loophole-foil/,"Firearm owners in California have discovered a way around the state’s latest “assault weapons” ban, which requires registering AR-15s with bullet buttons.

Bullet buttons are a mechanism law-abiding Californians placed on their AR-15s to allow their rifles’ magazines to remain detachable, yet compliant with the state’s last “assault weapons” ban. A bullet button is a button located where the normal magazine release is located, but designed so that it can only be pressed in with pressure from a sharp object, most commonly the point of a bullet.

The Los Angeles Times reports that the updated “assault weapons” ban—signed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) on July 1, 2016—contains a “ban [on] the sale of semiautomatic rifles equipped with bullet buttons.” And it requires that rifles possessing such buttons be registered the state, where they are listed in a database.

The California Department of Justice just launched an online registration website to accommodate bullet button registration, and Fox News reports gun owners find the new registration scheme “more intrusive” that previous registration requirements. For example, attorney and Artemis Defense founder Steven Lieberman said, “The registration is seen by many as a trap to purge the owner since they ask for very specific information about acquisition of the original rifle that most owners don’t have or remember. As a result, [they] ‘guesstimate’ as most would…[but] are potentially committing perjury.”

But bullet button owners have discovered a way around the registration process, an option by which they can mark their guns as a “featureless” firearm on the state’s website. Assemblyman Marc Levine (D) is hinting that this option may be short-lived, but it is there now. Levine said, “By closing the bullet button loophole, it is slowing down the reloading mechanism. Lawmakers will continue to do whatever it takes to keep communities safe.”

breitbart70,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-06-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/19/10-reasons-ar-15/,"Because of the frenzied push to ban “assault rifles” in general and AR-15s specifically — together with the media’s clear attempt to malign the AR at every turn — Breitbart News thought it would be the perfect time to share six reasons why it makes sense to buy an AR-15 now.

AR-15s are easy to operate — An AR-15 rifle is a simple firearm to operate and understand. Anyone who owns a gun of any kind should be well-acquainted with it so as to know where every bullet will go if you have to grab the weapon and use it in a defensive situation. With the AR-15, acquiring such familiarization is easy.

AR-15s are accurate — AR-15s are popular for hunting because they are accurate weapons. This is also why they are extremely popular for shooting targets. An AR-15 fires one round — and only one round — every time the trigger is pulled, so it is a precision weapon when used in long-range shooting applications. That makes mastery of the weapon for long-range shots both fun and rewarding.

AR-15s are easy to accessorize — AR-15s are the Glock or Colt 1911 of the rifle world; if you need a part for an AR, you can get it. If you need a light, laser, sight, scope, grip, trigger, stock, suppressor, sling, magazine, etc., you can get it. If you want the same grips and stock-types but in different colors, you can get them. In effect, you can personalize an AR-15 so that it’s not just a gun, rather, it’s your gun.

An AR-15 is a “defensive rifle” — Medium.com’s Jon Stokes makes a great point about the defensive uses of an AR-15. He refers to an AR-15 as an “assault rifle” for the purposes of making his argument, then writes: “An assault rifle is a defense rifle, and a defense rifle is an assault rifle; these two concepts are identical — such is the very nature of armed combat, in which one person is trying to prevent himself from being killed by killing the other guy first.” These two aspects — “assault” and “defense” — coalesce perfectly when a police officer arrives on the scene and must end an active threat posed not only to bystanders but to himself as well. “Assault” and “defense” also go hand in hand after a homeowner hears someone kick in his front door and knows he has to seek and stop that intruder before innocent family members are harmed.

AR-15s are an American firearm — The “AR” in AR-15 stands for “Armalite Rifle.” NSSF reports that Armalite is the company that designed the gun in the 1950s. Armalite’s website shows that the company began working on the AR platform via funding from “the Capital Southwest Corporation Dallas, Texas.” To put it plainly, the AR-15 is an American rifle just as the Kalashnikov is Russian weapon.

The final reason to buy an AR-15 is the most simple of all:

Buy one because you can — You have a natural right to keep and bear arms that is bestowed upon you by your Creator, rather than government (so says Thomas Jefferson). Moreover, Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia explained that the protections on this right cover “firearms that millions of Americans commonly own for lawful purposes.” And guess what? AR-15s are owned by “millions of Americans,” and the pool of AR-15 owners is growing exponentially at this time.

So get one because you can.

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed “to hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”

When confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, sometimes conflating an AR-15 with the 30-round magazines that can be used in such a firearm.

For example, a Twitter user named Greg tweeted to remind Carlson that our Founding Fathers did not write the Second Amendment so we could hunt. Greg wrote: “2nd amendment was not written to protect deer hunting Gretchen.”

Carlson responded: “It also wasn’t written to blow away people with 30 rounds.”

@Greg69640587 @Mediaite it also wasn't written to blow away people with 30 rounds — Gretchen Carlson (@GretchenCarlson) June 14, 2016

Another Twitter user–John–asked: “Why do you rich elitists who always want to make it more difficult for us common law abiding folks to protect ourselves?”

Carlson responded: “U need 30 rounds to do that?”

@ManViking u need 30 rounds to do that? — Gretchen Carlson (@GretchenCarlson) June 14, 2016

And another Twitter user–who goes by the name The New Independence–asked: “Let me ask you a question Gretchen Carlson. Somebody breaks into your house to kill your children. How do you stop them? Will they be nice?”

Carlson responded: “With a gun that isn’t an assault weapon.”

And just to sure everyone understands she does support banning AR-15s, Carlson responded to praise for her “objective reporting” by tweeting, “That’s why I backed the assault weapon ban today thanks.”

Carlson explained that her decision to go all-in against AR-15s after one was used in the Pulse Orlando gun-free zone was partly because of Sandy Hook–another attack in a gun-free zone–and partly because her daughter works for a Newton charity.

The journalist — Neil Steinberg — attempted to buy the gun at Maxon Shooter’s Supplies in Des Plaines, Illinois. He needed a FOID care (Firearm’s Owners’ Identification Card) — which he had — was required to fill out background check forms — which he did — and then had to wait 24 hours before picking up the gun. It was during the 24-hour wait that Steinberg found out Maxon would not sell him an AR-15 because of the past charge and “an admitted history of alcohol abuse.”

Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, Steinberg explained the process of going into the store — seeing the “cases of weapons” — and of trying to buy the AR-15.

He looked at a Smith & Wesson M&P AR-15 and made sure to point out that the gun comes with a “standard issue 30-round magazine.” He agreed to buy the gun.

While explaining the process of buying the gun, he wrote in a way that showed him reflecting on friends who have suffered the loss of family members to suicide. He also reflected on his neighbor’s shocked reaction when he told her, “I just bought an assault rifle.”

But in the end, he did not really buy the rifle. Rather, the gun store rejected the sale, saying, “It was uncovered that Mr. Steinberg has an admitted history of alcohol abuse, and a charge for domestic battery involving his wife.”

Steinberg responded to the cancelled sale by writing, “Would-be terrorists can buy guns. Insane people can buy guns. But reporters . . . that’s a different story.”

The video was clearly part of the establishment media’s concerted effort to demonize AR-15s by suggesting they are semiautomatics that can be modified into all out war machines.

The video begins with an image of a basic AR-15 rifle captioned, “Texas Church Gunman’s AR-15 Style Rifle.” The video then proceeds to list possible modifications, including items that were either one-offs or prototypical. USA Today listed so many that they had to follow the video with a disclaimer stating, “To clarify, the video shows both the shooter’s modifications, as well as other possible modifications. The shooter did not use a chainsaw bayonet.”

To clarify, the video shows both the shooter’s modifications, as well as other possible modifications. The shooter did not use a chainsaw bayonet. — USA TODAY (@USATODAY) November 8, 2017

USA Today was mocked relentlessly for posting the video.

One Twitter user sarcastically suggested the possibility of adding a “chainsaw bayonet” with a second AR-15 attached to the bottom of it:

Are you sure the weapon didn't look more like this? pic.twitter.com/MO4zNNz1iB — Jacob Smyth🌪️ (@JacobMyth) November 8, 2017

Another Twitter user suggested the possibility of AR-15 with a pizza cutter attached, to help with dinner preparation:

Another simply made fun of Democrats and their surrogates for pushing legislation on guns and other things that they “know nothing about”:

The video was released on the same day that Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats introduced gun control legislation to ban “assault weapons” and bump stock accessories.

But now two inventors, Travis Klein and Bart McCurdy, have created a new method of taking down an AR-15 that they say will allow owners of said guns to legally avoid registering them with the state.

According to Law Officer.com, Klein and McCurdy’s invention allows AR-15 owners to quickly take down their rifles in order to switch out an empty magazine for a full one.

The newest laws in California were aimed at outlawing “bullet buttons” — special California-specific buttons which allowed AR-15 owners to eject empty magazines by using a sharp tool or bullet point. With such buttons outlawed, the only way to legally eject magazines in California is to break down the AR — to literally remove the rear pin and separate the upper receiver from the lower, and only then to remove the empty magazine.

The Patriot Pin allows AR-15 owners to do this quickly. A small “take down arm” affixes to the rear pin of the AR, allowing the person holding the gun to use his or her thumb to quickly remove the pin after the magazine is empty. With the pin removed, the upper receiver separates from the lower and an “ARMagLock” can then be pressed with the index finger, dropping the empty magazine.

The Patriot Pin website says, “The new [gun control] law states you must disassemble your rifle before you are able to release the magazine. By installing an ARMaglock, by definition, you are compliant under the new laws.”

The installation of the Patriot Pin and the ARMagLock require “no permanent modifications” to your AR-15.

Russia essentially shut down a United Nations meeting in Geneva on the subject of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) by categorically refusing to participate in any restriction or ban on the development or use of such weapons.

Their official statement amounts to a plain attempt to obscure the issue, claiming that “LAWS” is too broad a term, and that is presently unnecessary. Both of these points are demonstrably untrue, as evidenced by virtually every other developed nation participating. However, the obstruction is beneficial to Russia — a point that some in the Geneva meeting readily pointed out. One anonymous attendee simply stated that “the Russians are not interested in making progress on this.” But Russia says:

According to the Russian Federation, the lack of working samples of such weapons systems remains the main problem in the discussion on LAWS…this can hardly be considered as an argument for taking preventive prohibitive or restrictive measures against LAWS being a by far more complex and wide class of weapons of which the current understanding of humankind is rather approximate.

They also claim that making a distinction between military and civilian use of autonomous systems will somehow stall the progress of artificial intelligence development in general.

The one notable exception to the otherwise general consensus was none other than the chairperson of the Group of Governmental Experts, Indian Ambassador Amandeep Singh Gil. Multiple attendees lay blame for the efficacy with which the Russians derailed the talks at the feet of Gil for both his comments and echoing position paper.

Meanwhile, Russia’s own Kalashnikov weapons manufacturer is giving the lie to their claims, with the development of very real and quite distinct robots of mass destruction. Convenient, then, that its government would be so resistant to calling them what they are.

The bill–HB 731–is sponsored by Mary Margaret Oliver (D-83rd), Stacey Abrams (D-89th), Carolyn Hugley (D-136th), Pat Gardiner (D-57th), Dar’shun Kendrick (D-93rd), Dee Dawkins-Haigler (D-91st).

According to the text of HB 731, the bill focuses on ” dangerous instrumentalities and practices” by prohibiting the “possession, sale, transport, distribution, or use of certain assault weapons, large capacity magazines, armor-piercing bullets, and incendiary .50 caliber bullets.” Moreover, the details punishment for crimes involving “the possession, sale, transport, distribution, or use of certain assault weapons, large capacity magazines, armor-piercing bullets, and incendiary .50 caliber bullets.”

It also “[designates] certain weaponry and ammunition as contraband and [requires] seizure of such by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.”

Representative Mary Margaret Oliver suggests 10 other representatives have joined the six original bill sponsors. An announcement posted to Oliver’s webpage says:

[Oliver] and fifteen Democrat women House members introduced HB 731 on the first day of the 2016 Session. The bill bans assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Georgia needs debate about these weapons which are only used for rapidly killing people. Assault weapons are not necessary for deer hunting.

Pro-Second Amendment group Georgia Carry responded to HB 731 by tweeting, “Dems finally honest about gun control, their ultimate goal is confiscation.”

Associate Justice Clarence Thomas dissented–Antonin Scalia joining him–suggesting that wordsmiths were finding categories of guns to ban by listing types of firearms outside those explicitly in focus in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008).

In other words, Heller struck down D.C.’s handgun ban, but the ban in Highland Park is on “assault weapons.”

The problem with this, as Thomas–joined by Scalia–explained, is that the Second Amendment protections reiterated in Heller were not limited to striking down handgun bans. Rather, the decision was to protect “firearms that millions of American commonly own for lawful purposes.”

In dissenting from the December 7 SCOTUS decision not to intercede and strike down the “assault weapons” ban, Thomas first set forth the details of the ban and then provided his reasons, shared by Scalia, for viewing the ban as a violation of the Second Amendment.

Ban details:

The City of Highland Park, Illinois, bans manufacturing, selling, giving, lending, acquiring, or possessing many of the most commonly owned semiautomatic firearms, which the City branded “Assault Weapons”. … The City also prohibited “Large Capacity Magazines,” a term the City used to refer to nearly all ammunition feeding devices that “accept more than ten rounds.” The City gave anyone who legally possessed “an Assault Weapon or Large Capacity Magazine” 60 days to move these items outside city limits, disable them, or surrender them for destruction. … Anyone who violates the ordinance can be imprisoned for up to six months, fined up to $1,000, or both.

Thomas noted that even within the Seventh Circuit’s considerations, justices admitted that certain “assault weapons” make formidable self-defense weapons and may be a good choice for that application because they are “less dangerous per shot than larger caliber pistols or revolvers.” Yet the Seventh Circuit upheld the “assault weapons” ban anyway, by recognizing that Heller “holds that a law banning the possession of handguns in the home … violates” the Second Amendment.

The thinking is that an “assault weapon” is not a handgun; therefore, it may not have the same protections.

But Seventh Circuit Justice Daniel Manion looked beyond the explicit mention of one type of gun over another and simply considered the Second Amendment protections reaffirmed in Heller, as well as in McDonald v. Chicago (2010). After doing this, he dissented from the Seventh Circuit decision, saying, “Both the [‘assault weapons’ ban] and this court’s opinion upholding it are directly at odds with the central holdings of Heller and McDonald.” That is Thomas’s point precisely, and it is the point for which Scalia stood, as well.

Thomas criticized the majority SCOTUS decision to allow the Seventh Circuit’s ruling to stand, suggesting the SCOTUS action runs the risk of allowing the Seventh Circuit to “[relegate] the Second Amendment to a second-class right.” And he pointed to an even greater existential risk arising from allowing “assault weapons” bans to stand when he wrote, “If a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the Second Amendment guarantees nothing.”

The February 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia leaves the GOP-controlled Senate with the duty to refuse confirmation of any jurist to the SCOTUS unless that jurist is as committed to the Constitution as was Scalia, as is Justice Thomas.

breitbart78,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-08-11 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/08/11/nuclear-weapon-protesters-call-total-abolition-weapons/,"With tensions between the U.S. and North Korea rapidly increasing, nuclear war protesters who gathered to remember the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are calling for the “total abolition of weapons.”

The protests were held outside of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, roughly 200 protesters came together outside the Livermore Laboratory “to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the bomb that decimated Nagasaki, just three days after another atomic blast did the same to Hiroshima.” Survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki attended the protest alone with the anti-nuclear weapons activists.

One of the local groups at the protest was Tri-Valley CAREs. That group’s executive director, Marylia Kelley, said, “We are here to stand with the survivors of that nuclear attack, but we are also here to stop the next nuclear war before it starts.” Kelley added, “We understand if we are ever going to rid the world of the threat of nuclear war, we need to have the total abolition of weapons. There are no right hands for these wrong weapons.”

The Chronicle reported that the protest was “heavy with emotion: indignation, outrage and fear over a potential nuclear build-up” as the U.S. and North Korea increasingly appear prepared to go head-to-head.

The protests against nuclear weapons–based on the prior use of atomic weapons against World War II Japan–overlook many things. Chief among them is the fact that the United States’s conventional weapons were literally burning the Japanese to death via a multitude of air raids. The ordnance burst and tumbled upon impact, spewing fire and death upon those in its path. Richard B. Frank points to colleague estimates “that between a quarter million and 400,000 Asians, overwhelmingly noncombatants, were dying each month the war continued.” This is death on a scale far greater than was caused by the two atomic bombs.

Moreover, the protesters overlook how many Americans would have died had a land invasion been chosen over the dropping of two atomic bombs. The estimates were hundreds upon hundreds of thousands and beyond, and these estimates do not include the POWs being held in Japan who would have immediately been killed.

breitbart79,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-10-13 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/10/13/chris-murphy-assault-weapons/,"Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) says the federal “assault weapons” ban that lapsed in 2004 would have prevented the Las Vegas attack, had that ban still been in force today.

This claim shows a deep misunderstanding of the “assault weapons” ban, which did not ban the possession or purchase of “assault weapons.” Rather, it limited importation and mandated types that could be manufactured in the U.S., thus driving up prices. For a man of means like Stephen Paddock, paying the higher price for an “assault weapon” would have been no problem.

According to CBS News, Murphy was asked to respond to Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-CA) affirmation that no law would have stopped the Vegas attacker from striking. He said, “I respectfully disagree with my colleague.” And while admitting that Paddock had no criminal record to prevent passage of a background check or ownership of firearms, Murphy suggested that limiting the types of firearms Paddock could have owned would have made all the difference.

He said, “What if [the attacker] did not have an assault weapon? What if the assault weapons ban still applied? What if he was up in that hotel with a pistol or a shot gun or a non-semi-automatic rifle? Maybe he would have gone through with the crime, but I guarantee you less people would be dead.”

Again–the “assault weapons” ban Murphy references did not prevent the ownership of “assault weapons.” And although it contained a “high capacity” magazine ban too, Breitbart News reported that it did not pose an out-right ban on ownership of “high capacity” magazines either.

Murphy’s appeal to such bans is a smoke-and-mirrors ploy to enact more gun control for the sake of gun control; to re-enact a ban that did not really ban anything, but which gave the impression that Democrats cared.

Moreover, looking at it from another angle, even if we had a ban that really did prohibit such weapons, why would we expect an outcome different that the one we have seen in Paris, where 130 people were gunned down in one night–November 13, 2015–by terrorists with “assault weapons.”

Murphy is missing a simple point–gun control does not control criminals or terrorists, but it does make their victims easier to kill.

breitbart80,breitbart,['John Hayward'],2017-11-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/11/30/north-korea-releases-photos-video-new-missile/,"North Korea released photos and video of its new missile on Thursday, showing what appears to be a larger and more powerful version of its previous top-shelf ICBM, the Hwasong-14.

Analysts have debated whether the new vehicle is enough of a generational improvement to merit the new Hwasong-15 designation North Korea has given it, but a spokesman for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said his country’s analysis of the photos “showed that there were clear differences between the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-14 in terms of the looks of the warhead, the joint of the first and second stages of the missile, and overall size.”

Reuters quotes Michael Duitsman of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies agreeing with the South Korean analysis, saying, “This is a very big missile. And I don’t mean ‘Big for North Korea.’ Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club.”

“The first stage seems to use essentially the same case but has two engines. The second stage looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant. The combination of those two things means it really is a new, more capable missile,” said David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists, comparing the new vehicle to the Hwasong-14.

“They wanted to hit all of the U.S., and they wanted something big to hit it with. This seems on the surface level to be that missile,” said David Schmerler of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, as quoted by CNN.

A U.S. intelligence official added that the test launch “appears to demonstrate a more powerful North Korean solid-fuel propulsion system, especially in its second-stage rocket.” Among other advantages, solid-fuel rockets can be launched more quickly than those using liquid fuel.

The New York Times cites analysts who believe the second engine nozzle in the first booster stage and greater fuel capacity of the second stage appear to give the Hwasong-15 much greater range than its predecessor, dispelling theories that the Wednesday launch was essentially a stunt in which a slightly modified Hwasong-14 was given a lighter test payload so it could fly higher.

The photos published by North Korea indicate that the weapon has a mobile launch system, although U.S. intelligence analysis of the Wednesday launch indicates it was conducted from a fixed position, not a mobile platform. Contrary to dictator Kim Jong-un’s claim that the new missile is “100 percent” produced by North Korean industry, the mobile launch truck appears to be a modified version of a vehicle provided by China.

Perhaps most disturbingly, the new missile has a larger, blunter nose cone design that appears to indicate North Korea has made progress toward reliable reentry shielding—one of the last pieces of nuclear ICBM technology they do not yet possess.

The BBC notes that the “vast size” of the Hwasong-15, comparable to the American Titan II missile from the Cold War, cannot be overstated:

“A jubilant Mr Kim is seen in many of the pictures, grinning as the rocket takes off. The missile’s steep trajectory can be seen on screens in the background, apparently charted in real time,” the BBC reports, wryly noting that Kim has a habit of walking around giant fuel-laden missiles while puffing on cigarettes in publicity photos.

CNN quotes a North Korean official who said that more tests would be coming soon, including the long-threatened above-ground “large-scale hydrogen bomb” test."

On Stephen K. Bannon’s return to Breitbart News Network as Executive Chairman, Mr. Kurtz asked if Breitbart would be seen as more of a “weapon”?

Kassam replied: “Breitbart’s always been a weapon, quite frankly. It’s a weapon for the American people. It’s a weapon for the base who put President Trump in the White House.”

“We don’t hide where we come from on the spectrum,” he added. “That’s the problem we have with the CNNs of the world. They try and hide where they are on the political spectrum. We actually own our purvue and our remit in that regards.”

.@RaheemKassam: I think Breitbart has always been a weapon. It's a weapon for the American people. It's a weapon for the White House. — #MediaBuzz (@MediaBuzzFNC) August 20, 2017

Kurtz observed: “The word ‘weapon’ makes it sounds as if you are political activists as much as you are journalists.”

“I think when you look at the media landscape, everybody is weaponised right now,” said Kassam.

“CNN will run a story saying that Antifa is not a violent organisation. That’s a nonsense. The Washington Post‘s slogan ‘Democracy dies in darkness‘ – that’s a nonsense. They would not have done that had Hillary Clinton won.

“The media is weaponised all across the board. The only difference is we’re honest about it.”

.@RaheemKassam says ""we [Breitbart] don't hide where we come from on the spectrum. That's the problem we have with the CNN's of the world."" — #MediaBuzz (@MediaBuzzFNC) August 20, 2017

Asking if Breitbart News Network would temper its support for President Trump, Kassam said: “My personal analysis is that Trump still believes in the economic nationalist agenda that’s what we’re interested in. That’s the America First agenda.

“I’ll just give him the benefit of the doubt. Let’s see how this plays out.”

Referring to Trump’s campaign promises to voters, the Breitbart London chief editor said: “I want to see Trump standing in front of that famous Bannon whiteboard. If that’s still in the White House, then that’s a-okay with me.”

“Iran is a very serious problem already and will be a much bigger one very shortly,” he warned.

Woolsey was alarmed by recent developments in North Korea as well, recommending a show of American strength in the region, along the lines of a carrier battle group deployment. He worried that America may have developed a reputation as a “paper tiger” that would make any less impressive demonstration insufficient.

“I think that the situation with North Korea is worse than a lot of people realize,” he said. “Because they can orbit a satellite, and they can fire a nuclear weapon. They have nuclear weapons. If you can detonate a satellite with a nuclear weapon in it, up above the Earth in certain locations, you can knock out the electric grid underneath. That’s, to put it mildly, a very big problem.”

As it happens, former NASA mission controller Jim Oberg sounded this very same note of alarm a few weeks ago at The Space Review. Oberg warned that North Korea’s satellite program, conducted at great expense with seemingly very little to show for it, might have always been intended to deliver an EMP weapon into orbit. Such a strike would require very little precision and have no need of re-entry protection for the weapon, two areas in which North Korea lags conspicuously behind.

Woolsey said North Korea may be the most urgent threat, but Iran was a more “fundamental” threat.

“Iran is the world sponsor of terrorism all over the place, and they are really committed to the destruction of the United States,” he observed. “North Korea may be. Russia and China, especially Russia I think is a matter of some substantial concern. But I’d put North Korea and Iran right up there at the top.”

When CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer objected that Iran does not have the capability to destroy the United States, Woolsey replied, “Not yet with a nuclear weapon, but I don’t think they are many years away from a nuclear weapon.”

“I think they may be a relatively short time away,” he said. “And in terms of their attacks through terrorism, through the Revolutionary Guard and elsewhere throughout the Middle East and throughout other parts of the world, Iran is a very serious problem already — and will be a much bigger one very shortly.”

“You don’t accept the notion that they’re honoring their commitments to halt their nuclear program with the nuclear weapons deal — the nuclear deal that the U.N. put together, the U.S. participating in that?” Blitzer asked somewhat incredulously, citing reports that the Trump administration has signaled an increased willingness to honor the deal, despite stern criticism during the campaign.

“I think that the chance the Iranians are keeping their word is about as close to zero as diplomatic relationships go,” Woolsey replied.

Blitzer sputtered about the testimony from various sources that Iran is keeping the deal, prompting Woolsey to smile and say, “Maybe very briefly.”"

Clayne Crawford (Rectify) and Damon Wayans (In Living Color) will take over the roles played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the films. But neither actor will be able to hold guns in the poster for the television series, whereas all four Lethal Weapon film posters have featured the characters wielding their trusty firearms.

According to Entertainment Weekly, Fox chairman Dana Walden indicated the network is trying to find “the right balance” between stories that are relevant and stories that are overly violent.

Walden said:

“These are entertaining shows. We think about it a lot from the marketing side. Even the artwork you saw of Lethal Weapon, we’re trying to focus on the characters, not on guns, or the violence, in the show. You have to hit a balance. They’re trying to create stories that are relevant in this day and age and feel heightened and have life and death stakes and take place in a cop world or in the world of terrorism, it’s hard to imagine that without any violence, so it’s just trying to find the right balance.”

The network also said it will purposely lessen the amount of “gun play” depicted in its reboot of action thriller series 24. The new series will be called 24: Legacy, with newcomer Corey Hawkins taking over for previous series star Kiefer Sutherland.

“We’re telling a thriller story, so clearly there will be gun play, but we’re trying to tell it in a thoughtful and modulated and complicated and humanistic way,” Fox entertainment president David Madden told EW. “Jack Bauer was a one-of-a-kind character. Corey Hawkins, playing Eric Carter, has a whole different worldview. You’ll see some gunplay, but you’ll see it expressed in a thoughtful way.”

Madden did not explain how an anti-terror agent could “thoughtfully” kill a terrorist intent on harming Americans.

breitbart84,breitbart,['Katherine Rodriguez'],2017-01-26 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/26/u-s-navy-laser-weapons/,"The U.S. Navy will deploy a new laser weapon system on its ships within the next two years, according to a naval official.

“We’re doing a lot more with lasers,” Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall, director of the Surface Warfare Division, said earlier this month at the annual Surface Naval Association national symposium, according to Scout Warrior.

Boxall said the Navy plans to test a 150-kilowatt weapon from a ship within a year, and to deploy that weapon on a carrier or destroyer a year later.

The weapon will destroy incoming missiles, drones, aircraft, and other threats from the enemy.

The Navy unveiled a 30-kilowatt laser weapon on the U.S.S. Ponce during patrols of the Persian Gulf in 2014, the Daily Mail reported.

The AN/SEQ-3 (XN-1) Laser Weapons System (LaWS) aboard the USS Ponce was available to the ship’s commander as a defensive weapon to shoot down incoming missiles, drones, boats and other potential threats.

The laser weapons are very precise, designed to destroy threats at a cost of 59 cents per shot, and do not require old-style expensive ammunition.

The new laser weapons system will require a massive amount of power to operate. “The Navy will be looking at ships’ servers to provide three times that much power,” Donald Klick, director of business development for DRS Power and Control Technologies, told Scout Warrior. “To be putting out 150 kws, they [the weapons] will be consuming 450 kws.”

The power requirement for the new weapons system is more than most ships are able to accommodate. That means most ships require an “energy magazine” that would store energy for the laser to use as needed, according to a Naval Postgraduate School paper titled “Power Systems and Energy Storage Modeling for Directed Energy Weapons” by Jeremy Sylvester.

Klick says the laser weapons system has to go through rigorous Navy certification testing before it deploys on Navy ships, but he eventually sees the system being deployed on military aircraft in the future."

The Chicago Tribune reports that the violence brought the number of homicides to 242 for January 1 through May 30, 2017.

But WGN 9 notes that 49 shot and six killed is actually an improvement over Memorial Day Weekend 2016. On that weekend 71 were shot and seven were killed.

An example of the violence that marked Memorial Weekend was witnessed on Monday night. Three men “were…standing in the street at 69th and Harvard” when approached by another man who opened fire. One of the men was killed–shot in the head–and the other two are in stable condition.

There were no arrests in the shooting.

This kind of violence has flared up throughout 2017 (just as it did in 2016). For example, on March 30, 2017, two brothers were shot dead in front of their mother. The brothers, ages 19 and 20, went to the restaurant where their mother worked to say hello and were shot and killed as she looked at them through the window. Moreover, Breitbart News reported that 29 people in Chicago were shot in less than 18 hours on April 15, 2017.

On April 24, 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) suggested the violence in gun-controlled Chicago proves the need for more gun control. He specifically pushed for more regulations on Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders.

But on the day after Christmas, she was shot in the head.

Brooklyn Rouse, 21, agreed to keep driving into the neighborhood to deliver pizzas to customers in the dangerous Bloomfield area, even after another employee was robbed and shot in the shoulder on a delivery less than a week prior.

Rouse was shot in the head on December 26 as she tried to deliver two pizzas. Police found the shooting victim lying on the ground lapsing in and out of consciousness, the Macon Telegraph reported. The woman was taken to a nearby hospital and was listed in critical condition.

Police reported that Rouse was conscious enough to tell them she was robbed, then shot. The victim also told police she did not want to die. “(I) told her to keep squeezing my hand as she was in and out of consciousness,” an officer noted in a police report.

The young woman’s pizza shop boss praised her as a worker.

“I could call her in any time and she’ll be here like that,” manager Frank Hurley told the Charlotte Observer. “Yesterday, she was originally off. I had a driver call in because of the last incident, so I called her in to cover his shift and then it happened to her.”

Since Rouse was shot, the store has canceled all deliveries to the dangerous neighborhood.

Police are asking anyone with information to contact the sheriff’s office at 478-751-7500 or Macon Regional Crime Stoppers at 1-877-68CRIME.

That means 86 were shot and wounded and 14 were killed over one holiday weekend in Chicago. Yet Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) supports even more gun control on the good guys–federally licensed firearms dealers–and opposes concealed carry reciprocity for law-abiding citizens.

According to the Sun-Times, “36 people [were] shot across the city in an 8-hour span of violence between 8 p.m. Tuesday and 4 a.m. Wednesday” alone. During that 8-hour span, six people lost their lives.

The weekend’s first fatal shooting occurred just before 9:00 p.m. on Friday “in the South Side Englewood neighborhood.” The victim–52-year-old John Hunter–was shot and “pronounced dead at his apartment.” He was one of three individuals shot in that one incident. The other two victims–30-year-old Javon Jackson and 50-year-old Sedrick Ringer–were shot and fatally wounded as well. Ringer was pronounced dead at the scene and Jackson died at the hospital.

On June 30–the first day of the July 4th weekend–Breitbart News reported that President Trump had seen enough. He tweeted that he was sending “federal help” to gun-controlled Chicago to try to get the violence under control. He wrote:

Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017

He originally put Chicago city leaders on notice on January 24, when he tweeted about the “carnage” in Chicago and pledged to “send in the feds” if the tide of violence was not stemmed.

If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017

There were nearly 4,400 shooting victims in gun-controlled Chicago in 2016 and almost 800 homicides. At some point city officials have to realize that the gun control-first approach is inhumane. Human beings are being preyed upon by armed street criminals and gang members who are not concerned with laws prohibiting the possession of guns or laws prohibiting murder. Gun control does not stop them. Rather, it empowers them.

One was killed while two others sustained injuries.

Authorities responded to a call of shots fired in the rural community of Fronton, Starr County Sheriff’s Office Major Carlos Delgado said to Breitbart Texas. Local, state, and federal authorities found two fishermen who had been injured and a third killed by gunfire. The survivors are expected to recover.

According to preliminary witness statements, the male victims had been fishing when a group of suspected gunmen began firing from the Mexican side for unknown reasons, Delgado said.

The area where the shooting took place is not far from the spot where a U.S. Border Patrol agent and a Texas State Trooper were shot in November 2016, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. In that case, law enforcement officials were stuck by gunfire from an apparent battle between Mexican law enforcement and cartel members. The trooper was shot in the hip area while the agent was shot in the chest but was saved by his body armor and a loaded ammunition magazine.

Just days after the shooting of the two lawmen, cartel gunmen murdered another Texas fisherman west of that region in the area known as Falcon Lake in Zapata County. Falcon Lake is an area commonly used by Los Zetas to smuggle large quantities of marijuana and migrants into Texas. The area is immediately south of Zapata and Starr Counties. In that case, two men were fishing when a another boat approached them from the Mexican side, leading to a confrontation and the two victims being shot at. One of the men died from his wounds while the second fisherman has since recovered. The gunmen returned to Mexico after that shooting.

Falcon Lake is the same area where in 2015 Texas State Troopers on gunboats captured a top Los Zetas commander who was trying to sneak into Texas, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. In that case, authorities arrested Jose Manuel “Z-31″ or “El Borrado” Saldivar Farias, a regional leader for the cartel.

Falcon Lake was also the scene where Los Zetas gunmen murdered David Hartley in 2010 while he and his wife were jet-skiing, Breitbart Texas previously reported. Hartley and wife Tiffany had been riding in the lake until an apparent failed kidnapping led to David being struck by gunfire, while Tiffany managed to escape.

The video shows officer Nizaam Alexander conducting a routine traffic stop when he is approached from behind by a gunman.

The gun initially jammed, but the gunman was able to fire off a shot into the back of Alexander, hitting him in the back of his bullet-proof vest.

The officer returned fire at the retreating suspect and then radioed for help. Once the suspect escaped, Alexander returned to the traffic stop to finish giving the ticket.

Alexander was awarded for his “professionalism and dedication to duty” by the City of Cape Town’s traffic services.

Justin Lampkins, 25, was waiting in line at the drive-thru with his friends inside a truck when the veteran got involved in a fight and was shot, WTHR reported.

Police say the veteran was involved in the fight after someone honked the horn in the line and suspect Evan Schaffer, 22, allegedly got out of the line and punched Lampkins.

Police are not sure who honked the horn.

“The victim shoved the accused back, the accused then presented a handgun,” Joe DeWees, Bedford assistant police chief, told WTHR.

Schaffer then allegedly shot the victim in the chest before he fled the scene. Lampkins was taken to the hospital, where he later died, according to the Bedford Police Department’s Facebook page.

Authorities arrested Schaffer Sunday and charged him Monday with murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

“It’s a senseless act to kill somebody over a horn,” DeWees said. “This is one of the most senseless, senseless acts I have ever seen.”

WISH reported that Lampkins served four years in the Marines."

The extent of the suspects’ injuries was unclear.

A video of the incident shows the two suspects enter the store with hoodies partially covering their faces. One of the suspects talks with the cashier while the other walks through the aisles then returns to the front. The first suspect then climbs the counter, pulling a gun as he goes over.

The second suspect soon follows and takes off his backpack, which he apparently planned to use as a bag to hold valuables.

The cashier put his hands in the air was stepping out of the way when the security guard entered the building. The guard immediately fires at the suspects, who scream, “It’s fake, it’s fake.” The guard responds, “Oh well, mine’s is real.”

After shooting at the suspects the guard orders them both to stand up and put their hands behind their back. He tells the cashier, “Call 911.”

As many Chicagoans enjoyed the beautiful weather, from late Friday until early Saturday evening, others suffered the constant raging violence too often seen in the Windy City.

Thus far, the city has suffered one killed and nearly 40 shot before noon on Easter Day.

The one shooting death occurred in the 1300 block of South Fairfield Ave., the result, police said, of an argument between teenagers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The victim was shot in the back of the head and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Two other teens were also shot during the incident. All were treated at Mount Sinai.

Police say as many as 20 gunshots may have been exchanged during a heated argument at a house party.

While the death toll is low this year, with many hours still to go until the holiday weekend is over, more shootings are sure to come.

Despite the low death rate, the number of wounded for the holiday weekend has far exceeded that of the last three years.

Though the weekend bloodshed will continue as Sunday winds down, thus far, about 40 have been wounded compared to 33 in 2016, 31 in 2015, and 36 in 2014. But by noon on Easter Day, only one had been killed, while 3 died in 2016, 6 died in 2015, and 10 were killed in 2014.

The shootings bring the city’s violence count to 159 shot and killed, 752 wounded, and another ten murdered by other means.

While the focus has often been misplaced on the police in the Windy City, those killed in confrontations with cops is relatively low. For instance, in 2017, only four of the city’s 717 shooting deaths were at the hands of police. Thus far this year, there have been no police-involved shootings.

In one 16-hour period, 16 were shot with one killed.

From 1 PM on Friday to 2 Am early on Monday morning, the body count tallied higher than the bloodletting of the same day in the last two years, with several shooting incidents once again featuring multiple victims at once.

Friday blasted in with ten shooting victims, of which two died, with one of the incidents featuring a pair of victims in the same incident.

Two more incidents with multiple victims occurred overnight on Sunday, too, with four victims in a shooting in the Grand Crossing neighborhood and another three victims in an incident in the Douglas area.

One of the incidents on Sunday involved a civilian employee of the Chicago Police Department, who when confronted by a trio of armed robbers drew his own pistol and wounded one of the assailants, causing the rest to flee. The CPD employee was not injured.

Sunday also saw a flurry of shootings over the second half of the day, with 16 shootings and one death in a single 16-hour period.

The fatal shooting occurred when a 19-year-old man was shot in the chest at around 3:30 PM. A 14-year-old girl was also wounded that same afternoon.

The number of shootings was up this weekend over the same weekend for the last two years. The 42 shot and 5 killed this weekend was up over the 7 killed and 34 wounded in 2015 and the 2 killed and 30 wounded for 2014.

The weekend’s carnage was a capper for another dangerous week in neighborhoods already drenched in blood. In the Austin neighborhood, for instance, five were shot on the very same block where six were shot the weekend before.

The totals so far this year find an incredible 2,319 citizens shot with 340 shot and killed.

CNN described Stephen Willeford as someone who grabbed his AR-15 before he grabbed his shoes. He ran out of his home barefooted, rifle in hand, to engage the attacker, Devin Kelley. Willford positioned himself behind a car and shot the attacker as he walked out of the church during the attack.

Once shot, Kelley fled the scene.

Willeford, gave an emotional interview to KHBS and stressed that the people he went to help were friends of his, that “they were family.”

He said, “Everytime I heard a shot I knew that probably represented a life. I was scared to death. I was. I was scared for me and I was scared for every one of them and I was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away.”

He recounted coming to the church, waiting for Kelley outside, then opening fire: “He saw me and I saw him. I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover. I know I hit him. He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again.”

Once Kelley took off, Willeford jumped into a truck with eyewitness Johnnie Langendorff and literally chased the attacker until he died. Langendorff said of Willeford, “He’s very much a hero. He acted quicker than he could think … He did absolutely the right thing, which was try and take [the attacker] down on the scene.” He said Willeford was “just taking a nap and heard the gunshots and reacted.” Then he came out of his house “barefooted.”

Willeford stressed, “I am no hero. I am no hero. I think my God, my Lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done. And I just wish I could have gotten there faster but I didn’t know. I didn’t know what was happening.”

First off, an AR-15 is not an “Assault Rifle,” as it is not capable of firing in either burst or automatic modes. The AR in AR-15 stands for “Armalite Rifle”. Armalite was the first company to manufacture Eugene Stoner’s rifle design in the late 1950’s.

Another inaccuracy in the article was the suggestion that civilians cannot own machine guns. This is simply false.

Machine guns can be obtained for civilian ownership, however they come at a price of around $15,000 to $100,000 (or more). There is no required permit or license to own a machine gun, but the purchaser is required to submit an ATF form 5320.4 and submit to an extensive FBI background check which usually takes 12-18 months. Upon approval the citizen is issued what is called a federal “Tax Stamp,” and they must keep a copy of that stamp with the rifle at all times.

After receiving the stamp the purchaser is then required to fill out an ATF form 4473 and submit to yet another background check. Then they can take possession of the firearm.

In addition to the extensive paperwork and background checks involved in acquiring a machine gun, it must be noted that only machine guns manufactured before 1986 are legal for purchase. This shrinks the supply of machine guns available for ownership, which in turn drives up cost amid high demand.

A machine gun is an “assault rifle,” an AR-15 is not.

breitbart96,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-10-03 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/10/03/7-deceptive-claims-kimmel-guns-one-monologue/,"During his opening monologue on Monday night’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, host Jimmy Kimmel made seven false or misleading statements about gun laws as part of a push to shame Congress into enacting increased gun control measures following Sunday’s attack on a country music concert in Las Vegas that left 59 people dead and hundreds more injured.

Ironically, he did this after admitting that the Las Vegas attacker complied with all gun controls in purchasing a number of firearms–meaning he passed background checks for those guns. Moreover, Kimmel even admitted that the attacker had “no criminal record,” and therefore, nothing to keep him from passing a check to acquire a gun.

Breitbart News reported Monday that the attacker purchased three guns within the last year from Guns & Guitars in Mesquite, Nevada, where store manager Christopher Sullivan said the attacker came across as “a normal guy.” Sullivan said the attacker had no criminal history and indicated that he passed a FBI background check for his firearms.

Kimmel is correct on one point–there was nothing in the attacker’s past that signaled a problem. But after making that point, Kimmel argued that there are still things that Congress could be doing (and this is where the falehoods and/or misdirection come into play).

1. Kimmel said, “Orlando, Aurora, Newtown, San Bernardino, [in] every one of these shootings the murderer used automatic or semiautomatic rifles.” The inclusion of the word “automatic” is very misleading. In all four instances the rifle used was semiautomatic, period. Pistols were also present. Moreover, Kimmel did not mention that in three of the four instances, the attackers acquired their guns via background checks. Exceptions to this would be the rifles used in San Bernardino–they were acquired via a friend–but the San Bernardino handguns were acquired via a background check. And the guns used by the Newtown attacker were stolen. He stole them from someone who passed a background check for them.

2. Kimmel made the classic leftist claim that AR-15s and the like “are not weapons used for self-defense.” In doing so, he ignored the report of the Houston boy who used his father’s AR-15 to defend his sister’s life during a home invasion. When the two intruders broke into the home, the boy grabbed his father’s AR and shot one of them three times. He also ignored the Michigan gas station owner who stopped a robbery in progress at his station by pulling his AR-15 on the robbers. He also ignored the Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, son who was home alone when he used his father’s AR-15 to stop a home invasion by shooting all three suspects. The suspects died but the son’s life was preserved.

3. He accused President Trump of “signing a bill that made it easier for people with severe mental illness to buy guns legally.” This was a reference to Trump’s repeal of Obama’s Social Security gun ban; a ban that was actually not directed toward people with severe mental illness but toward recipients of disability benefits who required help with finances. Yes, mental health labels were given to these people, but those labels could reference easily treatable and temporary conditions. This is why Duke University psychiatry and behavioral science professor Jeffrey Swanson said Obama’s Social Security gun ban targeted the “vulnerable” rather than the dangerous.

4. He said that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “won’t do anything about [the attack] because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” In reality, Breitbart News has been reporting that NRA-supported legislation revolving around concealed carry reciprocity has stalled because of Ryan.

5. Kimmel said, “Right now, there are loopholes in the law that let people avoid background checks if they buy a gun privately–from another party–if they buy a gun online or at a gun show.” For starters, there is no loophole. The Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 and since that point (and before), Americans have been buying guns from Americans. It is not a loophole, it is freedom. The left pushed background checks and secured them on retail sales in 1998–i.e., there have been background checks on retail sales for nearly two decades–and the left has spent the last four or five years inaccurately describing private sales as a “loophole” as a way to persuade Americans to support more gun control. Also, it must be noted that it is illegal to buy a gun online without going through a background check. If an individual from Florida wants to purchase a firearm online from a gun store in Oklahoma, that gun has to be shipped to a Florida store where the buyer passes a background check before taking possession of it.

6. Kimmel then showed a collage containing the photos of Senators who voted against closing the fictional private sale, online sales, and gun show “loopholes” after the June 12, 2016, Orlando Pulse attack. He did not mention that the Orlando Pulse attacker did not use these “loopholes.” Rather, he passed background checks and a waiting period for his firearms.

7. Lastly, Kimmel said Congress is now working to “legalize the sale of silencers.” In reality, “silencers”–or suppressors, as they are properly called–have been legal and are legal in 42 states. They are widely owned and used by hunters and sport shooters because of the hearing protection benefits they offer. What Congress is considering is a bill that removes the federal tax on suppressors, as well as the burdensome acquisition process to obtain one.

Sanders stated that Trump will “continue to support the Second Amendment,” despite fears from gun-rights activists that he is interested in compromising with anti-gun Democrats in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Sanders spoke with reporters on Friday after Trump met with NRA executives in the Oval Office on Thursday night.

Privately, the NRA expressed concerns with Trump’s rhetoric on Wednesday, although the organization publicly dismissed it as “great TV” without policy teeth.

Sanders stated that Trump was not “necessarily” interested in requiring universal background checks for all private sales of firearms, only that he was interested in improving the existing background check system.

She reiterated the president’s support for the Cornyn-Murphy bill that had the NRA’s approval.

Sanders also indicated that Trump might not be interested in federal legislation to raise the legal age to purchase a rifle to 21, despite his vocal support for the idea.

“Conceptually, he still supports raising the age to 21. But he also knows there’s not a lot of broad support for that,” she said, adding that Trump believed the proposal would “probably have more potential in the states than it would at the federal level.”

Trump traveled to Rev. Billy Graham’s funeral in North Carolina on Friday and will then spend the weekend at his resort at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida."
breitbart98,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/22/trump-opens-door-national-gun-registry-proposed-gun-controls/,"President Trump opened the door Thursday morning to a national gun registry via his proposed “comprehensive background checks.”

He called for such checks via Twitter:

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue – I hope! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Although there is a lack of clarity on what Trump means by “comprehensive background checks,” as to whether he is referencing an overhaul of our current system or is pushing the universal background checks lauded by Democrats, it is important to note that this represents a turning point which opens the door to a national gun registry.

This is so because universal background checks are not enforceable without a gun registry.

For contemporary, real world proof of this danger just look at California, where universal background checks led to registration requirements which resulted in gun confiscation laws. This has all played out before our eyes and is evident to those who pay attention.

For evidence from law enforcement, just consider the way New Mexico Sheriff’s rallied to defeat universal background checks on the grounds that such checks would have led to a gun registry in that state. On February 9, 2017, Breitbart News reported that 32 of New Mexico’s 33 sheriffs signed a letter opposing the universal background checks that were being debated in the state legislature at that time. They described the checks as a “scheme” that “would be unenforceable without creating a gun registry.”

In addition to the contemporary evidence from California and the evidence from law enforcement, common sense proves that a gun registry is necessary if the government is to know who is selling a gun, when they are selling it, and to whom they are selling it. In other words, government officials cannot know that gun sales are being universally monitored unless they know the name of every gun owner and have identifying information about every gun possessed by those owners.

Would a gun registry prevent mass shootings? No, but it would set the stage for the kind of confiscatory actions seen in California. And it would be another step toward narrowing the means to acquire firearms, thereby empowering the government to more easily restrict the guns law-abiding citizens can or cannot own, as we have seen in California.

On August 8, 2016, Hillary Clinton used a Newsweek column to call for “comprehensive background checks.” On February 22, 2018, Trump tweeted his support for “comprehensive background checks” as well. The question before us is whether Trump is voicing support for the same checks Clinton had in mind. If so, a gun registry will be necessary to make them work.

Hogg made the comments Sunday during a gun control rally held at Temple B’nai Abraham in Livingston, New Jersey.

The New York Daily News reports that Hogg said, “I’m not going back to school on Wednesday until one bill is passed.” He did not specify which law he wants most, only that he is not going back until at least one law garners the support of lawmakers.

He said, “Literally any legislation at this point would be a success. Considering the fact that so few legislators in Florida met with us and they want the people to forget, that’s disgusting. The fact that they want people to forget about this and elect them again as the child murderers they are, that’s unacceptable and we’re not going to let that happen.”

To date, state-level gun control proposals include “tougher background checks,” a bump stock ban, a waiting period for long gun purchases, raising minimum age for rifle purchases to 21-years old, and gun confiscation orders similar to California’s Gun Violence Restraining Orders. All of these gun controls were proposed last week by Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and not a single one of them would have prevented the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Proposed gun controls at the federal level include proposals similar to Gov. Scott’s, plus an “assault weapons” ban and “universal background checks.” Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) is a leading voice for these gun controls, even though neither one would have prevented the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. (The “assault weapons” ban would not have prevented the shooting because such a ban, if fashioned like the 1994-2004 ban, does not actually ban certain guns. Rather, it bans cosmetic features. And universal background checks would be impotent because the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, passed a background check for the rifle he used on February 14.)

The one change that could make an immediate difference in school safety would be to arm teachers as Utah did over 15 years ago, and as is currently being done in school districts in Colorado, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and other states. But David Hogg, Gov. Scott, and Rep. Deutch all oppose arming teachers for school safety.

Gov. Scott said we should rely on law enforcement, Deutch said talk of arming teachers is a “distraction,” and Hogg said money that would be used to arm teachers should instead be put into S.T.E.M. studies so teachers “can do more cool stuff and we’ll be able to create jobs in renewable, clean and independent American energy like wind and solar.”

breitbart100,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-27 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/27/poll-americans-blame-school-shooting-government-not-guns/,"The latest Rasmussen Reports survey shows that Americans blame government rather than guns for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.

According to Rasmussen, 54% of Americans believe government failure is to “blame for the mass shooting.” Only 33% of Americans blame guns. Eleven percent of Americans say they are unsure what contributed to the occurrence of the mass shooting.

When the sample group was adjusted so as to focus only on Americans “who have children of elementary or secondary school age,” the percentage of Americans who cite government failure as causal jumped to 61 and the percentage who blamed guns dropped to 23.

On February 23 Breitbart News summarized government’s failure:

The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBCSO) received 911 calls about Nikolas Cruz in November 2017. The calls referenced violence and erratic behavior. CNN reports that in one of the calls with the host family, with whom Cruz was living after the death of his mother, told PBCSO they feared Cruz was going to turn a gun on the family. The family member told deputies that Cruz was “buying “tons of ammo” and had allegedly put “put [a] gun to others heads in the past.” No charges were filed, no arrest made. On January 5, 2018, the FBI received a tip describing “Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” The FBI did not act on the tip. On February 14 Cruz attacked students and unarmed teachers in Stoneman Douglas High. A report from CNN claims four Broward County sheriff’s deputies were at the school as the attack was taking place but not one of them entered the school. On February 22 Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told ABC 13 that video showed deputy Scott Peterson by building 12 on campus, yet Peterson never went inside to confront Cruz. The CNN report quotes Coral Springs sources that claim there were actually four Broward County deputies on scene who did not enter the building.

Additionally, Breitbart News reported that Broward County Sheriff’s deputy Scott Peterson was outside the school’s building 12 while the attack occurred. He never went in to confront Nikolas Cruz.

On the other hand, the 19-year-old who attacked the school complied with gun control laws in acquiring his rifle. He passed a background check at a gun store just as the law demands.

The school was gun-free zone, and he ignored that, as criminals regularly ignore laws that would otherwise hinder them from carrying out their crimes. The school was also an ammunition-free zone, but Cruz ignored that too.

He also ignored statutes against murder.

What difference would once more law have made?

“This is a moment. This is exactly what happened during the Civil Rights Movement where people … they were 18-, 19-, 20-years old, young people who said, ‘We have had enough. Enough,'” Winfrey told DeGeneres of the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and across the country who walked out of class this week in support of more gun control laws. “These kids are right there.”

Encouraging the gun control protesters to get “organized,” Oprah Winfrey said the “reason why the Civil Rights Movement worked, [is because] there was a strategy. There was a plan. It wasn’t just out there, hocus pocus protesting all the time. There was a strategy, there was a plan.”

The OWN boss joined George and Amal Clooney on Tuesday in pledging $500,000 to the student gun control “March for Our Lives,” which is organizing a planned march next month.

“George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives,'” Winfrey tweeted.

George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’ These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard. — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) February 20, 2018

Partial transcript as follows:

The shortcomings of this administration are clear. They are usually worth it though, for two reasons. First, the ideas the president ran on are basically right. America first ought to be the principle of every administration by definition it’s an American administration. America should be first. But that’s not the motto of most administrations. Not even hardly. Second, the alternatives to what we have now are scary and getting scarier. The Democratic Party is completely irresponsible and increasingly anti-American. They prefer illegal aliens to our middle class. It’s true and terrifying. Somebody needs to defend the country from these people. Trump mostly does that. So for these reasons, most of the president’s supporters have stuck by him no matter what has happened, and a lot has happened. But there is a limit to the tolerance. They will not tolerate, and they shouldn’t have to tolerate, by the way, betrayal on the core promises of his campaign. And it seems to be happening on guns, unfortunately.

A few days ago, the president called for raising the minimum age for buying a gun to 21. By the way, that’s four years after we let people join the military. They can joint at 17. But he is saying you can’t buy a gun until you are 21. Nobody is even arguing this will save actual lives because there is no research that it will. It’s propaganda, and sneaky propaganda, by the way, incremental step toward more gun restrictions. That’s all it is. The president went further than that—met with lawmakers to talk gun control at the White House. At that meeting, he went after Republicans who wanted to defend the Second Amendment, suggesting they are puppets of the NRA. At one point the president said the government should, quote, take the guns first, go through due process second. Now, I mean, how honest do you want to be? Imagine if Barack Obama had said that? Just ignore due process and start confiscating guns? Obama would have been denounced as a dictator. We would have denounced him first, trust me. Congress would be talking impeachment. Some would be muttering success. The media agreed—they underplayed it and suggested a battle between the president and NRA. It’s not about the NRA. It’s not even about the president. It’s about the Constitution, and the Constitution remains the same no matter who is in power. That’s the point of the Constitution."

And while it must be noted that these 25 examples are only a smidgen of the hundreds of thousands of DGUs that occur each year–see the academic work of Florida State University’s Gary Kleck–they nonetheless present a well-rounded summation of the various locations and circumstances in which law-abiding citizens use guns to defend their own lives and the lives of others.

Here are the top 25 DGUs of 2017:

January 2, 2017–Kay Dickinson was attacked while entering her Wilmington, North Carolina, apartment. WWAY repoted that Dickinson had just gotten off work and was going into her apartment at Colonial Parke when she was attacked.” The suspect held her at gunpoint, “beat her and then tied her up with a broken belt in her bedroom.” She was able to work free, retrieve her gun, and kill the suspect.

January 12, 2017–An concealed carry permit holder saw an Arizona State Trooper being beaten on the side of Interstate 10. The permit holder pulled over, asked the Trooper if he needed help, then intervened when the Trooper answered in the affirmative. The permit holder ordered the attacker to stop, then shot him dead after he refused to comply. It turned out that the suspect had shot the Trooper before the permit holder arrived, then climbed on top of him in a rage and began beating him on the side of the road. The permit holder saved the Trooper’s life.

January 20, 2017–Charlotte, North Carolina’s Kim Badger was attacked in “broad daylight” by a home invasion suspect armed with a baseball bat. WCNC reported that the attacker struck Badger with the bat, then pursued her through the house. Throughout the attack Badger fought to deny the suspect control of a knife that was on a counter and, eventually, to deny him access to a sword. Badger’s teenage son joined the fight to keep the suspect away from the sword. As the son fought, the mother retrieved her gun and shot the suspect dead.

January 29, 2017–Two masked suspects entered West Philadelphia’s Eagele’s Corner Chinese takeout and “announced a robbery.” According to 6 ABC, police indicated that two store owners were present at the time and one of the owners pulled a gun and opened fire. The owner opened fire, causing both of the suspects to flee. One of the suspects was struck by the owner’s gunfire and was arrested after his accomplice drove him to the hospital for treatment.

February 9, 2017–A legally armed citizen in Holland, Michigan, shot and critically wounded a suspect who would not stop assaulting a woman inside a convenience store. Holland Police issued a press release recounting the incident by explaining that “the suspect violently punched the victim several times and threw her down to the ground, and it is at that point that the [armed] customer arrives and tries to intervene.” The suspect then turned and attacked the customer who was trying to intervene, leading the customer to open fire. The suspect was shot twice and hospitalized in critical condition.

March 8, 2017–A home invasion suspect who approached a family was shot and killed by the father after refusing to accept food stamps in lieu of money. WBRZ quoted East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore saying, “The [father] was at his own home with his family and was confronted by another individual who was armed. There was a scuffle which eventually led to shots being fired and the person who came to the home was shot and killed.” The father offered the suspect food stamps prior to fighting and eventually killing him.

March 9, 2017–A Houston, Texas, smoke shop owner was shot multiple times yet managed to pull his own gun and kill one of two robbery suspects. ABC 13 reported that customers were in the store when the two suspects entered. Those customers called 911 and the dispatcher could hear the sound of gunshots in the background. The store owner was hospitalized in critical condition after the uninjured suspect fled the scene.

March 21, 2017–A 21-year-old suspect kicked in his ex-girlfriend’s apartment door, then died after being shot multiple times. As it turns out, the ex-girlfriend’s brother was in the Detroit apartment and opened fire on the suspect. Police responded to find the suspect had a gun and had left his car parked in the street with the engine running.

April 14, 2017–A homeowner in Pierce County, Washington, awoke to the sound of someone trying to enter his home around 3:30 a.m. The homeowner retrieved a gun and went to investigate, ultimately firing one shot and killing 28-year-old Viktor Starovevrov. The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department responded to a call of shots fired and arrived to find Starovenrov beyond hope of survival. A 32-year-old woman and three-year-old girl were asleep in the house when the invasion was foiled.

April 23, 2017–A St. Louis 7-11 clerk was taking a smoke break around 3:50 a.m. when a robbery suspect approached and attempted to rob her. The clerk pulled her own gun and exchanged fire with the suspect, shooting him multiple times. The suspect’s wounds proved fatal. The clerk was also wounded in the gunfight, yet was in stable condition following the incident.

May 3, 2017–An Arlington, Texas, man described by witnesses as an “active shooter” was shot and killed by a concealed carry permit holder in Zona Caliente Sports Bar around 6:15 p.m. WFAA reported that the armed suspect shot and killed the bar manager and was then was engaged by the permit holder, who shot the aggressor dead. Police explained that the permit holder intervened out of fear that inaction would lead to a further “loss of life.”

May 12, 2017–A female homeowner shot and killed a suspect who allegedly brought his sevem-year-old son along for the home invasion. The San Antonio Express-News reported the suspect allegedly tried to break in through a window in the very room where the homeowner happened to be asleep. The woman heard the suspect trying to make entry into her home, armed herself, and fired at least two rounds. Police arrived in time to transport the alleged intruder to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

May 18, 2017–A home invasion suspect wearing only underwear was shot and killed after breaking into a pastor’s home in Cypress, Texas. The suspect entered the home around 2:00 a.m. and attacked the pastor and his wife. As the intruder went room to room looking for other would-be victims, he came upon an extended family member who was armed. That family member shot and killed the intruder, saving others in the home from coming under attack.

May 29, 2017–An armed neighbor in Ada, Oklahoma, came to the rescue of three children who were being drowned by their father. Cash Freeman was alerted to the situation when a terrified 12-year-old ran to his house to say the estranged father had taken the children from the mother and was trying to drown them. Freeman arrived to find the father holding three-month-old twins under water. Freeman shot the father twice, killing him and saving the children.

June 7, 2017–An Indianapolis mother protected her children by opening fire and killing a home invasion suspect who struck in broad daylight. Fox 59 reports that the mother heard someone trying to get into the apartment, then came to face-to-fact with 19-year-old Michael Hawkins. She opened fire at that point and Hawkins dropped dead “inside the doorway.” The mother and the children were not harmed.

June 17, 2017–A man was shot and killed by his ex-girlfriend after he allegedly threatened her and showed up to her house with an “assault rifle.” The incident occurred in Florida’s Pasco County around 10:30 pm. According to Fox 13 News, law enforcement officials said 45-year-old Frank Harrison had “previously threatened his ex-girlfriend.” When she saw him approaching her home she opened the front door and shot him dead before he could enter.

July 17, 2017–With a car thief on the lose near her family’s home 17-year-old Kimber Wood called her dad and asked if she could retrieve one of his guns to keep close at hand for self-defense. Her father said yes, so Kimber retrieved the gun and was ready when the suspect entered the house. Kimber and the suspect came face to face, only to have to him flee when she pointed the gun at him and ordered him to leave the home. She chased him as he fled and fired a warning shot to assure him that she knew how to use the gun.

July 31, 2017–A Katy, Texas, grandma opened fire on two home invasion suspects, leaving one dead. According to ABC 13, Harris County Sheriff’s deputies said the 60-year-old grandma was home alone when two suspects allegedly entered through the garage. Deputy Thomas Gilliland said, “Both were armed with pistols. She confronted both suspects, retrieved a handgun and fired several times at both subjects.”

August 5, 2017–An elderly homeowner in Lakewood, Florida, shot and killed a home intruder. The homeowner was in the home with his wife when they heard the suspect make entry. He grabbed a gun, confronted the suspect, then killed him. Law enforcement officials did not report how many times the suspect was shot, only that he was dead when responding officers arrived.

September 6, 2017–Three Taco Bell employees opened fire and killed an armed robbery suspect in Cleveland, Ohio. According to Fox 8, police said two suspects entered the store “wearing masks and ordered the employees to the ground at gunpoint.” There were multiple employees in the store at the time and three of them responded by opening fire. When officers arrived the suspect who had been fatally wounded was lying face down and a gun was still in his hand.

September 14, 2017–An Indianapolis father shot and killed an intruder who burst through the front door and rushed into the apartment. The father’s two young children were home at the time of the foiled invasion. CBS 4 quoted Indianapolis Metropolitan Police officer Aaron Hamer, who said, “It appears [the suspect] was yelling to get into the residence because he believed his kids were in the house. It turns out the kids inside did not belong to him.” The father and his two children were not harmed.

September 18, 2017–A female accountant shot and critically wounded a suspect who broke into her office as she was there typing alone. The suspect was fleeing police when he entered the office and the accountant asked to stop coming at her before she pulled the trigger and shot him in the neck. The suspect survived being shot, but has to undergo rehab to learn how to walk again.

September 24, 2017–Two home invasion suspects rushed into a Bridgeville, Maryland, home around 11:55 pm. Police indicated that at least one of the suspects was armed. The homeowner, home alone at the time off the invasion, wrestled with the armed suspect and shot was fired, killing the suspect. The suspect’s body was lying in the kitchen when police arrived. The homeowner was not injured.

November 5, 2017–Stephen Willeford was in his home in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when his daughter rushed inside to let him know someone was shooting congregants at the First Baptist Church. Willeford grabbed his AR-15 and a handful of bullets and ran barefoot toward the church in order to confront the killer. Upon arriving, Willeford took a defensive position behind a truck and exchanged fire with the killer, shooting him twice. The killer fled the scene after Willeford shot him, driving roughly 11 miles before taking his own life. Willeford proved anew the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.

December 6, 2017–A father with a handgun license shot and killed an armed suspect who confronted the father and his family in a Popeye’s restaurant. According to Fox 29, the suspect pointed a gun at the father and “demanded his property.” The father asked that his family be released, then pulled his own gun when the suspect became distracted by individuals walking out the restroom. The father shot the suspect multiple times, killing him on the spot.

The Second Amendment is not about duck hunting or plinking, but protecting our lives and liberty from threats as they arise. The top 25 defensive gun uses of 2017 show that law-abiding Americans understand this and are putting their guns to good use.

The record attendance comes as Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Bill Nelson (D-FL) push more gun control for gun shows. Other Democrats, like Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL), are pushing an “assault weapons” ban, a bump stock ban, and universal background checks, among other controls.

The public response to the gun control push was a record turnout at the Florida Gun Show.

WTSP reports “almost 7,000” people attended the show Saturday, and they expected even more people to attend on Sunday.

Gun show manager George Fernandez said he has never seen crowds so big. And he quickly admitted, “Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights.”

WTSP reporter Shannon Valladolid tweeted video from the gun show:

breitbart105,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-12-15 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/12/15/ninth-circuit-10-day-waiting-firearm-purchases-constitutional/,"On December 14, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that California’s ten-day waiting period on gun purchases is constitutional.

People who purchase firearms in California undergo a background check and pay for the gun, then are required to wait ten days before being allowed to actually take possession of the firearm. The court described this waiting period as “a reasonable safety precaution.”

According to the Wall Street Journal, Calguns and the Second Amendment Foundation filed the suit against the waiting period in 2011. They “argued that current gun owners are entitled to take home guns they purchase as soon as they pass a background check.” A federal judge sided with the Calguns and the Second Amendment Foundation in 2014, ruling that “the waiting period served no public-safety purpose when enforced against buyers who already own guns and who pass the background check.” But the 2014 ruling was appealed, and the Ninth Circuit has now ruled in favor of the state of California.

The Ninth Circuit saw the ten-day wait as a “cooling-off period.” Judge Mary M. Schroeder wrote, “An individual who already owns a hunting rifle, for example, may want to purchase a larger capacity weapon that will do more damage when fired into a crowd.”

Ironically, Florida has a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases. The Orlando attacker waited three days, as required, before picking the handgun he carried into Orlando Pulse nightclub the night of his attack.

It is important to note that the language of a “cooling-off period” has been part of the liberal lexicon for decades; it is part of their justification for waiting periods. But framing a waiting period in this way misses a key point: namely, many innocent people–women in particular–are harmed by waiting periods. In New Jersey in 2015, Carol Bowne needed a gun for self-defense, and while she waited for the state’s permission to buy one, she was brutally stabbed to death in her own driveway.

breitbart106,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-01-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/19/bloomberg-turns-firearm-burglaries-campaign-gun-control-gun-stores/,"Bloomberg is using ATF reports on gun store burglaries to call for more gun control for licensed firearm dealers.

Such controls have been pushed in California, where they would serve to drive neighborhood, mom & pop gun stores out of business. In a word, the expensive security measures would allow only those with the deepest pockets, and/or the largest conglomeration backing, to survive.

Bloomberg quotes ATF numbers to show that gun store burglaries across the U.S. went from 3,355 in 2013 to 7,841 in 2017. They point out that gun-friendly Texas had the largest number of guns burglarized at 769, after which the highest number for any other state was 456.

Equally gun-friendly Georgia came in at 427 guns burglarized last year, but that number was down considerably from 1,069 gun burglarized in Georgia in 2016. This shows a lot of fluctuation and may indicate that the overall number of burglaries have an ebb and flow which escapes the untrained eye.

Breitbart News has reported gun store burglaries on numerous occasions and, as with high profile firearm attacks, it is clear that the burglaries would not be easily deterred. For example, it is not uncommon to see “smash and grab” robberies where suspects in large vehicles drive to glass or walls to get to firearms:

Nevertheless, Bloomberg asked Gabby Giffords’ gun control group what they thought and policy advisor David Chipman said:

When states require gun dealers to take responsible steps to prevent their stores from being burglarized—by properly securing not only their stores, but the firearms themselves—they eliminate the risk of thieves taking off with weapons. We know how to solve this problem, but we need more states to acknowledge this issue and put best practices for reducing gun store theft into action.

Once the onus for gun store robberies is shifted from the perpetrator to the gun store owner–and the owner required to spend more and more money on various, expensive security measures–it is only a matter of time until mom & pop gun stores across the U.S. find they can not longer afford to be in the gun business.

Under a Trump administration, that means individual Americans should have the freedom to own the gun they are most comfortable with using for self-defense, whether a revolver, a semi-automatic handgun, a shotgun, or an AR-15 or AK-47.

According to Business Insider, “One thing Trump’s 2016 presidential platform is clear on is protecting the rights of gun owners and preventing any legislation that impedes their right to bear arms.”

Trump views an “assault weapons” ban as something that clearly impedes the Second Amendment.

When questioned in March about his position on an “assault weapons” ban, Trump said, “I do not support the ban on assault weapons.” His website says: “The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.” And Trump also believes Americans should be able to own “high capacity” magazines if they are comforted by having the added rounds for self-defense.

Breitbart News previously reported that Trump views “assault weapons” and “high capacity” magazine bans as leftist ploys to limit the freedom of citizens. Trump said:

Opponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like “assault weapons,” “military-style weapons” and “high capacity magazines” to confuse people. What they’re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans. Law-abiding people should be allowed to own the firearm of their choice.

The hero cop who was shot in the face by an ex-con died Monday after a two day struggle to stay alive, sources said… It also means that Demetrius Blackwell will likely face a murder charge for gunning down the 25-year-old officer in Queens Village on Saturday, the sources said.

Read the rest of the article here and be sure to check out Breitbart News Network’s live account of the Saturday night attack here.

The New York Daily News also published an account of the deadly shooting:

Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch was shaken following a bedside visit with the gravely wounded cop from Massapequa, L.I. “We’re praying that our hero officer comes through, but with any kind of brain injury, it’s difficult to tell,” Lynch said.

As Moore struggled in the hospital, Blackwell, 35, was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, assault and criminal possession of a weapon.

The cretin allegedly told detectives following his arrest, “They call me D. They also call me hell-raiser on the streets.”

[…]

Moore was driving an unmarked police car when he and partner Erik Jansen, 30, both on-duty but in plainclothes, pulled up behind Blackwell, whom they had spotted “adjusting an object in his waistband,” said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.

Moore identified himself as a police officer and asked, “Do you have something in your waistband?” a source said.

Blackwell responded: “Yeah, I got something,” pulled his gun and fired two to three shots into the car at the corner of 212th St. and 104th Road, hitting Moore in the face, the source said.

The woman who lives in the house where Blackwell fled said she heard the gunshots.

“When I came outside, all I heard (the officer) saying . . . ‘Partner, please stay with me.’ I saw him pick up his radio and call it in,” she said.

Cops nabbed Blackwell, who has nine prior arrests, including two for assaulting officers, at the home about 90 minutes after the attack.

Andre Tucker, 26, who also lives at the house where Blackwell was busted, said the suspect was one cool customer — hiding in plain sight just feet from the crime scene.

“(Blackwell) was hanging out for an hour and a half, smoking cigarettes and talking like everything is normal,” Tucker said.

He, Blackwell and others stood in the front yard gawking at the growing manhunt until cops ordered them all to go inside.

[…]

Blackwell, a cousin of former Giants cornerback Kory Blackwell, went to prison on an attempted murder conviction after firing into a car in July 2000 following a robbery. He was released from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate Dannemora in June 2008.

Blackwell was also wanted by authorities on a criminal mischief charge stemming from an incident last November in which he threw bricks at the windows of a house while toting a gun, police said.

Moore was the fifth NYPD officer shot since December. Two of the victims, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, were assassinated by the same cop-hating madman.

Israel, with its long and painful history of contending with terrorism, is rich with examples that prove this contention. In recent years, armed citizens have stopped dozens of terrorists. In some cases, those citizens acted when cowardly police officers shrank from danger.

For instance, on March 6, 2008, a terrorist disguised as a delivery man entered the Merkaz Harav seminary in Jerusalem with an assault rifle hidden in a television box. He opened fire on students studying in the library.

Two beat cops arrived on the scene but failed to enter the building to stop the killing.

In the event, a seminary student armed with a handgun, and an off duty infantry officer who lived in the neighborhood, heard the shots and ran to the seminary. The student, a young rabbi, was armed with a handgun; the officer was carrying his assault rifle. Both men ignored the police officers who told them not to go inside. They entered the building and killed the terrorist, ending the massacre. By the time they arrived, eight students, including five high school students, had been killed, while eight more were wounded.

The most recent Palestinian terror campaign, which lasted more or less from October 2015 through April 2016, showed the need for an armed citizenry. In two major attacks in Tel Aviv, the terrorists, armed with rifles were able to kill at will for several minutes because none of the civilians at the sites of the attacks were armed.

In contrast, terror attacks in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, which took place during the same period, were repeatedly stopped at their outset by armed civilians who ran to the scene within moments.

In response to the public outcry, Public Security Minister Glad Erdan slightly loosened restrictions on eligibility for gun licenses and encouraged citizens with gun licenses to carry their weapons wherever they go.

Erdan’s move to loosen restrictions on eligibility for gun permits shone a light on an aspect of Israeli life of which foreigners are largely unaware.

The widespread conception in the U.S. in particular is that Israeli gun laws are liberal. This is incorrect. Israel has strict gun laws. But at the same time, it has mandatory conscription in the military.

Active duty combat soldiers on leave are often required to take their weapons home with them. Soldiers who do not own gun safes large enough to store their assault rifles are required to take them everywhere they go. As a result, tourists often happily snap pictures of young Israelis carrying assault rifles at restaurants and nightclubs.

Israel’s gun laws are the nightmare of Second Amendment champions. To be eligible for a gun license in Israel you must be 21 years old and a military veteran, or 27 years old.

Only people who meet specific criteria are eligible to apply for gun permits. Israelis who live or work in communities defined as at-risk from a national security perspective by the government can apply for gun licenses. Farmers, tour guides, and people who transport hazardous materials are permitted to carry a gun. Military officers and NCOs on active duty may carry a personal handgun. Veterans of special forces units and other elite security services are permitted to carry a gun. Retired senior officers are entitled to carry a gun.

To receive a weapons permit, you must first undergo weapons training at a certified training facility and receive a health certification from a licensed physician.

If you are healthy and are eligible, you may receive a gun permit. That permit enables you to own and carry one handgun and fifty bullets.

Shotgun and rifle ownership is limited to veterinarians, nature preserve employees, and licensed hunters. These weapons may only be used for animal control.

However, whereas in the U.S. most states do not permit armed citizens to walk around with their weapons exposed, Israel has no such restrictions on its gun owners. Gun owners may carry their weapons openly or in a concealed manner, whichever they prefer.

Whereas private ownership of firearms is constrained, public use of firearms is more widespread. Every school in Israel is guarded by an armed security guard. Everyone entering a school has to pass through a manned, secure entrance.

Armed guards escort all school trips everywhere in the country.

Armed guards and metal detectors are stationed at the entrance to every underground parking lot, every supermarket, every hospital, every shopping mall, and every hotel in Israel.

All major public events need to be approved by the police. The organizers need to secure the perimeter of their events in coordination with the police. As a result, most of the mass shooting attacks that happened in the U.S. and Europe in recent years would have been much more difficult to carry out in Israel. For instance, the truck ramming attack on Bastille Day in Nice in 2016, in which an Islamic State terrorist killed 86 and wounded 458, would not have been possible in Israel.

In Israel, police would have cordoned off the entire area where the event took place. No trucks would have been permitted to enter the perimeter and likely no unauthorized vehicles would have been permitted to enter the perimeter. Moreover, security guards and metal detectors would have been deployed at all entry points to the event.

The massacre outside the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino in Las Vegas last year would also have been more difficult, if not impossible, to have carried out in Israel.

A security officer at the entrance to the hotel would have stopped the shooter from bringing his weapons and ammunition into the building.

If the killer had managed to smuggle his weapons into the hotel, and had begun shooting, it would have taken hotel security officers very little time to identify the source of the fire, enter his room, and stop him.

Israel bars gun ownership from mentally ill individuals. While there are a lot of illegal weapons in Israel – particularly in the Arab community – there is no legal way for someone who is mentally ill to acquire a weapon lawfully.

Despite the vast differences regarding the private ownership of weapons, there are two lessons from Israel’s experience that may be significant for Americans searching for ways to stop mass shootings.

The first lesson that Israel can offer relates to tactics for minimizing the risk of attack. Americans can learn from the Israeli model of controlling entry and exit points from schools and other public facilities; from Israel’s ban on guns to the mentally ill; and from its unapologetic policy of profiling terror suspects.

The second lesson from Israel’s experience that bravery is a vital social virtue.

Like millions of Americans, Israelis are brave. Because they are brave, they stand up to terrorists. When they have guns, they stand up to terrorists with guns. When they lack guns, they stand up to terrorists with whatever they have.

In February 2017, a group of citizens outside a sewing machine repair shop in Petah Tikva in central Israel stopped a terrorist who had been shooting and stabbing bus passengers by throwing sewing machines at him.

In January 2016, a mom-and-pop grocery store owner in a small town in Judea blocked two knife-wielding terrorists from entering his store by pushing them out with a shopping cart.

A society that values bravery can rely on its citizens to be brave more easily than a society that values victimhood.

Israel’s restrictive gun laws are a function of many aspects of Israeli society that are very different from conditions in America, including its powerful central government, its socialist roots, and its large Arab community.

Israel’s tragic history with terror attacks has required Israel to learn how to secure all public spaces and deploy forces to major civilian thoroughfares. And it has also taught Israelis to be brave."

The incident occurred approximately one week after 17 people were shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

The Sacramento Bee reported that the symbol was widely discussed and one student’s comments that the square root symbol “looked like a gun” fueled speculation of a “terroristic threat.”

KATC TV3 tweeted:

Is this what things have come to?? 😔 — Scott J. (@cajunsj) February 22, 2018

Police went to the student’s home and searched it but found “no guns or any evidence that he had any access to guns.” Moreover, the Bee indicated they found “no evidence the student had any intent to commit harm.”

The Allen Parish Sheriff’s Office observed, “The student used extremely poor judgment in making the comment, but in light of the actual circumstances, there was clearly no evidence to support criminal charges.”

On November 29 Breitbart News reported that the HPD had sent letters to about 30 medical marijuana cardholders ordering them to surrender their guns within 30 days. KITV pointed out that the letters informed cardholders to “surrender weapons, permits, and ammunition to HPD or to transfer ownership.”

The Honolulu Star reported that police have been sending letters throughout the year and the one dated November 13 was signed by HPD chief Susan Ballard. It informed cardholders that their “medical marijuana use disqualifies [them] from ownership of firearms and ammunition.”

The Associated Press reports that the HPD is reviewing the policy after it “sparked backlash from residents.”

Although federal law prohibits firearm purchases by persons who use marijuana, Dr. Clifton Otto said the HPD “cannot justify taking firearms away by citing medical marijuana use as a violation of federal law.” He suggested “federal scheduling of marijuana does not apply for medical use in Hawaii.”

However, on August 31, 2016, Breitbart News reported that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a ban on gun ownership for medical marijuana users as constitutional. The decision came in light of the fact that marijuana use remains illegal on the federal level, whether state-sanctioned or not. This means medical marijuana cardholders cannot pass background check form 4473 and, therefore, cannot legally purchase a firearm.

Does this also mean cardholders cannot keep firearms that they currently possess? That is the question with which the HPD is grappling.

The legislation supported by the NRA is the Hearing Protection Act, a bill which removes suppressors from the auspices of the National Firearms Act (1934) in order to streamline the process law-abiding citizens must go through to purchase one. The current process requires a would-be buyer to be fingerprinted, photographed, and submit to a background check. Moreover, the buyer has to pay the federal government a $200 tax and register the suppressor with the ATF. The entire process takes six to eight months. The Hearing Protection Act would change this, allowing law-abiding citizens to buy suppressors by simply passing the same background check they pass to buy a gun at retail.

In an editorial titled “Echoes of Gunfire Hurt Tender NRA Ears,” NYT said:

The National Rifle Association argues, self-servingly, that noisy guns are a public health hazard. With supporters like President Trump’s son Donald Jr., …it wants to roll back an 80-year-old federal law that tightly controls the sale of firearms silencers. Immune to irony, the NRA’s congressional friends have introduced a measure called the Hearing Protection Act, which contends that the sound of gunfire is hard on the ears of gun owners.

They then make claims similar to those put forward by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Gabby Gifford’s gun control group, and others, saying, “When it comes to public health, the noisier a gun is the better the chances for innocent bystanders to hit the ground and for police officers to apprehend the shooter.”

It is interesting to note that on March 20–four days before the NYT regurgitated the argument of Gillibrand and others–The Washington Post rejected claims that firearm suppressors will allow guns to be used criminally without detection. WaPo give Gillibrand’s claims three Pinnochios, indicating such claims contain “significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions.”

“[T]he Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable,” he wrote. “They should try winning an election. Sad!”

Trump suggested that the media was bored with the Russia investigation, saying that investigations over his campaign’s collusion with them were a “total hoax.”

Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable.

“The only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia,” he added.

Trump has gone to war against the Michael Wolff book, calling into question it’s accuracy.

“I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!” Trump wrote on Thursday night. “I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.”"
breitbart114,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-03-27 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2017/03/27/canadian-researchers-more-education-gun-control-needed-to-curb-unintentional-firearm-injuries/,"Canadian researchers, who released a study showing “one child or youth” is shot every day in Ontario, suggest more public health education and gun control are key ways of curbing the frequency of the incidents.

The study was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ).

The researchers involved with the study believe more gun laws are needed at this time, including a focus on gun storage. Researchers also intimate that unintentional firearm injuries are tied to a lack of education in general, not simply firearm education.

The researchers note:

Household gun ownership increases the risk of unintentional firearm injuries. The lower rates of unintentional firearm injuries observed among nonrefugee immigrants may relate to low rates of firearm ownership by immigrants, residence in urban areas and selection policies for immigrants to Canada who are highly educated. The increasing risk of firearm injury with longer time spent in Canada highlights one area for possible public health education and consumer regulation around gun safety and storage.

It is interesting to note that Canada already has stringent gun control laws. Breitbart News reported that Canadian gun laws include criminal background checks, mental background checks, and licensing requirements for gun ownership.

Canada also requires checks to ensure the would-be gun owner does not have a history of or familial proclivity to domestic abuse. Additionally, the University of Sydney’s GunPolicy.org reports that the would-be gun owner has to demonstrate a good reason for owning a gun, his “spouse, partner, or next of kin” has to be interviewed, and “third party character references” have to be submitted to the licensing authority.

Even with all these controls, researchers want more. They believe Canadians who jumped through myriad hoops for law-abiding gun ownership now need to face more “regulation” on gun storage.

Breitbart News has long contended that gun control is insidious. And once a nation, province, or U.S. state — like California or Washington — manages to expand background checks on law-abiding citizens, the appetite for more gun laws remains insatiable.

According to California Health Report, state lawmakers designated $5 million to launch the center. Napolitano said:

The state’s decision to provide public funding for a center to study firearm violence — the first of its kind in the nation — demonstrates great leadership by the state and presents a unique opportunity for the University of California to be at the forefront of researching a growing public health issue.

While researchers at the Sacramento campus will be the driving force behind looking at guns through the prism of public health, Napolitano “expects scientists at the other UC campuses to contribute to the research,” as well.

“The center will train post-doctoral researchers, such as epidemiologists or physicians, who want to study violence. And it will issue small grants to scientists across the country who are conducting firearm-violence prevention research.” The center will be guided by “an advisory board,” which consists of elected officials, law enforcement personnel, and academics.

Jones estimates he has taught over 5,000 people across Oklahoma.

According to Fox News, the course Jones teaches “takes eight hours and includes lectures that cover handling a weapon, Oklahoma laws regarding gun ownership, and shooting in self-defense.” The course also includes “practice at the instructor’s private range and a 15-question exam.”

When asked about the often-state Christian maxim of turning the other cheek, Jones intimated that Christians are called to turn the other cheek if attacked while preaching the gospel. However, a Christian is not called to turn the other cheek when their loved ones’ lives are in jeopardy or even when their own lives are exposed to peril via a home invader, public attacker, or murderer. In that situation, a Christian’s duty is to fight to defend life.

Jones put it this way: “We will turn the other cheek. I’m the least likely guy to pull out a gun in a fight. But we will not turn the other cheek if you’re going to assault my family or cut off my head in the process.”

He points to two examples from Oklahoma, one in which a woman was mauled to death by two dogs and another in which a woman was stabbed to death at work by a former employee. He asked, “[What] if they’d had a legal gun and been trained to use it?” And referencing the woman who was stabbed, Jones said, “Can you imagine what went through her mind the last few minutes of her life?”

Jones wants Christians to understand that defenseless is not a virtue.

In the understatement of the decade, the “About” section on the RoyJonesConcealedCarry Facebook page says, “Roy offers concealed carry handgun certification classes. These classes are not your typical gun class.”

breitbart117,breitbart,['Bob Price'],2015-06-29 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/06/29/passenger-discharges-firearm-at-texas-airport-check-in-counter/,"HOUSTON, Texas – A man preparing to depart Houston on a Delta Airlines flight discharged a firearm he prepared to put in checked luggage. No one was injured in the incident and airport operations were not interrupted.

The man approached the Delta Airlines ticket-counter at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), Terminal A, prepared to check his bag, said IAH spokesman Bill Begley in a phone conversation with Breitbart Texas. Following TSA procedures, the ticket agent asked the man to open the gun case and demonstrate that the weapon was clear and safe for check-in. During this examination process, the firearm discharged. The gun was still in the case at the time of the discharge and no one was injured.

Houston Police spokesman John Cannon told Breitbart Texas they were called at 2:10 p.m. on Monday and notified that a firearm had been discharged. Officers responded and conducted an investigation. The gun was a .45 caliber handgun that did not belong to a law enforcement officer, Cannon said.

“We detained the suspect and contacted the Harris County District Attorney’s Office,” he explained. “The District Attorney’s Office accepted charges of Deadly Conduct, a Class A misdemeanor.”

Cannon said the suspect, whose name has not yet been released, is being detained at the airport police office and will eventually be transported downtown for processing. The police department expects that formal charges will be filed sometime overnight, Monday night.

The status of whether the suspect is a licensed Concealed Handgun License holder has not yet been revealed. Authorities have also not released the exact type of handgun other than to say it was a .45 caliber.

The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) lists the procedures for checking a firearm in your luggage. That information can be found on the TSA website. It includes the following instructions:

All firearms must be declared to the airline during the ticket counter check-in process.

The term firearm includes:*Please see, for instance, United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 44 for information about firearm definitions. Any weapon (including a starter gun) which will, or is designed to, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. The frame or receiver of any such weapon. Any firearm muffler or firearm silencer. Any destructive device.

The firearm must be unloaded. As defined by 49 CFR 1540.5 – “A loaded firearm means a firearm that has a live round of ammunition, or any component thereof, in the chamber or cylinder or in a magazine inserted in the firearm.”

The firearm must be in a hard-sided container that is locked. A locked container is defined as one that completely secures the firearm from being accessed. Locked cases that can be pulled open with little effort cannot be brought aboard the aircraft.

If firearms are not properly declared or packaged, TSA will provide the checked bag to law enforcement for resolution with the airline. If the issue is resolved, law enforcement will release the bag to TSA so screening may be completed.

TSA must resolve all alarms in checked baggage. If a locked container containing a firearm alarms, TSA will contact the airline, who will make a reasonable attempt to contact the owner and advise the passenger to go to the screening location. If contact is not made, the container will not be placed on the aircraft.

If a locked container alarms during screening and is not marked as containing a declared firearm, TSA will cut the lock in order to resolve the alarm.

Travelers should remain in the area designated by the aircraft operator or TSA representative to take the key back after the container is cleared for transportation.

Travelers must securely pack any ammunition in fiber (such as cardboard), wood or metal boxes or other packaging specifically designed to carry small amounts of ammunition.

Firearm magazines and ammunition clips, whether loaded or empty, must be securely boxed or included within a hard-sided case containing an unloaded firearm.

Small arms ammunition, including ammunition not exceeding .75 caliber for a rifle or pistol and shotgun shells of any gauge, may be carried in the same hard-sided case as the firearm, as long as it follows the packing guidelines described above.

TSA prohibits black powder or percussion caps used with black-powder.

Rifle scopes are not prohibited in carry-on bags and do not need to be in the hard-sided, locked checked bag.

The bill–SB 1122–covers the private sale of private property in general and includes firearms as part of that property.

The NRA-ILA reports, “[SB 1122 would] prevent the state of Arizona, a county, city or town government from requiring a person to access or facilitate access to any state, federal or third party database as a condition of selling, gifting, donating or transferring personal property.”

SB 1122 is designed to shield Arizona residents from compliance with universal background checks, should a future administration work with a Democrat-controlled Congress to secure them.

Universal background checks exist at the state level in places like California, Washington state, and Colorado, and require every gun sale–retail or private–to be conducted via the auspices of a government representative. That representative–a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL)–does a background check on the buyer of the firearm, thereby creating a paper trail on guns that may have spent decades on grandpa’s nightstand rather than a retailer’s shelf.

Such checks allow the federal government to continue accumulating the names and addresses of all gun owners, as well as information on the types of guns owned.

SB 1122 would protect Arizona gun owners from participating in a broadened federal attempt to expand the paper trail on firearms.

Suppressors and firearms from Daniel Defense and Sig Sauer were used at the event, which was designed to be hands-on. This means the reporters and writers who were present got to shoot every firearm and use every suppressor at the range.

Breitbart News attended the event, which drew attention to the suppressor legislation contained in the Hearing Protection Act. That Act was put forward by Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) on January 9. It is focused on the hearing protection offered by firearms suppressors–protection that far exceeds that provided by ear plugs or muffs–and eliminating many of the cumbersome steps to suppressor acquisition, thus streamlining the gun owner’s process of getting the hearing protection he needs.

NSSF focused on these major points:

Firearm sound suppressors reduce, but do not eliminate, the noise of gunfire to levels safer for one’s hearing. It is legal to own a suppressor in 42 states, and legal to hunt with a suppressor in 40 of those 42 states. Although suppressors are already legal in over 4 out of 5 states, they “are rarely used by criminals.” Instead, they are used as “important safety devices” that provide hearing protection and “help reduce noise complaints against [gun] ranges.” The Hearing Protection Act would not completely deregulate but sale of suppressors but would eliminate “the current onerous process,” which means “the purchase of a suppressor would follow the same rules as the purchase of a firearm including an FBI background check.”

Sig Sauer’s Jared Hillis was on hand to discuss his company’s firearms and suppressors. He said, “The biggest misconception that I’ve heard is that everybody thinks that it is going to make the firearm completely silent, which is just not true. What it’s doing is it’s regulating the gases coming out the end of the barrel, so there’s not that big [explosive], concussive over-pressure happening. But it still sounds like a gun shot.”

Daniel Defense’s Lee Thompson said, “For a lot of people, their only exposure to… sound suppressors is from the media; from Hollywood movies, television, and that’s not the most accurate representation of how the product actually works. Gun muzzle blast is an extremely loud event, a sound suppressor dampens that to some extent but it does not completely eliminate it. It is still a loud event.”

Reporters and writers gathered at Elite Shooting Sports and were able to shoot the firearms without suppressor and then with a suppressor attached, in order to see the difference first hand. They were also able to shoot firearms which are integrally suppressed, which means the suppressor is an nondetachable part of the firearm itself.

The firearms attendees were able to sample included various offerings from the gun makers including the the a Daniel Defense DDM7 variant, Sig Sauer MPX 9mm, Daniel Defense DDM4 ISR, and Sig Sauer 227 and MCX 300 Blackout. Suppressors for each of the firearms were on hand as well.

USA – 112.6 guns per 100 residents Serbia – 75.6 Yemen – 54.8 Switzerland – 45.7 Cyprus – 36.4 Saudi Arabia – 35 Iraq – 34.2 Uruguay – 31.8 Sweden – 31.6 Norway – 31.3

Note–the Telegraph presents gun ownership as so expansive in the U.S. that guns actually outnumber people. Yet the U.S. does not appear on the list of the Top 10 countries for firearm-related deaths. Those countries are:

Honduras – 67.18 per 100,000 residents per year Venezuela – 59.13 Swaziland – 37.16 Guatemala – 34.1 Jamaica – 30.72 El Salvador – 26.77 Colombia – 25.94 Brazil – 21.2 Panama – 15.11 Uruguay – 11.52

The map and the accompanying Telegraph article were drawn from the Small Arms Survey and the 2012 Congressional Research Serrvice Report. As Breitbart News previously reported, the CRS report shows privately owned firearms jumped from 192 million in the U.S. in 1994 to 310 million in 2009. At the same time, the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” rate–which was 6.6 per 100,000 Americans in 1993–fell to 3.6 per 100,000 by 2000. Gun sales continued to surge and the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” rate fell to 3.2 in 2011.

Think about it–as gun ownership rose, the murder rate plummeted in the U.S. Couple that with the fact that only one of the Top 10 countries for gun ownership is also in the Top 10 for firearm-related deaths–Uruguay is number eight for gun ownership number 10 for gun deaths–and the point is clear: More guns correlate with less crime.

breitbart121,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-11-08 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/08/senate-democrats-introduce-ban-gun-stephen-willeford-used-stop-texas-attack/,"Senate Democrats introduced legislation Wednesday that will ban the gun Stephen Willeford used to stop the Texas church attack.

The bill was introduced by over two dozen Democrats, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).

According to the Hill, Feinstein released a statement with the legislation, saying, “We’re introducing an updated Assault Weapons Ban for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.”

Missing from Feinstein’s statement is an admission that the bill targets the kind of rifle which NRA member Stephen Willeford used to end the attack. As Fox News’ Tucker Carlson said on Tuesday, “He was armed with an AR-15, that’s exactly the sort of rifle we’ve been told must be banned to keep us safe.”

In addition to this, the gun control bill pushed by Feinstein would not have stopped the Texas church shooting, as the bill allows persons with AR-15s and similar rifles to keep those rifles. Moreover, it allows persons to transfer such rifles to other people as long as a background check is passed. Kelley possessed an AR-15 because he passed a background check for it.

This latest “assault weapons” ban also contains a ban on bump stocks, even though a bump stock was not used in the Texas church attack. It appears the Democrats decided to bundle a bump stock ban with an “assault weapons” ban in hopes of securing one or the other.

Neither ban would have prevented the Las Vegas attack or the Texas church attack, although the absence of a bump stock may have made the Vegas attacker more accurate, thereby leading to even more deaths as he opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

The video showed Hamilton wearing ear and eye protection while shooting an AR-15 at a target down range, but some Formula One fans reacted negatively because the video appeared “just hours after a gunman” illegally used a different kind of gun to carry out an attack on a train in France.

According to Mail Online, car sponsor Mercedes addressed the video and photographs without criticizing Hamilton, suggesting he pay better attention to “what is happening out there in the world.” But some Formula One fans were not so forgiving.

For example, the Mail cites readers from The Sunday Mirror who responded to the video and photographs by writing, “‘F**k! You are a fool. Take a police car and leave F1.” Another wrote, “Now Lewis Hamilton—a role model for youth—publishes a video with him shooting rifles with pleasure. C’mon Champ, that is not cool.”

But Hamilton made no excuses. He responded to the criticism by saying, “‘I went to the shooting range, shot some fun targets. It was a lot of fun.”

Spike’s Tactical is located in Apopka, Florida.

The AR-15 is listed as The Crusader Rifle on the manufacturer’s website, described as a “lightweight mid-length rifle,” built to be used for tactical applications or for competition. The words of Psalm 144:1—”Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle”—are etched upon the right side of the gun’s lower, while a cross and shield are etched upon the left side.”

Along the AR-15’s safety lever are the Latin words “Pax Pacis” (Peace), “Bellum” (War), and “Deus Vult” (God Wills It). Peace is the gun’s safe position while “War” is the gun’s fire position.

According to WTSP 10 News, Spike’s Tactical spokesman Ben “Mookie” Thomas explained why the company decided to create the Crusader:

Right now and as it has been for quite some time, one of the biggest threats in the world is and remains Islamic terrorism. We wanted to make sure we built a weapon that would never be able to be used by Muslim terrorists to kill innocent people or advance their radical agenda.

Among the stated reasons for their opposition, lawmakers cited that the ban would “interfere with Second Amendment rights” by disrupting the ammunition market far beyond M855 sales and/or restrictions.

In the letter, the lawmakers pointed to ongoing and broad-based efforts to restrict or fully ban lead ammunition throughout the country. This effort is occurring at federal and state levels.

With this war on traditional ammunition already underway, lawmakers indicated an additional ban on M855 rounds under the ATF’s fluctuating “framework” for what constitutes “armor piercing,” which is certain to “inhibit the development and use of rifle ammunition containing non-lead materials.” Under typical conditions, this could result in an ammo shortage, but amid the buying frenzies that result from fear of a political war on firearms and firearm supplies, a shortage on all types of AR-15 ammo is all but certain.

According to lawmakers, this disruption in the ammunition market interferes with Second Amendment rights.

It is a backdoor means to gun control, which, in lieu of banning guns, bans the ammunition with which the guns operate.

They’re buying it to do bad things,” while speaking with Keene, New Hampshire’s WKBK’s “Good Morning with Dan Mitchell.”

Shaheen said, [relevant remarks begin around 5:50] “You know, the fact is, the AR-15, the gun that Mateen used, that’s a weapon of war. It’s advertised as being able to do technologically advances in killing people that previous weapons have been unable to do, and somebody who’s buying that kind of a weapon isn’t buying it for target shooting. They’re not buying it to go out and hunt deer. You don’t need an AK-47 or an AR-15 to hunt deer. They’re buying it to do bad things, and we need to recognize that, and address it.”

breitbart126,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2013-03-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/03/09/gabby-giffords-husband-buys-ar-15-announces-he-s-not-keeping-it-after-news-leaks-out/,"Mark E. Kelly, gun-control proponent and husband to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, recently purchased an AR-15 (an “assault weapon,” he called it)–which he now says he intended as an illustration of the need for more stringent gun laws.

Kelly reportedly bought the AR-15 and a 1911-style semi-automatic pistol at a gun store in Tucson, Arizona.

Breitbart News received a tip on this when Neil McCabe, editor of Guns & Patriots newsletter, contacted us on March 7 and said:

Mark E. Kelly, made purchases which included an AR-15–sometimes described as an “assault rifle”–at 3:30 pm on the afternoon of March 5 at Diamondback Police Supply, 170 S. Kolb Street, Tucson, AZ.

According to McCabe, witnesses to the purchases claimed Kelly purchased “high capacity” magazines as well.

On March 6, McCabe contacted Kelly’s gun control group–“Americans for Responsible Solutions”–and on March 8 they replied that his message had been passed on to colleagues who handle press requests. Breitbart News then began investigating the details surrounding the purchase, including visiting the gun store.

Suddenly, Kelly announced on his Facebook page that he was not going to keep the AR-15, which he has yet to pick up from the store.

Days after making the purchases, Kelly wrote on Facebook:

I just had a background check a few days ago when I went to my local gun store to buy a .45. As I was leaving, I noticed a used AR-15. Bought that too. Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes. I don’t have possession of it yet but I’ll be turning it over to the Tucson PD when I do.

Testifying to the Senate Judiciary Committee Jan. 30, Kelly had urged senators to restrict sales firearms based on their lethality–a common refrain with other witnesses that day, who argued that semi-automatic weapons, which chamber subsequent rounds as bullets are fired, and other guns with military-style features level the playing field against law enforcement.

Kelly and Giffords founded their own advocacy group to restrict gun rights, Americans for Responsible Solutions, in January. On its website, ARS wrote: “High capacity magazines are a deadly factor in gun violence.” A 30-round magazine is considered a high-capacity magazine.

The ARS website says: “Congress should act to limit the sale of high capacity magazines, which are not needed for hunting or self-defense, but have proven very lethal.”

Similarly, the ARS website says: “Congress should act to limit the sale of assault weapons.

In February, Kelly told Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace that lawmakers need to address “assault weapons.” He said the purpose of an “assault weapon” is “to kill a lot of people very quickly,” and he lamented that such products were “too readily available.”

Kelly has not commented on whether he will also return the .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol he purchased.

breitbart127,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-03-16 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/16/five-great-ar-15-rifles/,"Below is a list a five great AR-15 rifles. The five vary in appearance, due to accessories, finish, etc., and they also vary in price, due to the variation of accessories and differences in materials and levels of craftsmanship involved in building and tuning the rifles.

All are AR-15s, and all five can be relied upon to deliver the shooting experience that owners of AR-15 rifles have come to love through the years.

Bushmaster XM15-E2S — This is a classic AR-15 with no accessories. It is a great AR for those purists who want the old, fixed buttstock — nothing adjustable here — and a fixed rear sight as well. The rear sight aperture is adjustable, but the sight itself is built into the carry handle, thus fixed. The gun has a 20-inch barrel, is accurate, and is certainly durable.

The XM15-E2S weighs 8.6 pounds.

The XM15-E2S is no longer in the Bushmaster catalog, but a used one can be acquired for around $750.

Smith & Wesson M&P15 Sport — The Sport is somewhat of a throwback AR, in that the style is very basic. Apart from the Magpul rear sight and telescopic buttstock — which lets you choose between 6 different positions for rifle length — the Sport is pure old-school AR without any bells and whistles. It does come with a 30-round magazine, but beyond that, the Sport’s key characteristics are dependability, accuracy, and durability.

As for durability, while it is smart to clean and maintain your firearms regularly, the Sport, which I had shot for an extended period of time, appeared not to care less. The gun operated flawlessly, regardless of whether it had or had not been cleaned at proper intervals.

The Sport weighs 6.45 pounds.

Because the Sport is bare bones, it is one of the more affordable ARs on the market. Suggested retail for a new Sport is $739.

Colt LE6920 — The Colt LE6920 is a civilian version of the Colt M4, a gun countless military personnel have relied on for safety during times of war and tumult. The LE6920 comes with a Magpul rear sight and various other Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) parts — including MOE SL handguards, MOE SL carbine stock, MOE SL pistol grip, and MOE vertical grip. The buttstock is position adjustable, like the stock on the Smith & Wesson M&P15 Sport.

The LE6920 weights 6.9 pounds.

Many AR-15 fans view the Colt as the only AR they will own because of the company’s rich history with the military. That is certainly another selling point for the rifle. The gun is extremely accurate and a pleasure to shoot.

Suggested retail on a LE6920 is $999.

SIG516 Patrol — Sig Sauer’s 516 Patrol comes with a SIG adjustable buttstock and a SIG grip and handguard. It has flip-up adjustable iron sights, front and rear, and comes with a 30-round magazine. The 516 Patrol handguard is aluminum and presents four M1913 Picatinny rails where various accessories can be added — lights, lasers, a vertical tactical grip, etc.

The SIG516 weighs 7.3 pounds.

The 516 Patrol is accurate and smooth in its operation. It is more refined than some of the other ARs on this list, and the price reflects that. The price on a new 516 Patrol is approximately $1250 to $1299.

Daniel Defense DDM4 V1 — The V1 takes AR-15 refinement to the next level. Whereas the Bushmaster XM15-E2S is at one end of the spectrum — capturing the essence of the AR-15 for the shooters who are purists — the V1 is at the other end of that spectrum, demonstrating everything an AR-15 can be in the hands of a person well-acquainted with it and trained in tactical usage.

The V1 is also just a heck of a lot of fun to shoot.

Daniel Defense makes their own accessories/furniture for their rifle, so the V1’s buttstock is made by Daniel Defense, as is its pistol grip, rail panels, handguard, sights, flash suppressor, etc. The V1 is a precision weapon and you know it as soon as you pull the trigger.

The V1 weighs 6.7 pounds.

Suggested retail on the V1 chambered in 5.56 is $1799.00.

Steve Israel (D-NY) plans to meet with incoming ATF director Thomas Brandon and talk to him about reviving the AR-15 ammo ban on the M855 round.

Breitbart News previously reported that current ATF director B. Todd Jones tendered his resignation on March 20 in the wake of the AR-15 ammo ban backlash and will be relinquishing his office at the end of the month. At that time, his deputy director, Brandon, will be taking the agency’s reins at that time.

According to The Hill, Israel wants to meet with Brandon to encourage the agency to revive the ban. Israel is convinced Jones handled the ban “sloppily,” which led to the ban being pulled. He “[hopes] under new leadership the ATF can have a more transparent and responsive process” than during the failed ban push.

On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.) says Jones’ departure marks the end of the AR-15 ammo ban. Moreover, he said “the departure of Jones is further proof the ATF should be eliminated.”

breitbart129,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-11-22 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/11/22/movie-producer-giving-away-ar-15-honor-texas-church-attack-hero-stephen-willeford/,"Movie producer J.P. Johnston is giving away a DPMS AR-15 on Christmas Day to honor Stephen Willeford’s courageous stand against Texas church attacker Devin Kelley.

After being alerted to gunshots at the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Willeford ran out of his house barefooted with an AR-15 and a handful of bullets to confront Kelley, ultimately shooting him and forcing him to flee the scene.

Johnston’s AR-15 giveaway is happening as his new film, The Reliant, is about to be released in theaters. The film stars Kevin Sorbo, Brian Bosworth, Mollee Gray, and Eric Roberts. It focuses on faith and family. It presents a scenario where”the economy collapses, widespread rioting and looting leaves a 19-year-old lovesick girl struggling to care for her four younger siblings in a stretch of woods on the outskirts of their burning town, wondering why a good God would let this happen.”

It features family members standing in defense of other family members, and using guns to do it.

The Reliant was written to deal with gnawing questions like, “Why do bad things happen to good people?” The goal of the film is to answer such questions “in a memorable, entertaining way that honors God, satisfies the conscience, and strengthens your faith.”

Standard Newswire reported the AR-15 giveaway and asked producer Johnston why he would give away the type of gun used by the Texas church attacker.

Johnston posited Stephen Willeford’s heroic use of the same gun as the reason. He added:

Who knows how many Sunday services the murderer [Devin Kelley] would have visited if it weren’t for the courage of Stephen Willeford. But his courage wouldn’t have amounted to much more than a brave death if it weren’t for the Second Amendment. Our forefathers knew that arms in the hands of the law-abiding was necessary to protect against criminals and tyrants. That’s why they secured this right in the Bill of Rights, and required our leaders to take an oath to uphold and defend it.

Johnston says, “The Reliant is subtle, yet relevant and winsome in its defense of the right to keep and bear arms.”

Oregon instituted universal background checks in the spring of 2015, and those require a check for every sale — private or retail — as well as transfers.

On July 27, Breitbart News reported that Reverend Jeremy Lucas — Christ Church Episcopal Parish, Oswego, Oregon — won an AR-15 after using discretionary church funds to buy 199 raffle tickets in the rifle giveaway. His plan was to win the gun and destroy it, but he changed his mind, deciding instead to have an artist turn it “into something symbolic.” He said, “I want it to be a symbol where we take something destructive, because a gun can never be constructive, and turn it into something else.”

In the interim, he passed the gun to a parishioner and may now face charges.

According to Oregon Live, Oregon State Police “are looking into the case.” OSP Capt. Bill Fugate said, “Lake Oswego police had asked them to look into the case.” But he stressed that “the investigation was still in its infancy stages.” He said OSP has “multiple troopers who investigate weapons transfers,” but he was not made aware of Reverend Lucas’s actions until August 1.

If Lucas is convicted of “an unlawful transfer of a weapon, a misdemeanor, he could face a maximum fine of $6,250 and up to a year in jail.”

The resident, 35-year-old Patrick Hale, had just loaded his family into the car to get out of the path of the killers when they walked upon him.

According to the Tennessean, Hale saw the two men cross a fence “about three hundred yards away from his back door.” He said, “I prayed like I have never prayed before.” He then backed out of the driveway with a gun “on him” and his family in the car. While backing up, he realized the men had already closed the distance and were waving frantically, trying to get him stop.

He slowed and said the two convicts reached his driveway, then “started to surrender.”

Hale said:

I began to slowly back up as they came closer. At that point, I realized I had two ex-cons wanted for murder who just shot at law enforcement and nothing to lose. And for some reason, they started to surrender and lay down on their stomachs on my concrete driveway. If that doesn’t make you believe in Jesus Christ, I don’t know what will.

Hale called 911 and said deputies arrived within three minutes.

Holly Morelock, who works in the area in which Hale lives, said, “I feel like it was a good thing. When you mess around out here in the county, most of us here have carry permits and carry (weapons). And it’s our job to protect our families and our homes.”

Speaking of Patrick Hale and his family, Morelock said, “And I’m very proud of the family … because they didn’t just turn around and mind their own business. They did what they had to do to protect everybody else around.”

breitbart132,breitbart,['Chris Tomlinson'],2017-01-25 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/01/25/police-warn-future-islamic-state-chemical-weapon-attacks/,"The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has warned that Islamic State may deploy chemical weapons in future terror attacks in Europe.

The BKA claim the threat of chemical weapons attacks have been overlooked and Islamic State supporters and other Islamists “are willing and able to procure large quantities of chemicals”. The BKA report says chemical weapons could be used in attacks similar to the 1995 Tokyo sarin gas subway attack or used to poison water supplies, Kronen Zeitung reports.

According to the BKA, other chemical attacks could occur on the food supply or on the transportation of hazardous chemicals themselves. The report, which was presented to the German government, advocates for better safety precautions for those who transport and handle dangerous chemicals as well as safety measures to mitigate the effects of potential attacks.

The BKA has heightened concern over chemical weapons after reports have come from Syria indicating Islamic State has been working on its own chemical weapons programme. According to some reports, Islamic State has already carried out 52 chemical attacks in Syria.

The fears of the BKA are also backed up by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls who said in November, “We know that there could also be a risk of chemical or biological weapons”.

In December 2015, the European Union parliament released a report claiming Islamic State had employed people capable of creating chemical and biological weapons writing, “In August 2014, a laptop owned by a Tunisian physics and chemistry graduate fighting with ISIL/Da’esh in Syria was found to contain a 19-page document on how to develop bubonic plague from infected animals and turn it into a weapon”.

The possibility of Islamic State smuggling chemicals and other dangerous materials to Europe could also be enhanced by reports they are slowly taking over, and profiting from, the people smuggling trade which has become a new source of revenue after their oil sales were largely cut off by Russian and American air strikes.

Chemical attacks have long been a concern for authorities after the September 11th, 2001 attacks. Shortly after, envelopes containing anthrax were mailed to the offices of several politicians and news outlets. Five people died due to exposure to the substance and the perpetrators were never identified, though assumed to be linked to terror groups.

The most infamous chemical attack occurred in 1995 on a Tokyo subway in which members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo released sarin nerve gas on a packed subway train killing 12 and severely injuring 50 others."
breitbart133,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-02-15 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/02/15/assault-weapon-requirements-withdrawn-california-doj/,"California’s Department of Justice has repealed “assault weapon” regulations it had submitted to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for the purposes of enactment without public comment.

The NRA and the California Pistol and Rifles Association sent a letter to the DOJ which pointed out “flaws in the regulations” and pledged legal action if the regulations were not withdrawn.

According to NRA-ILA, “It is unclear exactly why the DOJ [recalled the regulations], however it can be surmised that the NRA-CRPA legal letter likely prompted the move.

NRA-ILA previously reported that the regulations were an attempt to piggy back more “assault weapon” requirements on the back of expanded “assault weapon” ban rules signed by Governor Jerry Brown (D) in July 2016. “The regulations were submitted to OAL as ‘File and Print’ only, meaning DOJ [claimed] that the regulations [were] expressly exempted by statute from public comment or OAL review.”

The regulations were compiled in a way that read “like a wish list” for gun control advocates. The regulations included:

Excessive personal information requirements for registering a firearm, requirements that individuals provide information on where they acquired their firearms, requirements that individuals provide DOJ with photos of their firearms, requirements for serializing firearms built from 80% receivers, expansion of the “assault weapon” definition to bullet-button equipped shotguns, and restrictions on removing the “bullet-button” once the firearm is registered as an “assault weapon.”

But the regulations have now been recalled. The prospect of a defending them in a pro-gun legal climate overseen by Attorney General Jeff Sessions was not appealing.

I didn’t see it but witness reported pulling an assault rifle out of his car — bobphoto (@bobphoto) November 8, 2016

That action, in and of itself, would not be illegal in Texas unless the man did so in a manner to cause alarm or if he was within 100 feet of the polling location, a gun free zone.

Daemmrich told Breitbart Texas the man was eventually release by police and that he had no further information about the incident The hat was said to be an HEB hat.

Breitbart Texas reached out to the Austin Police Department to learn if the man had been arrested or if any other action was taken. Police officials were in the middle of a “network crisis” with their systems and could not readily obtain any information about the incident. The spokesperson promised to update Breitbart Texas when information became available.

The incident comes on the heels of a Breitbart Texas report on a possible FBI investigation into “online chatter on terrorist websites” which mentioned possible attacks in Texas, New York, and Virginia. The FBI reportedly interviewed three Muslims in Texas about the reported threat.

Texas officials reported on Friday they had been warned by national security officials about the potential for an attack on Texas and the other states before the Tuesday General Election.

“My office is working with law enforcement officials and we are continuing to monitor the situation in close coordination with the Texas Department of Public Safety,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “Texans should go about their daily lives as usual, but remain vigilant over the next several days and report any suspicious activity to state or local law enforcement. The State of Texas will continue to do everything it can to ensure the safety and security of its citizens.”

Mario Granados-Alvarado, 18, an El Salvadorian illegal immigrant, was arrested by agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after he was released days before by Montgomery County, Maryland, which prides itself on being a sanctuary city.

ICE officials said upon Granados-Alvarado’s release by Montgomery County, they placed a detainer on the illegal immigrant, which requests that the locality keep the suspect in custody until federal immigration officials can take over the case.

“Keeping people safe means not tolerating the release of aliens that present a clear public safety threat back into our communities,” said ICE Field Director in Baltimore Dorothy Herrera-Niles said in a statement. “ICE is committed to fostering positive collaboration with our local law-enforcement partners, and welcomes changes from county officials that would prioritize public safety.”

In March 2014, U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested Granados-Alvarado in Falfurrias, Texas, after he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico Border. At the time, he was issued a notice to appear before an immigration judge.

Most recently, though, Granados-Alvarado was arrested after it was discovered that he brought a stolen AR-15 onto the property of Albert Einstein High School, along with a car that he allegedly stole. Police say the illegal immigrant stole the rifle days before from a police vehicle.

Granados-Alvarado is now awaiting deportation.

This assertion runs counter to the official report of the Connecticut State Police, who list semi-automatic weapons–rather than automatic ones–as those used by Lanza.

According to the police report, Lanza used a Glock 10mm handgun, a Sig Sauer P226 9mm handgun, and a Bushmaster AR-15 style .223 rifle, all three of which are semi-automatic.

Obama brought up Lanza in a discussion of gun control laws recently enacted in Colorado. “[T]he issue of gun violence is something that has haunted families for way too long,” the President lamented, “and it is possible for us to create common-sense gun safety measures that respect the traditions of gun ownership in this country and hunters and sportsmen, but also make sure that we don’t have another 20 children in a classroom gunned down by a semiautomatic weapon — by a fully automatic weapon in that case, sadly.”

In the push for expanded gun regulations following Sandy Hook, Senate Democrats led by Dianne Feinstein (CA) wanted a ban on “assault weapons,” a term describing rifles like AR-15s which cosmetically look like automatic weapons but function far differently.

Feinstein’s assault weapons ban will not be included in the Senate’s gun control bill and will have to face a vote as its own amendment, which effectively dooms its chances of passage."

In American leftist lingo, an AK-47, a type of semiautomatic rifle, is an “assault weapon.” AK-47s are completely banned from private possession. That, however, did not keep a terrorist from getting one. And that alone highlights the foolishness of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wisc.) pursuit of more gun control following the June 12 Orlando terror attack.

In fact, the gun controls in Turkey are so strict that a terrorist in position of an AK-47 only highlights what we should have already learned from Chicago–namely, that gun control empowers wicked people, while making law-abiding citizens vulnerable.

According to The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy.org, Turkey’s gun controls are “restrictive.” In addition to the semiautomatic rifle (“assault weapon”) ban and firearms licensing, Turkey has background checks that are so invasive an applicant undergoes an examination of his “criminal, mental health, domestic violence, medical and addiction records.” If an applicant passes all aspects but a “likelihood of family violence” is discovered, the license is denied.

Moreover, the licensing requirement to own a firearm is complemented by a licensing requirement to own ammunition–and “authorities” maintain a record of both.

This is what “restrictive” looks like, and one of the three terrorists who struck Istanbul’s airport was carrying an AK-47.

France has “restrictive” controls, as well, yet 12 were shot and killed at Charlie Hebdo headquarters on January 7, 2015, and terrorists shot 130 to death on November 13.

Here’s the lesson: Gun control does not keep bad guys from getting guns. Rather, it keeps law-abiding citizens unarmed.

Ron Paul (R-TX) suggested the chemical weapon earlier this week blamed on the Syrian government could be a false flag.

Paul went as far to say there was zero chance Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to blame because it wouldn’t make sense for him to use chemical weapons at this point in time.

“I looked at The New York Times to get the explanation, and they said ‘Worst Chemical Attack In Years In Syria, U.S. Blames Assad,'” Paul said. “So it is all over and done with? But it is not quite so easy, is it? What happened four years ago in 2013? You know, this whole thing about crossing the Red Line. And ever since then the neo-cons have been yelling and screaming — even part of the administration has been yelling and screaming about Assad using poison gasses on his people four years ago. Not quite true. It was never proven.”

“[I]t doesn’t make any sense for Assad under these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gasses,” he continued. “I think there is a zero chance he would have done, you know, this deliberately. But we could also go ask a famous Senator who is famous for foreign policy. We could go ask John McCain to explain it. And he found somebody to blame. And I don’t know why he has it in for the president.”

“McCain says blame Trump,” Paul later added. “It is all Trump’s fault because he hasn’t been aggressive enough.”

Moreover, the Times points out that the threat posed by the private ownership of “assault weapons” is mythological in comparison to FBI stats on the actual use of such guns in crime.

According to the NYT, America was “suffering from a spike in gun crime…in the early 1990s” so “Democrats created and banned [an entire] category of guns.” The ban lasted from 1994 to 2004 and although crime fell during that time, a “detailed study found no proof” the decline was due to the ban.

Hard numbers showed the percentage of “assault weapons” recovered by police during the ban only rose from 1 percent to 2 percent.

On top of all this, the Times points out that “assault weapons” are not the gun of choice for criminals anyway–and never have been. “In 2012, only 322 people were murdered with any kind of rifle, FBI data shows.” And as Breitbart News reported on January 15, 2013, deaths in which an “assault rifle” were involved constituted less than .012 percent of the overall deaths in America in 2011.

The New York Times did report one clear outcome of the “assault weapons” ban in 1994–Democrats got creamed at the polls in November.

The Daily Mail reports Trevor’s South African mechanic stepdad, Abel Shingange, shot the comedian’s mother Patricia at their home in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2009 and, believing she was dead, attempted to find a then-25-year-old Noah while armed with a handgun.

The Daily Show heir’s grandmother tells the Mail Noah escaped with his life only because he was hard to find. In an exclusive interview with the British site, 88-year-old Nomalizo Noah said:

After shooting the mother Abel went around with a gun trying to find Trevor, but Trevor was always here, there and everywhere, performing on stage, you never knew where he was. So when Patricia’s husband began to hunt him he couldn’t find him… They are very lucky to be alive, thank you to God, Abel was a horrible, horrible man, I hated him.

Trevor’s former stepdad was reportedly often violent and sometimes beat his mother with old bicycle frames and slapped her in public. In 2009, his actions were near fatal after he became jealous that Patricia was engaged to her current husband, a man named Sfiso Khoza, the site reports.

“I was shot in the face and back. The bullets went through the nose and passed my jugular and one narrowly missed my spine,” she told the Mail. “I am lucky to be alive. When God writes he has to write for humans and he gives you a message that God is bigger than death.”

She was rushed to the hospital and credits Noah with footing the bill for her private health care.

“I was very grateful. The minute Trevor paid for me in that hospital, to go private, my prayer was that after three days I’m out of this hospital,” she said.

Noah grew up in poverty in the Soweto township in South Africa and was named in honor of his mother’s favorite Hollywood star: John Travolta.

“Trevor was the closest I could get to Travolta,” she told the site.

The son of a white Swiss father and a black South African mother, Noah reportedly struggled growing up in the divided country. Children in the slums allegedly screamed whenever they saw him, because they had “never seen anything like him.”

Jon Stewart handpicked Noah this week as his Daily Show successor. He became a regular contributor only four months ago.

The 31-year-old South African came under fire from critics on both the left and the right of American politics Tuesday when old posts surfaced from his Twitter account, which many determined to be racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic.

breitbart141,breitbart,['Cartel Chronicles'],2017-01-08 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/08/video-u-s-diplomat-shot-mexico/,"GUADALAJARA, Jalisco — A U.S. diplomat was shot in this city when he was leaving a shopping center in a failed murder attempt. The suspected gunman was able to ran away after the attack. Police later apprehended the shooter.

UPDATE, Jan. 8, 12:00 CST: Mexican Investigators with Jalisco’s Attorney General’s Office, have confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the suspected shooter has been identified as a 31-year-old man from India who then became a naturalized U.S. citizen.

The suspected shooter, Zafar Zia, was arrested by Mexican authorities as part of the investigation into the attack. At the time of the arrest, authorities seized a .38 caliber handgun, an automobile with California license plates and a wig that is believed to have been used at the time of the attempted murder.

According to authorities, Zia had moved to Guadalajara in November 2016 from Phoenix and had been residing in the city since. The apparent motive for the attempted murder appears to have been a disagreement over an undisclosed visa process.

Original Story Continues:

Authorities in this state have identified the shooting victim as Christopher Ashcraft, a consular agent with the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara, Jalisco.

A security video obtained by Breitbart Texas shows the moment when Ashcraft walks to a booth to pay for parking in the shopping center. The consular agent carryied a gym bag and was dressed in a manner that led authorities to believe that he was leaving a local gym inside the shopping center. The video shows a man wearing dark blue shirt and pants similar to a nurse’s Authorities following Ashcraft.

A second video shows the man in blue walking in circles as he awaits for Ashcraft’s vehicle. When the consular agent arrives at the exit of the parking lot, the gunman pulls a handgun from his pants pocket and fires a single shot at the consular agents vehicle before running away.

Authorities revealed to Breitbart Texas that the gunman had been using a hat or a wig, mustache, glasses and gloves during various stages of the crime — such as when he followed Ashcroft, during the shooting, and when he fled the scene.

The diplomat was left bleeding inside his compact vehicle until medical personnel arrived. An ambulance transported him to a local hospital. Ashcraft’s vehicle had consular license plates BCC0911 from Mexico’s Foreign Relations Secretariat.

Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigations arrived at the shopping center to go over the crime scene and take copies of the surveillance videos. A second team of agents rushed to the San Javier Hospital where Ashcraft was undergoing emergency surgery. Medical personnel confirmed that the consular agent was shot in his right midsection.

For security reasons, Ashcraft will be sent back to the U.S. while authorities continue to look into the failed assassination attempt. The consular agent served in the Guadalajara Consulate since March 2016. Authorities announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gunman and any accomplices.

On Friday morning, officials with the Jalisco Attorney General’s Office confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the suspected gunman had been arrested.

[Warning: Violence, Strong Language]



The Compton rapper posted a video to his Facebook page in which he appears bloodied and seemingly dazed by the alleged shooting.

“Got shot. I guess I’m really a rap n**ga now, I just got shot,” Royal says to the camera.

In an earlier post, Royal explained what happened:

“Yes me and the homies got shot at couple days ago,” the rapper wrote. “AK47 bullet flew past my head and I was hit with the bullet fragments, 3 frags stuck in my forehead for life. They stopped right on my skull before they could enter my brain… GOD IS REAL YALL ! I should’ve died that night but I felt God move me back just enough for the bullet to miss. Take this life shit serious ! I was almost on a T-shirt I’m just blessed enough to be here for a reason, can’t nobody stop Gods plans.”

Royal also posted what appeared to be an X-ray of his head showing the location of the bullet fragments.

Kimmel rightly lamented the “59 innocent” who are dead as result of the Las Vegas attack, but there was a not a peep about the nearly 59 a month on average that have been killed year-to-date in Chicago in 2017.

The Chicago Tribune reports that the current death toll for Chicago 2017 sits at 527.

Moreover, Kimmel’s monologue contained no lamentations for the more than 63 individuals who were killed on average every month in Chicago during 2016 (the Chicago Tribune reported a total of 762 murders for 2016). And nothing was said for the nearly 4,400 victims who were shot and wounded during 2016.

But Kimmel suggests Republicans ought to be ashamed for not passing more gun control now.

Chicago is a tough one for the left because all the gun control imaginable has been tried–including an all-out ban on handguns — so Chicago is actually a case study in the ineffectiveness of gun control; an example of how murder numbers rise when strict gun control laws are in place.

For example, the handgun ban was instituted from 1982 to 2010 and Breitbart News reported that the death toll was much higher during that time. Chicago Police Department reports show there were 850 homicides during 1993. That is nearly 100 more homicides in 1993 than the 762 homicides for 2016. Moreover, the Chicago Police Department shows there were 930 homicides in 1994; 921 homicides in 1991; and a startling 940 homicides in 1992. If you break these figures down by averages, it means over 78 individuals were killed every month in 1992, 70 were killed every month in 1993, and 77 were killed every month in 1994.

Where is the hand-wringing for these deaths?

We should mourn every innocent life that was taken in Las Vegas and we should be outraged at the animal who took those lives. But we should also be broken over the death that continues to mark Chicago and we should be outraged at the vestiges of gun control that continue to make the acquisition of self-defense handguns a difficult proposition.

Starr County officials confirmed to Breitbart Texas that a trooper was apparently struck by a stray bullet from a gun battle taking place across the Mexican border. The shooting took place near Roma, Texas, an area immediately north of Miguel Aleman.

The trooper was airlifted to a hospital in McAllen where he is expected to recover.

UPDATE 3:15pm local time

Law enforcement officials confirmed to Breitbart Texas that a U.S. Border Patrol agent was shot as well but his duty-issued ballistic gear protected him.

Federal and state authorities are looking into the case to determine if the shots were in fact a stray bullets from a gun battle on the Mexican side or if they were purposely aimed at law enforcement.

Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Johnny Hernandez confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the trooper was shot in the leg. He is undergoing tests and is expected to recover.

Chicago 5 reports that the boy was wounded in a shooting that left an adult dead and a teenager injured. The adult was a 27-year-old female who was “shot in the head” and pronounced dead at the hospital. The wounded teenager is 19. The four-year-old boy was shot in the arm and treated at the hospital.

The shooting occurred around 5:19 pm Friday and marked gun-controlled Chicago’s first homicide of the weekend.

On July 29 Breitbart News reported that Chicago exceeded 400 homicides this year, placing the city on track to tie or surpass the nearly 800 homicides witnessed last year. The Chicago Tribune reported that it was only four years ago that “Chicago didn’t record 400 homicides until just before Thanksgiving Day.”

Gun-controlled Chicago surpassed 1,000 shooting victims for the year before the month of April was over. Yet in the face of the dismal failure of gun control, Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s (D) response was more gun control. On April 24 Breitbart News reported that Emanuel was pushing more controls on Federal Firearms License holders (FFLs). In other words, his response to gang and street crime is to punish gun dealers who attain a federal license to sell guns and who perform a background check for every gun they sell.

Note to Emanuel—criminals are not buying their guns from FFLs. A study by the University of Chicago Crime Lab shows that criminals in Chicago avoid buying guns anywhere that draws attention to the purchase. This means they avoid gun show purchases, internet purchases, or purchases from licensed, brick & mortar gun stores. The Chicago-Tribune quoted crime lab co-director Harold Pollack, saying, “[The study shows] some of the pathways [regarding guns] people are concerned about don’t seem so dominant.”

The Chicago Tribune reports the number of shooting victims January 1 through January 30 is 302; this includes fatal and non-fatal shootings. The number of homicides alone is 54, which means the city has averaged 1.8 killings a day every day this year.

On January 23, Breitbart News reported that shootings and murders for January 1 through January 22, 2017, were up markedly over the number of shootings and murders for the same period in 2016. According to the Tribune, “At least 228 people were shot in Chicago [January 1 through January 22, 2017].” That was an increase of 16 victims above the number shot during the same period in 2016. There were “at least 42 homicides,” marking a “23.5 percent … [increase from] the 34 homicides from the same period in 2016.”

This news follows the grim report that gun-controlled Chicago had nearly 4,400 shootings and almost 800 murders.

During a January 25 interview with ABC News, President Trump described gun-controlled Chicago as a “war zone.” He also took to Twitter to make clear he is sending in the feds if city leaders fail to rein in the “carnage”:

If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017

Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL-4) and other Democrats derided Trump’s observations, rather than seeing the violence as a reason to support arming law-abiding citizens for self-defense.

Valdosta Police Chief Brian Childress says the officer also was wounded, but both men are expected to survive. He says the officer was shot “multiple times” but is going to be fine.

The suspect was not identified. Childress would not discuss a possible motive.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman Scott Dutton says one of the shots hit the officer in the abdomen, just below his protective vest. Other shots hit the officer’s vest.

The former NRA instructor engaged Devin Patrick Kelley as he exited the church.

“I’m no hero. I’m not,” Stephen Willeford told 40/29 News reporter Joshua Cole in a video interview on Monday. “I think my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills I needed to do what needed to be done.”

“I just wish I could have gotten there faster,” Willeford said in an emotional interview. “I didn’t know. I didn’t know what was happening.”

Willeford told Cole the experience was surreal. “I was scared,” he said. “It was surreal to me–it couldn’t be happening.”

After hearing the “pop pop pop pop” sound that was all too familiar to a former NRA instructor, Willeford said he grabbed his rifle and quickly loaded rounds into his magazine. When he stepped out onto the street, he saw a man wearing all black, a tactical helmet, and a ballistic vest.

“I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots – just ‘pop pop pop pop’ and I knew every one of those shots represented someone, that it was aimed at someone, that they weren’t just random shots,” Willeford explained. “He saw me and I saw him.”

He said he took cover and did what he had to do.

Texas officials reported in a press conference Monday night that Devin Patrick Kelley, the killer of 26 in the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, was struck by Willeford’s gun fire two times–once in the torso and once in the leg.” He then dropped his rifle, got in his car, and fled the scene before he could shoot any other people who were outside the church.

Willeford then stopped a passing neighbor and asked for help. “That guy just shot up the Baptist church,” he told the driver. He climbed in the car and together, they took off in pursuit of the deranged killer.

They eventually caught up to Kelley’s SUV shortly before he crashed into a road sign. They later learned Kelley shot himself in the head after calling his father.

Willeford and his companion shouted at Kelley to get out of his truck. There was no movement.

Willeford’s family has lived in the unincorporated Texas community of Sutherland Springs for four generations. Many of those who died or were wounded were friends of his.

He says he is not a hero–others are sure to disagree.

Tapper is being singled out for much of the criticism from those who say he remained silent as abusive personal attacks were hurled at Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch. Incredibly, Tapper also remained silent as his audience booed a rape victim.

At the Wednesday night spectacle, those in favor of protecting our Second Amendment civil rights were vastly outnumbered by an audience packed with hostile gun-haters and emotional questioners, including children.

According to various reports, the anti-gun participants were given scripted questions crafted by CNN. The last-place network has denied this by attacking a school shooting victim as a liar. His accusation, however, is credible given CNN’s long and disturbing history of using plants.

Throughout the hour, the audience heckled, howled, and poured derision on Loesch and Rubio. Other than admonishing his audience for calling Loesch a “murderer,” Tapper stood by in silent approval as abuse and personal attacks rained down on his outnumbered guests.

The Media Research Center writes, “Jake Tapper sat back as the wild crowd targeted … Rubio with boos and jeers… The wildest moment allowed by Tapper was when Parkland, Florida student Cameron Kasky smeared the Senator by equating him to the shooter that killed 17 of his classmates. And Tapper thanked him for all of it.”

Specifically, this is what Kasky snarled at Rubio, “Senator Rubio, it’s hard to look at you and not look down the barrel on an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz[.]”

Tapper then thanked Kasky.

Actor Adam Baldwin was one of many who compared the event to a “show trial.”

Tapper faced even more intense criticism for allowing the 17-year-old Kasky to bring Loesch’s children into the debate by attacking her as a mother.

“I wish I could have asked the NRA lady [Loesch] a question,” Kasky said to Rubio. “I would ask her how she can look in the mirror, considering the fact that she has children[.]”

As the crowd burst into cheers, Tapper muttered something about “What was that, I’m sorry?” The crowd roared on.

“Absolutely despicable behavior by Parkland student Cameron Kasky … question[ing Loesch’s] motherhood and whether she cares about her children,” tweeted Curtis Houck, managing editor of Newsbusters. “Jake Tapper does nothing. How un-American. Simply unacceptable[.]”

Houck attached video of the moment to his tweet:

Others chimed in over the left-wing Tapper’s silent approval:

Disgusting. After Tapper stayed silent last night when Dana Loesch's kids were attacked and threatened now they attack a survivor and call him a liar. — Evan G. (@Evan_G1126) February 22, 2018

God, such rudeness and disrespect shown to Dana Loesch. Booing, hostile yelling as she speaks…Jake Tapper not controlling the crowd on purpose. CNN Town Hall is an agenda driven joke. pic.twitter.com/0CbgQNDfJE — SeaMonkey (@OldSalt45) February 22, 2018

At the CNN Town Hall, Jake Tapper sat back while a disrespectful punk compared Marco Rubio to Nikolas Cruz and questioned if Dana Loesch cares about her children. Yes, the joke of a “journalist” and liberal puke Jake Tapper did not say a damn word. Slime. #StudentsStandUp — Mike (@mike_Zollo) February 22, 2018

Tapper, who likes to present himself as male feminist, also chose to remain silent when the audience booed a rape survivor who now supports the Second Amendment.

Journalist Mike Cernovich compared the night to a “Two Minute Hate,” an event in George Orwell’s “1984” where the elite deflect from their own sins by allowing people to pour out their loathing and hostility on an innocent person or symbol.

Rubio looked weak The audience cheered banning guns One person looked really nasty, attacking a mom Tapper and CNN showed their agenda, no pretense of dialogue, it was 2 Minutes Hate Loesch looks great, held court. Rubio looked weak and will never be POTUS#StudentsStandUp — Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) February 22, 2018

Another viewer summed the event up as “abusive.”

The country is democracy which means majority rule! It is NOT ruled by who yells the loudest or who protest the most or by intolerant obnoxious abusive crowds at a @CNN event. The “Town Hall” further demonstrated the lefts inability to have a civil debate or discussions! — P M W Family (@PMWellsFmly) February 22, 2018

CNN and Tapper, a former Democrat operative and Salon contributor, have faced growing criticism over the climate of hate (detailed here) the network frequently manufactures against Trump and his supporters, or anyone on the right — oftentimes through fake news.

For example, although debunked, Tapper continues to spread lies about Trump mocking a reporter’s disability. He also spread fake news with false claim that the president did not offer his condolences after a mosque shooting. While Tapper frequently attacks others over their tone and rhetoric, he does so while ginning up hatre against Trump by smearing the president as “un-American,” “unhinged,” and “unmoored.”

Tapper has yet to apologize for his behavior or to the rape victim, he also has not disavowed Kasky’s personal attacks or the behavior of the audience.

breitbart150,breitbart,['John Nolte'],2018-02-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/02/21/criticism-grows-cnns-use-children-push-anti-gun-agenda/,"The far-left cable channel CNN is facing a growing storm of criticism over its frequent use of minor children (14 to 17) to further its anti-gun agenda.

Already a number of the children, those who witnessed last week’s shooting massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida, have made countless appearances on the anti-Trump cable network. In furtherance of its anti-gun propaganda push, CNN’s anti-Trump pundit, Jake Tapper, will host a town hall Wednesday night featuring these children.

Many, however, see CNN’s use of these minors as an act of partisan exploitation that is not only immoral, but also not good for the mental health of children so soon after they have witnessed such a traumatic event.

Appearing on Fox News, the Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway said, “There’s been unfortunate media handling of these traumatized children. They’ve used them as ways to enact what they always like to do, a gun control agenda,” she said before referencing CNN’s upcoming town hall. “These children aren’t forcing their ways on to CNN, town halls, or covers of magazines. Media is choosing them to put there, to shut down debate and keep people from having a conversation about gun control.”

Truth Revolt also singled out CNN. “[The children’s] outrage is more than understandable after witnessing a mass shooting and fearing for their lives, but it’s shameful that CNN, and many other leftist outlets, would exploit them over and over again online and on-air to push the media’s gun control agenda. ”

The Federalist asks, What if putting “traumatized teenagers” on TV is “not healthy?”

“But what if putting traumatized teenagers, mere days removed from a shocking and life-changing event, in front of cameras and crowds is not healthy? Have we thought that through,” the Federalist asks, before closing with this, “Leave the kids alone. It’s our job to lead, not theirs.”

In her syndicated column, Michelle Maklin writes, “Many [of these children] may be exceptionally smart, passionate, and articulate beyond their years, but they do not possess any semblance of wisdom because they have not lived those years. Their knowledge of history, law, and public policy is severely limited … And their moral agency and cognitive abilities are far from fully developed.”

She adds, “Most are in no position to change the world when they can’t even remember to change their own bedsheets … Yet, [Lawrence] Tribe relishes the opportunity to hide behind the young Parkland activists headed to CNN’s propaganda town halls[.]”

At National Review, Ben Shapiro writes, “CNN plans a full primetime special with the victims’ classmates, parents, and community members … What, pray tell,” Shapirios asks, “did these students do to earn their claim to expertise? They were present during a mass shooting, and they have the right point of view, according to the Left.”

Singling out CNN, Shapiro points out that “There’s a reason that producers at CNN are eager to put [high school] junior Cameron Kasky in front of the cameras: He says things like ‘You’re either with us or against us.’ It seems a stretch to think that if Kasky were instead advocating for more armed school security, CNN would be breaking into its primetime lineup to air his views.”

Talking about CNN and other left-wing news outlets, National Review’s Dan McLaughlin writes, “’I’m never in favor of the whole spectacle of using kids as political props, which both sides do, but it’s one thing when it’s relatively benign stuff — a politician campaigning with his family … Those aren’t efforts to use kids as human shields against hard questions being asked in a serious public-policy debate.”

Hot Air’s John Sexton believes CNN is feeding these traumatized children talking points: “Perhaps what’s most striking is how closely some of [student Emma Gonzalez] points seem to mirror talking points tweeted out a couple days earlier by, wait for it, CNN. It’s almost as if CNN is feeding the students information for the events it then covers as the authentic voice of the students.”

Sexton also worries if CNN is exploiting these kids to promote its agenda. “Is it odd to anyone else that a CNN news story about student gun control efforts features a segment promoting CNN’s own town hall event? Is CNN reporting here or promoting an agenda?”

When Tapper himself, the former Salon writer and host of CNN’s upcoming anti-gun town hall, was criticized for “using traumatized teenagers,” he avoided the subject by accusing his critic of lying.

Twitter user @kengardner11 tweeted to the left-wing Tapper, “Using traumatized teenagers who don’t even yet know enough to have coherent political views as emotional props to push a particular political agenda is not healthy or logical.”

Tapper fired back with a non sequitur: “You said something demonstrably false and now you’re trying to change the subject.”

Gardner replied, “Um…really? What did I say that you claim that was demonstrably false? Demonstrate it to me. But focus on what I actually said.”

Tapper was then forced to change the subject, arguing that Gardner accused him of bias. When Gardner challenged Tapper to point out where he did this, Tapper abruptly shut down the discussion. “[T]his doesn’t seem a conversation you’re trying to have in good faith, so adios! Have a great weekend,” Tapper snarked.

Um…really? What did I say that you claim that was demonstrably false? Demonstrate it to me. But focus on what I actually said. If you do, this won’t take long. — Ken Gardner (@KenGardner11) February 18, 2018

I was about to answer this again — it was about how just a few hours ago i was defending a kid who spoke in favor of having his teacher armed. The point was people shouldn’t attack; they should debate. But now I see your other tweets about me. So I don’t really see the point. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 18, 2018

You suggested i would never voice such support for anyone who publicly took a conservative position. I literally had done so minutes before. But again, this doesn’t seem a conversation you’re trying to have in good faith, so adios! Have a great weekend. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 18, 2018

Tapper’s intellectual dishonesty has been the typical response from CNN to those criticizing the last-place network for using children, who are obviously traumatized, as a means to push its anti-gun agenda.

Rather than address the actual issue at hand — Is it appropriate to use children as young as 14 in this way? — CNN manufactures arguments its critics did not make or focuses on straw men, like a few conspiracy theorists claiming these children are actors.

CNN has yet to address the matter directly or to bring mental health experts on the air to discuss it.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) declared Monday that Congress ought to follow the example of Emma Gonzalez, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who spoke out for gun control after last Wednesday’s shooting.

“It’s time for Congress to have the same courage and compassion as Emma Gonzalez and the parents, students, and faculty at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It’s time to stand up to the gun lobby,” Harris tweeted.

In her speech at a gun control rally on Saturday, Gonzalez accused President Donald Trump of being bought by the National Rifle Association (NRA). After a tearful introduction, she launched into a set of talking points familiar from gun control campaigns nationwide.

CNN posted a transcript of her remarks, a portion of which follows:

Every single person up here today, all these people should be home grieving. But instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see. Since the time of the Founding Fathers and since they added the Second Amendment to the Constitution, our guns have developed at a rate that leaves me dizzy. The guns have changed but our laws have not. … Because Australia had one mass shooting in 1999 in Port Arthur (and after the) massacre introduced gun safety, and it hasn’t had one since. Japan has never had a mass shooting. Canada has had three and the UK had one and they both introduced gun control and yet here we are, with websites dedicated to reporting these tragedies so that they can be formulated into statistics for your convenience. … We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He [the shooter] would not have harmed that many students with a knife. … If the President wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association. You want to know something? It doesn’t matter, because I already know. Thirty million dollars.

Harris’s hashtag, “#WeCallBS,” refers to a refrain at the end of Gonzalez’s speech.

Pollak'],2018-02-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2018/02/19/pollak-please-name-one-new-law-stop-mass-shootings/,"The mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week has caused shock and grief to the entire nation.

The left is, as usual, demanding gun control — and it has enlisted several students from the school in its cause.

(Actually, the students are, like the rest of America, divided on the issue, but apparently only the students who support gun control are earning national media headlines and support from politicians and parents.)

One can understand the desire to do something — anything — to prevent another terrible event, but once again it is unclear what law or regulation would stop mass shootings.

Outlawing “assault weapons”? Automatic weapons are already largely illegal, and are not involved in most mass shooting events. The last “assault weapons” ban did nothing to stop mass shooting events — including Columbine.

Banning the AR-15 — a single-pull, single-shot weapon falsely described as an “assault weapon”? The Charleston shooter murdered his victims at the church with a handgun. Stephen Willeford, the hero who stopped the Texas church shooter last year, did so with an AR-15 rifle.

Gun violence restraining orders (GVROs)? These arose in California after the Isla Vista shooting in 2015, to allow relatives of a troubled person to have police take their guns away. But these orders are only temporary. The Sandy Hook shooter’s mother gave him his guns. And in Parkland, the parents who took the killer in had no idea he was so troubled. They told reporters that he had been showing improvement, and thought they had locked his guns away.

Improved background checks? That might help, although that solution depends on the ability of the bureaucracy to manage databases properly, which it failed to do in the case of the Texas shooter, who never should have been able to buy a gun. And just as in Parkland, many other mass shooters, including Islamic terrorists, have previously been reported to law enforcement or the FBI, but have either been ignored, or have been left alone after a brief inquiry.

As Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Breitbart News last week, “there are signals and signs before these shootings that, if recognized, could lead to intervention, and could stop these events from occurring.” They are being missed.

So — what new gun laws or regulations would actually prevent mass shootings?

There is one possibility, but the left will not allow us to try it: namely, allowing teachers to carry guns.

Last year, five largely rural California school districts adopted policies to allow teachers with concealed carry permits to bring their weapons on campus, so that they could respond to any active shooting situation that might arise, and — more likely — deter one from happening.

In response, the Democrat-dominated California legislature passed, and Governor Jerry Brown signed, a law to “delete the authority of a school district superintendent, his or her designee, or equivalent school authority to provide written permission for a person to possess a firearm within a school zone.”

We will never know if the districts’ policy would have helped prevent shoot shootings because California Democrats never gave it a chance.

And so, thanks to Democrats and the media, we are reduced to debating gun laws and regulations that we know would not have prevented the shooting in Parkland, or elsewhere.

The best that can be said of these ideas is they might prevent future mass shootings. But most new gun controls would also come at the heavy cost of infringing a fundamental constitutional right, and of stripping law-abiding citizens of the ability to defend themselves.

Although the March is officially titled “March for Our Lives,” BuzzfeedNews reports the march is indeed focused on securing gun control:

ABC News reports that South Broward High School students have already begun rallying for gun control, with Sophomore Genesis Campbell leading chants while holding a sign that read, “No more silence, end gun violence.” And this all comes after Nikolas Cruz complied with gun control to acquire a rifle, then carried that rifle into a gun-free school zone and opened fire, killing 17.

Actress and gun control advocate Julianne Moore praised the students for pressuring Congress to act:

This is an exciting and important moment. On March 24, students are leading marches in DC & across the country to demand that lawmakers do their jobs and take action to prevent gun violence. Get involved: https://t.co/u4MKGLpoZR #MarchForOurLives @Everytown — Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) February 18, 2018

Josh Gad voiced support for the gun control march as well:

Milano tweeted within hours of the February 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas High, asking NRA members to demand “sensible gun control.” She did not say what such gun control might be, but the “sensible” gun control pushed by Hollywood and Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control groups has historically been background checks. But the Florida school gunman passed a background check.

Because of this, the column, which hinged on quotes from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, actually served to undermine the left’s hysteria-charged perception of AR-15 rifles.

For example, USA Today quoted the Brady Campaign saying, “[AR-15s] are accurate and they can basically shoot as quickly as you can pull the trigger.” They continued, “Along those lines, [AR-15s are] very customizable — most average people can figure out how to install accessories like forward trigger grips that let you hold the gun at waist height and spray bullets while stabilizing the gun, laser sights, and you can add high-capacity magazines.”

Note the use of “forward trigger grips” (whatever those are) and the intimation of a pray-and-spray shooting style.

But master firearms instructor and gun store owner Dean Hazen looked right past the hype and told USA Today that the focus on AR-15s is not because the firearm is the best suited for mass public attacks but because those carrying out such attacks have a “copy cat mentality” which causes them to use a gun used by previous attackers.

Hazen said, “It’s really just a perception thing.” He added, “There are rifles that are more powerful and more dangerous than that, but they’re not being used.”

He is correct inasmuch as there are far more effective weapons. However, the left does not see this because they focus on things like “forward trigger grips” (whatever those are) and other firearm accessories that sound ominous to them. In reality, the greatest advantage an attacker has is time and when the area he strikes is designated “gun-free” then time is certainly on his side.

For example, Breitbart News reported that the Sandy Hook Elementary School gunman had over 9 minutes without armed resistance during his December 14, 2012, attack. With that kind of time the type of firearm used is largely a moot point, as an untold number of people could be killed or wounded by a gunman armed only with a snub-nose revolver and a pocket full of bullets.

Yet there are firearms that could make heinous crimes even worse. Those firearms are “more powerful and more dangerous” than an AR-15. Hazen alluded to his when he said, “Thank God [the attackers] don’t know any better because if they did they would use much more effective weapons.”

The attack occurred at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, at approximately 11:30 a.m. central time. Celebrities began calling for gun control before the number of casualties was confirmed and before the gunman had been identified, or his possible motive discovered.

Horror novelist Stephen King was quick to call for new gun laws:

How many more have to die before we enact sane gun control laws? — Stephen King (@StephenKing) November 5, 2017

King’s gun control push was echoed by comedian and actress Sarah Silverman:

When a plane crashes, air travel becomes exponentially safer bc of the lessons learned. But 1 mass shooting after another…nothing. — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) November 5, 2017

And actor Josh Gad:

Terror attack that kills 6 gets travel bans same day; Deadliest mass shooting & deadliest church shooting ever get prayers & 2 soon to talk — Josh Gad (@joshgad) November 5, 2017

Comedian and former Netflix talk show host Chelsea Handler blamed the attack on Republicans:

Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) November 5, 2017

Meanwhile, actor Timothy Simons blamed the attack on the NRA:

Joy Reid blamed the NRA as well:

The @NRA is soaked and bathed in blood. How do its adherents sleep at night? — Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) November 5, 2017

And a producer for Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show unleashed a profanity-laced tweet against President Donald Trump, Russia, and guns:

Director Adam McKay tweeted:

And Silicon Valley actor Kumail Nanjiani called for “#GunControlNow:”

breitbart156,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-11-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/21/17-gun-controls-currently-pushed-democrats-surrogates/,"Senate Democrats and their surrogates in various groups are currently pushing 21 new gun controls for law-abiding citizens.

These controls range from an all-out ban on semiautomatic firearms to regulations on single shot muzzleloaders and limits on the number of guns someone can pass to a felon.

Breitbart News outlined the first nine of these gun controls on October 11. They were:

Ban on Bump Stocks – Sen. Dianne Feinstein is pushing this with her Automatic Fire Prevention Act. She admits that bump stocks are an accessory—that they do not convert semiautomatics into automatics—but she wants to ban them anyway. Her bill explicitly bans any accessory that allows an increase in rate of fire in short bursts but does “not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun.” Ban on Trigger Cranks – Sen. Feinstein’s bill bans trigger cranks too. Like the bump stock, trigger cranks are another novelty that gun owners can use to achieve short, rapid bursts of fire. Such cranks allow a gun owner to mimic automatic fire yet do not convert a semiautomatic gun into an automatic one. Ban on Semiautomatic firearms – Sen. Feinstein voiced support for this ban during her appearance on Face the Nation, and the Washington Post pushed for such a ban two days later. Implementation of Universal Background Checks – Sen. Chris Murphy used an appearance on State of the Union to stress that a bump stock ban is only the beginning for Democrats. They plan to follow that ban with the implementation of universal background checks, which means private gun sales would require a background check just like retail sales. Democrats claim these checks would save lives, yet Sen. Murphy and others ignore the fact that the Vegas attacker purchased his guns via background checks, as did so many attackers before him. The real reason Democrats want universal background checks is because such checks require a gun registry to be enforceable. Therefore, the implementation of such checks would immediately lead to one more gun control: a gun registry. Ban on “Assault Weapons” – Sen. Murphy also mentioned an “assault weapons” ban, suggesting it would be next in line after background checks. The Los Angeles Times called for an “assault weapons” ban as well. Ban on “High Capacity” Magazines – The Los Angeles Times also called for a ban on “high capacity” magazines, describing them as one of the most dangerous aspects of “assault weapons.” The Times points to attacks like ones on Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, and the San Bernardino County Building as justifications for an “assault weapons” ban that contains a “high capacity” magazine ban. In so doing, the Times overlooks the fact that all three attacks—Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, and San Bernardino—occurred in gun-free zones. This means the attackers had no threat of armed response and could take their time, reloading as often as needed. In such scenarios magazine capacity is a moot issue. Opposition to Concealed Carry – Breitbart News reported that Sen. Feinstein took time to argue against concealed carry for law-abiding citizens during an appearance on Face the Nation. Speaking of concealed carry she said, “I don’t believe it’s protected by the Constitution.” Opposition to National Reciprocity – Sen. Feinstein also voiced opposition to the national reciprocity legislation currently pending before Congress. She said, “Well, my opinion of that bill is it’s terrible. … [Do] we want every American to feel comfortable packing a concealed weapon around the country?” Australian-style Gun Ban – The Washington Post put forward the idea in an October 9 editorial.

Numerous others have flooded in since the introduction of those original nine. The newest suggested controls include regulation on single shot muzzleloaders. In fact, Gabby Giffords gun control group suggests muzzleloaders could be the next bump stock. Her group also wants gun control on “high capacity shotguns,” binary triggers, “AK and AR style pistols,” arm braces for AR style pistols, “AR pistol blade stabilizers,” .50 caliber rifles, .50 caliber ammunition, and tracer rounds for various calibers of firearms.

Giffords’ group seeks to substantiate their call for a ban on tracer rounds by writing, “Tracer rounds allow a shooter to see where rounds are tracking at night.”

Two other gun controls are being pushed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The first of the two is a federal ban on firearms trafficking. She is pushing this ban although such trafficking is already clearly prohibited via ATF background check form 4473. LIBN reports that Gillibrand is also again pushing the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking & Crime Prevention Act, which “would make it illegal to sell purchase, or transfer two or more firearms to someone whom the seller knows, or has reasonable cause to know, is a felon or convicted domestic abuser.”

Lastly, the 21st gun control currently being pushed is regulation on so-called “ghost guns.” These are guns that are legal to manufacture at home, but require a significant amount of know-how and equipment to accomplish. The establishment media is currently pointed to two crimes committed with “ghost guns” as justification for a new federal law to regulate the sale, manufacture of the firearms.

On October 19, 2017, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urged his Democrat colleagues to drop gun control. He worried that it will politically hurtful for those trying to get re-elected in red states in November 2018. Apparently, Schumer’s colleagues are not listening.

breitbart157,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-03-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/30/doctors-for-responsible-gun-ownership-firearm-suppressors-fight-hearing-loss/,"Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership (DRGO) have released a position paper explaining how firearm suppressors fight hearing loss and announcing their support for theHearing Protection Act.

The doctors contributing to the position paper include Matthew P. Branch, MD; Gerard J. Gianoli, MD, FACS; Bradford Ress, MD, FANS; and Timothy Wheeler, MD. Their paper comes as Congress moves closer to taking up the Hearing Protection Act, which was put forward by Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) on January 9.

According to DRGO:

Particularly harmful for firearms enthusiasts is the explosive blast (or impulse) generated when firing a handgun or rifle. This explosive blast generates 1,000 times more pressure than the actual noise of a gunshot. Such blasts can result in significant, permanent hearing loss with a single exposure of 140 decibels or more… This is the same “acoustic blast trauma” suffered by survivors of IEDs on the battlefield.

After showing that “significant, permanent hearing loss” can result from “a single exposure of 140 decibels or more,” DRGO points out that that “muzzle blast sound levels for most firearms (handguns, rifles and shotguns) range from 140 to over 170 decibels, more than sufficient to cause instant, permanent hearing damage.”

The doctors then explain the insufficiency and potential risk of using “ear plugs or ear muffs” to protect against hearing loss:

Hearing protection in the form of ear plugs or ear muffs, alone or in combination, can only reduce noise exposure by approximately 20-30 decibels. This limitation in noise reduction may still expose a firearms user to damaging levels of noise; 120 decibels is still louder than a car horn from three feet away. Thus, inside the canal and over the ear devices (i.e., ear plugs and ear muffs)—the only current generally available protection—are inadequate for impulse noise protection, and when used together they deafen the wearer to all external sound.

They point to a study conducted by Dr. Matthew Branch, who also contributed to the DRGO position paper. His study found:

All suppressors offered significantly greater noise reduction than ear-level protection, usually greater than 50% better. Noise reduction of all ear-level protectors is unable to reduce the impulse pressure below 140 dB for certain common firearms, an international standard for prevention of sensorineural hearing loss… Modern muzzle-level suppression is vastly superior to ear-level protection and the only available form of suppression capable of making certain sporting arms safe for hearing.

It is interesting to note that Gabby Giffords’ gun control group claims Americans should use “ear plugs” instead of suppressors. Giffords’ group tweeted, “You know what protects your hearing better than a silencer? Ear plugs. Don’t be fooled: the so-called ‘Hearing Protection Act’ does nothing to protect hearing.”

FACT: Silencers do not protect your hearing. pic.twitter.com/EXe8e4VgmY — ARS (@resp_solutions) March 13, 2017

So it appears we must choose whom we believe: doctors trained in evaluating hearing and threats to hearing or gun control propagandists?

breitbart158,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-06-12 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/12/house-panel-takes-hearing-protection-act-firearm-suppressors/,"The House subcommittee on Natural Resources will review legislation containing the Hearing Protection Act on Wednesday.

Breitbart News reported that that Hearing Protection Act was introduced by Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) on January 9, 2o17. The legislation recognizes the hearing protection benefits for firearm suppressors and removes them from the purview of the National Firearms Act (1934) to make the process of acquiring one less cumbersome for law-abiding citizens.

According to Politico, Duncan has now included the suppressor legislation in the Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act (SHARE Act) and “a ‘discussion draft’ of SHARE Act will be reviewed by…[the subcommittee] on Wednesday.”

Duncan held a demonstration of how suppressors work for some of his colleagues at a U.S. Capitol Police shooting range last week. He spoke about his legislative push on suppressors, saying:

The Hearing Protection Act has been one of the most important bills for sportsmen and women this Congress, which is why it’s common sense for it to be included in this year’s sportsman’s legislative package. By changing the outdated regulation of suppressors to an instant background check, just like the requirements to purchase a typical firearm, I hope the sportsmen and women in the United States will have greater access to noise reduction technology as they carry the hunting and recreational shooting tradition to future generations.

During a September 26, 2017, interview with SilencerCo’s Josh Waldron, Donald Trump Jr. lauded the benefits of suppressors and talked of how the devices are commonplace throughout Europe:

I’ve had the privilege of being able to hunt in Europe, where some of the strictest gun laws in the world exist. And guess what, virtually every hunting gun there is suppressed. It’s about safety. If you have that kind of noise levels in any of industry, like you do shooting sports, OSHA would be going crazy. It’s about safety.

He then pointed out the cumbersome regulations for acquiring suppressors in the U.S. and described them as “[rules] the government wants to put in place for no reason.”

Donald Jr. made clear that his father would sign the Hearing Protection Act if Congress passes it. He said, “We want to go through Congress, want to do it the right way, but if you line up those votes he is obviously going to be for it.”

breitbart159,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-03-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/06/eight-states-where-2nd-amendment-is-only-carry-permit-required/,"The West Virginia House overrode Tomblin’s veto on March 4 and the West Virginia Senate followed suit on March 5. WSAZ 3 reports that permitless carry “becomes law” 90 days from date of veto override.

This means there are now eight states where the Second Amendment is the only carry permit required.

It is important to note that there are still various rules that need to be learned and followed–in Montana, for instance, there are requirements for a permit in order to carry concealed in a city setting and many of the states have different rules for residents vs. non-residents–but apart from such caveats, permitless carry is the law of the land in Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Vermont, Wyoming, and West Virginia.

Alaska: The Alaska Department of Public Safety succinctly explains the state’s concealed carry law, “Alaska’s laws do not prohibit anyone 21 or older who may legally possess a firearm from carrying it concealed. A special permit is not required.” Alaska does have certain prohibitions as to where a concealed carry firearm cannot be possessed, such prohibitions include bars but differentiate between restaurants that serve alcohol and actual bars. The prohibitions also include private property where permission to carry is denied. The full list of prohibitions can be viewed here.

Arizona: Arizona’s carry laws are very similar to Alaska’s. If you are 21-year-old or older and are not barred from gun possession then you can legally carry a concealed handgun for self-defense without a permit. There are restrictions, one of which is a prohibition on carrying into “businesses serving alcohol for consumption on the premises.” You can carry in a such a business if you have an Arizona concealed carry permit, but such locations are off limits otherwise. The Arizona Department Public Safety lists other restrictions.

Kansas: Permitless concealed-carry became the law of the land in Kansas on July 1, 2015. Since that time the Kansas Attorney General’s website says, “A Concealed Carry Handgun license from Kansas or any other jurisdiction is no longer required in order to carry concealed firearms in Kansas for most individuals. So long as the person is 21 or older and lawful to possess firearms.” The Kansas Attorney General’s website also contains specifics on restrictions pertaining to concealed carry in the state.

Maine: Permitless concealed-carry became the law of the land in Maine on October 15, 2015. Maine.gov expounds: “Concealed carry without a permit is limited to people who are 21 or older, with the following exception: If a person is 18 years of age or older, and is on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard, or has been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces or the National Guard, and is not otherwise prohibited from carrying a firearm, the person may carry a concealed handgun. ” Other restrictions tied to concealed carry can be found on Maine.gov.

Montana: According to the Montana Department of Justice, “You may carry a concealed weapon without a permit if you are outside the official boundaries of a city or town or the confines of a logging, lumbering, mining or railroad camp.” However, carrying concealed without a license is not permitted in municipal areas. The details on the restrictions for carry in municipal areas can be found on the Montana Department of Justice website.

Vermont: Carrying a concealed handgun for self-defense without a permit is lawful in Vermont. According to the NRA-ILA, “It is lawful to carry a firearm openly or concealed provided the firearm is not carried with the intent or avowed purpose of injuring a fellow man. It is unlawful to carry a firearm within any state institution or upon the grounds or lands owned or leased by such institution.” As with other states that recognize permitless carry, there are restrictions on where a concealed handgun can be carried–including schools, courthouses, etc. Those who plan to carry concealed in Vermont need to familiarize themselves with all restrictions before do doing.

Wyoming: It became lawful for Wyoming residents to carry a concealed handgun without a permit in 2011. But Wyoming has a number of restrictions differentiating between concealed carry requirements for residents and non-residents, and everyone who plans to carry in Wyoming should familiarize themselves with those restrictions prior to carrying. Smart Gun Laws provides a good starting summary of the Wyoming carry statutes.

West Virginia: The West Virginia House and Senate just overrode Governor Earl Ray Tomblin’s (D) veto of House Bill 4145, sponsored by Delegate Saira Blair (R-Martinsburg). This means the Second Amendment will be soon be recognized as a sufficient carry permit for those 21-years old and older in West Virginia. HB 4145 also lowers the age for acquiring a concealed carry permit to 18-years of age, so that persons 18 to 20 years old can get a permit in order to carry a gun for self-defense prior to turning 21. Those planning to carry without a permit in West Virginia need to keep an eye on emerging information on official websites for the West Virginia government and follow pertinent restrictions."
breitbart160,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-07-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/07/19/ar-15-flying-off-gun-store-shelves-following-newest-gun-controls/,"Gun store owners in California say the demand for AR-15s has skyrocketed in the wake of the new gun controls signed by Governor Jerry Brown on July 1.

Among those controls is a law that will enhance the state’s ban on “assault weapons.”

According to KION, Ray Parga, owner of Marina’s Del Valle Gunsmithing, said “California compliant rifles” sold so fast they are now “now-existent” on store shelves. Moreover, he said, demand is so great that the incoming shipments of such guns “have already been sold.”

Parga said the demand for the rifles arises from the simple fact that Californians “want to be able to have one before they aren’t allowed to buy them anymore.” And he stressed that the new gun laws are misplaced, in that they burden law-abiding citizens with rules criminals will never follow. He added, “Criminals don’t care about the law. Evil is as evil is.”

Six new gun bills in total were signed by Brown. One seeks enhancement of California’s “assault weapons” ban by outlawing rifles with “bullet buttons.” Such buttons are simple releases that allow gun owners to trade out an empty ammunition magazine for a full one.

Breitbart News reported that gun owners rallied in Sacramento the day after the bills were signed, proclaiming their determination to refusal to recognize the new requirements.

According to the Sacramento Bee, the protesters held banners that declared, “WE WILL NOT COMPLY.”

Earlier in July, Breitbart News reported that one innovator has already devised a way to circumvent the ban on “bullet buttons”: “… on July 5, the inventor of the ‘bullet button’ introduced the ‘Patriot Mag Release,’ a.k.a. ‘Bullet Button Reloaded.'”

California’s Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom has been pushing a November referendum that will require background checks for ammunition purchases in the state. Such campaigns almost always drive up the demand for weapons."
breitbart161,breitbart,['Oliver Jj Lane'],2016-07-15 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/07/15/automobile-weapon-choice-islamist-killers/,"Thursday night’s Bastille killings in Nice, France follows a familiar pattern of one of the crowning achievements of Western civilisation — the mass-produced automobile — being used as a weapon against its own people.

The use of a vehicle as a deadly battering-ram, followed up by a dismounted gun or knife attack is directly out of the Islamist playbook, and the repeated use of the method follows orders disseminated through Islamist propaganda to commit these styles of attacks. We have learnt over the course of Friday that the killer even called the customary war cry “Allahu Akhbar” as he ploughed his truck into the crowds.

While Europe has already seen several similar attacks — some of which have been already forgotten or dismissed as the work of the mentally ill — Islamist car assaults are already familiar to the people of Israel. Breitbart Jerusalem reported last night on how Palestinian killers routinely deploy the deadly tactic — with one Palestinian male attempting a car attack against Israeli border police just two days ago.

Little more than a week ago, IDF soldiers were similarly targeted, with attacks going back eight years using not just cars but heavy vehicles too, just like Thursday’s deadly Nice attacks.

Many may be shocked to discover this is not the first time Islamists have used this method in France — Nice has merely been the most deadly. Just weeks before the deadly Islamist attack on the offices of Paris satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, Breitbart London reported on 13 seriously injured pedestrians as a man driving his car and shouting “Allahu Akhbar” mounted the pavement and repeatedly drove into crowds of people.

Of the injured two were left in critical condition, and one victim was just eleven years old. That attack came just weeks after an Islamic State propaganda video was released in the French language entitled ‘What are you waiting for?’ which entreated true believers to “kill them and spit in their faces and run them over with your car”.

The next day on December 22nd , terror struck again as a delivery van was driven at speed into a Nantes Christmas market, injuring 11. British newspaper of record The Times reported reliable eyewitnesses including a police officer who stated the driver shouted “Allahu Akhbar”.

The method has grown in popularity among would-be terrorists because it is so deadly, and so effective. Islamist propaganda including recruiting magazines such as the Islamic State’s Dabiq and Al-Qaeda’s Inspire have both called on readers to use cars to run over enemies of Islam.

Automobiles are easily acquired in Western countries without arousing the suspicion of the security services, and as has been tragically demonstrated in the past 24 hours can be even more deadly than a trained shooter.

Another Islamist terror attack against France in August 2015 which saw Moroccan national Sliman Hamzi open fire on a speeding Thalys train was brought to an abrupt end after his Ak-47 rifle jammed, allowing him to be overpowered by an off-duty American marine who happened to be on the train. Unlike the firearm — illegally acquired in France — the 7.5 tonne truck kept going for two trouble-free kilometers as it was driven through crowds of revellers celebrating France’s national day.

Reportedly armed with guns and grenades, Nice killer Mohamed Lahouaiej Boisvert was then ready to keep killing.

As Breitbart London reported in September 2014, the chief spokesman of the Islamic State called for such attacks, in a speech apparently inspired by the murder of British soldier Drummer Lee Rigby on the streets of London. He was run over by a car traveling at more than 40 miles per hour by Islamist killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale who then dismounted and attempted to behead him with knives.

Following the attack ISIS boss Abu Mohammed al Adnani said to followers in Europe and the United States: “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him”.

The call was similar to Al-Qaeda-linked English language magazine Inspire, which said in a 2010 edition “The idea is to use a pickup truck as a mowing machine, not to mow grass but mow down the enemies of Allah”. According to International Business Times, the magazine is read by 4,000 people in Britain every week.

Giving detailed instructions which seem to have been carried out to the letter in Europe, the article continued: “To achieve maximum carnage, you need to pick up as much speed as you can… be able to strike as many people as possible in your first run… the ideal location is a place where there are a maximum number of pedestrians and the least number of vehicles… if you have access to firearms, carry them with you so that you may use them to finish off your work if your vehicle gets grounded during the attack”.

The emphasised importance of speed was put into practice in the June 2015 car attack in Graz, Austria. Driving a 4×4 at speeds as high as 90 miles per hour up and down the provincial city’s main shopping street, before getting out of his smashed car and attacking bystanders with a “large knife”, Alen Rizvanović killed three including a four-year-old boy.

Although it was claimed at the time the attack had nothing to do with terrorism and that the driver was a Catholic with mental health issues, it later transpired he was a devout Muslim who went to Mosque six times a week, and followed dozens of Islamist pages on Facebook and Twitter. There is now concern in Austria that the killer could soon walk free because court-appointed psychiatrists deemed him to be mentally unwell, and therefore not liable for his actions.

The mayor of Graz, who was out shopping on the day of the attack is campaigning to have Rizvanović locked up for life.

While the Bataclan attacks in Paris killed more — some 137 French and tourists in the city — it was the work of nine men, compared to 84 deaths for one Islamist killer with a battering-ram truck. All counter-terror experience has shown these individuals gravitate towards what they would consider success which strongly suggests that vehicle attack stabbings — one of the hardest forms of mass-casualty attacks for security services to prevent — are here to stay.

After all, as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said today”Times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism”, so we’d better get used to it."
breitbart162,breitbart,['Wynton Hall'],2014-02-17 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/02/17/kerry-climate-change-world-s-most-fearsome-weapon-of-mass-destruction/,"Secretary of State John Kerry told Indonesians on Sunday that global warming is now “perhaps the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.”

“Think about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It doesn’t keep us safe if the United States secures its nuclear arsenal while other countries fail to prevent theirs from falling into the hands of terrorists,” Kerry told students at a high-tech U.S.-funded cultural center at a Jakarta mall.

Kerry added, “The bottom line is this: it is the same thing with climate change. In a sense, climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even the worlds most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.”

Kerry explained to the Indonesian students that climate change represents an existential threat to their very survival.

“Because of climate change, it’s no secret that today Indonesia is…one of the most vulnerable countries on Earth,” Kerry said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say that the entire way of life that you live and love is at risk.”

Kerry went on to deride scientists and citizens who challenge global warming’s scientific validity.

“We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,” said Kerry. “The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand. We don’t have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society.”

Kerry’s Indonesia speech was just one portion of his three-nation jet-setting tour of Asia."
breitbart163,breitbart,['John Nolte'],2013-09-17 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2013/09/17/ar-15-daily-news-cnn-already-blow-anti-gun-narrative/,"Tuesday’s New York Daily News cover story is nothing more than a long-form editorial that attempts to make the AR-15 (a semiautomatic sport rifle) the bad guy in Monday’s horrific Navy Yard shooting. Last night, CNN attempted to do the same through blowhard Piers Morgan. But there is just one problem: CNN and The Daily News are 100% wrong. The FBI has just confirmed that a shotgun and two pistols were recovered, and that the “gunman was NOT armed with [an] AR-15.”

Tuesday morning’s Daily News cover hysterically blared, “Same Gun Different Slay.”

Inside, Mike Lupica continued the blare:

This time the shooter is reported to be a Navy reservist named Aaron Alexis and when he is shot dead by law enforcement, taken out before he can put a gun to his own head the way Lanza did, he has his light, handy assault weapon with him, and a semiautomatic pistol, and a shotgun.

But even if the shooter had used a semiautomatic rifle (which we now know he didn’t), it would have been one he took from a security guard during the rampage. Maybe the Daily News didn’t get it wrong; maybe Lupica and company are so far over the edge that they are now calling for the American military to be disarmed?

Meanwhile, over at CNN, within hours of the shooting, the network allowed Piers Morgan to launch his own sanctimonious attack against the AR-15:

—

—

But just a few hours later, CNN had to walk it back. Buried in an article singling out the AR-15, CNN reported that an AR-15 was not found on the scene.

Apparently, sometime yesterday, the talking point went out that said that the anti-gun narrative coming out of the Navy Yard shootings would be to turn the AR-15 into this massacre’s convenient left-wing bogeyman — all in an effort to get it banned.

The left-wing, anti-science media blows it again by caring more about the agenda than the facts.

This is especially devastating for CNN, a cable network desperate to get off the floor after non-stop debacles involving the Boston Marathon bombing, being caught openly pushing for gun control, and all things George Zimmerman. Eventually, CNN has to see Piers Morgan as the low-rated liability he really is. Straight out of the gate, within hours of this massacre, CNN already is a punchline … again.

“Strong leaders don’t automatically agree with the last thing that was said to them. We have the Second and due process of low for a reason. We’re not ditching any Constitutional protections simply because the last person the President talked to today doesn’t like them.“

* * *

President Trump told a group of lawmakers that they must do something to keep guns away from mentally ill individuals – even if that means raising the minimum age for rifle ownership to 21, Bloomberg reports.

His remarks appeared to contradict a CNN report from earlier in the week, which quoted anonymous White House aides saying Trump would soon walk back his support for raising the age limit.

But on Wednesday, in what the New York Times characterized as a “shocking” break with his Republican Congressional allies, Trump told lawmakers during a televised meeting in the Cabinet Room that easing gun owners’ ability to carry concealed weapons across state lines, a provision of the House-passed gun bill and the NRA’s top legislative priority, should be part of a separate bill, a strategy favored by Democrats. The House bill combining background check provisions with the loosening of concealed carry rules has stalled in the Senate after passing the House. Instead, Trump said he supports the proposal from Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., which he says is best positioned to pass. Sen. Amy Klobuchar agreed that the Manchin-Toomey bill is a “good place to start.”

“It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everyone could support,” Mr. Trump said as Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, sat smiling to his left. “It’s time that a president stepped up.”

Per the Times, Trump repeatedly suggested that the dynamics surrounding the gun control debate had shifted, in part, because of his presence in the Oval Office – a remark that earned him cheers from Democrats.

WATCH: President Trump: ""I like taking the guns early … Take the guns first, go through due process second."" pic.twitter.com/aydEZdAGq0 — NBC News (@NBCNews) February 28, 2018

Trump predicted his plan would pass with broad support, suggesting that he plans to win over a sizable chunk of the Democratic caucus.

Trump told his audience that raising the ownership age is “something you have to think about,” Trump said. He added that “people don’t bring it up” because the NRA opposes the policy. Trump had initially claimed that he would convince the NRA to go along with it.

As the Hill pointed out, he also said he supports confiscating guns from mentally ill individuals, a position vociferously opposed by Republicans.

“I like taking the guns early like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida … to go to court would have taken a long time,” Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence. “Take the guns first, go through due process second,” Trump said.

He also said mentally ill people shouldn’t have guns.

“A lot of people are saying ‘oh you shouldn’t be saying that’,” Trump said. “But I don’t want mentally ill people having guns.”

To be sure, states don’t need to enact the exact same restrictions, Trump said. But “what does have to be the same is the background checks and all of the data.”

Per Reuters, Trump urged lawmakers to pass a comprehensive gun control bill as the national conversation surrounding gun control – a conversation that was triggered by a shooting at Marjory Douglas Tillman High School in Parkland Fla. The shooting left 14 students and 3 faculty dead, and more than a dozen injured.

Rebutting accusations that he is beholden to the NRA, Trump added that gun lovers have less power over him than lawmakers.

Earlier today, Dick’s Sporting Goods said it is “going to take a stand” and announced it would permanently ban sales of the AR-15 – the rifle used by Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz and several other mass shooters – from its stores.

The meeting with lawmakers was his fourth “free-flowing gun policy discussion” since the Valentine’s Day massacre in Florida, according to Reuters.

“We’re going to come up with some ideas,” Trump said. “Hopefully we can put those ideas in a very bipartisan bill. It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody can support, as opposed to – you know – 15 bills, everybody’s got their own bill.”

Seven senators and representatives were invited to Wednesday’s session. The group included Democrats and Republicans who, according to Reuters, have diverse views on gun control.

Republican Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who have proposed legislation to fix holes in the background check system for gun buyers, and their Democratic co-sponsors.

Trump also said he back Cornyn’s bill while urging senators to add more items to the bill to make it more comprehensive."
inforwars1,inforwars,['Paul Joseph Watson'],2018-02-26 06:28:36-05:00,https://www.infowars.com/google-searches-for-buy-a-gun-hit-all-time-high/,"Google searches for “buy a gun” have hit an all time high as interest in purchasing firearms dramatically increases in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting.

Expecting new restrictions on guns and ammunition, anecdotal evidence suggests the AR-15 semi-automatic weapon is becoming popular once again following a lull in interest after Trump’s election.

Google searches for “AR-15” are at their highest since just after the Sandy Hook massacre over five years ago.

However, the more generic term “buy a gun” just hit its highest level ever, with incomplete data suggesting it could be an even more popular query than it was just after Sandy Hook.

With the NRA facing a boycott campaign that has caused numerous major companies to sever connections, searches for “join NRA” are also spiking to levels not seen since December 2012.

The Google data correlates with interest in this weekend’s Florida State Fairgrounds gun show, which organizers say was attended by more people than ever before.

“Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights,” said Florida Gun Show manager George Fernandez, amidst fears that the so-called “gun show loophole,” which allows people to buy guns without a background check, will be closed.

Stoneman Douglas high school shooter Nikolas Cruz passed a background check before legally purchasing a semiautomatic AR-15 style rifle.

Gun sales typically spike after every mass shooting, but the data suggests that Americans are exercising their Second Amendment rights more vehemently than ever before in response to a media-driven campaign that is using Parkland survivors as cheerleaders for gun control.

In a Wednesday interview with Infowars, Martin discussed his experience encountering media who did not want to listen to his pro-gun views.

“I was at the vigil. I was taking pictures. This photographer came up to me, he’s like, ‘Oh, who you taking pictures for? You’re just doing that for pleasure?’ I was like, ‘We’re not doing it for pleasure, but I’m taking pictures. I’m going to send them to Infowars.’ He was like ‘Oh,’ and then he walked away immediately, like he knew that, ‘OK, these guys’ views aren’t the same.’”

Jalen remarked that “As soon as someone appears on Infowars or has an opposing view to the one viewpoint that they’re gonna express tonight [at the CNN townhall], which is gun control,” they are immediately shut out of the debate.

“I’m especially going to the CNN townhall. So hopefully if they don’t pre-screen questions like Donna Brazile and Hillary Clinton, then maybe i’ll get to ask some real questions, not something prepared on a note card.”

Not only has the media refused to interview Martin, his credibility was attacked by a Snopes managing editor after he appeared last week on the Alex Jones Show following the shooting. The editor claimed Martin could not possibly be a student at the school.

MSNBC’s Lyin’ Brian Williams also attempted to bait Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior Brandon Minoff into giving an anti-gun comment last week, but the student blamed mental health issues for the shooting instead.

“Gun-wise I don’t think there’s any way to prevent it,” Minoff told Williams. “You outlaw guns it just creates a higher demand for it.”

“I think it has to do with mental health, though,” he added. “If he’s been expelled three different times from three different schools, I think he needs to be helped out.”

A 17-year-old Junior ROTC member, Colton Haab, was also given very little airtime after claiming his coach could have prevented further bloodshed if only he’d been armed.

“I believe that if we did bring firearms on campus to teachers that are willing to carry their firearm on school campus if they got their correct training for it, I think that would be a big beneficial factor into school safety,” Haab said, adding, “just because, I mean if Coach Feis had had his firearm in school that day I believe that he could have most likely stopped the threat.”

Haab later ended up giving the fake news media a run for their money Wednesday after claiming he was given scripted questions by CNN to ask during a Town Hall debate hosted by the network.

“CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions, and it ended up being all scripted,” Haab told Local 10 News Wednesday night.

Local10.com reports: “Haab wrote questions about school safety and suggested using veterans as security guards, but he claims CNN wanted him to ask scripted questions instead.”

CNN was forced to issue a statement refuting Haab’s claims.

While an objective media should be offering different perspectives and letting their audiences form their own opinions, the MSM’s selective promotion of a few students with certain viewpoints exposes their bias and subversive anti-Second Amendment agenda.

As journalist Matt Drudge commented Sunday, the media’s manipulation of people “has reached absurd levels.”

Axios reports that Trump has “told associates that he doesn’t think high school kids should be able to buy guns, and is open to the idea of imposing a minimum purchase age of 21 for guns like those used in the Florida high school massacre.”

While the report states that the talk is “relatively loose and open-ended so far,” and that no firm decisions have been made, the President tweeted out the following call for politicians on both sides of the aisle to back stronger background checks for gun owners:

Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2018

The White House also released a memo Tuesday that indicates Trump has directed the Justice Department to draw up legislation to ban firearm modifiers including the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas massacre.

Trump wrote in the memo, “Although the Obama administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns.”

Fox News reports that a DOJ official has confirmed that the department is acting “quickly” on the president’s order.

“The department understands this is a priority for the president and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process,” spokesman Sarah Isgur Flores said. “We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed.”

The Washington Post has also reported that Trump has “signaled an openness to modest gun-control measures following what he called an ‘evil massacre’” in Florida.

“In private, he has indicated that he might do more,” the report states, “telling advisers and friends in recent days that he is determined to push for some sort of gun-control legislation.”

Some reports have suggested that Trump may look to impose a ban on the sale of firearms in private."

The non-profit RAND corporation spent two years and $1 million on the analysis, searching for evidence of benefit from gun control policies. RAND’s analysis looked to establish connections between gun policies and rates of homicide, suicide, self-defense gun use, hunting, and other categories. The vast majority of those categories went unaffected by legislation, however, according to NPR.

“Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn’t find any evidence,” Andrew Morral, who lead the analysis.

RAND’s analysis found some evidence that laws aimed at keeping firearms out of the hands of small children had some effect on rates of suicide and accidental gun injuries. Morral also surveyed 95 gun policy experts on both sides of the debate, asking them to rank the ideal outcomes of any given gun control legislation. The outcomes included lowering homicides, suicides, and mass shootings as well as protecting privacy, and enabling hunting and sport shooting. The vast majority of the expert responded that cutting suicides and homicides should be the top priorities.

As a survivor of the shooting, the media has pounced on Hogg and used him as a mouthpiece to push for gun control, demonizing anyone who questions Hogg as being insensitive to the victims of the tragedy.

However, Hogg is now a public figure and an activist. He is not immune from criticism. Nor should criticism of him be used as an excuse to curtail the First Amendment, as is happening with CNN lobbying YouTube to ban Infowars.

Infowars has invited Hogg on the Alex Jones Show to clear the air and we hope to see this happen as soon as possible.

CBS Los Angeles featured Hogg as the eyewitness and videographer of a testy encounter between Hogg, a veteran Redondo Beach, Calif., lifeguard and a surfer, who was reportedly Hogg’s friend, in August of 2017.

Hogg claimed the lifeguard accosted his surfer friend over the issue of resting a sandy bodyboard on a beach trash can.

Interestingly, Hogg has reconnected with CBS for an appearance on CBS This Morning as the mainstream media unabashedly features high school students as figureheads for a new anti-gun push.

A CBS employee posted a photo of Hogg with fellow teen activists and CBS reporter Gisela Perez, which was later taken down after Kristinn Taylor of The Gateway Pundit reported on the photo shoot and how strange it seemed that all parties looked so cheerful and enthusiastic in the wake of such a tragedy.

Hogg has become an overnight celebrity, appearing on international media outlets and television shows, vehemently calling for strict gun control, regularly slamming President Trump, and defending the FBI – of which his father is a retired agent, which many have found to be a peculiar coincidence as the FBI has come under fire for not preventing the Parkland massacre despite being warned about suspected killer Nikolas Cruz repeatedly beforehand.

“The retired FBI dad is very significant,” asserts former Navy SEAL and commentator, Matt Bracken. “The FBI has been hiring SJW’s for years. It’s not just the 7th Floor of FBI HQ. It’s endemic.”

February 15, 2009

Illinois — the land of Obama and the Blagojevich mafia — is serious about making the Second Amendment so expensive only the rich will be able to exercise it. Kenneth Dunkin, a former social worker and Democrat member of the Illinois House of Representatives, has introduced HB0687, entitled the “Firearm Owners ID-Insurance” bill. It is currently in the Rules Committee.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t



Dunkin’s bill amends the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act, a previous bill aimed at chipping away at the Second Amendment. Dunkin’s amendment states “that any person who owns a firearm in this State shall maintain a policy of liability insurance in the amount of at least $1,000,000 specifically covering any damages resulting from negligent or willful acts involving the use of such firearm while it is owned by such person.”

A million dollars!

Can you imagine the premium on such an insurance policy? It would be astronomical and out of the reach of most people in Illinois.

If the firearm owner cannot afford the insurance or decides that it is simply crazy and also unconstitutional and refuses to participate, “the Department of State Police shall revoke and seize a Firearm Owner’s Identification Card,” thus making the the firearm illegal and the owner a criminal.

If Dunkin’s bill makes it out of committee and is passed by the Illinois General Assembly, a whole lot of people will have their firearms confiscated by the State Police."

July 2, 2013

New gun laws enacted in Colorado yesterday have crippled some gun and pawn shops.

The state once considered part of the Wild West is now reduced to imposing universal background checks on gun purchases and is also banned from selling ammunition magazines that hold over 15 rounds.

New gun laws followed in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school last December in Newtown, Conn. where 20 children and 6 adults were killed. Although the story has been widely publicized and city governments nationwide have even implemented legislation based on this event alone, many questions remain unanswered about the gruesome killings.

The most important question left unanswered is why? Why did Adam Lanza suddenly slay 20 school children at a school that he himself once attended? When tragedies like this occur, usually the public is interested in getting inside the mind of the killer and finding out why. But in this case more questions were left unanswered than information was provided.

Blogs and alternative media websites questioned what type of mental state Adam Lanza was in, asking what prescription drugs, if any, he was on.

The establishment media sidestepped these questions completely, and it was never made public what prescription drugs Lanza was on.

Despite loads of unanswered questions, the mainstream media waged a war against AR-15s demanding they be abolished and even managed to inflict hoplophobia, the fear on firearms, on the entire country.

Since then, all sorts of gun laws have been proposed including gun taxes, mandated firearm insurance, universal background checks, mandatory gun-registration, magazine restrictions and even all-out bans on particular firearms.

While the US government is the world’s largest firearms distributor, they are now adamant to stop private gun companies from selling certain firearms and magazines.

Colorado is the most recent state to be hit with new gun laws. Rod Brandenburg, the owner of Grandpa’s Pawn and Gun, says the new law “bars him from returning such magazines to the customers who show up at his shop to repay the principal and interest on the loans they got,” according to local Colorado newspaper.

Last Saturday Brandenburg said his business had “between 50 and 100 ammunition magazines that will be in violation of the 15-round limit.”

Brandenburg was able to call customers in advance of the new law and warn them that they needed to come pick up their magazines and bring something else to pawn before the law went into effect on Monday. However, many customers were not able to retrieve them in time.

The owner told the local newspaper that “the new law is forcing him to violate the contract between him and his customers”, adding that he’s meeting with his local sheriff on Tuesday for “advice on what to do.”

Gander Mountain, a Colorado sporting goods store that previously sold so called high-capacity magazines prior to the law going into effect, told Infowars.com how the new laws were affecting them. “We are currently waiting to hear from the corporate office on what to do with the left over stock of high-capacity magazines. We will most likely ship them out to states that don’t have the same firearm restrictions.”

It seems silly to ban the magazines in one state just to have them shipped out and sold in another state. But fortunately for the franchises, they have the option of transferring their merchandise to another store, but what about the mom and pop shops?

Lamont Norris, an employee at Pawn Bank in Englewood, Co., told Infowars.com there’s absolutely nothing they can do with their high-capacity magazines, and as of now they’re just sitting idly on the shelves. Norris also said, “It is illegal to release them, so as of now we have no plans on what to do with them.”

The Colorado State Patrol Office, the entity who’s supposed to be in charge of answering questions regarding the new law, said they don’t have any information or instructions to offer businesses that are stuck with these now illegal magazines.

In fact the Colorado State Patrol office couldn’t even provide direction on who to contact regarding this issue.

Even some Colorado sheriffs are against the new gun restrictions. Last Saturday at a rally protesting the new laws, Weld County Sheriff John Cooke told thousands of participants that “he didn’t intend to enforce the new laws because they’re unenforceable.”

According to the Daily Caller, Cooke and 54 other elected sheriffs are suing the state in an attempt to overturn the new law. In a July 10th hearing, the plaintiffs will request a suspension on the law until the lawsuit is settled."
inforwars12,inforwars,['Kit Daniels'],2016-05-24 12:49:43-05:00,https://www.infowars.com/hawaii-considers-gun-owner-registry-for-firearm-confiscations/,"Hawaii wants to become the first state to register gun owners into a federal database – and expects other states to follow its lead, despite the Second Amendment.

Under a bill proposed by Sen. Will Espero, Hawaii would enter gun owners into an FBI database available to local police.

The FBI already has a similar database for people in “positions in trust,” such as school teachers and other public officials, but Hawaii would be the first to enter gun owners into a database.

“I don’t like the idea of us being entered into a database,” firearm instructor Jerry Ilo told AP. “It basically tells us that they know where the guns are, they can go grab them.”

“We get the feeling that Big Brother is watching us.”

His fear is not unfounded; New York City already had a similar registry in place which was used by police to confiscate firearms.

After N.Y. passed the SAFE Act in 2013, the NYPD sent out notices to registered gun owners demanding they give up their guns.

The notice ordered gun owners, who possessed firearms now prohibited under SAFE Act, the “options” to either surrender their firearms to the police, remove them from the city limits or otherwise render them inoperable.

That’s exactly what Hawaii’s authoritarian lawmakers want, but their proposed registry faces significant legal challenges.

“You’re curtailing that right by requiring that a name be entered into a database without doing anything wrong,” said Kenneth Lawson, faculty at the University of Hawaii’s William S. Richardson School of Law.

The NRA called the proposal “extremely dangerous.”

“Exercising a constitutional right is not inherently suspicious,” said the NRA’s Amy Hunter. “Hawaii will now be treating firearms as suspect and subject to constant monitoring.”

The billionaire investor is in a strong position to make such a call: He’s one of the leading financiers of the gun control movement, and the fund he leads recently owned a piece of the firearms industry.

On Thursday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros expressed interest in the divestment idea. Asked by International Business Times if investors who support gun control should sell their holdings in firearms companies, Soros responded: “I’m very much against guns. And if it can be organized on a large enough scale, I wouldn’t be opposed to it.”

Securities and Exchange Commission filings reviewed by IBT show Soros Fund Management as a top institutional shareholder in Vista Outdoors — considered the country’s top ammunition manufacturer — and Olin Corp., which makes ammo under the Winchester name. Soros Fund Management purchased a stake in Vista in early 2015 and possessed $11.4 million worth of shares in the company at the end of September, the most recent time the firm reported its holdings. Soros’ firm appears to have bought $5.2 million worth of Olin shares between July and September.

CNN downplayed the ISIS-style Parliament attack as a “firearms incident” despite UK media reporting it as a combined knife and car attack.

The network published an article with the headline “UK police investigate ‘firearms incident’ near parliament” around 11:30AM EST.

“London’s Metropolitan Police said on Twitter they were called at approximately 2:40 pm to reports of an incident near Westminster Bridge and that it was being treated as a firearms incident,” CNN said. “TV images have emerged of a car crashed into a fence outside the Parliament building.”

CNN did admit a police officer was stabbed in the “firearms incident,” but the article was light on details.

In comparison, both the Sun and the Daily Mail said a knifeman was shot outside the UK Parliament right after he mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, an attack which copies the methods used by jihadis during recent terror attacks.

And the Drudge Report had the following main headline as the CNN piece was going up:

“We heard a loud bang, lots of shouting and men running around. Someone rushed through, attacked a policeman,” a witness told The Sun. “He appeared to be carrying a knife or a gun. We then heard gunfire, five or six rounds.”

“The man approaching one of the police officers with a knife.”

As of this writing, police have not identified the suspect, although reports circulating on social media suggest the suspect was Middle Eastern.

Additionally, the two methods of the attack – a knife and a vehicle – mimick recent terror attacks in the West.

In November, a Somali refugee attacked at least nine people with a knife at Ohio State University.

“A high-ranking faculty member who spoke to NBC 4 Columbus said that one of his colleagues was in Watts Hall at the time and was slashed in the leg with a machete,” reported the Daily Mail on Nov. 28. “…The attack then got out of the car and started stabbing and slashing victims, a witness said.”

More recently, in Germany, one person was killed and three were injured by a knife-welding jihadi who shouted “Allahu Akbar” at a train station near Munich.

A similar attack happened on a train between Würzburg and Treuchtlingen.

“A German official described the footage of the teenage suspect in the German train stabbings as a ‘classical farewell video’ of a suicide attacker that indicates he was inspired by ISIS,” CNN reported. “Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the 17-year-old also left a goodbye letter saying he prayed that he could take revenge on all infidels.”

And let’s not forget the lorry attacks in Berlin and Nice, France, in which dozens of people were mowed down by jihadi drivers encouraged by ISIS to use trucks to kill “infidels.”

The Parliament is located in London, which has attracted so many Muslim migrants over the past several years that the city is now called “Londonistan.”

Even the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is a Muslim.

The new push for gun control from the left comes courtesy of ABC News which recently published a piece promoting the use of an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) that many believe is nothing more than a thinly veiled confiscation plan that would allow a judge to “issue an ex parte order” for the direct confiscation of an American citizens firearms.

Unbelievably, the order can actually be issued without the firearm owner even being present, which would in turn end with police at the citizens door demanding he hand over his weapons or face violence from the state.

ABC’s Andy Fies, on the other hand, apparently wants Americans to see the orders differently, painting a more friendly picture of the ERPO’s while quoting two different left-wing gun control groups as seemingly unbiased experts on gun violence.

As of now, only Washington, California, Connecticut and most recently Oregon have ERPO laws (while Indiana and Texas have modified risk warrant statutes). Over the past year, however, spurred by a string of mass shootings beginning with the Pulse Nightclub attack that killed 49 in June 2016, legislatures in 19 states and Washington, D.C., have taken up 32 separate ERPO bills for consideration, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that advocates for gun control.

Everytown’s deputy legal director, William Rosen, told ABC News that list will grow. “We expect to see at least as much interest in 2018,” he said.

“There is a growing consensus,” added Lauren Alfred of the gun violence prevention group Sandy Hook Promise, “that this is the first step we should be taking when we are talking about people who are at risk of hurting themselves or others.”

Current laws barring gun ownership are limited. Generally, a person with a long history of mental health issues can still legally buy or possess firearms if they don’t fall into specific statutory categories such as having been adjudicated mentally ill or under a domestic violence restraining order. But, as was the case with Texas church gunman Devin Kelley, even these restrictions may not work if the person’s troubled past is not recorded on a background registry.

With an ERPO, however, if family members or police can show a gun owner to be an imminent danger to themselves or others, they can force the person to surrender their weapon(s).

Keep in mind that Everytown for Gun Safety is a Michael Bloomberg funded, left-wing gun control group that was created as part of a rebranding effort by the billionaire gun grabber after his previous group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, was outed by multiple former members as actually pushing an agenda of full-scale gun confiscation.

The Extreme Risk Protection Orders scheme seems to be nothing more than another attempt at slowly eroding the right of lawful Americans to own firearms.

As AWR Hawkins reported in an April 2017 article about a similar law being pushed in Oregon, “Oregon state Sen. Brian Boquist (R-Dallas) is pushing a confiscation bill that would broaden the number of prohibited gun purchasers as well as require certain individuals to hand over any guns in their possession.”

At the time, gun rights activist and NRA member Keely Hopkins rightfully described the law as an attempt to remove your Second Amendment rights by using a third-party who would need little evidence to declare you unfit to own a firearm. (Imagine a vengeful ex-wife/husband)

“This bill allows for a protective order to remove your Second Amendment rights, not because of a criminal conviction, but based on third-party allegations using an evidentiary standard that falls far below what’s normally required for the removing of fundamental rights.”

It is also important to note that gun control advocates and the mainstream media are using The Las Vegas Massacre, which the authorities are openly lying about (there were at least 7 different shooters) as a pretext to further take away Americans right to bear arms.

Rep. David Cicilline, (D-R.I.), announced Monday he is introducing the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. Over 150 Democrats have signed on in support of the legislation, according to Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL).

“Today I joined @RepCicilline and 150+ of my colleagues to introduce the assault weapons ban. It’s time for Congress to listen to the will of a majority of Americans and pass sensible legislation to get these weapons of war off our streets. #NeverAgain #MSDStrong,” Deutch tweeted.

Ted Deutch (@RepTedDeutch) February 26, 2018

The legislation would make it “unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon.”

The bill also lists over 205 different kinds of rifles and handguns that would be banned, including the AR-15 and AK-47.

“In addition to rifles, this bill would ban virtually every self-defense handgun sold in the U.S. – but the anti-gunners swear they aren’t trying to ban guns…” the NRA tweeted on Tuesday.

The mainstream media has been calling for an outright repeal of the Second Amendment since the shooting, including The New York Times, MSNBC, and NPR.

However, President Trump has indicated that he would veto such a bill.

“He campaigned for president and was opposed to the assault weapons ban, and his position hasn’t changed on that,” White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said last week.

“What we are looking for are solutions that don’t ban a class of firearms for all individuals but ban all weapons for certain individuals who are identified as threats to public safety.”

Trump also said Democrats are just playing politics, as they weren’t able to pass any kind of gun control legislation when they had majorities in the House and Senate during Obama’s term.

“Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!” he tweeted last week.

The Orlando Mayor says he used an assault rifle, while Florida Congressman Alan Grayson adds that he believes the attack is “more likely than not” ideologically motivated.

CBS added that the FBI is currently checking if he was linked to extremists.

According to BBC, Mateen was not on any terrorism watch list, although as CBS also adds Islamic terrorism is being investigated as one of the possible motives behind the mass shooting.

CNN adds that the suspected Orlando gunman was trained in use of weapons.

Yesterday it was revealed that the ATF intends to ban sales of the ammunition, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

Gun stores immediately reported that people were panic buying cases of the bullets, with Ryan Cook, manager of Eagle Armory in Springfield, noting that suppliers were telling him “there was none available to order”.

It appears as though some Walmart stores are also beginning to sell out of the same ammunition.

Alex Jones Show listener Monte Bosak contacted us to relate how his local Walmart in Anchorage, AK went from having “way too much” of the ammo in question two weeks ago, according to the store clerk, to completely selling out after yesterday’s announcement.

“Two weeks ago, I purchased a thousand rounds of XM855 62 grain green tip ammo at this exact Walmart location for $350,” writes Bosak. “While purchasing, I spoke to the lady who works the gun counter and asked her if she had been selling a lot of it. $350/1k rounds is extremely cheap. She said no they hadn’t been selling much of it, and that they had many pallets in the back… “way too much” as she put it.”

“So that leads us to today (2/26/15) when the Drudge Report broke the story of the impending executive order to ban this specific ammunition. Naturally, I went straight to this Walmart after work to purchase what I could, only to find out that they had “sold out”. I spoke to the same lady behind the counter, and I spoke to a manager. Neither of which could look me square in the eye while telling me they sold out,” adds Bosak, who suspects that Walmart may even have deliberately “pulled their stock of the ammunition.”

“There’s no way possible in my mind that they sold all that ammunition,” writes Bosak.

Walmart has previously faced accusations that it has restricted ammunition sales in accordance with the Obama administration’s gun control agenda, but has denied them every time.

Shortly after the Sandy Hook massacre, reports circulated that the retail giant had stopped ordering ammunition and would not be making more sales in anticipation of expected curbs on the second amendment. Other customers reported that they were told Walmart would not stock ammunition for assault rifles, only for shotguns.

Following a surge of demand, in January 2013 Walmart restricted sales of ammunition to three boxes per customer, per day.

“To the extent the January 2015 Open Letter implied or has been construed to hold that incidental, sporadic, or situational ‘use’ of an arm-brace (in its original approved configuration) equipped firearm from a firing position at or near the shoulder was sufficient to constitute ‘redesign,’ such interpretations are incorrect and not consistent with the ATF’s interpretation of the statute or the manner in which it has historically been enforced,” ATF assistant director Marvin Richardson wrote in an official letter.

The ATF’s opinion deals with a complicated part of the National Firearms Act of 1934. That federal law sets standards for which firearms are subject to a special tax and registration with the federal government. One type of firearm regulated under the act are short-barrel rifles, which have rifled barrels under 16 inches in length and are designed to be fired with the stock of the firearm pressed against the shooter’s shoulder.

A video posted by Official Bouchards Milwaukee (@bouchards1) on Jul 23, 2015 at 9:59pm PDT

Rami Murrar, owner of Milwaukee-based Bouchards Clothing Store, posted video of the encounter to the company’s Instagram account Thursday with a stark warning to any other potential burglars.

“Just to set the record straight, we go to work to make our living and to feed our families, not to have shootouts,” Murrar wrote. “Don’t come to our establishment with guns or try breaking in our stores and expect less than us defending ourselves, and if this is what it’s gonna take then let it be, we will protect our business and employees at any cost.”

According to Murrar, who was armed with an AR-15 rifle, one suspect was shot after the would-be robbers attempted to crash a stolen van through Bouchards’ front door.

Detailing the “dumb criminals” mistakes in the video description, Murrar confirmed that at least one of the men were arrested following the incident.

This video also shows the perfect example of dumb criminals. these are the steps:

1- Steal a van.

2- Crash the stolen van into a store and make all of that loud noise when it’s quiet at night.

3- Don’t expect anyone to be monitoring or securing they’re small business.

4- GET SHOT.

5- GET ARRESTED.

6- Leave with nothing.

At the end of the day it’s just some clothes it’s not worth anyone’s life.

An alleged friend of Murrar commenting on Facebook stated that the business had previously been hit by criminals multiple times, prompting Murrar to finally take steps to defend his livelihood.

“He’s had enough. Time to start blasting back at those scumbags!”

Murrar says if it weren’t for his firearm, he may very well may have lost his life once the suspects made their way inside.

Natural News

Jan 14, 2013



Here at Natural News, we have a reputation for asking intelligent questions about things that don’t add up. There are a lot of mysteries out there, and they deserve to be explored and questioned: Why is there still mercury in vaccines? Why did the WTC 7 building implode and fall when no airplane hit it? If the government can create money from nothing, why are we still paying taxes?

And today, I’m adding to that list this commonsense question: Why has no surveillance footage been released from the Sandy Hook shooting, showing Adam Lanza blasting away with an AR-15?

Here’s why the non-release of this video footage is so interesting:

Every time a school shooting takes place, one of the very first things that gets released to the media is the school surveillance footage depicting the gun and the shooter. The purpose of this is to associate the pain and anguish of the massacre to the image of a scary-looking rifle.

In mere days after the Columbine shooting in 1998, for example, the media received footage from the massacre and began playing it over and over again, hammering home the images of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold with their guns. The same is true with numerous other school shootings as you’ll see below.

But with the Sandy Hook school shooting, no video footage has been released. A reasonable person has to ask the question: WHY?

You see, the release of footage of Adam Lanza murdering children with an AR-15 — if such a thing even happened — would strongly support the mainstream media’s call for banning so-called “assault rifles.” It would also:

• Amp up the emotional impact of the fear mongering being carried out by the media.

• Provide visual support for the gun-grabber’s plea to ban all rifles.

• Provide a wealth of images to be used by newspapers and magazines to further demonize the image of rifles.

… and yet, for some reason, we see no surveillance footage from Sandy Hook.

Why is that?

Answer: The AR-15 appears to have been left in his car and never even used in the shooting

The real answer to all this — and this reveals the “Big Lie” of the mainstream media — is that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was left in Lanza’s car.

It was never brought into the school in the first place. As a result, it was not used in the shooting.

This was openly admitted in an NBC news report that has since been scrubbed and marginalized. But NaturalNews captured the video and posted it on our own private video network which is immune from censorship:

Click here to watch the NBC News video yourself.

Here’s a partial transcript of the video:

Matt Lauer: Pete Williams, our chief justice correspondent, has got some new information as well, good morning.

Pete Williams: Matt, good morning to you. This continues to be a very complex investigation, and there is a lot of contradictory information out there, but there is some new information this morning from a couple of federal officials and state officials. They say now that there were actually four handguns recovered inside the school. Not just two as we were initially told. Four handguns and apparently only handguns that were taken into the school.

We knew that Adam Lanza… also had an assault-style, AR-15 style rifle that he had taken to the school that was in the car he drove there, his mother’s car. But we’ve been told by several officials that he left that in the car.

Adam Lanza left the AR-15 in the car

This simple fact, which was confirmed by “federal officials and state officials” has been completely scrubbed out of the mainstream media, and replaced with the “assault weapon lone gunman” theory that just happens to fit nicely with the citizen disarmament agenda being pushed by anti-American traitors like Dianne Feinstein and Joe Biden.

This is why no video footage has been released. Because the real video footage almost certainly shows HANDGUNS used in the massacre, not a rifle. There may even be other elements in the video footage that they don’t want the public to see, including the possibility of multiple shooters.

But take a look at the images and video footage we normally see from other shootings:

Zero Day shooting on May 1, 2001

In all those shootings (and many more), video footage and still images are quickly released to the media for the purpose of blasting these images into the minds of viewers everywhere. Video is played over and over again in the media with the hopes that people will be driven into a state of total irrational fear. It’s also, of course, a good way to cause copycat massacres which result in even more news ratings.

And yet with Sandy Hook, we see no video footage at all. Why is that?

Three possible explanations

Explanation #1) They are busy doctoring the video footage to insert an AR-15 into the video frame by frame. The technology to do this has existed for many years as we all saw with the movie Forrest Gump, where actor Tom Hanks was shown shaking the hand of JFK. You can see that at the :48 mark of this YouTube video.

Explanation #2) No video footage was ever taken by the school. This is absurd, as it’s already on the record that the Sandy Hook school had installed a video security system to monitor anyone entering or leaving the school. In fact, it’s even more interesting than that: this school security policy letter was sent to parents at the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year, and it clearly states:

…the office staff will use a visual monitoring system to allow entry. Doors will be locked at approximately 9:30 a.m. Any student arriving after that time must be walked into the building and signed in at the office…

It’s quite clear that if a student approached the school carrying an AR-15 rifle, he would not have been allowed entry! The only way he could have entered the school with the security system in place was to hide handguns under his clothes. You cannot hide an AR-15 rifle in a pocket, obviously.

Explanation #3) The video footage has been seized by the government and “archived” along with the footage of the missile that struck the Pentagon during the 9/11 attacks. Where is all that video footage? It was all seized and completely hidden from public view.

To be considered “armor piercing” under 18 U.S.C. 921 (a)(17)(B), a bullet must have an entirely metal core or have a jacket weighing more than 25% of its weight, which wouldn’t include M855 rounds because their bullets are partly lead.

The definition in full:

(17) (A) The term “ammunition” means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellent powder designed for use in any firearm. (B) The term “armor piercing ammunition” means- (i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or (ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile. (C) The term “armor piercing ammunition” does not include shotgun shot required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Attorney General finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device.

For years the ATF exempted the M855 from its list of “armor piercing” rounds, but its clear from the statue it never needed an exemption because legally it’s not an “armor piercing” round.

But the law hasn’t stopped the ATF from banning M855 ammo, which is popularly used by AR-15 owners for target shooting due to its relatively cheap cost and availability.

“Now [the ATF] says that since the [M855] bullets can be used in semi-automatic handguns they pose a threat to police and must be banned from production, sale and use,” Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner reported.

Earlier this week, the ATF announced its intention to ban sales of the ammunition, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

The news prompted panic buying, with numerous gun stores reporting a rush of demand for the ammunition.

According to Travis Brunson, owner of Guns on 41 in Ft. Myers, Florida, he is getting calls from customers asking, “whether this ammunition is gonna be banned, how much can I get and what’s happening to the price.”

“We probably sold 2,000 rounds today, where normally we might sell 100, 200,” Brunson told Fox 4. The price of the bullets is also starting to rise.

It’s a similar story at Fowler Firearms, where manager Jon Dezendorf said he began receiving calls about the ammunition shortly after the ATF made its announcement.

Steve Ellis, owner of Top Guns in Terre Haute, Indiana, told WTHI that supplies were dwindling.

“Everyone is selling out of ammunition, distributors are out, manufacturers are out, most dealers are out,” said Ellis.

It was also reported that a Walmart in Anchorage, AK went from having plentiful supplies of the bullets to none whatsoever.

Meanwhile, Ryan Cook, manager of Eagle Armory in Springfield, said that suppliers were telling him “there was none available to order”.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte asserts that the proposed ban is a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act and has vowed to fight the measure in court.

Congressman Tom Rooney has also introduced a bill which will shoot down the ban, with Rooney charging that the measure infringes upon the second amendment.

The key to winning World War III will be to strike hard and to strike fast, and the Russians understand this. Meanwhile, the U.S. military has totally shifted gears from a “Cold War mindset” and is now completely focused on fighting smaller regional wars in the Middle East and elsewhere. As a result, U.S. strategic forces have suffered. There has been very little effort to modernize, and many of our nuclear missile silos are using technology that is ridiculously outdated. For example, CBS News has documented that eight inch floppy disks are still being used in many of our missile silos. And don’t expect things to change any time soon. At this point, the U.S. military plans to keep Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles that were originally deployed in the 1960s and 1970s in service until 2030.

What all of this means is that the Russians are feverishly preparing to fight World War III and we are not. The following are just a few of the next-generation weapons that Russia will use against the United States during the next great global war…

The Sarmat Intercontinental Ballistic Missile

Most Americans have heard of the infamous SS-18 “Satan” intercontinental ballistic missiles. But these are now being replaced by the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile…

The Sarmat (also known as Sarmatian) is a Russian liquid-fueled, MIRV-equipped, super-heavy thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missile in development as of early 2015, intended to replace the previous SS-18 Satan and carry extensive counter-missile defense measures. Its large payload would allow for up to 10 heavy warheads or 15 lighter ones, and/or a combination of warheads and massive amounts of countermeasures designed to defeat the anti-missile systems. The Sarmat is expected to be ready for deployment around 2020, but other sources state that the program is being fast-tracked and it could comprise up to 80 percent of Russia’s land-based nuclear arsenal by 2021.

As you can see below, these missiles are extremely huge…

The Borey Class Nuclear Submarine

Of even greater concern than the Sarmat are the new Borey class nuclear submarines that Russia is building. The following is from an article about the launch of one of these new submarines, the Vladimir Monomakh, in 2013…

Russia recently launched its near silent nuclear submarine following several years of development. The Borey Class submarine, dubbed Vladimir Monomakh, has a next generation nuclear reactor, can dive deeper than 1,200 feet, and carries up to 20 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). Each of these “Bulava” ICBM’s can carry ten detachable MIRV warheads, what they call “re-entry vehicles,” capable of delivering 150 kiloton yields per warhead (luckily, tests of the warheads only yielded 11 “successes” out of almost 20 attempts). Which doesn’t mean they aren’t a concern, MIRV’s are what shook the Cold War to its foundation when they first appeared in the 1970s.

One of the primary things that has U.S. military planners worried is how quiet these subs are. In fact, according to an RT article these subs are supposed to be “almost silent”…

It belongs to a class of missile strategic submarine cruisers with a new generation of nuclear reactor, which allows the submarine to dive to a depth of 480 meters. It can spend up to three months in autonomous navigation and, thanks to the latest achievements in the reduction of noise, it is almost silent compared to previous generations of submarines.

So why is that a problem?

Well, imagine a scenario where Russian nuclear subs approach our coastlines completely undetected and launch a barrage of missiles toward our cities and military bases. We could be wiped out before we even knew what hit us.

If you don’t think that this could ever happen, just consider the following excerpt from a Fox News article published back in 2012…

A Russian nuclear-powered attack submarine armed with long-range cruise missiles operated undetected in the Gulf of Mexico for several weeks and its travel in strategic U.S. waters was only confirmed after it left the region, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. It is only the second time since 2009 that a Russian attack submarine has patrolled so close to U.S. shores.

If we can’t detect them, how are we going to defend against them? Here is a look at one of them in the water…

The Bulava Submarine-Launched Nuclear Missile

The Borey class submarines are going to be carrying Bulava submarine-launched nuclear missiles. The Russians have had some difficulties with the development of these missiles, but most of those difficulties now appear to be ironed out. The following is a description of these missiles from globalsecurity.org…

The Bulava (SS-NX-30) is the submarine-launched version of Russia’s most advanced missile, the Topol-M (SS-27) solid fuel ICBM. The SS-NX-30 is a derivative of the SS-27, except for a slight decrease in range due to conversion of the design for submarine launch. The SS-27 has is 21.9 meters long, far too large to fit in a typical submarine. The largest previously deployed Russian SLBM was the R-39 / SS-N-20 STURGEON, which was 16 meters long. Russian sources report that the Bulava SS-N-30 ballistic missile can carry ten warheads to a range of 8,000km. Other sources suggest that the Bulava might have a range of 10,000 km, and is reportedly features a 550 kT yield nuclear warhead. Apparently up to six MIRVs can be placed at the cost of offloading warhead shielding and decoys.

The Bulava is specifically designed to avoid interception, and each warhead is independently maneuverable to help ensure that they reach their targets intact. The following was written by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Tom Spahn…

Similar to its land-based variant, the Topol-M SS-27, to thwart evolving Western ballistic-missile-defense shields, the Bulava can conduct evasive post-launch maneuvers and deploy a variety of countermeasures and decoys to defend against interception. Its ten hypersonic, independently maneuverable warheads are protected against both physical and electromagnetic-pulse damage to ensure that they can reach their targets intact.

The Barguzin Strategic Missile Train

When nuclear missiles are in a stationary location (such as a missile silo), they can be pretty easy to target. But if you put them on a mobile platform, you can gain quite a strategic edge.

With that in mind, the Russians have reintroduced the strategic missile train…

A Russian military source outlined the capabilities of Barguzin strategic missile train. The country may roll out five such disguised mobile launch platforms each carrying six RS-24 Yars missiles in five years. A ‘nuclear train’ – properly called BZhRK, short for ‘combat railway missile complex’ in Russian – is a mobile platform for transporting and launching strategic nuclear missiles. Similarly to nuclear submarines, such trains are hard to wipe out in a preemptive strike because of their mobility and ability to be disguised as regular freight trains. The Soviet Union had 12 such nuclear trains, each carrying three RT-23 Molodets (SS-24 Scalpel in NATO disambiguation) missiles, but they were released from combat duty after Russia and the US signed the START-2 treaty in 1993 and eventually decommissioned. Last year the Russian military said that nuclear trains – which are no longer banned under the New START treaty – would be revived.

The S-500 Missile Defense System

Lastly, I want to discuss a very important weapons system that I recently mentioned in another article.

It is called the S-500 missile defense system, and it fundamentally changes the balance of power between the United States and Russia.

Once fully deployed, the S-500 will be able to intercept our intercontinental ballistic missiles. This means that the concept of “mutually assured destruction” does not necessarily apply any longer. If the Russians can take out most of our nukes with a devastating surprise first strike and intercept whatever we are able to launch back at them with the S-500, the cost/benefit analysis of a nuclear conflict completely changes.

The following information about the S-500 comes from military-today.com…

The S-500 is not an upgrade of the S-400, but a new design. It uses a lot of new technology and is superior to the S-400. It was designed to intercept ballistic missiles. It is planned to have a range of 500-600 km and hit targets at altitudes as high as 40 km. Some sources claim that this system is capable of tracking 5-20 ballistic targets and intercepting up to 5-10 ballistic targets simultaneously. It can defeat ballistic missiles traveling at 5-7 kilometers per second. It has been reported that this air defense system can also target low orbital satellites. It is planned that the S-500 will shield Moscow and the regions around it. It will replace the current A-135 anti-ballistic missile system. The S-500 missiles will be used only against the most important targets, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, AWACS and jamming aircraft.

Sadly, most Americans do not believe that there is even a remote possibility that we will ever fight a war with Russia.

As a result, most Americans will never see the point of articles like this one.

But over in Russia, anti-American sentiment is at an all-time high and many of their talking heads and intellectuals are now convinced that a shooting war with the United States is inevitable.

So what do you think?

September 19, 2013

Officials involved in the investigation of the Navy Yard shooting, have come forward with new insights on the weapon that was used in the shooting. Alexis had carved the words ‘My ELF weapon’ on his Remington 870-Express-Tactical shotgun. ELF stands for ‘extremely low frequency’, and usually refers to communications or weather. [1]

For those who are familiar with this technology, it is well understood that this is used in programs such as H.A.A.R.P. It has also been reported by several government whistle blowers, and even political activists that they suspected a ‘ELF weapon’ was being used on them.

The report about the carvings is most interesting, because it seems to confirm the claim made by Alexis that 3 men were following him using an ELF weapon while he was in his hotel room. He even filed a report to the Newport, Rhode Island Police stating these claims. Aaron stated he had to change his hotel 3 different times because these people were using the microwave machine on him.

On August 7, the police alerted the Newport Naval Station about the incident, however they did not hear from Alexis again. Although he was being treated for multiple ‘mental disorders’, Aaron was still able to keep his security clearance, enabling him to use his key card to gain access into the Naval Yard Building’s fourth floor and open fire.

The news about the etching on the stock of his rifle is incredible to say the least, as such information rarely reaches the public. The use of ELF waves on humans is usually thought to be science fiction to most, but to others it is very real. Researchers such as Fred Bell, who died after shooting an episode of ‘Conspiracy Theory’ with Jesse Ventura; spoke about said weapons. [2]

Mike Adams

Natural News

March 15, 2014

Exclusive investigation: The 239 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may still be alive. This stunning realization is now supported by considerable emerging evidence detailed in this article. At the same time, the “vanished” Boeing 777 may also be in a hanger in Iran right now, being retrofitted with nuclear weapons and turned into a suicide bomb to be deployed over a major city in the Middle East. This possibility is discussed in detail, below, with supporting evidence.

The idea that Flight 370 passengers and crew may still be alive is not a bizarre theory. Even Reuters is now reporting that U.S. authorities have stated, “…it’s also possible the plane may have landed somewhere.”

Here’s the evidence in support of this emerging “piracy” theory of what may have happened to Flight 370 and why the people who may have diverted it might also be planning on turning it into a weapon:

Five critical pieces of astonishing supporting evidence that Flight 370 passengers may still be alive

Please understand that I do not wish to create false hope for all those families who have greatly suffered through this ordeal. My heart goes out to them, and we can only hope these 239 passengers and crew are, indeed, being kept alive somewhere to be used as a bargaining chip for ransom or political purposes. Here’s the substantial evidence in support of this theory:

• Fact #1: No crash debris has been located, despite an exhaustive search

The search for debris has involved over two dozen nations and is unprecedented in aviation history. If the plane had crashed in the ocean anywhere near its intended flight path, the debris almost certainly would have been located by now.

• Fact #2: The plane’s transponder appears to have been manually turned off several minutes before other communication systems stopped transmitting

As the Associated Press reports, “…key evidence for ‘human intervention’ in the plane’s disappearance is that contact with its transponder stopped about a dozen minutes before a messaging system quit.”

This almost certainly means someone deliberately disabled the transponder (the device which transmits location to air traffic controllers).

Why would someone do that? Because they don’t want to be tracked as they change course and take the plane to a new destination.

A Reuters article adds more detail:

Analysis of the Malaysia data suggests the plane, with 239 people on board, diverted from its intended northeast route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and flew west instead, using airline flight corridors normally employed for routes to the Middle East and Europe.

This adds some evidence to the idea that the plane may have been diverted to the Middle East. Together with the suspicion of stolen passports and the identities of those who traveled with them, this starts to paint a more clear picture in support of piracy as the underlying explanation, with possible ties to Iran (see more below).

What’s especially fascinating to me in all this is that once the transponder was turned off, this massive aircraft apparently went into “stealth mode” where nobody could track it. Although this seems to defy the laws of physics and radar, we cannot argue with the fact that the plane was apparently untraceable as it flew for four hours after the transponder was turned off.

• Smoking Gun Fact #3: The plane’s engines continued to broadcast performance data to satellite for four hours after radar contact was lost

This fact is really the smoking gun in all this. The Wall Street Journal has posted an excellent investigative article revealing that Boeing’s own people have confirmed the plane kept flying four hours after disappearing off radar. As the WSJ reports:

The investigators believe the plane flew for a total of up to five hours, according to these people, based on analysis of signals sent by the Boeing satellite-communication link designed to automatically transmit the status of certain onboard systems to the ground. Throughout the roughly four hours after the jet dropped from civilian radar screens, these people said, the link operated in a kind of standby mode and sought to establish contact with a satellite or satellites. These transmissions did not include data, they said, but the periodic contacts indicate to investigators that the plane was still intact and believed to be flying.

Obviously, this system cannot continue to transmit data if the plane has crashed or exploded. The existence of these signals is very nearly conclusive proof that the aircraft continued flying and did not crash or explode. This eliminates most of the scenarios which would result in the death of passengers, and it strongly supports the piracy / hijacking scenario.

• Fact #4: The mobile devices of many passengers continued to stay online for days after the disappearance

The Washington Post has reported that phones of Flight 370 passengers were active and online for several days following the disappearance of the plane:

…a few relatives said they were able to call the cellphones of their loved ones or find them on a Chinese instant messenger service called QQ that indicated that their phones were still somehow online. A migrant worker in the room said that several other workers from his company were on the plane, including his brother-in-law. Among them, the QQ accounts of three still showed that they were online, he said Sunday afternoon. Adding to the mystery, other relatives in the room said that when they dialed some passengers’ numbers, they seemed to get ringing tones on the other side even though the calls were not picked up.

This evidence also fits the piracy theory remarkably well. If the plane was diverted and landed with passengers alive, their mobile devices could have indeed stayed online by automatically connecting to cell towers. The pirates or kidnappers may have overlooked this and failed to confiscate and destroy the mobile devices, allowing them to connect as long as they had battery life remaining.

• Fact #5: Black box transponders are not broadcasting homing signals because the plane never crashed

Normally, when aircraft crash into the ocean, their black boxes emit homing signal transmissions so they can be located. But no signals were ever detected from Flight 370 black boxes.

Now that seems to make sense: if the plane was hijacked / pirated, then it never crashed and the black boxes are still intact, sitting on the aircraft. This may be why they cannot be found (and why there is no wreckage or debris).

Could passengers still be alive?

If the plane kept flying for four more hours, then it was obviously being piloted with an intent to take it somewhere for some specific purpose. Anyone sophisticated enough to disable the transponder in-flight would have also been sophisticated enough to plan the final destination and landing of the aircraft.

As Reuters now reports:

Military radar data suggests a Malaysia Airlines jetliner missing for nearly a week was deliberately flown hundreds of miles off course, heightening suspicions of foul play among investigators, sources told Reuters on Friday.

Anyone pirating a jetliner and diverting it to another location really only has two key assets to work with: The aircraft itself, and the passengers onboard.

Obviously, acquiring a large aircraft like a Boeing 777 would be a huge asset for terrorist groups who could turn it into a weapon. If this is the intent, then the passengers on board would most likely be killed, as they would serve no particular purpose to the hijackers. Sadly, this remains one of the possible outcomes of piracy, and I don’t want to publish any false hope that might mislead families who have lost loved ones. Realistically, the odds of the passengers being alive right now are probably no better than 1 in 3, in my estimation. But that’s better than zero chance.

A second possibility is that the passengers themselves are going to be used as bargaining chips in an elaborate K&R (kidnap & ransom) scheme. It’s also possible that selected passengers have special value in some way we don’t yet realize, and only they will be kept alive as bargaining chips while the others are killed by the hijackers. Sadly, this is another likely outcome of all this.

And yet, despite all the very negative possible outcomes, there does remain a legitimate scenario in which the passengers and crew of Flight 370 remain alive at this very moment, long after their plane was diverted to an unknown location and safely landed. If this is the case, then we would expect to sooner or later hear from the hijackers with their list of demands for the safe return of the passengers. Such demands, if they ever materialize, would no doubt be multinational in nature.

On the more pessimistic side, if the hijackers only sought the aircraft and not the passengers, then we will probably never hear from them until the day a Boeing 777 flying without a transponder in “stealth mode” delivers a terrorist weapon of some sort to whatever city is being targeted.

Turning a Boeing 777 into a nuclear, chemical or biological weapon

A Boeing 777 is a very large aircraft and can obviously be outfitted with a wide variety of weapons systems by anyone with sufficient knowledge and technical skills (not to mention a soul of pure evil).

According to the Boeing website, the 777 has a “revenue payload capacity” of 112 tons, or about 102,000 kg.

With that sort of enormous carrying capacity, a Boeing 777 could be outfitted with elaborate, high-volume chemical spraying weapons, air-dropped biological weapons or of course a nuclear weapon capable of destroying an entire city. Technology also exists to remotely control large aircraft, and Iran in particular has already demonstrated its technical ability to seize control of U.S. military drones through a process of GPS-spoofing. In support of this feat, Russia just recently “electronically captured” another U.S. drone over Crimea.

Shockingly, the next time the world sees this aircraft may be when it deploys itself over a city like Tel Aviv and detonates a large nuclear weapon at altitude. The reason I deliberately choose Tel Aviv in this example is because there appears to be a possible link with Iran in all this, and the Iranian government leadership has reportedly said it wishes to see Israel wiped off the map. The elaborate nature of this aircraft piracy, if indeed this is the true explanation, also smacks of state-sponsored involvement. This is not the kind of operation that can be pulled off by a couple of yahoos trying to score some quick cash.

The fact that this aircraft was able to fly undetected for at least four hours after the transponder was turned off means the plane can very effectively be used as a “stealth” weapon of sorts, and it could theoretically be deployed over major cities across Europe, Asia, the Middle East or even North America.

Where is Flight 370 now? Pakistan, Iran both potentially in range of the landing

According to this Boeing web page, the 777 has a cruising speed of around Mach .84, or around 650 miles per hour.

If the aircraft cruised for four hours after the transponder was turned off, it could have flown nearly 2600 miles, putting it just within reach of Pakistan, and possibly even southeast Iran if it flew at a slightly higher speed and had sufficient fuel. The Iran Shahr Airport, located less than 100 miles from the border of Pakistan, is conceivably within range and sits at an altitude of around 2,000 meters. This airport has a runway length of 7,711 feet, and according to page 16 of this document on the Boeing website, the required runway length for landing a Boeing 777 is less than 7,711 feet as long as the runway is not wet. This is true even if the aircraft is fully loaded and flying at maximum weight.

The aircraft was actually designed to take advantage of shorter runways. Even Boeing itself says the 777 “uses a new semi-levered gear, which allows it to take off from fields with limited runway length.”

Thus, Flight 370 could have conceivably and successfully landed in Iran. Remember, too, that the aircraft was “using airline flight corridors normally employed for routes to the Middle East and Europe,” according to Reuters (link above).

This flight path, however, would have put it directly over India, and it is difficult to imagine the Indian government not noticing a Boeing 777 aircraft flying over its airspace without a transponder. Then again, the Malaysian government seems to have no idea where the plane went, either, and so we may be dealing with regional military incompetence on these matters, or possibly some amazing new stealth technology that was somehow deployed on the plane.

To help explain where this aircraft could have gone, I put together this flight range map, showing the possible locations where Flight 370 could have flown in the four hours after it disappeared from its intended flight path:

Notice that this range encompasses North Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, Afghanistan and even part of Iran.

An interesting area of investigation in all this would be to find out how much fuel the aircraft was loaded with, and determining whether that fuel load could allow it to fly four or even five more hours."

Details of the attack aren’t yet clear, but officials are calling it a terrorist incident. Just before 2:40 p.m., a small sport-utility vehicle slammed into pedestrians and police officers on Westminster Bridge, which spans the River Thames just in front of Westminster Palace, home of the British Parliament and a popular tourist spot. Two people were killed, and 40 injured, according to authorities.

The driver of the vehicle—police said they believed there was only one—then made it onto the grounds of Parliament, where this person stabbed a police officer to death before being shot and killed.

inforwars37,inforwars,['Paul Joseph Watson -'],2014-09-09 06:12:27-05:00,https://www.infowars.com/new-police-compliance-weapon-blinds-targets/,"A firm that provides non-lethal equipment to law enforcement is set to release a new “compliance weapon” that temporarily blinds targets for up to 15 minutes, amidst a national conversation about the militarization of police in the aftermath of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.

Shield Defense Systems, LLC, a company based in Reno, Nevada, is currently developing the Z-RO “retinal obfuscation” gun. According to the firm’s website, the weapon, “Obstructs the target’s vision temporarily for up to 10-15 minutes via proprietary technology when deployed on engaged mark.”

Or in other words, despite coming under intense scrutiny over their treatment of protesters and journalists in Ferguson, militarized police departments are about to get their hands on a new toy that blinds people. The weapon will be available for purchase in December.

The company claims that the weapon inflicts no lasting damage on the target and does not harm their retina and cornea, although we heard the same thing about taser weapons which have killed over 500 people in the United States since 2001.

The image of the weapon on the company’s website isn’t likely to calm nerves given that the Z-RO is surrounded by what appear to be standard bullets. There is no explanation of how the “retinal obfuscation” gun actually works.

The notion of “pain compliance,” a technique increasingly being utilized by police departments, has led to concerns that officers have been given the green light to resort to a form of torture that provides plausible deniability.

Fresh spotlight has been thrown on tactics and weapons being used by police departments in America following last month’s disorder in Ferguson, Missouri during which numerous journalists were arrested and had sniper rifles pointed at them simply for doing their job.

A four day trade show in Oakland called Urban Shield has also come under criticism, with Mayor Jean Quan announcing that the event will no longer be held in the city after hundreds of residents protested against the sale of military-style weapons to domestic law enforcement bodies.

According to the Guardian, the show is an opportunity for “weapons contractors who normally deal with the US military seek to redirect their products to domestic use on America’s streets,” and includes the sale of sniper rifles originally designed for the British and German armies.

A recent major ACLU report warns that the increasing use of military-style vehicles and weapons in domestic law enforcement situations is part of a transformation towards militarized policing where Americans are treated “like wartime enemies.”

The clip is a promo for episode 11 of the ABC show Designated Survivor, in which Kiefer Sutherland plays an obscure cabinet secretary who is “unexpectedly thrust into the presidency after an attack at the capitol during a State of the Union address.”

The scene shows the fictional president attending the swearing in of a Congressman before a gunshot is heard and panic ensues.

“Who took the bullet?” asks the promo before the scene cuts to a hospital as surgeons operate on the victim.

Viewers did not find out in the previous cliffhanger episode if the president in the show was shot or if someone else “took the bullet,” although the implication that the president could have been the victim is clear.

One viewer complained to Infowars that he thought the airing of the ad during the interview with Trump was “distasteful”.

The idea of Trump being assassinated has repeatedly been invoked by commentators, journalists and television networks.

Back in February last year, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat caused outrage after he joked about how an assassination attempt could end Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Douthat tweeted a clip from a movie in which a political figure is gunned down by an assassin.

The day before his inauguration, CNN aired a piece asking what would happen if Trump was killed in an attack, along the same lines as the plot in Designated Survivor.

As we reported yesterday, German newspaper publisher and editor Josef Joffe appeared on a panel show during which he “joked” that someone in the White House could “murder” Trump to end his presidency.

He’s the latest loud-mouthed leftist to give his hot take on the mass shooting in Las Vegas.

In a now-deleted-but-never-forgotten tweet, Morelli said:

Soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief. White people shooting White people isn’t terror… it’s community outreach.

Once again, more Democrats happy to make the connection between Trump supporters and country music fans.

Morelli then responding to the mass shooting with a “mass apology” which is everything you’d expect it to be: crappy. He acknowledged that his words hurt and for that he apologized. However, it appears that mass shootings have him in such emotional shambles he doesn’t know how to speak like a human being. The apology is strange and rambling, like a crazy man. But it’s not his fault, really, because these mass shootings have him so freaked out he felt it okay to shout his “relief” that it was a white man shooting white people from the rooftops. That’s called being unhinged.

Here is the entire apology, via Facebook:

MASS APOLOGY

I’m sorry. The words I chose hurt people. I apologize.

Name: Greg Morelli

Born: 1967

Roles: Son, Brother, Citizen In Crisis

We live in a time of mass shootings. This is my mass apology.

The thoughts have not worked. The prayers have not worked. What lead me to think Twitter was a good idea is beyond me. I simply do not know what to do about the shootings. Truly, I’m lost!

I own the words I wrote. They hurt people. I apologize.

Some have suggested I take them down. I don’t know if you can. Once it’s out there, it’s out there. But I’ll try.

There. I just took them down. Let’s see if it’s a step in the right direction.

For those who called, who think I’m advocating Gun Control, I’m sorry. I have no answers. Only questions. I do not want to take your guns. It’s up to you to decide what to do with your guns.

I simply do not know what to do about these mass shootings. I’m sorry.

For those who called, threatening my life, I’m sorry. Maybe this is my time. I’m going to try and make this right. But maybe I can’t. So maybe this is my time.

We’re all called. Maybe I’m being called. And not just by angry callers. Maybe I’m being called by something higher. We’ll see.

God Help Me!

Sorry to my staff, who took too many threatening phone calls, got scared and closed early. Sorry to my mom, who read all the comments, took them to heart and fears for my life. I let you down, Mom.

Sorry to my brother. I don’t know what else to say.

I apologize.

I have no appetite, as you can probably imagine. But if I did, I’d make myself a bowl of oatmeal with bananas, blueberries, strawberries and a little bit of milk. I’m drinking coffee, black.

I love music. All music. I believe in the power of dancing to heal a broken heart. In the country music genre, I love Johnny Cash. I love the honesty he brings to his songs. In the rock genre, I love Perry Ferrell, not only for the earthquake of Jane’s Addiction, but Lollapalooza, a music carnival responsible for lifting more artists than I can name. In the genre of life, I love Stevie Wonder. Songs In The Key Of Life re-set the emotional space where music and heart co-exist.

I’m sorry, to all of the artists I named. I hope by association I didn’t bring you down. To those I hurt, I’m sorry. To those who died in Las Vegas, who died in Sandy Hook, who died in Virginia Tech, who died in Fort Hood, who died in Columbine, I’m sorry. I have no answers. I wish I did. I can’t even find the words.

I tried to participate. But all I did is put my foot in my mouth. These mass shootings have me freaked out.

I’m sorry.

Wearing a ski-mask, 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson opened fire at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ at 11:15am yesterday morning, killing 39-year-old parishioner Melanie Smith as she was walking to her car.

Samson then entered the rear of the building and began firing indiscriminately. He was stopped after a struggle with licensed gun owner Robert Engle, who was pistol whipped but forced Samson to accidentally shoot himself in the chest during the fight.

The shooter was taken to hospital and will now be charged with murder and attempted murder.

Samson shared a Mic video back in February entitled “white terrorism” which facetiously argued that Donald Trump should be “considering a ban on white men” because of the claim that, “You’re more likely to be killed by a white man than a Muslim terrorist.”

Mic is a left-wing website that routinely peddles far-left content that appeals to social justice warriors and Black Lives Matter supporters.

“Stop falling for stupidity so easily,” commented the killer.

So the man who shot seven white people at a church in #Antioch shared this @mic video titled ""White Terrorism"" back in February. pic.twitter.com/dz8fMKVq1r — Far Left Watch (@FarLeftWatchOrg) September 25, 2017

The video is typical of far-left anti-white rhetoric that plays on racist propaganda and has become normalized on social media.

Leftists appear to be panicking about the fact that the incident bolsters Donald Trump’s travel ban, given that Sudan was on the original list of banned countries.

One Reddit poster asked another user not to link to a story that showed a picture of the gunman because it would “embolden Trump voters”.

The left is panicking over the Sudanese migrant who shot up a church in Tennessee. pic.twitter.com/PBPT8oNBhc — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) September 25, 2017

Last year, Dallas massacre gunman Micah Johnson was motivated by a similar grievance, stating that he “wanted to kill white people” before killing five police officers and injuring seven.

NYPD cop killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley also executed two police officers at point blank range as part of a Black Lives Matter revenge attack in response to the death of Michael Brown.

Suggestions that Samson’s motivation was racial once again emphasize how the extremist rhetoric of the alt-left is causing unstable people to act out violently.

Or more specifically, is it common for blacks to be unfairly shot by police? Judging by most media coverage and SJW responses, you’d think so (see Chaos in Milwaukee After Police Shoot Armed Suspect. Because #BlackLivesMatter and Blue Lives Matter? Hillary Specifically SNUBS National Police Union). But as it turns out, the numbers state otherwise…

A recent deadly force study by Washington State University researcher Lois James found that police officers were less likely to shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white or Hispanic ones… Harvard economics professor, Roland Fryer… found that blacks were 24% less likely than whites to be shot by officers even though the suspects were armed or violent [in Houston].

When they’re not busy “peacefully” rioting… do you ever hear Black Lives Matter mention those statistics? Yeah, that’s not a thing. Just like “systemic” police racism isn’t a thing. For a group that claims to care so much about blacks (oft times exclusively), they don’t seem to care about the statistics regarding the deaths of black people…



See, statistics bring to light the fact that the inner cities have been destroyed by leftist policies (watch Detroit Real Time Ride-Along). Thus when it comes to hyper liberal SJWs, numbers aren’t as effective as, say, a hashtag. Don’t judge. Math is hard, you bigot.

But even if they’re ignored, the facts remain. Meanwhile, racism? Not so much.

Clearly this isn’t to say that there are no instances of racism ever. PragerU is simply pointing out the fact that blacks aren’t unfairly targeted. They make a compelling argument, considering they did actual research and stuff. I know, I know. I can already hear Shaun King’s culturally-appropriated cornrows simmering with anger. Worry not, we have even more “racist” facts below…"

October 1, 2011

Flu shots are becoming the most widely recommended vaccine on the planet, with The Federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) changing their flu shot recommendation from children between 6 months and 5 years old demographic to virtually everyone except those between the ages of 19-49 who are in perfectly good health. Even within this category there is a barrage of organizations warning against avoiding the ubiquitous flu shot.

The fact of the matter is that seasonal flu shots are simply not backed by reputable science, and a number of major studies have even shown that the seasonal flu shot is not effective at all in preventing the flu.

Adding fuel to the fire, this ineffective shot comes with pages of nasty side effects that will certainly make you reconsider getting one this year. Here are 3 major reasons you, your family, and the medical establishment should reconsider flu shots as effective flu prevention tools:

1. Seasonal flu vaccines have been found to only be 1% effective

A new major study has numerically determined the effectiveness of the flu shot to be 1%. This means that despite the H1N1-loaded flu jab, there is still a 99% chance that you will not be protected against the flu. The reason for this, despite the faulty science behind the development of the vaccine, has to do with flu strains. It is extremely challenging, to the point of guessing, which flu strain will affect your area. With such a wide selection, it is very rare (about 1%, according to the study), for it to be the correct strain.

The researchers from the study stated:

“The corresponding figures [of people showing influenza symptoms] for poor vaccine matching were 2% and 1% (RD 1, 95% CI 0% to 3%)” announced the study authors. In other words, you would have to vaccinate 100 people to reduce the number of people affected by the influenza virus by just one.

The findings do not stop there. The researchers also highlighted other findings about the flu vaccine, which topple the mainstream concept of their safety and effectiveness:

“Vaccination had…no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates.”

“Vaccine use did not affect the number of people hospitalized or working days lost.”

“The analysis howed that reliable evidence on influenza vaccines is thin but there is evidence of widespread manipulation of conclusions…”

“There is no evidence that [influenza vaccines] affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission.” — Meaning vaccines do not affect transmission of disease, what they are designed for.

“In average conditions (partially matching vaccine) 100 people need to be vaccinated to avoid one set of influenza symptoms.”

2. Flu shots have been linked to killer nerve disease

Even government health officials have confirmed the link between the H1N1-containing flu shot and the killer nerve disease known as Guillain-Barre Syndrome. A government agency known as The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a warning over the connection following the phony swine flu pandemic. The news came after mainstream media reported on the fact that even 50% of doctors were refusing the H1N1 vaccine over health concerns.

Neurologists around the world were even warned about the safety of the vaccine by Professor Elizabeth Miller, head of the immunization department for UK’s Health Protection Agency.

The vaccines used to combat an expected swine influenza pandemic in 1976 were shown to be associated with GBS and were withdrawn from use,” she wrote in a letter to neurologists.

3. Vitamin D is over 800% more effective with no side effects

A major clinical trial performed at the Division of Molecular Epidemiology in the the Department of Pediatrics at the Jikei University School of Medicine Minato-ku in Tokyo found that vitamin D was extremely effective in preventing and reversing influenza. Led by Mitsuyoshi Urashima, the study involved 334 children, half of which were given 1200 IUs per day of vitamin D3. This is actually a very low amount of vitamin D, with many natural health experts recommending around 5,000 IUs per day for most individuals. If the researchers used a higher amount like 5,000 IUs, the findings and subsequent percentage would most likely be even more profound.

What the study found was that 31 of 167 children in the placebo group contracted influenza over the 4 month duration of the study, while only 18 of 168 children in the vitamin D group did. This is in comparison to the flu shot being effective in 1 out of 100 participants, with countless side effects.

This means that vitamin D is 800% more effective in preventing the flu than vaccines at 1200 IUs daily. The percentage could likely climb into the thousands if the dosage was upped to the recommended 5,000 IUs per day, and perhaps even higher beyond that.

There is simply no reason to receive a flu shot when natural alternatives like vitamin D exist. Deadly nerve disease, narcolepsy, and overall ineffectiveness are but a few of the negative aspects of the flu shot."

So this is what you get. … We not the one’s that killing us, ya’ll are killing us. We can’t make a change if ya’ll don’t change.”

He’s wrong. The biggest threat to black lives is other blacks.

Two percent of blacks killed in Missouri were killed by cops, whereas 98% were killed by other blacks:

May 12, 2014

A woman in Alpine, Texas has accused a DEA agent of smashing her neck with the butt of an M-16 rifle during a raid on her sister’s smoke shop.

KWES NewsWest 9 / Midland, Odessa, Big Spring, TX: newswest9.com |

Ilana Lipsen, owner of the Purple Zone, told reporters that the incident began when DEA agents confronted her sister as she attempted to open the store late last week. According to the DEA, Lipsen’s shop was targeted as part of a nationwide crackdown on “synthetic drugs.”

“She pulled up and they said, ‘Do you have the key?’ and there’s not a key for my property,” Lipsen told News West 9. “We have smart locks and they’re all on codes. She said, ‘I don’t have a key, but I have…’ and at that exact moment, one of the officers said, ‘Break it down.’ It didn’t give her a chance to say, ‘I have a code.'”

Lipsen says agents then entered her shop, disconnected her surveillance cameras and confiscated hard drives, cameras, cell phones and several firearms. Lipsen refutes claims by DEA agents that she was selling or in possession of any synthetic drugs.

“The only information that I could get was they were looking for some type of document,” Lipsen said. “I said, ‘Well, could you please tell me what kind of document that you’re looking for and I can help you?’ But they wouldn’t give me any information.”

As Lipsen’s sister watched from the sidewalk, one agent reportedly approached and demanded she leave the area, prompting her to ask, “What are you going to do, shoot me?”

“He grabbed her by the shoulders and started roughhousing her,” Lipsen said. “My sister has never been arrested, has never had any other problems and she was terrified.”

Lipsen says the situation grew worse after her sister flinched, causing the agent to become even more violent.

“At that moment, he took his foot and tripped her to get her off of her feet and have her down to the ground. One of her feet came flying up and accidentally hit him in the shin,” Lipsen said. “At that time he started saying, ‘Well now you’re assaulting a police officer.’ And he started attacking her more. He took the butt of his M-16 rifle and smashed it into her neck.”

Lipsen’s sister was then handcuffed by one agent as another reportedly grabbed her by her neck.

“She was yelling, ‘Get off of me. You’re hurting me. You’re choking me.’ He had his hand around her neck as he was holding her face into the ground of the neighbors property,” Lipsen said.

The DEA denied all allegations and claimed the blood on scene was from an agent who accidentally cut himself while breaking down the store’s door. Although the DEA did confirm the arrest and assault charge, no explanation was given over how Lipsen’s sister received the large wound on her neck.

The sisters were charged with three felonies for selling an illegal substance, charges both sisters deny.

While both parties deny the other’s claims, the issue at large continues to be the militarization of law enforcement through the failed war on drugs.

Gary Tuchman, a correspondent for the network, also drew widespread laughter for effeminately handling the weapon and closing his eyes while firing.

1. All guns are loud

2. There is no such thing as full semi-automatic he should be a part of the @migos making up words like that.

3. The gun doesn’t kick that hard this Guy is just super saiyan beta.

4. Every gun is design to inflict

5. JUST THROW THE WHOLE @CNN AWAY pic.twitter.com/27iZnJeVAE — Colion Noir (@MrColionNoir) February 27, 2018

The clip begins with Tuchman struggling to hold the rifle properly as retired Lt. General Mark Hertling explains the weapon’s mechanics.

Despite Hertling’s alleged expertise, the former military man goes on to claim that the AR-15 is capable of being fired “full semi-automatic.”

The made-up term appears to be part of an attempt to frame the rifle as more dangerous than other semi-automatic rifles, the Daily Caller’s David Hookstead argues.

“It’s also worth noting that these two are pushing a narrative that somehow an AR-15 shoots at a more rapid rate than other semi-automatic weapons. That’s of course completely false,” Hookstead writes. “The cyclical rate of AR-15 can be faster than some semi-automatic weapons and slower than others.”

Social media users were also quick to pick apart the report, making fun of Tuchman and Hertling in the process.

The report is strikingly similar to a 2016 article in which a New York Daily News journalist claimed to have acquired post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after firing an AR-15.

“The recoil bruised my shoulder, which can happen if you don’t know what you’re doing. The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face,” the writer said. “The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary form of PTSD. For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.”

Despite the AR-15 being identical in capabilities to countless hunting rifles, anti-gun advocates are demanding the rifle be outright banned based merely on its appearance.

Infowars.com

January 28, 2012

In an end-run around an all out gun ban, the New Jersey Assembly Law & Public Safety Committee is set to consider legislation that would ban ammunition under the auspices of protecting police.

The language seemingly targets the already prohibited ‘armor piercing ammunition’ but would encompass any ammo that is deemed to “pose a threat to the safety and well being of law enforcement.” Ammoland is reporting that “Common hunting, target, and self-defense ammunition would be subject to ban, along with BB’s, airgun pellets, and non-metallic ammunition like plastic airsoft pellets.”

The NRA concurs with Ammoland, reporting that while the language of the bill seemingly deals only with handgun ammo, the actual legislation could include the ban of many rifle ammunition, particularly as there is a bleed over between cartridges that work with both types of firearms:

Although the bill only mentions handgun ammunition, it is in fact not limited to handgun ammunition, and would apply to all rifle ammunition for which a handgun is ever made. As an increasing number of gun manufacturers make handgun models that shoot rifle caliber ammunition, the line between “handgun” vs. “rifle” ammunition has become blurred, and the New Jersey State Police have already begun treating rifle ammunition in this category as if it were handgun ammunition for regulatory purposes. As long as a handgun exists that shoots a particular caliber of rifle ammunition, New Jersey treats that ammunition as if it were handgun ammunition.

The bills would also “criminalize the use of a defaced or stolen firearm,” which would again, through vague and ill-defined language, deceptively restrict the lawful ownership of virtually any modified or restored firearm.

The Judiciary Committee, sister to the Law & Public Safety Committee in the New Jersey assembly, has previously pushed sweeping gun ban legislation, as in 2008 where it passed 5-to-1 out of committee a long-list of firearms, including modern weapons, traditional muzzleloaders, older guns and even replicas that were targeted for a ban.

Police have repeatedly admitted that they can’t protect us and have pointed out that they have no liability to do so. Yet, this and other legislation proves that they don’t want us to be able to protect ourselves either. Further, it is the criminal intent of the aggressor, not the tool he holds, that poses the threat to law enforcement or anyone else targeted. Leaving all the tools in the hands of criminals and taking them away from law abiding citizens does nothing to even the score and makes little sense, despite what may well be good intentions. Still, lawmakers are ever eager to encroach on the guarantee of the right to bear arms so clearly outlined in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.

Assembly Bill 588 and Assembly Bill 1013 are scheduled for hearing on January 30, and would enable the state’s Attorney General to instate a de facto restriction of the Second Amendment via executive fiat.

There are, of course, many pushing for whatever restrictions can be sustained under the current political climate at any given time.

New Jersey, like other big city venues including New York and Chicago, has long been a hotbed for victim disarmament. Newark Mayor Cory Booker has been publicly demonizing gun ownership for some time, offering a $1000 reward for anonymous tips and warning that ‘illegal’ firearm possession will lead to jail time. Booker is a prominent member of the national Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, who advocate many of the same restrictions.

Meanwhile, the resignation of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords a year after her attempted assassination has prompted renewed cries to embrace federal legislation to ban certain ammo-clips, backed by the vigilant anti-2nd Amendment Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, the Brady Center and other disarmament advocates.

According to reports, President Obama secretly vowed to the Brady Center last year to work on gun legislation “under the radar,” prompting many commentators to connect it with the Fast & Furious gun-walking scandal, as well as many other related covert operations, asserting that it was in part an attempt to demonize the 2nd amendment and garner support for firearm legislation.

Further, efforts are being made in 2012 to coerce that U.S. Senate into ratifying the United Nation’s Small Arms Treaty, an international agreement that seeks to disarm ordinary Americans and limit the ability to purchase a wide array of products in the firearm industry.

Jan 28, 2013

In yet another huge blow to the rhetoric and narrative of the Obama administration and its desire to disarm the American public, a DHS bid has been uncovered (see documents below) showing that the Department of Homeland Security recently put out an offer to purchase 7,000 full-auto “assault weapons” to be used domestically, inside the USA.

Keep in mind that President Obama is on the record saying, “AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals; that they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities.”

But it seems he really means they don’t belong on the streets of our cities unless they are in the hands of homeland security enforcers, in which case they can be FULL-AUTO assault weapons.

The DHS bid for 7,000 full-auto assault weapons is found by clicking here. The original credit for discovering this goes, to my best knowledge, to Awr Hawkins at Breitbart.com.

In the hands of the government, they’re called “Personal Defense Weapons”

The juiciest part of this bid is the use of the phrase “Personal Defense Weapons” to describe the full-auto AR-15s being purchased by DHS.

Apparently, when YOU hold an AR-15, it’s an “assault rifle.” But magically, if you hand that same rifle to an armed government homeland security enforcer, it instantly transforms itself into a “personal defense weapon.”

The request for bid actually says:

DHS and its components have a requirement for a 5.56x45mm NATO, select-fire firearm suitable for personal defense use in close quarters and / or when maximum concealment is required.

So there it is, right in black and white: DHS enforcers need full-auto AR-15s which are “suitable for personal defense in close quarters” and for “maximum concealment.”

But if you or I make the same claim, suddenly we are branded lunatics by the fringe left and all the gun grabbers across America who apparently have no clue that their own government is arming up like never before.

Senator Feinstein, the gun-grabbing Senator from California, says she wants to take all the guns from all Americans. “Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ’em all in,” she says on the record. But while Mr. and Mrs. America are turning in their guns, ‘roid-head DHS goons are arming to the teeth with full-auto assault rifles.

This is all on top of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition the U.S. government has already stockpiled, as was discovered last year. What kind of government wants to domestically stockpile ammo and full-auto weapons, putting them in the hands of domestic agents who have nothing whatsoever to do with overseas wars? Well, the kind of government that plans to NEED 1.6 billion rounds of ammo and full-auto assault weapons, of course.

The action shall be select-fire (capable of semi-automatic and automatic fire). The action shall be capable of accepting all standard NATO STANAG 20 and 30 round M16 magazines (NSN 1005-00-921-5004) and Magpul 30 round PMAG (NSN 1005-01-576-5159). The magazine shall have a capacity to hold thirty (30) 5.56x45mm NATO rounds. The receiver top shall be equipped with an integral MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail for mounting sights and other accessories. The fire control selector shall have three positions; safe, semi-automatic, and automatic. The pistol grip shall be a fixed, vertical pistol grip constructed of a durable material.

DHS admits AR-15 with 30-round magazine is “suitable for personal defense use in close quarters”

This government document openly admits that AR-15s with 30-round magazines and capable of fully automatic fire are “suitable for personal defense” in close quarters (i.e. your home).

CNN, of course, doesn’t want you to ever hear that. Nor does Feinstein, Cuomo, Schumer, Obama, Eric Holder or any other gun grabbers. Even while their own government is arming up with 1.6 billion rounds of ammo and 7,000 full-auto “assault rifles” (plus lots more in other bids), they are trying to completely disarm the American citizenry through new gun registration and confiscation legislation.

The whole point of all this, of course, is to create firepower disparity between the government and the citizenry… To disarm the People while arming up the government agents who operate domestically. That way, the people can be forced at gunpoint into doing almost anything the oppressive government demands! (Taking vaccine shots, giving up private property, turning over farms and businesses, etc.)

What’s really hard-hitting about this is that the radical left keeps claiming things like “no one needs an assault rifle for personal defense.” Okay, if that true, then the Department of Homeland Security should abandon all such rifles first! Let’s see DHS turn in all its rifles and ammo, thereby setting an example of the “fact” that “nobody needs an assault rifle” for self defense.

In truth, a full-auto AR-15 is an outstanding weapon for self defense, which is exactly why DHS is buying thousands of them. Nothing stops bad guys faster than a barrage of high-velocity lead aimed in their direction. Again, that’s why DHS wants these rifles in the first place. One of these rifles in the hands of a citizen could have stopped the Sandy Hook shooting in seconds.

Pay attention to the word games (which are really mind games)

As you observe the highly manipulated gun control argument, pay special attention to the word games you’re being subjected to:

An AR-15 in the hands of a citizen is an “assault rifle.”

But an AR-15 in the hands of a DHS agent is a “Personal Defense Weapon.”

A full-auto-capable rifle in the hands of a citizen is called a “machine gun.”

A full-auto-capable rifle in the hands of a DHS agent is called a “select-fire rifle.”

According to the media, all government agents with assault rifles are presumed innocent and assumed to be stopping crime.

But all private citizens with assault rifles are presumed guilty and assumed to be causing crime.

When one citizen goes crazy and murders a bunch of people, the call goes out for ALL citizens to be stripped of their firearms.

But when one government agent goes crazy and murders a bunch of people, the calls goes out for MORE guns to be placed in the hands of MORE government agents!

Thank you, DHS, for admitting the truth

In summary, it looks like we actually need to thank the DHS for admitting the truth that Obama won’t: AR-15s are personal defense weapons, suitable for use in close quarters, especially when equipped with 30-round magazines.

That’s why I own one, and it’s why DHS wants thousands more (but theirs are full-auto, while mine is only semi-auto).

As a general rule, all freedom-loving Americans should want the same firepower their domestic government possesses. That’s the whole point behind the Second Amendment, and it represents the distribution of power in a free society.

But instead of firepower being equal in America today, DHS is using our taxpayer dollars to purchase thousands of full-auto weapons for their own agents. This is apparently being done under ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).

This brings up the question for another entire article, and here’s the question: Why does immigration need 7,000 full-auto assault rifles? Is there a friggin’ Mexican invasion planned that nobody told me about? Is ICE going to invade Mexico and start a shooting war with the Mexican drug cartels?

Seriously: Why does ICE need 7,000 full-auto assault rifles? And why does DHS need 1.6 billion rounds of ammo?

24-year-old Daniel Frisiello was arrested after a federal investigation traced the unsigned letters to him as a result of Frisiello also ordering a “glitter bomb” for one of the intended recipients using his own name.

“You are an awful, awful person. I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV,” Frisiello wrote in the letter addressed to Trump Jr.

It also said: “You the family idiot. Eric looks smart. This is the reason why people hate you. You are getting what you deserve. So shut the f*** up.”

A cursory scan of Frisiello’s Facebook page confirms him to be a gun control advocate who has endorsed and supported numerous anti-Trump political causes and campaigns.

Numerous posts over the last two weeks by Frisiello expressed support for the Parkland students who have been given platforms by the mainstream media to advocate for Second Amendment restrictions.

“Oh how karmas a bitch!” wrote Frisiello in response to companies ending their relationship with the NRA over the Parkland shooting. He also donated to the anti-gun March For Life which is set to take place later this month.

“Oh how I laughed! Karmas a bitch when you get money from the NRA!” wrote Frisiello in response to Senator Marco Rubio being confronted during last week’s CNN town hall.

Frisiello’s “likes” include numerous anti-Trump campaigns as well as pages such as “CNN Heroes,” MSNBC host Joe Scarborough and COngressman Adam Schiff.

Frisiello also posted an image of a sign that reads, “Trump For Prison 2017.”

In the video, Hogg, who works for the Marjory Douglas high school newspaper, asks fellow students what their thoughts are on gun control — while shooter Nikolas Cruz was terrorizing the school.

“So what are your thoughts?” Hoggs asked a terrified girl.

“I don’t think there’s really anything more to say, but there shouldn’t have to be, cause if you look around this closet and saw everyone just hiding together, you would know that this shouldn’t be happening anymore, and that it doesn’t deserve to happen to anyone,” she said.

“And that no amount of money should make it more easily accessible to get guns and that’s that.”

Another girl said that she used to be pro-gun until the shooting started.

“I wanted to be a junior NRA member, I wanted to learn how to hunt, I was always fascinated by guns as a young girl, but this experience was so traumatizing to the point where now I can’t even fathom the idea of a gun in my house.”

She added she was even going to a gun range for her 18th birthday to learn to shoot.

“But at this point, I don’t even want to be behind a gun, I don’t want to be a person behind a bullet, because I don’t want to be the person to point a bullet at someone, and to have a bullet pointed at me, my school, my classmates, my teachers, my mentors – it’s just, it’s definitely eye-opening to the fact that we need more gun control in this country.”

Hogg’s intrepid journalistic spirit is better explained when one learns he’s an avid CNN fan, having toured the Atlanta headquarters and sporting the Fake News Network’s shirt in several photos.

His liberal and anti-Trump views on Twitter help explain why CNN is so eager to elevate him as a spokesman for the current anti-gun movement.

Viewed nearly 7 million times at the time of publication, the video, created by Facebook user Danny Farnsworth, dismantles the myth that the AR-15 is any different than countless other rifles.

“Let me try to clear the air here a little bit,” Farnsworth begins. “All this talk about ‘assault weapons, assault guns,’ is total bullshit.”

Farnsworth continues by comparing an AR-15 and a small hunting rifle, noting that both weapons share the exact same capabilities and only differ in terms of cosmetics.

“A weapon that looks like this, people are super scared of,” Farnsworth says while holding up an AR-15.

“Yet this,” Farnsworth says while displaying the wooden rifle, “is totally fine. No problems.”

“I have news for you. These two guns are exactly the same weapon… the only difference in these two guns is the way it’s built with wood or plastic… that’s it!”

The gun enthusiast goes on to show how the AR-15’s magazine is compatible with the wooden rifle and notes that both fire only as fast as the trigger is pulled.

“But somehow this will be made illegal and this is fine, yet they are the exact same gun, Farnsworth adds. “So please, those people out there calling for bans, calling for ‘stop the assault rifles,’ you don’t know what the fuck you are talking about.”

“Your ignorance is showing and it makes your argument moot.”

The video comes amid heightened debate over gun control in the wake of a tragic school shooting in Florida that took the lives of 17 people last week.

Unlike previous presidents, Donald Trump opted to put the focus on mental health during an address to the nation, drawing the ire of gun control proponents.

“It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,” Trump said. “We must actually make that difference.”"

The survey, which was conducted at the start of the week, finds, “Only 24% of Americans trust the government to fairly enforce gun control laws.”

A full 58 per cent of Americans lack trust in the government’s ability to implement such laws, while 18% are not sure.

The numbers emphasize how while support for new gun control measures is clearly a majority opinion, confidence in the success of those measures having any positive effect isn’t solid.

Almost half (49%) of Americans think more gun control laws will have no impact on violent crime. Even amongst Democrats, a relatively slim majority, 56 per cent, think new gun restrictions will decrease violent crime.

A Quinnipiac poll released earlier this week found that support for gun control is at an all time high, with 67% of Americans supporting what the media has termed an “assault weapons” ban.

President Donald Trump has called for allowing “gun adept teachers with military or special training experience” to carry a concealed weapon in schools so they could “immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions”.

Meanwhile, NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre told an audience at CPAC today, “The elites don’t care not one whit about America’s school system and school children. Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment (of the Constitution) and our firearms freedoms so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.”

“No more ‘thoughts and prayers,’ please,” Blythe wrote on his Instagram on Thursday. “You can take those and put them towards something that only God, fate, random chance, the universe, whatever you believe/do not believe in can affect — they might do some good there.”

“Instead of ‘thinking and praying,’ here’s a CONCRETE ACTION you can take — you can contact your legislators and DEMAND that there be some reasonable, common-sense gun law changes. DEMAND IT AND KEEP DEMANDING IT.”

“The time for ‘thoughts and prayers’ is long past — it’s a slap in the face of people who continue to die as a result of crazy people armed with LEGALLY obtained high-powered semiautomatic weapons, weapons that are designed for JUST ONE THING — killing human beings,” he added.

The heavy metal singer then asserted that AR-15 rifles should not be legal because they’re used for “hunting men,” not deer.

“I grew up in the country with guns in the house — these were shotguns, used for hunting,” he said. “You don’t use an AR-15 for hunting deer, you use it for hunting MEN or (apparently) CHILDREN.”

Instead of calling AR-15s “assault rifles,” which is already a misnomer, Blythe suggested calling them “Kid Killers” to drive home his message.

“Some people don’t like the term ‘assault rifle.’ Okay, cool — why don’t we call them ‘Kid Killers’ then? Is that a little better? Can we get a little KID KILLER control happening? Is it still ‘too early’ to start talking about getting these KID KILLERS off the streets? Are the students who survived the massacre in Florida and who are publicly begging us, the adults in charge of things, for gun law reform ‘politicizing’ the whole thing? Is it ‘too early’ for THEM to bring it up? Should we just tell them to shut up because they are children and don’t understand adult matters, stuff like why crazy people can easily buy assault rifles and then SHOOT THEM DEAD in the classroom?”

Blythe fails to grasp a couple of things. First, the shooter Nikolas Cruz had a long history of mental issues, violence, and trauma, and was alerted to the FBI and local authorities on numerous occasions. So this particular attack could have been easily prevented by law enforcement.

Second, Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school is a gun-free zone. So the facility already heeded the advice from anti-gun advocates, which just means a building full of people who were defenseless.

Several schools recognize the problem with gun-free zones, and are taking steps to arm their faculty should another shooting incident occur.

Perhaps Blythe should stick to growling into his mic, and heed his own lyrics when following the left’s talking points about the Second Amendment:

“This is the art of ruin.

This is the resolution

The end of all progress

The death of evolution

It bleeds all life away.”

Kennedy (R., La.) railed against stricter gun control provisions, saying that America needs ‘idiot control’ rather than gun control.

CNN host John Berman questioned Kennedy regarding his stated opposition to legislation being considered in the Senate that would give federal agencies greater access to state records, in order to better determine the eligibility of a person to buy firearms.

The bill would offer greater federal funding to state agencies that comply, while withholding it from those that don’t.

“I don’t think we need more gun control laws,” Kennedy said.

“Not a single one?” Berman asked.

“No,” Kennedy declared. “I think we need more idiot control.”

When Berman asked Kennedy to expand on what he meant by the term ‘idiot’, the Senator stated that he was referring to violent criminals like the shooter in Parkland.

Kennedy said he was not referring to anyone with a mental illness, and that he may have “misused” the term in that context.

Kennedy then stated that violent criminals are too often assumed to be mentally ill when many are just plain “evil.”

The Senator noted that the mental stability of the Parkland shooter has not been properly determined at this stage.

“I don’t know that, so I will call him an idiot,” Kennedy said."

August 7, 2013



A Colorado apartment complex has sent out a letter to all tenants (and future disarmed slaves) stating that starting October 1, “firearms and weapons are prohibited” from the complex.

Retired Marine Art Dorsch, 77, contacted 9News in Castle Rock, Colorado after receiving the “updated community policies” notice which turns his fine abode into a “victim disarmament zone.”

“I’m a hunter. I’m a licensed conceal and carry person,” Dorsch said to the news channel.

That didn’t matter to the apartment manager who apparently wants to create a mini-Chicago.

A handwritten note on the typed letter emphasizes that even handguns for licensed concealed carry are included in the ban.

“It upsets me very much,” Dorsch said.

To comply with the heavy demand, Dorsch said he may have no choice but to leave his guns with a friend 30 miles away.

Firearm bans at apartment complexes could encourage criminals to perform “home invasions” after realizing that the apartment dwellers are likely unarmed.

Violent crimes will increase as anti-gun attitudes grip Colorado, but many Coloradans are pushing back.

After Colorado Senate President John Morse introduced strict gun control legislation last spring, the “Recall Senator John Morse” committee gathered more signatures to remove Morse from office than he even received in votes for his election.

“It’s pretty amazing,” said Paul Paradis, owner of Paradise Sales Firearms in Colorado Springs. “You think he might have ticked off some of his constituents?”

Colorado recently banned magazines that hold more than 15 rounds, which effectively prevented gun shops from selling rifles that typically use 20 and 30 round magazines.

“We can sell the gun, but we won’t be able to sell the magazine with it, so what’s the point?” gun store manager Richard Taylor said to the Denver Post.

Several northern Colorado counties even recently proposed seceding from Colorado and forming their own state in response to such state gun control legislation among other things.

“Northern and Northeastern Colorado and our voices are being ignored in the legislative process this year, and our very way of life is under attack,” said Weld County Commissioner Sean Conway.

Unfortunately an “unarmed slave” mentality is spreading beyond legislation as evidenced by Oakwood Apartments’ new “community policy.”

The complex is managed by Ross Management Group, with a claimed “solid reputation with Finance Authorities, tax credit investors and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.”

The management company operates multiple apartment complexes around the Denver area.

Castle Rock, approximately 30 miles south of Denver, has a population of nearly 50,000.

inforwars71,inforwars,[],2015-10-01 07:15:01-05:00,https://www.infowars.com/fbi-far-more-murders-committed-with-knives-than-assault-rifles/,"Nearly five times as many murders are committed with knives than so-called “assault rifles,” according to the FBI.

The new crime statistics released by the agency reveal that out of 11,961 murders performed within the U.S. in 2014, 660 were committed unarmed, 1,567 were committed with knives and only 248 murders were known to have been committed using rifles of any type, including single-shot long arms and “assault rifles” routinely demonized by gun control groups.

Granted, the FBI did list 2,052 murders under “unknown firearm type,” but given the percentages of the known firearm categories, it is unlikely that more than four percent of the “unknown firearms” were in fact rifles, and less than that were semi-automatics.

In other words, despite the calls to ban “military-style assault rifles” by anti-gun groups, conservatively less – and likely much less – than four percent of murders were committed using AR-15s, AK-47s and other semi-automatic long arms.

This figure is a decrease from 2013.

In comparison, AR-15s are used far less often in murders than shotguns, a fact which contradicts Vice President Joe Biden who once implied otherwise.

That isn’t that surprising considering the recent study by the University of Chicago Crime Lab which revealed that AR-15s and AK-47s are unpopular amongst criminals.

Overall the number of murders involving guns has plunged from 8,855 in 2012 to 8,454 in 2013 and now 8,124 in 2014, following a significant decline in gun-related violent crimes since the mid-1990s.

“…The 2014 estimated violent crime total was 6.9 percent below the 2010 level and 16.2 percent below the 2005 level,” the FBI stated.

Guns are used exponentially more often to stop crime than to kill; each year firearms prevent an estimated 2.5 million crimes in the U.S., usually without a shot being fired, meaning that guns are used over 300 times more often to save innocent lives, given the 8,124 murders committed with firearms in 2014.

It’s also been estimated that over 56 million people have died due to gun control in the last century, according to Gun Owners of America:

In 1911, Turkey established gun control. Subsequently, from 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, deprived of the means to defend themselves, were rounded up and killed. In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. Then, from 1929 to 1953, approximately 20 millon dissidents were rounded up and killed. In 1938 Germany established gun control. From 1939 to 1945 over 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, mentally ill, union leaders, Catholics and others, unable to fire a shot in protest, were rounded up and killed. In 1935, China established gun control. Subsequently, between 1948 and 1952, over 20 million dissidents were rounded up and killed. In 1956, Cambodia enshrined gun control. In just two years (1975-1977) over one million “educated” people were rounded up and killed. In 1964, Guatemala locked in gun control. From 1964 to 1981, over 100,000 Mayan Indians were rounded up and killed as a result of their inability to defend themselves. In 1970, Uganda embraced gun control. Over the next nine years over 300,000 Christians were rounded up and killed.

Scott announced the new measure at a press conference Friday, adding that military and law enforcement members would be exempt.

“We will require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older,” Scott said. “There will be exceptions for active duty and reserve military and spouses, National Guard members, and law enforcement.”

The previous minimum age required to buy a firearm was 18.

The governor added the state would also allocate $500 million to improving school safety, after a 19-year-old gunman killed 17 at a Florida high school last week.

Most of the money will be used to bolster school security, including adding police officers or sheriffs to schools, bulletproof glass, steel doors and metal detectors for some schools.

Scott’s plan would also add a mental health counselor to schools and open a hotline for students to be able to anonymously report concerning behavior.

“Anyone who has an injunction for protection against stalking, cyberstalking, dating violence, repeat violence, sexual violence, or domestic violence would be prohibited from purchasing a gun for at least 60 days,” reports Washington Examiner.

The plan also dedicates $50 million toward improving mental health for Floridians.

“I want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who has mental issues to use a gun. I want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who is a danger to themselves or others to use a gun,” Scott stated.

“I want to create a new program in Florida. I call it the Violent Threat Restraining Order. This concept is very simple and very common sense in my view. This will allow a court to prohibit a violent or mentally ill person from purchasing or possessing a firearm or any other weapon when either a family member, a community welfare expert, or a law enforcement officer files a sworn request and presents evidence to the court of a threat of violence involving firearms or other weapons.”

Additionally, the plan also bans bump-stock modifications for rifles.

Nationally, the President has called for strengthening background checks and potentially arming educators, but at a CPAC speech Friday Trump warned that Democrats would try to “take away your Second Amendment” if they prevail in mid-term elections.

The argument particularly made little sense in this case given that reports quoting law enforcement suggested that suspected killer Dylann Storm Roof was given the gun used in the shooting spree by his father as a gift, when Roof was ineligible to own a firearm due to drug related crimes.

The story then evolved into Dylann STOLE the gun, a Glock, from his parents.

In either case, laws were flouted, and further restricting the rights of law abiding Americans would have done NOTHING to prevent this from happening.

CNN reports today, however, that in actual fact, the shooter BOUGHT the gun he used himself:

He himself bought the .45-caliber handgun used in the shooting last April at a Charleston gun store, according to the two officials. Earlier, a senior law enforcement official had indicated that [his] father bought him a Glock firearm for his birthday. […] His grandfather says that Roof was given “birthday money” and that the family didn’t know what Roof did with it.

If this information is accurate, it means that Roof passed a background check in a gun store, a check that gun control advocates want to see applied to ALL transactions, public and private.

This begs the question then, if background checks on all firearm transactions are the one stop solution to gun crime, then how did Roof, a known felon, pass the background check that we are told over and over again is the key to reducing gun violence?

Indeed, it is the case that the majority of other mass shooters in recent years managed to buy the firearms they used legally after passing background checks.

The shooters at Virginia Tech, the Aurora Colorado movie theater, Fort Hood, Isla Vista, the Washington Navy Yard, the attempted mass killing at Arapahoe High School ALL passed background checks.

The shooter at Washington Navy Yard even managed to buy his firearm after the background check system was supposedly strengthened following the incident at Virgina Tech.

The fact is that criminals break the laws, and it seems the laws don’t work anyway. Further infringing on the rights of those who abide by the laws will not change either of these situations.

BREAKING: Democrat Admits Obama Agenda Is Total Gun Ban

The New York State Police are suspending the handgun permits of people in the state who are prescribed anti-anxiety medication, according to Jim Tresmond of the Tresmond Law Firm in Hamburg, New York. Tresmond Law specializes in firearm litigation.

“We are representing a client right now who is impacted by this onerous activity of the government,” Tresmond told WBEN, a news talk radio station in Buffalo, New York.

“We were flummoxed by this whole matter,” the attorney said. “The HIPPA act is supposed to prevent this kind of thing from happening. It’s a gross invasion of our privacy rights.”

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Tresmond said the New York State Police are responsible for taking action against legal firearms owners. “Based on information the county received from the New York State Police, they’ve suspended the permits. The State Police instigates the proceedings.”

Section 9.46 of the NY SAFE Act of 2013 authorizes therapists, doctors, nurses and social workers to report patients they determine may engage in conduct that may result in harm to self or others. If a determination is made that the person in question poses a threat, the provision permits the government to confiscate firearms. The provision is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment and the legal standard of probable cause.

Experts said many mental health providers will likely ignore the provision.

NY SAFE was passed by the New York State Legislature on January 15, 2013, and was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo the same day."

In what is being referred to as a landmark ruling, Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis denied a request by Remington Arms Co., Bushmaster and others to dismiss the suit submitted by 10 Sandy Hook victims’ families.

Asserting the court has the proper jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit, Bellis said the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) which ordinarily shields firearm companies from legal liability does not meet “legal sufficiency” to nullify claims made by the families.

“The court concludes that any immunity that PLCAA may provide does not implicate this court’s subject matter jurisdiction,” Bellis wrote according to The Independent. “Accordingly, the defendants’ motions to dismiss, in which they claim that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, cannot be granted on the basis of PLCAA.”

Judge Bellis added that her ruling did not affect claims from the plaintiffs that “negligent entrustment” is an exception to the PLCAA, or claims from defendants that the PLCAA provides them immunity.

Regardless, lawyers for the plaintiffs celebrated the ruling, calling it a “huge victory for the Sandy Hook families.”

“We are thrilled that the gun companies’ motion to dismiss was denied,” a lawyer representing the families said. “The families look forward to continuing their fight in court.”

A few findings by Congress regarding the PLCAA, found in 15 U.S. Code § 7901 (a), make note that firearm manufacturers should not be held liable for harm caused by their products:

(5) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to the public of firearms or ammunition products that have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and should not, be liable for the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended. (6) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation’s laws, threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional right and civil liberty, invites the disassembly and destabilization of other industries and economic sectors lawfully competing in the free enterprise system of the United States, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreign commerce of the United States.

“Bellis ordered participating lawyers to her courtroom on April 19 for a status conference,” reports the Connecticut Post. “But an appeal of the decision could sidetrack the issue, particularly any action by manufacturers filed in federal court. Calls to attorneys for the gun makers were not immediately returned Thursday.”"

February 25, 2014

The State of Connecticut is now demanding that gun owners across the state turn in all newly-banned, unregistered firearms and magazines or face felony arrest.

The State Police Special Licensing & Firearms Unit began mailing out notices to gun owners who attempted to register their firearms and accessories with the state but did not do so in time for the Jan. 1 deadline of Connecticut’s newly enacted gun control law.

The law bans the sale of magazines holding over 10 rounds and “assault rifles” manufactured after 1994 and requires that residents who possessed either before the ban to register them with the state.

“We are returning your application for [an] assault rifle certificate and/or [a] large capacity magazine declaration because it was not received or postmarked prior to January 1, 2014 as required by law,” the notice states.

The letter breaks down the gun owner’s “options,” including surrendering their firearms and magazines to the police, selling them to a gun dealer, removing them from the state or rendering them inoperable.

Because these owners attempted to register their guns and accessories, the state can now prosecute them at will because they know exactly who they are.

But when it comes to the vast majority of gun owners who did not register at all, Connecticut lacks clout.

Last month it was revealed that out of the over 2.4 million high-capacity magazines in Connecticut, only 38,000 have been registered.

“So, where did these millions of magazines go?” reporter Warner Todd Huston asked. “All that can be said is that it appears that gun owners in Connecticut are not quite the sheep that jackbooted government officials may have imagined they were.”

“After all, if there really were millions of high capacity magazines in the state – and it is very likely that there are – and they have now gone unregistered, that means that thousands of gun owners have refused to bow to this unconstitutional, anti-Second Amendment law.”

Likewise, only 50,000 semiautomatic rifles were also registered, further proof that Connecticut’s gun owners are revolting through civil disobedience.

These gun owners correctly realize that registration only leads to confiscation and that the overall agenda of gun control is to completely ban private gun ownership.

Last year, the New York Police Department began confiscating guns which were previously registered but are now banned under New York’s newest gun control law.

The NYPD knew exactly which gun owners to target by using the city’s centralized firearms registry which was already in place.

Connecticut’s anti-gun politicians want their own registry so they can eventually confiscate firearms in the exact same manner.

According to Fox 2 Now St. Louis, the incident all began in late 2013 when the councilwoman, Janet Dixon, retaliated against officers for arresting her drug-dealing son.

The councilwoman’s son, Terrance Dixon, who admitted to selling crack-cocaine and heroin out of his home following a drug raid arrest, was given probation after the city council fired all three officers involved in his arrest.

Although the officers were quickly reinstated, one of the officers involved was fired yet again after investigating a domestic violence call the following year that involved none other than Terrance.

Police dash cam video shows Councilwoman Dixon running from Terrance’s residence and putting the alleged female victim into a vehicle before telling the officer “this will be your last paycheck.”

Police reports reveal the alleged victim had contacted officers previously saying Terrance regularly beat her but that “his momma got him out of it.”

Councilwoman Dixon filed a protection order against the fired officer two days after the encounter, telling a local judge that he had threatened to “kill” her “black ass.”

A St. Louis intelligence officer approached the judge following Dixon and revealed that he had traced the officer’s phone location during an investigation into Dixon’s claims. The trace uncovered that the officer was nowhere near Dixon as she had claimed, resulting in the case being dismissed by the judge.

The situation finally came to a head Monday when the city council voted to fire the department’s 23 officers, alleging budget constraints were solely to blame.

Interestingly enough, Councilwoman Janet Dixon had been arrested that very day on suspicion of possessing a firearm with the serial numbers removed. Only four hours after being released from jail, Dixon met with fellow councilmembers and reportedly spearheaded the decision to disband the department.

According to LEOAffairs.com, now-former Wellston Police Chief G.T. Walker argues that the decision was rooted almost entirely in “dirty politics.”

Linda Garner, a councilwoman who voted against the decision, also noted that the vote was made without any public input whatsoever.

The “North County Co-Operative,” a group of officers from neighboring Vinita Park and Vinita Terrace, will now police the Wellston area according to Fox 2.

In yet another example of the massive gap between the American people’s perception of what is going on around them (whether by propaganda channels or simply cognitive bias) and the actual reality, Reuters reports that while gun-related homicides are down 39% from the 1993 peak, only 12% of people believe that gun crimes have fallen. Non-fatal firearm crimes declined by 69% to 467,300 in the same period but 56% of Americans believe that gun crime is higher now than it was 20 years ago, the Pew Research Center said its poll showed. The dichotomy between record food stamp usage (and non-employment) and multi-year highs in consumer sentiment comes to mind – we wonder which is more ‘real’.

Highlights of the report:

– Firearm-related homicides declined 39%, from 18,253 in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011.

– Nonfatal firearm crimes declined 69%, from 1.5 million victimizations in 1993 to 467,300 victimizations in 2011.

– For both fatal and nonfatal firearm victimizations, the majority of the decline occurred during the 10-year period from 1993 to 2002.

– Firearm violence accounted for about 70% of all homicides and less than 10% of all nonfatal violent crime from 1993 to 2011.

– About 70% to 80% of firearm homicides and 90% of nonfatal firearm victimizations were committed with a handgun from 1993 to 2011.

– From 1993 to 2010, males, blacks, and persons ages 18 to 24 had the highest rates of firearm homicide.

– In 2007-11, about 23% of victims of nonfatal firearm crime were injured.

– About 61% of nonfatal firearm violence was reported to the police in 2007-11.

– In 2007-11, less than 1% of victims in all nonfatal violent crimes reported using a firearm to defend themselves during the incident.

– In 2004, among state prison inmates who possessed a gun at the time of offense, less than 2% bought their firearm at a flea market or gun show and 40% obtained their firearm from an illegal source.

– Males, blacks, and persons ages 18 to 24 were most likely to be victims of firearm violence

March 7, 2013

During the Senate Judiciary meeting today to markup a potpourri of bills designed to deny the American people their rights under the Second Amendment and disarm them, Senator Dianne Feinstein opposed an amendment to her so-called assault weapons ban legislation that would allow veterans to continue buying firearms the bill would outlaw.

Feinstein basically said all veterans have PTSD and should have their Second Amendment stripped. In response to the amendment, she said the following:

…this adds an exemption of retired military. As I understand our bill, no issue has arose in this regard during the 10 years the expired ban was effect… and what we did in the other bill was exempt possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States… that included active military. The problem with expanding this is that you know with the advent of PTSD, which I think is a new phenomenon as a product of the Iraq War, it’s not clear how the seller or transferrer of a firearm covered by this bill would verify that an individual was a member, or a veteran, and that there was no impairment of that individual with respect to having a weapon like this. So you know I would be happy to sit down with you again and see if we could work something out but I think we have to — if you’re going to do this, find a way that veterans who are incapacitated for one reason or another mentally don’t have access to this kind of weapon.

The comments are included in the C-Span video below.

Thankfully, Feinstein’s bill will most certainly be dead on arrival and – for now – the American people (with the exception of Americans unfortunate enough to live in New York state) will have their Second Amendment rights spared.

Feinstein’s remark, however, reveals a deep-seated mistrust and contempt for America’s veterans. It also reveals the fear by government of the revolutionary potential of veterans, a fear dutifully expressed by the Department of Homeland Security when it said returning veterans are “right wing extremists” who may challenge the government.

Incidentally, Feinstein is way off the mark. Although PTSD is a relatively new definition, soldiers returning from combat have experienced anxiety disorders since time immemorial. It is nothing new. She is merely exploiting a modern psychology term in order to add substance to her argument that veterans are insane and as such must have their Second Amendment rights nullified."

The same day the proposal was released, on a Friday of a three day holiday weekend, ATF opened up a shortened 30-day period for the public to submit comments about the new regulation.

But it turns out, ATF has been working on a ban of AR-15 “green-tip” ammunition for quite some time and has already issued the ban in its new, 2014 Regulation Guide. For reference, ATF Regulation Guides come out approximately every ten years.

When you take a look at the 2005 ATF Regulation Guide, you’ll see an exemption for AR-15 “green-tip” ammunition, which means it exempted from the definition of “armor piercing” and therefore is legal on the federal level.

When you look at the last page of the new, most recent ATF 2014 Regulation Guide, which was published in January, there is no longer an exemption for AR-15 “green-tip” ammunition.

The federal agency announced its intention to ban sales of M855 “green tip” bullets, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

Gun stores quickly reported a run on the ammunition, with suppliers unable to keep up with the demand. The buying frenzy has also sent prices skyrocketing, as Liberty Arms Manager Colton May explained to CBS News.

“Ten to 11 bucks, you know, for a box of 20,” May said. “Now I’ve seen it priced for 20 bucks, even higher and that’s just a small batch of ammunition.”

May added that the scare had prompted all kinds of semi-auto ammunition to fly off the shelves, noting that he had sold 6,000 to 7,000 rounds of 2.23 mm or 5.56 mm just on Friday alone.

Some stores, such as Guns on 41 in Ft. Myers, Florida, are reporting that they are selling around 20 times the normal volume of the bullets.

Jack Lesher, owner of Chuck’s Firearms in Atlanta, told CBS that the proposed ban was part of a plan to eventually prohibit all AR-15 ammo.

CBS News put the rush down to “angry gun enthusiasts” who were trying to stockpile the bullets before any potential ban on sales is implemented. A more sober analysis is that the shortages are being caused by the ATF’s second amendment-busting proposal, and not by the emotional state of gun owners.

As we reported yesterday, gun stores in South Carolina, Indiana, Anchorage, Florida, and Springfield, Missouri are all reporting that they have completely sold out of the ammunition.

According to Jamey Ray at Van’s Sporting Goods and Deer Processing in Brandon, Mississippi, suppliers are also completely out of stock.

“There is no distribution of it right now,” Ray told the Clarion Ledger.

The Obama administration publicly addressed the controversy yesterday, with White House press secretary Josh Earnest asserting that the proposed ban was a “common sense step” to protect law enforcement officers.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte penned a bipartisan letter to the administration asserting that the ban would, “Interfere with Second Amendment rights by disrupting the market for ammunition that law-abiding Americans use for sporting and other legitimate purposes.”

The ATF is taking public comments on the proposed ban until March 16.

Rep. Jeff Duncan wants to know why IRS law enforcement agents are training with AR-15 rifles.

As chairman of the House Homeland Security oversight subcommittee, Duncan (R-S.C.) toured a federal law enforcement facility in late May and noticed agents training with the semi-automatic weapons at a firing range. They identified themselves as IRS, he said.

“When I left there, it’s been bugging me for weeks now, why IRS agents are training with a semi-automatic rifle AR-15, which has stand-off capability,” Duncan told POLITICO. “Are Americans that much of a target that you need that kind of capability?”

While Duncan acknowledges that the IRS has an enforcement division, he questions if that level of firepower is appropriate when they could coordinate operations with other agencies, like the FBI, especially in a time of austerity.

After all, perhaps there is a reason that Barack Obama has been branded the world’s greatest gun salesman.

That’s the feeling that gun dealer, historian and author Martin KA Morgan has developed – after watching Americans turn feverishly towards buying up semi-automatic “assault weapons” in the wake of Clinton’s 1994 assault weapons ban.

Before that? Hardly anybody was focused on or buying these guns, and there wasn’t much to say about them.

via the London Guardian:

US author and historian says allure of the taboo may explain why measures such as the 1994 assault weapon ban led to an explosion in popularity When Martin KA Morgan was a kid in the 1970s, military-style rifles were only a “small sliver” of the firearms market in the United States. More than twenty years later, Morgan said, American firearm ownership has been radically transformed. “Semi-automatic, magazine-fed rifles – they dominate the market,” he said. […] By 1994, the Clinton administration was close to passing a federal assault weapon ban… In the months before the 1994 crime bill, which included an assault weapon ban, passed, “there was a mad scramble among the shooting public” […] “I believe that we can assign Freudian psychology to it,” he said… Today, Morgan believes, the popularity of military-style guns “continues to be driven by the ban concept”.

Of course, that doesn’t change the fact that many of the worst villains in government are indeed dead set on stripping down the 2nd Amendment until is has no real meaning.

The attempts at gun control are sincere, in a sense, but they are also quite frightening – perhaps intentionally.

On Wall Street and in the realm of economic crashes, there is money to be made on the way up, and on the way down. The manipulation of all phases of a bubble is key to those who would make a fortune off of the misery of others; it is the essential Machiavellian stroke.

Here, with firearms like the AR-15, a huge money making opportunity has developed around the mad dash to stock up on guns and ammo before and in case of new legislation banning “assault weapons” or anything else.

Perhaps it should come as no real surprise that many of the biggest gun control liberals on Capitol Hill secretly have stocks in gun manufacturers and ammunition supplies, as well as the raw materials.

Many of them hide behind the fact that funds they invest in have such diverse holdings that a bit of firearms-funding is all-but unavoidable.

Nonetheless, intentional or not, President Obama and cohorts like the Brady Center, Sen. Diane Feinstein, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros and plenty of others are driving sales of the very guns that they despise in the hands of citizens:

The Washington Post estimated last year that Barack Obama had given the gun industry at least a $9bn billion boost, in part because of his high-profile advocacy for gun control in the wake of a series of mass shootings in 2012. Gun sales have spiked since the very beginning of Obama’s presidency, with record-breaking sales in recent months, and the trend seems likely to continue if Hillary Clinton occupies the White House.

The question is: why? There is definitely a deception at hand.

Maybe it isn’t fair to apply the saying that a sucker is born every minute, but it is clear that the herd is being fleeced to some degree. Wallets open, and FBI background checks go crazy every time Obama opens his mouth or signs his pen regarding gun control.

More accurately, a populace that is rightly fearful that its 2nd Amendment rights are under threat also make good consumers/ easy marks during their time of greatest fear.

Word on the street is that a shorting of the market, dumping of the stocks and/or drastic tightening of the supply (particularly with ammo) may soon be at hand.

Could it get any more conspiratorial?

Watch wisely, and keep and bear arms like your liberty depends upon it."

“We hope that the Bureau will swiftly review comments on the proposed framework and issue a revised proposal that will address the danger posed by handguns that fire 5.56mm and other rifle ammunition,” Democrats said in a letter to the director of ATF.

The public comment period for the proposed ban ends Monday.

“It is critical to update this legislation as new technologies are developed in order to keep law enforcement officers and our communities safe,” the Democrats continue. “That is why we urge you not to drag out this delay and to act swiftly to keep armor-piercing ammunition that can be used in handguns off the street.”

In an effort to overstep the agency and ignore public opposition to the effort to outlaw the popular ammunition, New York Democrat Rep. Eliot Engel introduced legislation that would outlaw the M855 outright. Engel and the Democrats insist no one other than police and the military the ammo.

Congressional Democrats argue an “out-of-touch gun industry lobby is fighting tooth and nail to keep cop-killing ammunition on the streets.” They also claim “to speak up on behalf of our police officers” who believe upholding the Second Amendment is “madness.”

Despite the rhetoric, the ammunition in question does not threaten police.

“Any ammunition is of concern to police in the wrong hands, but this specific round has historically not posed a law enforcement problem,” James Pasco, executive director of the Washington office of the Fraternal Order of Police, the world’s largest organization, said earlier this month.

The BATFE, however, disagrees and says not only the M855 threatens police, but all 5.56 ammunition does. Last week BATFE Director B. Todd Jones testified before a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing:"

Earlier this week, a Tucson, Arizona, radio talk show host posted a photo of former Congressman Gabby Giffords posing with the dreaded AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.

The photo was taken in October, 2010, prior to Giffords suffering a near fatal gun wound to the head during a political event in January, 2011.

On Thursday, Breitbart News confirmed the photo is real through Arizona law enforcement. The source requested anonymity and said the photo was taken for campaign purposes.

Giffords has admitted the photograph is authentic.

“We were told she wanted to toughen her image,” the source told Breitbart News. “She asked to come out and she wanted to shoot a rifle. She had one of our guys out there to show her how to shoot an AR-15.”

Following the shootings at the Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Connecticut, Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, formed an organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions. The group has called for rolling back the Second Amendment and outlawing semiautomatic “assault” weapons like the AR-15 Giffords posed with in the photograph.

On March 5, Kelly bought an AR-15 and a semiautomatic handgun at a police supply store in Tucson. After Breitbart News received a tip on the purchase, Kelly posted on Facebook saying he intends to turn “it over to the Tucson PD.” In addition to the AR-15, a witness told Breitbart News Kelly also bought a so-called “high-capacity” magazine for the firearm.

The liberal media, including AOL Huffington Post, reported that Kelly bought the AR-15 in order to demonstrate how easy it is to purchase the weapon. “Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes… We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole,” he wrote on his Facebook page.

Kelly told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on March 11 he bought the firearm to show how unobtrusive background checks are.

He told Blitzer it was “important for me to have firsthand knowledge about how easy it is or difficult it is to buy a weapon like that,” and argued for closing down to the so-called “gun show and private seller loop hole,” in other words he wants the government to criminalize private sales between individuals."

Last week, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its intention to ban sales of the ammunition, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

Fearful that this is just the first step towards the eventual goal of banning semi-automatic rifles altogether, gun owners have responded by stockpiling the bullets, which are the cheapest available for AR-15’s, prompting nationwide shortages.

“Oh we sold out of it in two days, every bit of it I had,” said Chuck Scott, owner of the Aiken Gun Rack and Range in Aiken, S.C., adding that the ATF’s proposal had created a a buying frenzy and panic.

Scott noted that the feds were, “banning something that’s going to affect hundreds of thousands of sports shooters, it’s rarely ever used in a crime.”

“Once they get this bullet off the market they’ll go for the next and the next,” remarked Mike Ludwiksowski, a keen hunter.

His sentiments were echoed by another gun owner in Oklahoma, who told News 9, “I think it’s them just trying to do little bits and pieces to get to their ultimate goal to ban tactical style rifles.”

Blue Buchanan, owner of Wilshire Gun in Oklahoma, said the ATF’s announcement had prompted a rush of customers wanting to purchase AR-15 ammo.

“Especially over the last two days we’ve had a large run on 5.56 and 223 ammo. We’ve sold much more than we normally do,” remarked Buchanan, adding, “The distributors are pretty much sold out so what we have is what we have for a while until the panic dies down.”

As we previously reported, gun stores in Indiana, Anchorage, Florida, and Springfield, Missouri are all reporting that they have completely sold out of the ammunition.

The ATF is taking public comments on the proposed ban until March 16. Congressman Tom Rooney has introduced legislation to stop its implementation, while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has authored a bipartisan letter to President Obama and has vowed to fight the issue in the courts if necessary.

Gun grabbers who want to ban the AR-15 might want to talk to Jonathan Haith.

The North Carolina resident who was confronted by a pistol-wielding home invader escaped injury or death when the man missed with the one shot he got.

Haith and his semi-automatic didn’t miss – which means he’s alive and the home invader is behind bars after hospital treatment, according toWTVD, the ABC affiliate in Raleigh.

Haith, of Henderson, told the station he was awakened about 9:15 a.m. Monday by someone banging on his door. Eventually, the door was broken in and Hath took the rifle he keeps under his bed into the hallway.

There, he confronted the home invader who was crouched in a shooting stance and fired once. The bullet missed Haith and lodged in the wall behind him. Haith returned fire and hit the mark. The bullet went through the man’s shoulder and hit another wall.

As the wounded intruder fled up the street before collapsing, a vehicle pulled out of Haith’s yard to pick up the man, WTVD reported.

By then, Haith had called 911.

The wounded man was treated and released into custody, WTVD reported. The driver of the car that picked him up is being charged as an accessory.

And Haith going on with his life.

The AR-15 is at the top of the list for libs when it comes to the guns they want to round up. Maybe they have a better idea of handling a home invader?"

No one has the right to tell you, you can’t publish a book because you might libel somebody. Nobody tells you, you can’t own an automobile because there might be an accident. And nobody should tell you, you can’t own a gun because it might be misused.

If somebody is libel, they have recourse in the courts. If somebody causes an accident with an automobile, this can be dealt with in the courts. The same way with a gun. If a gun is misused, it should be dealt with in the courts.

Unfortunately, government doesn’t enforce the law against those individuals who commit violent crimes. 70 percent of the crimes in this country are committed by individuals who have prior criminal records.

This gun sure looks deadly, but it’s not the least bit deadly unless I point it at someone and pull the trigger.

In the words of Thomas Jefferson, he said that we were “endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights,” and among those rights is our right to defend ourselves, defend our family, and to defend our property.

Unfortunately, in every society, there are those individuals who will resort to force to get what they want. It’s impossible to have a policeman on every corner to protect us, so; therefore, it is very important that we maintain the right to defend ourselves.

I think it’s important that we look at the Second Amendment in the context of the entire Bill of Rights. Our freedoms are based on a philosophy called the Libertarian philosophy. That means we have a right to own anything we want, including guns, as long as we harm no other person.

The Constitution gives us that right. The best way to protect that right is to exercise it. If we sacrifice our liberty in the pursuit of safety, we’ll lose our safety and our liberty.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday the ATF’s ban of M855 AR-15 ammunition is a “common-sense step.”

“We are looking at additional ways to protect our brave men and women in law enforcement, and believe that this process is valuable for that reason alone,” he said.

But of the 12,253 murders reported by the FBI in 2013 (the most recent data available,) only 285, or 2.3%, were committed using rifles, including long arms such as bolt-action and single-shot rifles, meaning that semi-automatic AR-15s would account for less than 2.3% of all murders.

In fact, shotguns, which Vice President Joe Biden famously suggested women should use instead of AR-15s, were used more often in murders than AR-15s.

Overall, the use of rifles in murders decreased since 2012, when long arms accounted for a still minuscule 2.5%.

The number of murders involving guns in general plunged from 8,855 in 2012 to 8,454 in 2013, following a steep decline in gun-related violent crimes since the mid-1990s.

Last week we reported the ATF was trying to ban M855 AR-15 ammunition popular with sport shooters by declaring it “armor piercing,” despite the ammo containing lead which exempts it from the classification according to law.

To be considered “armor piercing” under 18 U.S.C. 921 (a)(17)(B), a bullet must have an entirely metal core or have a jacket weighing more than 25% of its weight, which wouldn’t include M855 rounds because their bullets are partly lead.

“While M855 has carried the exemption from a 1986 prohibition on manufacture, importation and sale, (but not possession) of ‘armor piercing’ rounds, it’s clear from the definition that it should have never needed to be ‘exempted,’” Bryan Black of Itstactical.com wrote.

“We’re doing a lot more with lasers,” said Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall, director of the Surface Warfare Division, at the Surface Naval Association national symposium earlier this month.

Unlike traditional naval guns, Laser Weapon Systems, known as LaWS in military jargon, are measured in kilowatts as opposed to caliber. The Navy plans to test fire a 150 kilowatt laser weapon off a ship within a year. “Then a year later, we’ll have that on a carrier or a destroyer or both,” said Boxall.

The 150 kilowatt weapon is a massive upgrade from the 30 kilowatt AN/SEQ-3 (also known as the XN-1 LaWS) currently deployed on the USS Ponce. The AN/SEQ-3 was first deployed in 2014, and is available to the ship’s commander as a defensive weapon to shoot down incoming missiles, drones, boats and other potential threats.

To put the weapon’s power in perspective, 150 kilowatt is enough energy to power 1,500 modern light bulbs.

Laser weapons offer advantages that traditional kinetic weapons do not. LaWS systems are extremely precise, have a low cost per shot and do not require ammunition. Like the lasers seen in Star Trek, they can also fire in a sustained pulse.

Impressive as the LaWS may be, it requires a massive amount of power to operate.

“The Navy will be looking at ships’ servers to provide three times that much power,” Donald Klick, director of business development for DRS Power and Control Technologies, told Scout Warrior. “To be putting out 150 kws, they (the weapons) will be consuming 450 kws.”

The LaWS huge power requirement would overtax the energy resources of most navy ships, meaning they may require an “energy magazine,” according to a Naval Postgraduate School paper titled “Power Systems and Energy Storage Modeling for Directed Energy Weapons” by Jeremy Sylvester. Theoretically, such a magazine would be made of batteries, capacitors or flywheels and would recharge between pulses.

Once the energy issues are worked out, LaWS systems could prove to be a crucial mainstay in the military’s arsenal. The weapons could be particularly useful against swarm threats posed by drones and fast-attack boats, threats which are being explored by adversaries like Iran and China. Additionally, the laser weapons could see deployment on other platforms, such as aircraft.

“We’re looking at Air Force Special Forces on a C-130. You have to strike a car, but you’re worried about collateral damage,” said Klick. “With that pinpoint accuracy, you don’t have to worry about collateral damage. You can just cause a car to stop running. There’s a lot more capability.”"

The Iranian Fars News Agency reports “A group of Iraqi popular forces known as Al-Hashad Al-Shabi shot down a US Army helicopter that was carrying weapons for the ISIL in the western parts of Al-Baqdadi region in Al-Anbar province” last week.

The report claims that the fighters posted a picture (see above) online of the downed chopper and the weapons that were recovered.

The claims comes on the heels of reports last week that the Iraq Army shot down two British planes also delivering weapons to the Islamic State.

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

Hakem al-Zameli, a senior Iraqi legislator, added that the current government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from security forces in al-Anbar province about flights airdropping weapons to ISIS.

The reason for the drops, according to the legislator, is to prolong a chaotic situation in Anbar Province.

Last week, video was also released claiming to show a US Chinook helicopter dropping two boxes full of weapons for ISIS by flying at a low altitude in an extremist controlled area south of Fallujah. The footage is said to have been filmed by the Iraq-based Hezbollah Brigades.

There were even reports that some US helicopters landed in Fallujah, a main base of ISIS linked Takfiri militants in Iraq. Iraqi lawmakers have urged the government to open an investigation into the matter.

The claims of the US and the UK supplying weapons to ISIS extremists have now been ongoing for some time.

It is certainly evident that US made weapons have fallen into ISIS hands on multiple occasions.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the al-Ahad news website quoted the head of the al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying recently.

Weapons made in Europe and Israel were also discovered in Ramadi, Tarmouz said.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations,” he said.

Paul Joseph Watson

Prison Planet

September 9, 2008

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward revealed to Larry King last night that the U.S. has embarked on a “secret killing program” in Iraq which has dramatically reduced attacks on coalition troops by wiping out terrorists, but what could this secret weapon possibly be?

A CNN report details Woodward’s revelations.

The program — which Woodward compares to the World War II era Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb — must remain secret for now or it would “get people killed,” Woodward said Monday on CNN’s Larry King Live. “The top secret operations will “some day in history … be described to people’s amazement,” Woodward told King. While he would not reveal the details, Woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities. “The enemy has a heads up because they’ve been getting wiped out and a lot of them have been killed,” he said. “It’s not news to them.”

For the weapon to be comparable to the atomic bomb, one would speculate that it must employ some kind of exotic new technology and is potentially related to neutron bomb and electromagnetic weapons research.

As far back as 2002, a Cox News Service report entitled Super-Secret Microwave Weapons May Be Used In Iraq, speculated that the military was preparing to utilize high-powered microwave weapons that send bursts of electromagnetic energy which completely disable enemy electronic devices.

However, Woodward’s discussion of the secret weapon wiping out alleged terrorists in large numbers suggests it may be a far more barbaric device than an EMP weapon, which would more traditionally be used against standing armies rather than scattered insurgents.

One possibility is that the weapon is something similar that described to film maker Patrick Dillon by Iraqi infantryman Majid al-Ghazali – a frightening giant flame-thrower type device that instead shoots out “concentrated lightning bolts” or radiation bursts that result in vehicles and people being almost literally liquidized.

During a street battle in Baghdad on April 12 2003, Al-Ghazali describes witnessing American troops unveil an oddly configured tank which “suddenly let loose a blinding stream of what seemed like fire and lightning, engulfing a large passenger bus and three automobiles.”

“Within seconds the bus had become semi-molten, sagging “like a wet rag” as he put it. He said the bus rapidly melted under this withering blast, shrinking until it was a twisted blob about the dimensions of a VW bug. As if that were not bizarre enough, al-Ghazali explicitly describes seeing numerous human bodies shriveled to the size of newborn babies. By the time local street fighting ended that day, he estimates between 500 and 600 soldiers and civilians had been cooked alive as a result of the mysterious tank-mounted device.”

Al-Ghazali adds that following the battle, U.S. troops were scrupulous about burying the evidence of the weapon’s deadly consequences, but that telltale signs remained which he showed to journalist Dillon.

Dillon, a battlefield medic in Vietnam, Somalia and Kosovo, stated, “I’ve seen a freaking smorgasbord of destruction in my life, flame-throwers, napalm, white phosphorous, thermite, you name it. I know of nothing short of an H-bomb that conceivably might cause a bus to instantly liquefy or that can flash broil a human body down to the size of an infant. God pity humanity if that thing is a preview of what’s in store for the 21st century.”

An interview with Majid al-Ghazali can be viewed below along with a further exploration of exotic weapons systems being employed in Iraq. Aid workers and others have backed up reports of terrifying new weapons systems being deployed that cause horrific injuries and agonizing deaths. Woodward’s characterization of the victims merely as “terrorists” conceals the fact that a great number of the victims of these brutal weapons are no doubt innocent people caught up in the fighting."

In a press release, the Austrian police revealed security for the confab will be in operation from June 9th-14th.

A statement from the Minister of the Interior notes that in conjunction with German police, extra special police forces, known as COBRA, will be called in to operate security during the gatherings.

Pulled right out of the “fact is stranger than fiction” category, the elite special forces counterterrorism police protecting the miserly war mongering ravenous den of sociopaths is none other than COBRA.

Cobra was the name of the terrorist organization confronted by American forces in the 1985 Marvel Comic/Hasbro series G.I. Joe.

The Federal Ministry of the Interior changed the unit’s name from GEK to EKO Cobra in 2002.

The Einsatzkommando Cobra, formerly known as GEK (Gendarmerieeinsatzkommando) was formed in 1978, primarily as a response to the attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

The Interior Minister’s statement also notes police are considering “significant” traffic restrictions and even a 30-mile no-fly zone around the meeting, to include paragliders and hang gliders.

The hotel previously hosted the Bilderbergers in 1988. 2015 will mark the third time the conference has been held in Austria.

While the mainstream media habitually fails to afford Bilderberg the press coverage it demands – characterizing the group as a mere “talking shop” – innumerable examples of the organization having a direct impact on global policy have been documented in recent years, leading to charges that the group is fundamentally undemocratic in nature."

I think most right thinking people are agreed that physical effects aside, the content of the majority of TV programming today (I emphasize the word programming, a process that involves a passive receptor of information) is designed to instill a social worldview and value system that is self-centric and is in fact the opposite of what a healthy and enduring society requires. Individualism at any cost rules the day and it is more and more evident that empathy for one’s fellow citizen and a sense of personal responsibility are rapidly vanishing along with the morality that all healthy civilizations have known to be necessary for survival. Only recently a car I was traveling in was bumped from behind by a driver who was, I would guess, in his mid to late thirties, looked quite respectable and drove a new and expensive car. Rather than stop and offer his details for the damage done he feigned an apology and when our vehicle pulled off to park safely he took his opportunity to flee the scene, no doubt congratulating himself on avoiding a messy process involving insurance agencies etc. People today are only made to feel guilt when caught and exposed for their crimes. They have no higher authority to fear and the current direction of societal attitudes puts paid to that particular view often espoused that it is possible to remain moral and upstanding without religion or a guiding moral principal if you prefer. The crime figures, road rage and general attitude of fellow citizens would tend to indicate otherwise. I believe TV has much blame to shoulder for this.

People spend a lot of their spare time in front of the television. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to state that TV is a major source of many people’s opinions and views on pretty much everything. Given the amount of time people spend watching television it makes perfect sense that if you want to shape public opinion the TV is the medium par excellence by which to disseminate your information. It stands to reason then that if you agree that a movement exists, and I think a lot of people of do, whose aim is to re-make the world in man’s image, albeit a skewed and perverse one, then it makes sense for such an organization to consolidate control of the TV airwaves and turn it into a propaganda video-drome. Some might say that the proof is in the pudding, that TV is so biased toward the crude, libertine, amoral lifestyle and that the portrayal of the Christian religion, the very force that created our society, is so negative, misinformed and hostile that surely such a conspiracy exists. Now to extrapolate this thought is an article unto itself but the facts are there and the conspiracy is out in the open. To give just two examples, we have the admission by the BBC following a leaking of an internal memo wherein it was admitted that they are anti-Christ in their outlook. After complaints that BBC programming repeatedly errs on the side of sensitivity to Islam & other minorities (religious or otherwise) & bias against Christianity (especially Roman Catholicism), the British Broadcasting Corporation has admitted its guilt. A summit meeting of BBC officials culminated in admissions that “the BBC is not impartial or neutral,” as BBC political editor Andew Marr put it. The closed-door summit’s conclusions were leaked to the British newspaper The Mail on Sunday.

Having A Supply Of Healthy Foods That Last Just Makes Sense

Evidence also exists that governments control news output and content. On January 14,1983 President Reagan of the USA signed into effect directive 77 which gave the CIA and government full power to determine and control the content of news that the American public receives, news which can now be uploaded and or modified in minutes with modern technology. Goebbels would be proud. Think about it. It only takes a decision made by one chief editor to determine the news received by millions and in the US it is said that upwards of 90% of all media formats including newspapers and magazines are controlled by 3 or 4 corporations, a number which is going down as more and more news agencies are bought up and amalgamated. All an agency has do to make sure the news delivered suits a particular agenda is to put a very small number of people into the right positions.

Alex Jones, a rising star in the American “Truth Movement” is an independent syndicated radio talk-show host and investigative journalist from Austin, Texas. He has had personal contact with people from many of the US’s major news agencies like FOX and CNN and he says that many people employed with these companies don’t agree with the style and content of news produced and in fact know and believe much of it to be contrived, mis-represented or simply incorrect.

The physical way in which TV affects the brain makes it a perfect vehicle for propaganda. It’s important to note that your eyes grow directly, stem-like, from the brain. They really are the window to the soul and the perfect conduit to access the brain’s inner sanctums.

The human brain works at 4 basic frequencies. These are Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta.

Beta waves are produced when one is thinking and using one’s higher faculties and Delta is associated with sleep and/or deep trance like states. The radiant light and flicker rates of TV cause the brain to drop down to a level of activity somewhere between Alpha and Theta – essentially a sleepy dreamlike state of mind where the higher critical functions are turned off. Even if you’re reading text on a television screen the brain registers low levels of Alpha wave activity. Theta brainwaves engage inner and intuitive subconscious. You will find theta in places where you hold memories, sensations and emotions Any information therefore imbibed from the TV by-passes our logical, critically thinking sieve and goes straight into those sub areas of the mind associated with more emotive response. TV then appeals more to the emotions than the mind and of course how many of us engage in lively informed debate anymore? Very few. The more common reaction to big questions is usually an emotive response followed by a quick change in subject. TV viewing is a somatic experience which means it is “of the body, not of the mind”. I’m reminded of Huxley’s book, “Brave New World” where the drug of choice was called soma and enabled people to escape un-palatable intellectual life problems.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

{openx:49}

Psychologist Thomas Mulholland found that after just 30 seconds of watching television the brain begins to produce alpha waves, which indicates torpid (almost comatose) rates of activity. Alpha brain waves are associated with unfocused, overly receptive states of consciousness. A high occurrence of alpha wave activity does not occur normally when the eyes are open. In fact, Mulholland’s research implies that watching television is neurologically analogous to staring at a blank wall. It’s worth noting that the goal of hypnotists is to induce slow brain wave states. Alpha waves are present during the ‘light hypnotic’ state used by hypnotherapists for suggestion therapy.

The critical side of your brain is the left. As you read this you are making judgements, passing opinions and coming to conclusions which take the form of beta brain wave activity. These are the waves activated when you begin to use that left hand side, the center of logical human communication and analysis.

Researchers have found that once the television set is switched on, that left hand side and all it’s faculties tends to switch off. Instead the image from television go straight to the right brain. The switch from beta to alpha waves shows this. Alpha brain waves are the ones we associate with meditation and sleep. By no means does this mean that we are not taking the information in – we are taking it all in, we are just not able to critically evaluate it as we would with information coming from other sources.

Video Games have been shown to lower brain activity to below that of the Delta frequency!

The TV screen flicker rate alone is known to induce mesmerized states in people. This flicker rate is the rate at which the screen image is updated, generally about 50 or 60 times a second. DARPA is a US military funded research programme. One of their endeavours concerned developing TV flicker rates that could be played whenever a mesmerized state was required in a given section of the population.

Endorphins are released by overexposure to light. The radiant light from televisions causes a release of endorphins. Researcher Herbert Krugman showed that while viewers are watching television, the right hemisphere is twice as active as the left, a neurological anomaly. The crossover from left to right releases a surge of the body’s natural opiates: endorphins, which include beta-endorphins and enkephalins. Endorphins are structurally identical to opium and its derivatives (morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.). Activities that release endorphins (also called opioid peptides) are usually habit-forming (we rarely call them addictive). These include cracking knuckles and strenuous exercise. External opiates act on the same receptor sites (opioid receptors) as endorphins, so there is little difference between the two.

Even casual television viewers experience such opiate-withdrawal symptoms if they stop watching TV for a prolonged period of time. An article from South Africa’s Eastern Province Herald (October 1975) described two experiments in which people from various socio-economic milieus were asked to stop watching television. In one experiment, several families volunteered to turn off their TV’s for just one month. The poorest family gave in after one week, and the others suffered from depression, saying they felt as though they had “lost a friend.” In the other experiment, 182 West Germans agreed to kick their television viewing habit for a year, with the added bonus of payment. None could resist the urge longer than six months, and over time all of the participants showed the symptoms of opiate-withdrawal: increased anxiety, frustration, and depression.

Herbert Krugman’s research proved that watching television numbs the left brain and leaves the right brain to perform all cognitive duties. This has some harrowing implications for the effects of television on brain development and health. For one, the left hemisphere is the critical region for organizing, analyzing, and judging incoming data. The right brain treats incoming data uncritically, and it does not decode or divide information into its component parts.

Researches into the effects of TV have warned that children under two years of age shouldn’t watch any at all due to the negative impact on various areas of a child’s development which include skills of observation, speech, hearing, depth perception, reading ability, inducing attention deficit type behaviour, a lack of motor skills due to immobile viewing habits and so on. TV is a wholly inappropriate and ineffectual teaching tool. It’s pointless having debates lamenting the demise of intellectual ability and endeavour when intellects have never even had a chance to naturally and properly grow due to the numbing effects of television on children particularly.

Conversely its worth noting that radio has the opposite effect and actually develops a higher rate of concentration, the audio forcing people to be stimulated to visualize what they hear. Reading of course further extends the ability to concentrate and critically examine information over longer periods.

Even the style of TV production these days is geared toward an amphetamine-like addiction people have with regard to information reception. The cadence of scene changes, that is the rate and beat at which images are changing on the screen is very fast and further inclines the mind under development to be unable to concentrate for long periods on long pieces of textual information. Average rates of attention span are down from a few decades ago to mere minutes where once it was more than one hour for deep critical thinking.

Studies have linked quality of life to high vocabulary rates which heavy TV consumption impacts negatively. If you have good communication skills you are better able to express the world you live in and how you define it and if this is a yardstick to judge by then for many of our countries’ young folk the world must be very banal indeed. A poor vocabulary means you have a myopic existence, you have a tunnel-like perception of this great planet and your quality of life is adversely effected. Just listening to pop stars in particular, the idols of the young, can make one cringe with embarrassment at the vacuous and inarticulate clap-trap they come out with.

We live in a world today were people’s personalities are formed by unreal things: TV, the music industry, video games, movies, the effects of drugs (be that of the recreational or psychotropic variety). Virtual reality dominates the interests of a lot of people out there, even young adults and people of my own age group in their 30"

In at least one of the incidents, law enforcement officials say the gunman was motivated by recent police shootings of black men.

“Authorities in Tennessee say a man who opened fire on a highway in Tennessee targeted police officers and others because he was troubled by incidents involving black people and law enforcement officers,” the Associated Press reports.

A press release from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation says that the suspect, 37-year-old Lakeem Keon Scott, a black male, targeted only white individuals in the attack. A local newspaper carrier lost his life while three others, including the police officer, were injured by the gunfire.

Details behind the other shootings in Missouri and Georgia are unclear at the moment.

According to local reports, the Missouri officer was ambushed and shot in the neck while sitting in his police car by a black male. The suspect was later located and arrested hiding in an area home.

Motive for the ambush attack has not yet been released.

The Georgia officer, who was shot multiple times and hit in the abdomen while investigating a damaged vehicle, is also expected to survive.

Valdosta Police Chief Brian Childress similarly claimed that no motive was known at the time.

“You start to wonder. But any motive of why this happened this morning would be speculation,” he said."

If we follow the logic of Congress and use FBI statistics, the government should outlaw hammers and clubs.

According to the FBI’s annual crime statistics, the number of murders committed annually with hammers and clubs far outpaces the number of murders committed with a rifle.

Awr Hawkins, writing for Breitbart, cites the government figures: In 2005, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 445, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 605. In 2006, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 438, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 618, Hawkins writes.

Moreover, nearly twice as many people are killed by hands and fists each year than are killed by rifles.

But you won’t hear Obama, Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer and the gun-grabbers in Congress calling for outlawing and “grandfathering” hands.

The FBI stats underscore the fact that for Feinstein and crew job one is outlawing the possession of modern firearms. Preventing the murder of children comes in a distant second.

A government that kills thousands of innocents in Pakistan and Yemen and has slaughtered millions since the Vietnam War – including more than 500,000 children through disease, starvation and malnutrition in Iraq – doesn’t give a whit about the murder of school kids in Connecticut.

Feinstein’s jihad against the Second Amendment is about disarming the American people. It is about making sure the government maintains a monopoly on power."

The footage, filmed in South Gate, California shows a woman filming a group of United States Marshals on a sidewalk using her cell phone.

“I have a right to be here, you need to stay away” the woman is heard telling the officers, presumably explaining why she was filming them. She is also heard to say “I have a right as a citizen.”

One of the officers, holding an assault rifle, then slowly walks towards the woman, before charging at her, and grabbing at the phone.

The phone hits the ground with a smashing sound, and the officer kicks it aggressively at the woman, before turning away and leaving the scene.

The person filming the video from across the street is heard gasping in shock at the thug cop’s actions, as the woman notices and asks “did you record that?”

There are no further details on the video at this time.

The footage highlights the attitude police generally have to citizens recording them. Every day there are stories of police threatening and assaulting lawful Americans who hold them accountable by exercising their Constitutional right to film in public.

These cops showed up in what is clearly a well to do neighborhood, in an unmarked vehicle, armed with assault rifles. The woman filming them was clearly not impeding their activity.

The attack on her by the officer constitutes an assault.

On July 5, the Department of Homeland Security announced on the FedBizOpps.gov website that it plans to buy thirty-six Colt LE901 rifle systems. The latest DHS purchase follows a solicitation issued on July 13 for the purchase of .223 Caliber Remington Enhanced Performance Ammunition in excess of $500,000. The Colt assault weapons are designed to accept the .223 ammunition.

“The 901 is much more than your typical assault rifle,” notes the Prepper Podcast Radio Network website. The weapon will allow “the DHS/FEMA foot soldier to go from an assault rifle to picking off ‘terrorists’ at a distance by only changing the upper receiver.”

In June, FedBizOpps.gov listed a “Personal Defense Weapons Solicitation” issued by DHS calling for 5.56x45mm NATO select-fire firearms “suitable for personal defense.” The due date for the solicitation is mid-October of 2012

In April, we reported on the DHS awarding contracts to a munitions company for 450 million rounds of .40 caliber hollow point ammunition. Prior to this, the feds awarded Winchester a five year contract for 200 million rounds .40 caliber ammunition.

“I could understand if the U.S. military was ordering ammunition in this quantity. When you fight wars you can go through ammunition very rapidly,” the American Dream blog commented following the extraordinary purchase. “But the Department of Homeland Security is only supposed to be shooting at people very rarely.”

Also in April, Paul Joseph Watson reported on the DHS purchasing bullet resistant guard booths. “The purpose behind the bullet proof booths is unknown, but the DHS has publicly announced that it plans to increase the number of unannounced checkpoints manned by TSA VIPR teams and other federal agents beyond the 9300 that were set up last year alone,” Watson wrote at the time.

It looks like DHS and the feds are gearing up for something big. A growing chorus of urgent voices are warning that the economy will finally implode this year and the result with be social chaos.

In February, trends forecaster Gerald Celente told Alex Jones 2012 will witness bank runs, riots and other social dislocation as the economy collapses later this year. Celente has issued spot-on economic forecasts since 1980.

Texas Tribune

Posted December 27, 2010

The federal government wants to curb violence on the U.S.-Mexico border by requiring Texas gun dealers to inform the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives when they sell two or more “long rifles,” including military-style assault rifles like the AK-47.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

{openx:49}

As soon as next month, gun sellers with a federal firearms license in Texas could be required to furnish letters to ATF chronicling the sale of two or more semi-automatic rifles to one person within a five-day period. The policy covers guns with a caliber greater than .22 and a detachable magazine clip, including the AR-15 and AK-47s, which ATF says are increasingly being used in border crimes.

Gun rights advocates, including Gov. Rick Perry, say the policy is misguided and would unfairly target legitimate businessmen — the gun sellers — under the guise of securing the border.

“The federal government as a whole ought to be focusing instead on securing the border to prevent the trafficking of guns — and people, for that matter,” said Katherine Cesinger, a Perry spokeswoman. “The strategy and the concept is flawed.”

“It appears to be a Ruger AR-556 with several modifications.”

The suggestion that criminals are running around with chainsaw modifications on their rifles drew ridicule from conservatives on social media.

You’d think that mainstream reporters would be interviewing as many students as they can who were present at the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Fla., but no: the current media coverage is revolving around a group of teenage gun control advocates.

This coverage, spearheaded by CNN, reveals that the mainstream media is not “unbiased and objective” as it claims to be but is instead pushing an anti-gun agenda.

And this presents a problem to you, the audience. Instead of simply presenting you the facts so you can make your own, informed opinion, mainstream pundits would rather you just stop thinking and do what they say.

Just look at this tweet from CNN, for example:

Here are the 71 Florida lawmakers — all of them Republicans — who refused to vote for an assault weapons ban, along with their NRA rating https://t.co/5RFJWpMqqf pic.twitter.com/Gf47cRDLf8 — CNN (@CNN) February 21, 2018

How is that objective reporting? It’s not: it’s activism.

And if you call out the media for such slanted “reporting,” you’re demonized. You see, you’re a threat to the power structure if you think for yourself.

“After Watergate, few would have predicted today’s dynamic in which some journalists view their job not as questioning the powers that be, but undermining those who report on the powers that be,” once wrote Sharyl Attkisson, a former investigative journalist.

It’s easier to understand once you see the mainstream media as the propaganda arm of the ruling class, which operates through an interconnected network of academia, technology, entertainment, bureaucracies and, of course, media.

That’s why you’ll often see the same agenda – whether it’s “global warming” or gun control – pushed in unison by academics, Hollywood directors and news reporters.

Garner says he has sold 17 AR-15’s, the same weapon used by the Parkland shooter, in just four days alone.

As we reported yesterday, Google searches for “buy a gun” have hit an all time high, with searches for how to buy an AR-15 also hitting their biggest peak since just after Sandy Hook.

With the NRA facing a boycott campaign that has caused numerous major companies to sever connections, searches for “join NRA” are also spiking to levels not seen since December 2012.

Meanwhile, St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara will be mailing letters to 84 federal firearms licensed gun dealers in the county later today to ask them to stop selling semi-automatic weapons to anyone under 21-years-old.

Mascara is attempting to convince firearms retailers to implement the measure before it becomes law.

Gun stores have been receptive to the move, with Paramount Pawn and Jewelry owner John O’Neill asserting it’s very rare to sell one of the weapons to someone who is under the age of 21.

FLASHBACK: APD Releases Official Explanation of Gun Shows Shut Down

Peaceable Texans For Firearms Rights

September 2, 2010

(PRESS RELEASE – Download .doc) In Federal District Court on July 20, 2010, the ATF won a conviction from an Austin jury that defies logic and reason.

In a trial before Federal Judge Sam Sparks, government lawyers conceded Texas resident Paul Copeland did not know his buyer was an illegal alien, but the jury they should convict him anyway because he “had reasonable cause to believe” he was selling to an illegal alien because the two men and a boy who were present at his table at the time of the sale: 1) were Hispanic, 2) spoke Spanish, and 3) wore cowboy clothing. And the jury did as asked. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Freel acted as lead prosecutor in the case.

The firearm transaction at issue occurred on January 16, 2010, at a gunshow at the North Austin Events Center, at 10601 N. Lamar Blvd., in Austin, Texas. Undercover ATF agents followed Mr. Huerta, his son, and another Hispanic male, Hipolito Aviles, around the “Texas Gunshow” that day, and claimed to observe Huerta’s transaction. Austin P.D. used Copeland’s case as the reason to close down the gunshow, leading to a protest by Austin residents in front of APD headquarters on January 25.

FLASHBACK: APD Releases Official Explanation of Gun Shows Shut Down“Austin Police Department Firearm Review Unit detectives assisted in the Austin portion of the operation. They observed and participated in multiple arrests of prohibited persons (primarily convicted felons and illegal immigrants) that obtained firearms illegally at a local gun show. Federal convictions were obtained in a majority of the cases,” the press release states.

Mr. Copeland is a 56 year old Cedar Creek resident and Vietnam veteran who liked to buy, sell, and trade firearms as a hobby. On January 16, however, he had the misfortune to sell a handgun to Leonel Huerta Sr., who spoke both English and Spanish. Huerta Sr. negotiated his purchase from Copeland in English, showing Copeland his Texas Driver’s License. At Copeland’s trial Huerta admitted on the witness stand, that he is in the country illegally, (Huerta Sr. had previously admitted this fact to Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Agent Leo Buentello). ATF Agent Shawn Kang claimed he saw Huerta later hand off the gun to Aviles. Despite these admissions, Huerta Sr. was never arrested, charged, or deported. Instead, his presence at the gunshow was used to entrap an American citizen into an unwitting violation of a federal gun control law. Huerta Sr., who is a resident of the City of Austin, appeared as a witness at the trial, admitted he was in the country illegally before federal prosecutors and a federal judge, yet he was allowed to leave the courtroom under his own power. To date Huerta Sr. has not been prosecuted for his purchase, possession, or disposition of the handgun he bought from Copeland, while Copeland is now a convicted felon.

“Instead of busting the illegal alien for buying, they bust the citizen for selling,” commented Paul Velte, attorney and founder of Peaceable Texans for Firearms Rights, a gun-owners rights advocacy group from Austin. Velte asked, “who was in a better position to know the buyer’s immigration status, the buyer or the seller?” He also said, “What happened to Paul Copeland should enrage all Americans. The Federal Government is using illegal aliens to entrap citizens lawfully exercising their right to sell firearms. The illegal alien walks free, but the citizen gets convicted. The same government charged with controlling immigration is the one using illegal immigrants to attack its own citizens. Does this make any sense? It makes no sense unless the purpose is to discourage attendance at gunshows and frighten citizens from selling their firearms to other citizens.”

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

{openx:49}

Velte pointed out that “There is no way for a citizen to know who is here legally or not. In fact, under Austin’s ‘sanctuary city’ policy, not even the police officer at the door of the gunshow was allowed to ask a person’s immigration status, yet the average Texan inside the show is expected to assume that a person standing before them with a Texas driver’s license is in the country illegally just because they look Mexican and speak Spanish.”

Velte noted that the federal government’s lawsuit against Arizona was based on that very type of conduct: Concluding someone could be here illegally based on their looks or their language. Velte said gun owners in his group are outraged, and they want to know:

• Why is the illegal alien who purchased the gun, Leonel Huerta Sr., still living in Austin? • Why does he still have a Texas Driver’s license? • Why is ATF using illegal aliens to set up and convict American citizens? • What has he been promised for his cooperation? • Why has he not been prosecuted? He committed three distinct crimes: he purchased a firearm knowing he was an illegal alien, he possessed the firearm, and he transferred the handgun to another illegal alien (Hippolito Aviles, who was convicted and given time served on June 30, 2010). • Why has Huerta Sr. not been deported?

Starting next Thursday, Oklahomans could regularly begin seeing firearms out in plain sight wherever they go.

A new law slated to take effect Nov. 1 will allow the open carry of a loaded firearm, whether in a holster or hidden from view, as long as its owner has a concealed weapons permit.

What began as a Facebook page for people of Oklahoma interested in open carry laws to convene quickly snowballed into a lobby group that was able to spur momentum behind a bill geared to allow open carry.

On May 10, the bill cleared the Oklahoma Senate and five days later was signed into law by Governor Mary Fallin. Following the signing of the bill into law, the founders of the Facebook page formed the Oklahoma Open Carry Association (OKOCA)

Oklahoma Senator Anthony Sykes, the author of Senate Bill 1733, lauded the new law to the New York Times saying it reinforced the notion that gun owners are responsible people: “This enhances Oklahomans’ ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights…I think the evidence is clear that gun owners are some of the most responsible people, and they’ve shown that in not just Oklahoma, where we’ve had conceal carry for quite some time and there’s never been an incident, but in these other states as well.”

Come next Thursday, Oklahoma will become the 15th state in the nation to allow open carry with a permit requirement. There are 44 states that already allow open-carry in various forms."

October 24, 2013

Since at least 2001, the U.S. Department of Education has been building a massive arsenal of guns purchased through steep discounts orchestrated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Capitol Police.

The Education Department’s Office of the Inspector General somehow found it necessary to spend over $80,000 on Glock pistols and over $17,000 on Remington shotguns in the past seven years for investigations into “fraud, waste or abuse of Department of Education funds.”

In July alone, the OIG purchased 30 Glock 27s for a total of $10,800, according to documents released by Muckrock.

Overall, the Dept. of Education is estimated to have over 200 handguns and at least 27 shotguns.

The shotguns even came with Wilson Combat Sights.

“I believe the requested firearms and parts are essential for the safe, effective and efficient operations of [OIG] Investigation Services,” Mary Mitchelson, the former Dept. of Education Inspector General, wrote in a February 2010 memo.

Prior to receiving a firearm, Dept. of Education OIG special agents must complete a training course conducted by the Department of Homeland Security.

In one memo in particular, the OIG requested “10 additional Glock 27 pistols” due to an “increase in hiring.”

Ironically, the Education Dept. is not the only federal agency expanding its firepower outside of the Dept. of Justice.

Back in July, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration bought 72,000 rounds of .40 Smith & Wesson.

The year before, the National Weather Service made a solicitation for 46,000 rounds of .40 caliber jacketed hollow point ammunition.

Also in 2012, the Social Security Administration purchased 174,000 rounds of 125 grain .357 SIG hollow point ammunition to be delivered to 41 locations across America.

SIG Sauer developed the .357 SIG to be the equivalent of the powerful 125 grain .357 Magnum load in common use by lawmen throughout most of the Cold War.

The Department of Homeland Security bought so much ammo last year that it even began censoring the quantity of rounds the agency sought in its solicitations posted on the FedBizOpps web site.

It has been estimated that DHS stockpiled at least two billion rounds of ammunition, enough to sustain the war in Iraq for 24 years.

While the Dept. of Education continues to purchase guns at ease with a steep discount, law-abiding Americans on the other hand are struggling to even find firearms at retail prices in gun stores across America.

July 30, 2013

Police in Cook County, Illinois are demonstrating that, contrary to gun control proponents’ reassurances, a gun registry does eventually and inevitably lead to confiscation.

Last week, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that the Cook County Sheriff’s office has formed a special task force assigned to seek out Cook County suburb residents whose Firearm Owner’s Identification Cards have expired.

“The Chicago Police Department conducts regular missions to recover revoked FOID cards and seize guns from the holders, but there wasn’t a concerted effort to do that in Cook County’s suburbs,” Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told the Sun-Times.

In February, the team confiscated 160 FOID cards and more than 160 guns from citizens whose cards had been revoked due to any number of circumstances, including newly discovered “mental illnesses,” felonies and protection orders, which morphs their non-violent firearm ownership into unlawful activity.

According to the Sun-Times, Sheriff Dart has influenced the Illinois General Assembly to include language in a new FOID law that gives sheriffs and local police the power to obtain warrants and invade the homes of expired permit holders in order to seek out their firearms.

Dart called the provision a “hammer” which gives police the power to conduct home searches, especially when gun owners insist they aren’t in possession of any firearms.

The Illinois State Police are also handing the Cook County Sheriffs leads, telling them which homes are set to have an FOID card expire and also informing them whether those homes have recently purchased any firearms, a detail which shows up in State Police databases due to a background check run at the time of gun purchases.

In most cases, firearm owners who were legal one minute and deemed “illegal” the next will not be afforded the opportunity to explain their situations.

Cook County Police have essentially initiated an early form of pre-crime previously only witnessed in places like California. They no longer have to wait for these so-called criminals to commit actual crimes.

Instead, gun owners can now be approached so long as they’re labeled “mentally ill,” even if just offhandedly reported by overzealous neighbors for, God forbid, believing in “conspiracy theories,” or if they’ve just returned from a military tour of duty and are diagnosed as having PTSD.

Many believe persecuting gun owners one by one using a registry, rather than going door-to-door, will be the template followed in the event that a more concerted national effort goes under way.

This latest effort to masquerade authoritarian gun control as a mere public safety measure is exactly the way it is done in California, where since 2007 gun repo teams have been knocking on gun owners’ doors in hopes to retrieve their weaponry.

Despite what gun control advocates, like the Director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Mark Glaze, attempt to lead Americans to believe, a gun registry inevitably leads to gun confiscation, and in the event of national emergencies, such as witnessed during Hurricane Katrina, homes appearing on these registries will undoubtedly be the first ones to have their firearms taken.

See below how, in the event of a national emergency, the government would like everyone to be disarmed, obedient slaves.

An Oregon man riding a public bus was arrested and booked into the Multnomah County Jail Tuesday for allegedly mentioning firearms during a conversation.

According to reports, a TriMet bus driver claims to have overheard comments made by 41-year-old Patrick O’Brien Nolin, who is accused of telling another passenger that he was carrying a firearm.

TriMet police were immediately called to the scene and began approaching the bus at the intersection of Northeast 82nd Avenue and Sandy Boulevard. Preparing to board, officers suddenly received new reports claiming that Nolin was not only armed, but had his firearm “cocked and loaded.”

Police carefully made their way onto the bus before finally confronting Nolin, who it turned out had no firearm or weapon whatsoever. Despite breaking no law, police decided to arrest Nolin anyway, charging him with “Interfering With Public Transportation,” a Class A Misdemeanor. Nolin was released on his own recognizance several hours later.

According to TriMet regulations, no person, except for law enforcement, can bring or carry any firearm, knife or any other instrument, article, device, material or substance specifically designed for, or attempted to be used to, inflict or cause bodily harm to another.

As Oregon state law preempts any regulation that restricts the possession or transfer of firearms under ORS 166.170, TriMet also goes on to state that a person in possession of a weapon, that cannot be legally banned, may not display or carry the weapon in a manner which is likely to result in fear or alarm by other persons or District employees.

Regardless, Nolin’s arrest clearly illustrates the establishment’s over-the-top reaction to anything Second Amendment related. In countless examples across the country, people, mostly children, have been punished for completely legal activity.

Last April, a highly decorated military veteran was illegally detained and disarmed after an officer accused him of “rudely displaying his rifle while out on a hike with his son.

In 2012, a 5-year-old girl in Pennsylvania was suspended for making a “terroristic threat” after telling fellow students about her “Hello Kitty” toy bubble gun.

The following year, a 5-year-old Maryland boy was interrogated for 2 hours until he wet himself after bringing a toy cap gun to school.

Last September, a 9-year-old boy in Detroit was suspended indefinitely after a teacher accused him of pointing his spinning top machine like a gun."

Online retailer Cheaper Than Dirt!, one of the world’s largest sporting goods stores and a top online gun distributor, has suspended sales of firearms as of Tuesday.

According to an alert posted on its Facebook and Twitter accounts, the “temporary” suspension is effective immediately as the company reviews its policies and promotions related to online gun sales.

Cheaper Than Dirt! has temporarily suspended online sales of firearms. As a long time supporter of the Second Amendment, Cheaper Than Dirt! will continue to promote the safe and responsible use of firearms by law abiding customers. During this temporary suspension, we will review our policies and promotions.

In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings gun control advocates and politicians on both sides of the aisle have called for bans on the sale, transfer, importation and possession of semi-automatic rifles. One of the most outspoken anti-gun legislation supporters, Mayor Bloomberg of New York, pleaded with President Obama to take executive action that would essentially nullify the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Retailers like Cheaper Than Dirt! are not alone. Dick’s Sporting Goods, another large distributor of firearms, has also taken action by suspending the sale of certain rifles and removing public display cases for firearms. “During this time of national mourning we have removed all guns from sale and from display in our store nearest to Newtown and suspended the sale of modern sporting rifles in all of our stores chainwide,” says apress release on the company’s corporate website. Celebrus Capital management, an investment firm with a stake in firearms maker Freedom Group, which manufactured one of the guns used in the Newtown shooting, said it would sell its ownership in the company.

While thousands have signed an online petitition calling for new anti-gun laws, so too are thousands of Americans taking up arms, so to speak. Within minutes of the newCheaperThanDirt! policies being put into place, hundreds of comments criticizing the company’s move began flowing on social networks:

With free market retailers already bowing to the pressure of anti-gun groups, it shouldn’t be too difficult for legislators to start taking aim at the Second Amendmentthrough guns bans, as well as banning the online sale of ammunition.

The event in Newtown, CT was tragic to be sure.

Equally as tragic, however, is that millions of Americans may soon lose their right to defend their homes and their persons as a result of half-baked, emotionally driven policies and laws.

How many innocents will die once Americans are stripped of their only defense against criminals who will stop at nothing to use deadly weapons to get their way?

The solution is not to try and ban or collect the some 300 million weapons in circulation in the United States; it’s to allow Americans to carry these weapons freely, openly and in a responsible manner.

It’s that simple."

August 11, 2013

The U.S. government is developing new firearm nanotechnology that can track, disrupt, and even self-destruct firearms.

The technological system, known as a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), utilizes tiny devices that are implanted in guns and other weapons. These devices are more than chips; they are actual mechanical processes created by precision engineering that can affect the weapon’s operations. Media reports reveal the devices include miniature GPS systems designed to make guns easier to track and self-destruct systems that could cause them to explode if they receive a wireless signal.

The technology coincides with the ‘smart gun’ technology Anthony Gucciardi has broken down in the past, which can be used to ‘turn off’ weapons when in gun free zones or whenever designated by government.

Other capabilities being developed include software that could interfere with the operation of targeting systems. This could include laser sights that couldn’t lock onto a person in uniform. Another possibility is targeting systems or sights that simply stop working after a certain date or shut down if they receive a wireless signal.

GUNS THAT SELF-DESTRUCT

The scary thing is that MEMS is being developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon’s science division. The idea is that this technology will be used in weapons given to questionable allies such as the Syrian rebels, who Obama is currently funding with weapons and other resources.

DARPA actually has a program to develop what it calls ‘Vanishing Programmable Resources’; in other words, weapons that will self-destruct. The idea here is to make weapons that can be ordered to self-destruct if they fall into the wrong hands.

HIGH TECH GUN CONTROL

The scary thing is that this technology is emerging right now, and it isn’t hard to imagine law enforcement or gun control zealots demanding that such technologies be built into all guns sold to the public. That way somebody could just push a button somewhere and thousands of guns could simply explode, or the targeting systems could stop working. They could also mandate that all guns contain a tiny transmitter that would make it easy for law enforcement to track down.

This technology isn’t a fantasy; weapons expert Chris Harmer told Bloomberg Businessweek that MEMS capabilities will be built into U.S. weapons within three to five years. Businessweek also reported that the market for MEMS will soon be around $1.1 billion.

Within a few years the federal government and others could have the capability to control guns without banning them. That will mean a huge market for older guns built before this technology became available.

An alarming document sent to us by an Infantryman based out of Fort Campbell Kentucky shows that active duty military personnel are being secretly ordered to submit information to their Chain of Command on how many firearms they own privately, their location, as well of details of any Concealed Carry permits.

Though the order was apparently rescinded, the fact that active duty soldiers are being asked to submit every detail of their private firearm collection is a telltale sign that the second amendment is in dire straights. Furthermore, Alex Jones has personally confirmed that such directives are being issued all over the country.

The directive orders active duty personnel to report details of all privately-owned firearms to their Chain of Command, as well as future firearms purchases.

The memorandum was sent to us by a concerned 11B Infantryman based at Fort Campbell. In his e mail, the man expresses his shock at being ordered to comply with what amounts to a registration of privately-owned firearms.

Read the document below.

“I live off post, with my firearms (which I don’t bring on post for any reason). A very frightening thing happened at work yesterday,” he writes. “I was ordered to fill out a list containing my firearm information. This included make, model, caliber, and serial number of all firearms I currently posses. In addition, I was also required to list registration information, location of all weapons individually, and information regarding any CCW permits I posses.”

The man tried to ascertain why such information was being demanded by speaking to his First Sergeant but was told, “Just put your info on the form.”

“I don’t know how high this goes, but I am hearing that this is going on in other units at Fort Campbell as well,” writes the Infantryman. “It just seems a little coincidental to me that within 90 days: the most anti-firearm President in history is inaugurated, some of the nastiest anti-firearm laws are put on the table in Washington, and then the Army comes around wanting what amounts to a registration on all firearms, even if they are off post, and doesn’t provide any reason or purpose as to why.”

The man said he had been at Fort Campbell for almost 8 years and had never encountered anything like this directive before.

“I fear something really nasty is blowing in the wind here,” he warns.

According to a World Net Daily article, the order was stopped when it was discovered the commander was not “acting within his authority.”

However, Alex Jones has personally confirmed that bases all over the nation, including in Texas, are directing active duty personnel to provide the same information about their private gun collections.

The story emphasizes how gargantuan threats to the second amendment are not being reported by the mainstream media nor by big gun groups like the NRA.

A similarly grave threat to the second amendment is the so-called ‘No Fly, No Buy Act’, (H.R. 2401), a bill that will merge the TSA’s no-fly list with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), a point-of-sale system for determining eligibility to purchase a firearm in the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

Since the Department of Homeland Security now considers veterans, advocates of the Second Amendment, and states’ rights activists as terrorists, the ‘No Fly, No Buy’ act would effectively disarm the majority of the entire country.

The language of H.R. 2401 reads as follows: “To increase public safety and reduce the threat to domestic security by including persons who may be prevented from boarding an aircraft in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and for other purposes,” according to the Open Congress website. Govtrack.us reports that the bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary."

After two days, the New York Times finally corrected its story claiming Virginia state law blocked Aaron Alexis from buying an AR-15 rifle before his rampage at the Navy Yard. The article, however, still is not accurate.

On Tuesday, I wrote that the Times was part of the widespread effort in the liberal media to tie the AR-15 rifle to the mass murder or 12 innocent people in Washington on Monday.

The headline was — and is — “State Law Stopped Gunman From Buying Rifle, Officials Say.”

It said that the gunman was stopped from buying an AR-15 “because state law there prohibits the sale of such weapons to out-of-state buyers, according to two senior law enforcement officials.”

In fact, there is no residency requirement in federal or state law for purchase of shotguns or rifles.

Wu argued officers are woefully underequipped in the event of a terrorist attack or mass shooting, in which shooters increasingly wear body armor, which is not penetrable with standard firearms. He cited a recent FBI study that found that roughly 5 percent of mass shooters have worn such armor. Wu said that while assault-style rifles are more deadly, they’re also more accurate.

“Handguns you’d be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards,” Wu said. “With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can be go 50, 100 yards accurately.”

Mark E. Kelly, gun-control proponent and husband to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, recently purchased an AR-15 (an “assault weapon,” he called it)—which he now says he intended as an illustration of the need for more stringent gun laws.

Kelly reportedly bought the AR-15 and a 1911-style semi-automatic pistol at a gun store in Tucson, Arizona.

Breitbart News received a tip on this when Neil McCabe, editor of Guns & Patriots newsletter, contacted us on March 7 and said:

Mark E. Kelly, made purchases which included an AR-15–sometimes described as an “assault rifle”–at 3:30 pm on the afternoon of March 5 at Diamondback Police Supply, 170 S. Kolb Street, Tucson, AZ.

According to McCabe, witnesses to the purchases claimed Kelly purchased “high capacity” magazines as well.

Indeed, many have speculated on my motives in most unkind terms.

Having recently emerged from the threat of prosecution on two felony “dangerous nature” criminal charges, I can now freely address the important reasons for this protest. In brief, I must protest a now nearly institutionalized attempt to intimidate us into surrendering our civil rights to other people’s irrational fears.

We all have fears, but what do I mean by irrational fears?

Some fears are, of course, quite rational; for example, being fearful of burning your finger after touching a hot burner as a child.

But the responses to other fears are simply not based on a reasonable assessment of reality. They are are irrational.

Extreme examples can be psychotic or delusional beliefs, such as being afraid to get out of bed at night because of a fixed false belief that a ghost will emerge from the closet to harm you.

Other fears are irrational because the assessment of the likelihood of the event is completely out of proportion to reality. An example would be an unwillingness to leave the house because a meteor might strike and kill you. While a meteor could suddenly come out of the sky and kill you, it only happens 1 time in every 74.8 million years of life.

Unfortunately, our airports are now prime sites where people’s irrational responses to their fears are used as an excuse to bully, intimidate or force us into giving up our liberties.

The Air Force Research Laboratory has been working with Boeing for several years on the perfection, miniaturization and deployment of its Counter-electronics High-powered Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP), which has already been in the arsenal, but which will become increasingly central to the armed forces.

The U.S. Air Force’s confirmation that they and Boeing are developing the Counter-electronics High-powered Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP), an electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, that essentially uses microwave energy to render useless all electronics in its “blast” area without causing structural damage, trended all over the Internet last month […] “This technology marks a new era in modern-day warfare,” said Keith Coleman, Boeing Phantom Works’ CHAMP Program Manager in a Boeing video on the CHAMP test in 2012. “In the near future, this technology may be used to render an enemy’s electronic and data systems useless even before the first troops or aircraft arrive.”

Here’s a video simulation of CHAMP in action, including proud statements from its creators on its powerful effect during tests to use directed energy to neutralize a modern urban environment:

In their test, the electromagnetic attack took out all the computers and other electronic equipment in the office without creating any structural damage, which would have rendered most populations and many enemies helpless in a real world conflict scenario.

In 2012, CHAMP lead test engineer, Peter Finlay, said, “Today we made science fiction science fact.”

Though there are ways to guard against an EMP attack, it essentially amounts to an instant checkmate for anyone who is not prepared.

Lights out may largely translate to game over in future scenarios… bringing the masses to their knees.

That is what the Air Force is eyeing, and why it is (pardon the unfortunate pun) championing CHAMP in its public relations efforts.

Miniaturization and stealth deployment will give U.S. forces the edge, while similar weapons are already in the hands of rival powers and even rogue players.

[Flight Global reporter James Drew] reported that Masiello said the technology is mature and will be miniaturized for the JASSM-ER. CHAMP is “an operational system already in our tactical air force, and that is really what will make us more operationally relevant.

There is little doubt that such an attack could be crippling, as many experts in the U.S. have warned. As the Inquisitr reports:

United States EMP Commission statement about the domino effect an EMP attack would have on the United States. “The primary avenues for catastrophic damage to the nation are through our electric power infrastructure and thence into our telecommunications, energy, and other infrastructures. These, in turn, can seriously impact other important aspects of our nation’s life, including the financial system; means of getting food, water, and medical care to the citizenry; trade; and production of goods and services. The recovery of any one of the key national infrastructures is dependent on the recovery of others.”

But are its devastating effects against civil populations – even in declared wars – fair game? And how long until such an attack threatens the population here at home?"

August 30, 2013

Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta have admitted to Associated Press correspondent Dale Gavlak that they were responsible for last week’s chemical weapons incident which western powers have blamed on Bashar Al-Assad’s forces, revealing that the casualties were the result of an accident caused by rebels mishandling chemical weapons provided to them by Saudi Arabia.

“From numerous interviews with doctors, Ghouta residents, rebel fighters and their families….many believe that certain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the (deadly) gas attack,” writes Gavlak. (back up version here).

Rebels told Gavlak that they were not properly trained on how to handle the chemical weapons or even told what they were. It appears as though the weapons were initially supposed to be given to the Al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra.

“We were very curious about these arms. And unfortunately, some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions,” one militant named ‘J’ told Gavlak.

His claims are echoed by another female fighter named ‘K’, who told Gavlak, “They didn’t tell us what these arms were or how to use them. We didn’t know they were chemical weapons. We never imagined they were chemical weapons.”

Abu Abdel-Moneim, the father of an opposition rebel, also told Gavlak, “My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry,” describing them as having a “tube-like structure” while others were like a “huge gas bottle.” The father names the Saudi militant who provided the weapons as Abu Ayesha.

According to Abdel-Moneim, the weapons exploded inside a tunnel, killing 12 rebels.

“More than a dozen rebels interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government,” writes Gavlak.

If accurate, this story could completely derail the United States’ rush to attack Syria which has been founded on the “undeniable” justification that Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack. Dale Gavlak’s credibility is very impressive. He has been a Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press for two decades and has also worked for National Public Radio (NPR) and written articles for BBC News.

The website on which the story originally appeared – Mint Press (which is currently down as a result of huge traffic it is attracting to the article) is a legitimate media organization based in Minnesota. The Minnesota Post did a profile on them last year.

Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in providing rebels, whom they have vehemently backed at every turn, with chemical weapons, is no surprise given the revelations earlier this week that the Saudis threatened Russia with terror attacks at next year’s Winter Olympics in Sochi unless they abandoned support for the Syrian President.

“I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,” Prince Bandar allegedly told Vladimir Putin, the Telegraph reports.

The Obama administration is set to present its intelligence findings today in an effort prove that Assad’s forces were behind last week’s attack, despite American officials admitting to the New York Times that there is no “smoking gun” that directly links President Assad to the attack.

US intelligence officials also told the Associated Press that the intelligence proving Assad’s culpability is “no slam dunk.”

As we reported earlier this week, intercepted intelligence revealed that the Syrian Defense Ministry was making “panicked” phone calls to Syria’s chemical weapons department demanding answers in the hours after the attack, suggesting that it was not ordered by Assad’s forces.

UPDATE: Associated Press contacted us to confirm that Dale Gavlak is an AP correspondent, but that her story was not published under the banner of the Associated Press. We didn’t claim this was the case, we merely pointed to Gavlak’s credentials to stress that she is a credible source, being not only an AP correspondent, but also having written for PBS, BBC and Salon.com.

Speaking to the UK’s Channel 4 in a report entitled “Could Trump win?”, Kellyanne Conway said polls showing Trump losing to Hillary are manufactured by the media and do not reflect the actual public sentiment.

“The polling numbers for Donald Trump are looking pretty bad now, aren’t they at the moment?” reporter Matt Frei asked.

“Not all of them, no. Just the cherry-picked polling numbers that are put out by media outlets that are also bent on his destruction,” Conway responded, adding that online polling consistently shows something much different.

“Our internal polling is proprietary and confidential so I won’t discuss it, but I will tell you that Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the election.”

Conway explained American voters are under social pressure to appear as though they dislike Trump, but that anonymous online polling affords voters the ability to make choices they might otherwise be ridiculed for publicly embracing.

“It’s because it’s become socially desirable, especially if you’re a college educated person in the United States of America, to say that you’re against Donald Trump,” Conway described.

“The hidden Trump vote in this country is a very significant proposition,” Conway said.

Asked if they have a number on so-called “undercover voters,” Conway replied, “I can’t discuss it. It’s a project we’re doing internally. I call it: ‘The Undercover Trump voter,’ but it’s real. And I think that if you go around this country and talk to people, you’ll see it’s real as well.”

The campaign manager’s words were quickly reinforced when Frei interviewed Trump impersonator John Di Domenico in front of the White House, who broke character to disclose what he’s personally witnessed.

“You travel all over the country doing this schtick. What’s the impression that you get? What’s your own personal polling telling you about his popularity?” Frei asked.

“I’ve been on the road almost non-stop since last August,” Di Domenico said. “I would say he’s going to win in a landslide. You see it in the polls on the news one way, and when you hit the ground and meet people, it’s totally different.”

Conway’s assertion that Trump is actually polling higher in anonymous online polls was also vindicated by the maker of the Zip question and answer app, who told USA Today earlier this month their polls show Donald Trump in the lead.

The app co-founder, Ric Militi, attributed the discrepancy between their polling and mainstream polls to the factor of online anonymity.

“We’re not a poll. We’re a conversation, and 100% anonymous,” Militi says. “People feel comfortable answering questions without fear of being bullied or being called a racist. People can express themselves safely, and you get a pure answer.”"

In another example of children being considered potential terrorists, a Massachusetts teacher sent home a note to each parent of her sixth-grade class banning all pencils and pens from school including the student’s person, backpack, and on the bus citing that they could be used in “weapon making”.

The letter read:

students would no longer be allowed to bring writing implements to school. It said pencils would be provided for students in class and any students caught with pencils or pens after Nov. 15 would face disciplinary action for having materials “to build weapons.”

After receiving several calls from the media, the school district quickly retracted the ban, stating that the teacher sent the notice on their own authority without prior approval of the school board.

This isn’t the first case of a teacher or school taking a drastic stance against minor and otherwise harmless items at school. A school in Rhode Island banned one student from wearing a hat that featured an American flag and plastic toy soldiers made in honor of soldiers. The 8-year-old boy made the hat as part of an assignment when they were to meet their pen-pals. He decided it would be a good idea to decorate it to be patriotic. The school disagreed.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

{openx:49}

A 7-year-old was expelled for over a year after a teacher found a toy gun in his backpack. The toy never left his bag, and wasn’t used in any threatening manor. The school board determined that the young boy should have to risk repeating the second grade as a just punishment for bringing a toy with him to school.

If that wasn’t crazy enough, a student was nearly expelled over a 2-inch Lego gun made for a policeman figure. The Staten Island student was playing with Legos during his lunch period when a teacher spotted a tiny toy gun no bigger than a quarter. This landed him in big trouble resulting in threatened suspension and even expulsion.

Fresh food that lasts from eFoods Direct (Ad)

Are teachers, principals, and school board members taking their zero-tolerance policies just a little too far? While there is no denying that bringing a live firearm on school property should be strictly forbidden, instilling fear of retaliation by public employees for even possessing a toy leaves a lasting and potentially harmful mark on a child’s psyche. This is an early conditioning that teaches students to fear their own actions, and with notes like the one above banning writing utensils, to possibly submit to restrictions on creativity and expression. Keeping a journal or writing about your experiences was also banned in Orwellian 1984.

Note from Alex Jones: This is a form of mind control to teach children that the image of a gun in a slave’s hand is evil, while the same weapon in the hands of a swat team is good."

Canadian doctor Ghislaine Lanctôt, author of the Medical Mafia, has underscored the lawsuit recently filed by Austrian journalist Jane Bürgermeister against the WHO, the UN, and several high ranking government and corporate officials. Bürgermeister has documented how an international corporate criminal syndicate plans to unleash a deadly flu virus and institute a forced vaccination program.

“I am emerging from a long silence on the subject of vaccination, because I feel that, this time, the stakes involved are huge. The consequences may spread much further than anticipated,” writes Lanctôt, who believes the A(H1N1) virus will be used in a pandemic concocted and orchestrated by the WHO, an international organization that serves military, political and industrial interests.

1979 CBS 60 Minutes episode concerning the 1976 swine flu “pandemic” in the U.S.

Lanctôt warns that the elite and their minions will introduce a compulsory vaccination that will contain a deadly virus and this will be used specifically as a eugenics weapon for “massive and targeted reduction of the world population.” Moreover, a pandemic will also be used to further establish martial law and a police state, according to Lanctôt, and activate concentration camps “built to accommodate the rebellious” and eventually transfer power from all nations to a single United Nations government and thus fulfill the sinister plans of the New World Order.

In her book The Medical Mafia, Lanctôt writes about the ineffectiveness and dangers of vaccination. “Because of my professional status, my words weighed significantly in the public eye. The Medical Board’s reaction was immediate and strong. Its leaders demanded that I resign as a physician. I answered that I would do so as long as they could prove that what I had written was false. The Medical Board replied with a call for my expulsion,” she writes. “As I witnessed the disproportionate reaction of the Medical Board, I realized that, for the health establishment, the subject of vaccination was taboo. Unknowingly, I had opened a Pandora’s box. I discovered that, despite official claims, vaccines have nothing to do with public health. Underneath the governmental stamp of approval, there are deep military, political and industrial interests.”

During her trial in 1995, Lanctôt used an episode from the March 11th, 1979, 60 Minutes TV show covering the massive vaccination program foisted on the American public supposedly in response to the 1976 swine flu outbreak. It was later established by the CDC that the virus originated out of Fort Dix in New Jersey. “The Fort Dix outbreak may have been a zoonotic anomaly caused by introduction of an animal virus into a stressed population in close contact in crowded facilities during a cold winter,” note Joel C. Gaydos, Franklin H. Top, Jr, Richard A. Hodder, and Philip K. Russell.

It was also characterized “a rare example of an influenza virus with documented human to human transmission,” according to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. The virus is “thought to be a direct descendant of the virus that caused the pandemic of 1918,” explained Richard Krause, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the time.

[efoods]”Public health experts, fearing a possible replay of the 1918 pandemic, engaged in an intense debate about how to respond. Eventually they launched a nationwide vaccination campaign, which was announced by President Gerald Ford in March. By the end of the year, 48 million people had been vaccinated,” write Robert Roos and Lisa Schnirring of the Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy. “But the feared pandemic never materialized.”

Instead, numerous people came down with Guillian-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing neurologic illness, after receiving the government-hyped vaccination.

More than 33 years later, according to Dr. Russell Blaylock, a board certified neurosurgeon, “we are hearing the same cries of alarm from a similar lineup of virology experts. The pharmaceutical companies are busy designing a vaccine for the swine flu in hope that this administration will make the vaccine mandatory before another vaccine-related disaster can ruin their party…. Like SARS and bird flu before it, this swine flu scare is a lot of nonsense. Just take your high dose vitamin D3 (5000 IU a day), eat a healthy diet and take a few immune boosting supplements (such as beta-1, 3/1, 6 glucan) and you will not have to worry about this flu.”

According to a source known to former NSA official Wayne Madsen, “A top scientist for the United Nations, who has examined the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa, as well as HIV/AIDS victims, concluded that H1N1 possesses certain transmission “vectors” that suggest that the new flu strain has been genetically-manufactured as a military biological warfare weapon.

In April, Army criminal investigators were looking into the possibility that disease samples went missing from biolabs at Fort Detrick. “Chad Jones, spokesman for Fort Meade, said CID is investigating the possibility of missing virus samples from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases,” the Frederick News Post reported. “Obviously, in light of the current swine flu scare, and the new strain’s possible synthetic origin, the fact that virus samples may have gone missing from the same Army research lab from which the 2001 anthrax strain was released is extremely disturbing,” Paul Joseph Watson wrote at the time.

Jane Bürgermeister “charges that the entire ‘swine flu’ pandemic business is premised on a massive lie that there is no natural virus out there that poses a threat to the population,” writes Barbara Minton for Natural Health News. “She presents evidence leading to the belief that the bird flu and swine flu viruses have, in fact, been bioengineered in laboratories using funding supplied by the WHO and other government agencies, among others. This ‘swine flu’ is a hybrid of part swine flu, part human flu and part bird flu, something that can only come from laboratories according to many experts.”

Minton continues:

Using the “swine flu” as a pretext, the defendants [in Bürgermeister’s lawsuit] have preplanned the mass murder of the U.S. population by means of forced vaccination. They have installed an extensive network of FEMA concentration camps and identified mass grave sites, and they have been involved in devising and implementing a scheme to hand power over the U.S. to an international crime syndicate that uses the UN and WHO as a front for illegal racketeering influenced organized crime activities, in violation of the laws that govern treason.

Note the language in this clip: Americans will be “required” to get multiple vaccinations.

Obama’s Bilderberg Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius — and Bilderberg member — wants to make it easy for kids to get their toxin-laden eugenicist “swine flu” vaccine this fall. “Schoolchildren may be first in line for swine flu vaccine this fall — and might even be able to get the shot right at school,” the Associated Press reported on June 16.

As we noted last month, the government appears to be planning a mandatory flu vaccination program. In a recent article on the unfolding economic collapse, Rep. Ron Paul warns that the hysterically hyped H1N1 flu “pandemic” may result in the government requiring mandatory flu vaccinations. “Nearly $8 billion will be spent to address a ‘potential pandemic flu’ which could result in mandatory vaccinations for no discernible reason other than to enrich the pharmaceutical companies that make the vaccine,” writes Paul.

Considering the track record of the global elite, the government-mandated vaccination program now in the works — as Ghislaine Lanctôt and Jane Bürgermeister warn — will serve the eugenicist plan to depopulate the planet. A contrived pandemic will also set the final stage for the implementation of martial law and a high-tech surveillance and police state grid."

Earlier this week, a Spanish newspaper quoted Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez as saying the U.S. Navy caused the Haiti earthquake with a tectonic weapon. The Venezuelan media reported that the earthquake “may be associated with the project called HAARP, a system that can generate violent and unexpected changes in climate,” Press TV reported on January 21.

Chavez cited a report from Russia’s Northern Fleet. According to the report, the U.S. Navy made a mistake with a secret “earthquake weapon” and the result was the Haitian earthquake. The Russians believe the intended target was Iran. “Though Russian Northern Fleets’ report was not confirmed by official sources, the comments attracted special attention in some US and Russian media outlets including Fox news and Russia Today,” writes Pragmatic Witness blog. “Russia Today’s report said that Moscow has also been accused of possessing and utilizing such weapons.”

“Speaking on his weekly television show, Chavez opined that the U.S. mission in Haiti was a ruse to initiate military occupation,” the New York Daily News said.

Venezuelan media “added that the U.S. government’s HAARP program, an atmospheric research facility in Alaska (and frequent subject of conspiracy theories), was also to blame for a Jan. 9 quake in Eureka, Calif., and may have been behind the 7.8-magnitude quake in China that killed nearly 90,000 people in 2008,” Fox News reported on Thursday.

In 1997, former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen made the following statement:

Others [terrorists] are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves… So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations…It’s real, and that’s the reason why we have to intensify our [counterterrorism] efforts.

Cohen was talking about longitudinal EM wave interferometers (LWI) technology (also known as “Tesla howitzers”). LWI waves can effortlessly pass through the ocean and earth. Experts claim LWI waves can in fact pass through the earth and emerge on the other side. The United States and Russia have possessed this technology for decades.

Cohen would have you believe it is a technology that only terrorists would use. It depends on who you would call a terrorist.

In 1966, Professor Gordon J. F. MacDonald, associate director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Los Angeles, was a member of the President’s Science Advisory Committee. MacDonald published papers on the use of environmental-control technologies for military purposes, including “earthquake engineering” (he also wrote about weather manipulation, climate modification, polar ice cap melting or destabilization, ozone depletion techniques).

“The revealed secrets surprised legislators,” writes Dr. Nick Begich. “Would an inquiry into the state of the art of electromagnetic manipulation surprise lawmakers today? They may find out that technologies developed out of the HAARP experiments in Alaska could deliver on Gordon MacDonald’s vision because leading-edge scientists are describing global weather as not only air pressure and thermal systems, but also as an electrical system.”

Jesse Ventura detailed the HAARP program on his popular truTV show Conspiracy Theory:

Of course, we have no direct evidence the Pentagon used HAARP to touch off a massive earthquake in Haiti.

[efoods]The U.S., however, has exploited the earthquake to send the military to the stricken island nation. “They brazenly occupied Haiti without consulting the UN or the OAS (Organization of American States),” said Chavez earlier in the week. Bolivian President Evo Morales said Wednesday he would request an emergency UN meeting “to repudiate and reject this military occupation of the United States in Haiti.”

“It’s not right the United States should use this natural disaster to invade and militarily occupy Haiti,” he told a press conference.

“The unspoken mission of US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) with headquarters in Miami and US military installations throughout Latin America is to ensure the maintenance of subservient national regimes, namely US proxy governments, committed to the Washington Consensus and the neoliberal policy agenda,” writes Michel Chossudovsky. “While US military personnel will at the outset be actively involved in emergency and disaster relief, this renewed US military presence in Haiti will be used to establish a foothold in the country as well pursue America’s strategic and geopolitical objectives in the Caribbean basin, which are largely directed against Cuba and Venezuela.”

The objective is not to work towards the rehabilitation of the national government, the presidency, the parliament, all of which has been decimated by the earthquake. Since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship, America’s design has been to gradually dismantle the Haitian State, restore colonial patterns and obstruct the functioning of a democratic government. In the present context, the objective is not only to do away with the government but also to revamp the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), of which the headquarters have been destroyed… Prior to the earthquake, there were, according to US military sources, some 60 US military personnel in Haiti. From one day to the next, an outright military surge has occurred: 10,000 troops, marines, special forces, intelligence operatives, etc., not to mention private mercenary forces on contract to the Pentagon. In all likelihood the humanitarian operation will be used as a pretext and justification to establish a more permanent US military presence in Haiti.

Is it possible the Pentagon would kill 100,000 or more Haitians to realize such a project?

The U.S. killed well over a million Iraqis, why not a 100,000 or so Haitians?"

March 12, 2014

Over a dozen nations have now mobilized search teams for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The mysterious disappearance has left investigators all over the world wondering what could have happened. This is a huge investigation, as evidenced by the fact that China has re-tasked ten satellites to search for the wreckage, suggesting that the People’s Republic really wants to get to the bottom of what happened here.

There is no debris to be found. The black box, which is supposed to be indestructible in a large explosion and should broadcast a homing signal for up to 30 days, has gone dark. Moreover, INTERPOL is looking into several passengers who boarded the plane using false passports, and whose tickets were reportedly purchased by an unknown Iranian benefactor.

Several theories have emerged as to what could have caused the flight to “vanish” out of thin air. None of them are, as of yet, conclusive.

We can probably rule out a mid-air explosion, because something like that would likely have left instruments operational for long enough that readings would have been transmitted back to flight controllers. Likewise, there would be a fairly wide debris field had such an explosion occurred at such a high altitude.

Terrorism has not been ruled out, but traditional methods, including a hi-jacking, seem unlikely (remember those reinforced cockpit doors?).

It is certainly possible that search teams are just looking in the wrong place and the plane could be found in coming hours or days.

However, as noted by Mike Adams, the idea of an advanced military weapon of some sort is certainly within the realm of possibility. We know our Defense Department, as well as the militaries of other countries, are always hard at work developing new war-making technologies.

One such advanced weapons system has come to public light in recent years and as recently as two days prior to the disappearance of flight 370 Senator Ted Cruz mentioned it in a followup to his CPAC speech:

“When Iran describes Israel as the Little Satan, and America as the Great Satan, we have every interest to make sure they don’t acquire the weaponry to kill millions of Americans.” Cruz imagined a nightmare scenario in which Iran detonated a bomb over “Tel Aviv or New York or Los Angeles.” Detonated here, the effects of an EMP attack could kill “tens of millions of Americans.”

We know for a fact that China, North Korea, Russia and the United States have developed what are dubbed Super-EMP Weapons. These types of weapons require nuclear fuel and must be detonated over or near the target area. The secondary effect of this nuclear detonation is an electro-magnetic pulse. Deployed properly, for example 200 miles over the state of Kansas, such a weapon could literally wipe out every electronic system from coast to coast.

It is this possibility that prompted investigators to contact the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation yesterday, so they understand that this could well be the type of weapons used.

Experts at Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty have been asked to see if they detected an explosion at high altitude of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. Lassina Zerbo, executive director of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) told a news conference the organisation used “infrasound” – or infrasonic sensors – to monitor the earth mainly for atmospheric nuclear explosions. (source)

More than likely, the infrasound tests won’t yield any result. For starters, it would be quite difficult to sneak a suit-case nuclear weapon onto an airplane. Second, a space or air explosion would have quickly been detected by military monitoring systems operated by the U.S., China and Russia.

The other possibility is one that is often not discussed, yet has emerged as a highly effective military system in recent years. This involves the use of a non-nuclear electro magentic pulse weapon.

Weapons designers specializing in high-energy physics can now create electromagnetic pulses without going into outer space. One approach involves harnessing the force of a conventional explosion. Others are simply just modifications of radar, which bounces pulses of energy off aircraft in flight, vehicles on the ground, and other objects. Crank up the power and you have an EMP weapon, ready to point at the computers of your favorite enemy.This knowledge has set off a new arms race. Whether fitted into cruise missiles or parked at the side of the road in a van, non-nuclear EMP weapons have the potential to devastate the electronic systems of areas as large as a city or as small as a selected building, all without being seen, heard, or felt by a single soul. It is a dream come true for any and all terrorists. Sound far-fetched? It did not in 1993 to the owners of automobiles parked about 300 meters from a U.S. Defense Contractor’s EMP generator test site at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Their alternators and electronic engine controls were accidentally fried by a pulse during classified field trials. Source: Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin

The following provides an explanation for how these weapons work. What we know about the Flight 370 disaster suggests that if this was an act of terrorism it could have been executed using a NNEMP:

NNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs, cruise missiles (such as the CHAMP missile) and drones, with diminished mechanical, thermal and ionizing radiation effects, but without the political consequences of deploying nuclear weapons. … The electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect. These facts limit the range of NNEMP weapons, but allow finer target discrimination. The effect of small e-bombs has proven to be sufficient for certain terrorist or military operations. Examples of such operations include the destruction of electronic control systems critical to the operation of many ground vehicles and aircraft.

We know for a fact that these e-bombs have been built and tested by our own military. Unlike nuclear-based EMP weapons, these devices can be small and compact versions can actually be created with basic Do-It-Yourself kits. They can be deployed on drones, planes and missiles. They can be specifically targeted at cities, buildings or even vehicles. Thus, it is possible that such a device was used to take down Flight 370.

For the skeptics out there, watch the following video of a do-it-yourself homemade e-bomb being used to short-circuit a cell phone:

In this video, another homemade e-bomb is used to disable various electronics. Note that the rudimentary device looks to have an effective range of roughly 10 – 15 yards:

Now consider what a rogue terror organization or black ops team could do with a multi-million dollar budget.

Harping back to the Iranian connection, is it possible that a small capacity non-nuclear EMP weapon was smuggled on board the airplane, perhaps in common electronic devices, and triggered mid-flight?

That an unknown man named “Ali” purchased tickets for his friends at the last minute to the cheapest destination available, is highly suspect and is indicative of terrorism. An incident involving a man with a similar profile occurred at Amsterdam airport when the Christmas underwear bomber was allowed onto the plane – without a passport.

We’re not necessarily suggesting Iran is behind this, but it sure is an easy story to sell.

Insofar as the effects themselves, a non-nuclear EMP could well explain how a plane, from one second to the next, simply vanishes without a trace.

There would be no large debris field because the plane would have fallen right out of the sky, so instead of a search area of square miles, we’d be looking at mere yards, a difficult find in a huge ocean.

The homing device on the black box, which as far as we can tell is not shielded against an EMP blast, would, just as the planes instrumentation and communications equipment, short circuit and become inoperable.

No explosions or missile signature would have been detected by monitoring systems

While this theory is far from conclusive, it makes as much sense as any being proposed.

If this was the kind of weapon used, then it could have been a “dry run” for something much bigger, like a coordinated attack involving many more planes in the future.

Or, as highlighted by American Everyman, we can just go with the official story per the mainstream media:

So, right on cue, in the absence of a logical thesis, the mainstream media along with “high ranking unnamed sources” are starting to float ridiculousness as the solution. Officials investigating the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board suspect it may have disintegrated in mid-flight, a senior source said on Sunday, as Vietnam reported a possible sighting of wreckage from the plane. Reuters Yes, there you have it, it may have just vaporized itself in mid-air for no apparent reason.

Vaporized? Gone? Nothing remained of this 600,000 pound jumbo jet?

The notion that an e-bomb was responsible is much more likely than vaporization.

And that is a much more terrifying thought to consider."

In retaliation the jets were targeted by Syrian anti-aircraft missiles with one of the Israeli fight planes shot down.

According to a statement by the Syrian Army, a total of four Israeli jets breached Syrian airspace on Friday morning, Reuters reports. Syria’s air defenses shot down one of the Israeli jets over “occupied ground” and damaged another.

The Israeli Army confirmed it had conducted airstrikes on several targets in Syria, Israel National News reported. However, as usual the IDF insists that none of the jets was harmed. “At no point was the safety of Israeli civilians or the IAF [Israeli Air Force] aircraft compromised,” an Israeli military spokesman said.

Following the breach of the country’s airspace, the Syrian Army warned Israel of “direct” retaliation “with all means at its disposal,” Haaretz reports. Earlier, a spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that Israeli military jets were targeted by anti-aircraft missiles after they struck several targets in Syria.

“I can say that the sirens were the result of the incident,” an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson told Sputnik, referring to the launch of missiles at Israeli planes that carried out attacks on targets in Syria.

As Reuters further adds, after Israeli Air Force planes struck several targets in Syria on Thursday night, Damascus retaliated by activating its air defense systems and firing a number of missiles at Israeli jets, according to Haaretz.

None of the missiles struck the jets, but one was intercepted by a missile defense system north of Jerusalem, Haaretz reports, adding there were no Israeli casualties in the incident.

“Overnight IAF (Israeli Air Force) aircraft targeted several targets in Syria. Several anti-aircraft missiles were launched from Syria following the mission and IDF (Israel Defence Force) Aerial Defence Systems intercepted one of the missiles,” the military said in its statement, as cited by Reuters.

A rocket siren was heard at around 3:00am Friday morning in the Jordan Valley area, after which witnesses heard an explosion. The IDF later confirmed that the sirens were a result of Israeli airstrikes on several targets in Syria, Israel National News reports.

Friday’s incident is the third time that Israel has bombed targets on Syrian territory.

Recent, in mid-January, Israeli forces hit the Mezzeh Military Airport west of Damascus, with the facility rocked by several explosions according to RT.

On December 7, the state agency SANA reported that multiple surface-to-surface missiles had been fired by the IDF from the Golan Heights.

Syrian authorities have repeatedly accused Israel of endorsing terrorism by carrying out the attacks. Regarding the strikes, Israeli authorities previously said they were targeting positions of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group inside Syria. Israel views the organization as enemy militants."

Beirut-based Al Masdar News reports that the incident occurred at approximately 6:30 A.M. Saturday morning (local time) and that the Israeli F-16 fighter was hit while flying within Syrian airspace near Damascus.

Official Israeli statements claim multiple of its jets were scrambled in response to an Iranian drone launch into Israeli airspace, which the IDF says was intercepted amidst “massive Syrian anti-air fire”. The F-16 was engaged in an operation to destroy the Syrian ground base from which the UAV was launched.

According to the Israeli version of events issued in real time by IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus:

The Syrian military has stated that its air defense missile system further struck an Israeli drone shortly after the F-16 was downed, which had been launched from the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. There’s not been immediate Israeli confirmation of this second aircraft downing.

In response to the F-16 downing, after 8:00 A.M. local time the Israeli Air Force fired several missiles targeting the Al-Kiswah area near what is said to be an Iranian base outside of Damascus. And shortly after this initial Israeli retaliation strike, a more massive wave of missiles hit a mountaintop Syrian Army base in the same area. Regional sources are reporting that multiple Israeli missiles struck the base, while others were intercepted by Syrian air defense.

It appears that Israel launched missiles on locations in central Syria as well, with casualties reported among Syrian Army forces and their allies. The Associated Press cites a Syrian opposition monitoring group to report the following:

A Syria war monitor says Israel has struck targets in central Syria and the southwestern suburbs of the capital Damascus in two separate and successive waves of airstrikes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the first round targeted in the central desert area where Syrian troops and their Iranian-backed allies including Hezbollah are known to maintain bases. It cited unconfirmed reports of casualties among Syrian government forces and allied militiamen. The Britain-based Observatory, which monitors the Syria war through a network of activists on the ground, says the second round targeted outposts in the southwestern suburbs of Damascus

Syrian government media reported multiple missile intercepts, likely through its sophisticated Russian-supplied anti-air defense system, and confirmed the large-scale Israeli attack on Syrian military locations in central Syria.

According to Syrian state-run SANA:

The army air defense confronted a new Israeli aggression on one of the military positions in the central area and hit more than one aircraft… Moreover, the Army air defense confronted another Israeli aggression on Damascus Countryside on Saturday morning… Meanwhile, media of the Israeli enemy admitted that the Syrian air defense shot down an F-16 jet over Galilee in occupied Palestine and that its pilots were injured, confirming the closure of parts the Israeli airspace for aviation after downing the warplane.

As a result of escalating events airspace closures have been reported over northern Israel, as well as multiple Israeli air defense warning sirens sounding at the Golan Heights and throughout lower and upper Galilee.

Israel’s Ben Gurion international airport outside of Tel Aviv was also reportedly on lockdown for some period of time after the exchange of fire between Syrian and Israeli forces.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military has blamed close Syrian ally Iran for today’s F-16 shoot down and escalation. The IDF issued a threatening statement which reads: “The IDF will act determinately against such severe violations of Israeli sovereignty by Iran and Syria and will continue to act as necessary. The IDF is ready for various scenarios and will continue to act according to situation assessments.”

And according to a statement issued to the AFP, Israel says Iran and Syria are “playing with fire” but that Israel does not want escalation. However, regional media reports indicate Israel has continued to pound the Damascus countryside throughout the morning. The Syrian government has condemned Israel’s actions as unwarranted “aggression”.

It must be remembered that the Israeli Air Force has acknowledged striking targets inside Syria at least 100 times over the past few years of the conflict, with the last attack prior to today’s events happening just earlier this week. Syria has frequently taken its case before the U.N., calling for official condemnation of the unprovoked attacks, but has been just as frequently rebuffed.

In its now ‘open secret’ of a years-long pursuit of regime change in Syria, Israel has given covert support to al-Qaeda linked groups in Syria’s south – near the vicinity of today’s F-16 shoot down – which has involved weapons transfers and treatment of wounded jihadists in Israeli hospitals, according to The Wall Street Journal. As former Acting Director of the CIA Michael Morell once directly told the Israeli public, Israel’s “dangerous game” in Syria has involved getting in bed with al-Qaeda in order to fight Shia Iran.

And as Israel has long sought ways to justify attacks on Iranian assets in Syria while at the same time undermining and destabilizing the Syrian government, the downing of an F-16 may have given Israel’s hawkish leadership the excuse they’ve been looking for all along to escalate toward a final confrontation.

Middle East based journalist and analyst Elijah Magnier says we could be witnessing the tipping point that will ignite the entire region. Magnier reports that according to a “private source, all Syrian military and intelligence and their allies’ (Hezbollah) positions in Syrian and Lebanon are on full alert.”

Michael Wright, a lawyer representing the family of 22-year-old John Crawford III, who was shot and killed by police inside the Beavercreek Walmart earlier this month after being spotted wielding one of the store’s Crosman MK-177 pellet guns, commented at a news conference yesterday on bits of surveillance footage shown to him and the family by the Ohio Attorney General.

Wright said that, based on what he’d been shown, it did not appear Crawford made any threatening gestures, as suggested by a 9-1-1 caller, but was instead leaning on the butt of the air rifle when police arrived.

“The tape we saw saw several shoppers walk by John, look at merchandise in the same aisle with John, including Angela Williams and her children and they were completely indifferent as to John’s presence. No shopper showed any concern about John’s presence that we were shown on tape by the attorney general,” Wright stated.

On August 5, Beavercreek police used lethal force when they responded to a call regarding a man walking around the store menacingly pointing a weapon at other shoppers.

The 9-1-1 caller stated he witnessed Crawford “walking around with a gun in the store,” and that he was “loading it right now,” and pointing it at customers and children.

He “was just waving it at children and people. Items…. I couldn’t hear anything that he was saying. I’m thinking that he is either going to rob the place or he’s there to shoot somebody else,” the concerned shopper told police.

“We have no idea what this 9-1-1 caller viewed,” Wright stated. “The video that we were shown shows John doing absolutely nothing menacing, not pointing the gun, doing none of the things that the 9-1-1 caller indicated,” asserted Wright, adding that he had not yet been able to question the caller. “You just saw [Crawford] standing talking on the phone, and the next frame he’s laying on the ground.”

“From what we’ve seen, John had no opportunity to put the gun down,” Wright said. He was “doing nothing more, nothing less than shopping”

Lee Cee Johnson, the mother of Crawford’s children, said she was speaking with him on the phone right before police shot him. She said she heard Crawford tell someone the gun was “not real,” then heard screaming.

“We was just talking. He said he was at the video games playing videos and he went over there by the toy section where the toy guns were. And the next thing I know, he said ‘It’s not real,’ and the police start shooting and they said ‘Get on the ground,’ but he was already on the ground because they had shot him,” Johnson said. “And I could hear him just crying and screaming. I feel like they shot him down like he was not even human.”

Wright said he’s still waiting to view the footage in its entirety, as he’d only been shown select parts, but said what police have released so far is extremely “one-sided” in favor of police accounts.

“Everything released is one-sided. There is nothing favorable to John Crawford. You can’t show different pieces. Show it all. Don’t trickle pieces to gain favor of the public,” said Wright.

Ohio Attorney General Mike Dewine says they haven’t released the footage because it “is not the right thing to do,” and because it might affect the opinions of jurors presiding over the case.

The Beavercreek police chief, Dennis Evers, has already weighed in defending the officers, stating, “Preliminary indications are the officers acted appropriately under the circumstances.”

“The officers gave verbal commands to the subject to drop the weapon,” Evers stated at a press conference the day after the shooting. “The subject … was shot after failing to comply with the officers’ commands. The quick response of officers was instrumental in containing this situation and minimizing the risk to customers.”

An innocent bystander also died following the confrontation. The Greene County Coroner indicated Angela Williams, 37, of Fairborn, was “apparently running from a dangerous situation inside the Walmart store when she collapsed. She was taken to Soin Medical Center where she died at 9:14 p.m.” In a sad twist, the mother of two was due to be wed that weekend.

Ohio’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation predicted it could be months before the investigation wraps up, a sluggish pace Crawford’s father, John Crawford II, perceives as “stall tactics.”

The state has handed the case over to a special prosecutor, and a grand jury will convene on September 22 to ultimately decide what repercussive actions to take, if any.

One of the officers involved in the altercation, David Darkow, is back on duty, while officer Sean Williams remains on paid administrative leave, according to the Huffington Post."

October 25, 2013

The shooting death of a 13-year-old California boy believed to be carrying an assault rifle unfolded in no more than 10 seconds, police said. Andy Lopez Cruz, who was later found to be carrying a plastic replica, was struck by seven bullets.

In that time, a total of eight rounds were fired by one of the two sheriff’s deputies who confronted the teen, with two of the wounds – one in the right side of his chest and the second in his right hip – proving fatal.

Lt. Paul Henry, of the Santa Rosa Police Department, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Cruz was also shot in his right wrist, left biceps, right forearm, right buttocks and right hip.

It took another 16 seconds for the deputies to call for medical assistance, according to a timeline of events released by police investigating the fatal shooting in Santa Rosa on Tuesday, Reuters reports.

At approximately 3pm Tuesday, a 24-year-old deputy of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office and a rookie deputy he was training spotted Andy, donning a blue hoodie and shorts, walking on Moorland Avenue with what they believed was an assault rifle in his left hand.

Police say the deputies – who have not yet been officially identified – got out of their squad car and took cover behind the open doors. The senior deputy twice shouted, “Put the gun down,” before Cruz turned to his right, the Sheriff’s Office said.

Police said the boy ignored two calls to put down the weapon, instead turning toward the senior deputy with the rifle barrel “rising up and turning in his direction.” The deputy is then said to have opened fire out of fear for his life, being unable to tell whether his target was a child from where he was standing.

The eighth grader died at the scene. A toy handgun was also was found tucked in his pants.

The rookie deputy, who was hired last month, did not fire any shots, the Chronicle cites Assistant Sheriff Lorenzo Duenas as saying. That deputy had served 11 years with another police agency, said Duenas, who declined to identify that agency.

Four seconds after the shooting, the two officers radioed for assistance from other deputies. Another six seconds elapsed before they notified dispatchers that shots had been fired. Police had previously said the deputies called for backup the moment they noticed what appeared to be a military-style rifle.

The officers involved in the shooting have both been placed on administrative leave, in accordance in usual procedure in such cases. The incident is being investigated by the Santa Rosa Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.

The shooting has sparked outrage in the community and beyond, with Andy’s family and friends accusing the deputy who opened fire of overreacting to a situation which did not require the use of deadly force.

The death has prompted calls in Santa Rosa for the creation of civilian review boards to examine such incidents.

“People have to do something,” Elbert Howard, a founding member of the Police Accountability Clinic and Helpline of Sonoma County, told Reuters. “He’s a child, and he had a toy. I see that as an overreaction to shoot him down.”

An advisory panel of the US Civil Rights Commission urged Sonoma County to create civilian-review boards in 2000 in the wake of eight fatal officer-involved shootings in less than three years. The panel’s recommendation, however, was disregarded.

Up to 200 mourners gathered Thursday around a makeshift memorial consisting of flowers, balloons, teddy bears and pictures of the boy at the site of the shooting.

Some held candles and signs that said: “What a tragedy, what a travesty.”

Friends and family have described Cruz as personable and well-liked in the neighborhood.

Residents say the diverse neighborhood does not have a particularly high rate of crime, with people feeling safe allowing their children to play in the streets.

“A lot of people say this is not a great neighborhood, but we’ve never had any problems,” Sam Hin, a mother who works in human resources at a skilled nursing facility, told the Press Democrat. “It’s our home. It’s what we’re used to.”

But Shannon Peavler, an in-home support provider whose mother lives on Moorland Avenue, told the daily deputies “come into the neighborhood thinking it’s a bad neighborhood, so they treat people that way.”"

Describing how California’s SB-880 will re-define “assault weapons,” Jacob Belemjian of The Firing Line shooting range in Clovis points out exactly what parts of the rifle will make the gun illegal at the start of the new year, and what can be modified on the gun to make it legal.

Despite the AR-15 he uses as an example requiring a special tool in order to detach the magazine, Belemjian says the feature, which in the past allowed the gun to bypass detachable gun magazine restrictions, means the gun would be in violation of the new laws.

Under the new law, a “fixed magazine” is now defined as “an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.”

Belemjian also described other features on his example centerfire, semi-automatic rifle that would make it illegal, such as the aforementioned detachable magazine and any of the following features: a collapsible, or adjustable, or foldable stock; a pistol grip that protrudes below the trigger guard; a forward pistol grip; and a flash hider.

But, “if I remove the flash hider, remove the forward pistol grip, put a fixed stock on it and change out this [pistol] grip, guess what? It’s not an ‘assault weapon’ anymore; now it does not meet the definition.”

CBS Fresno reports that Wednesday will be the last day Californians can legally buy the gun in its current form:

“The Department of Justice says buyers must actually take possession of their rifle before January 1st. It has to be purchased in time to allow for the 10-day waiting period before the buyer can pick up their new rifle. if someone purchases a soon-to-be-banned rifle by the Dec. 21 deadline, but fails to pick it up in time on Dec. 31, they will not get their rifle. Legally gun dealers may not deliver one, even if it’s been paid for.”"

Joe Scarborough accused Trump and the GOP of doing “nothing to protect Americans from future killings,” claiming that “They hide behind the lie that Americans have a constitutional right to own a military-style weapon.”

“We know this is going to happen again!” Scarborough said. “Donald Trump knew this day was coming. Donald Trump knows another school shooting is coming. Donald Trump snows another church shooting is coming. More Christians will be gunned down in churches in middle America. More country music fans will be gunned down at concerts across America.”

Scarborough’s guest Donny Deutsche openly suggested that Trump could be manipulated into acting on gun control.

“If you think about what drives him, what motivates him more than anything is to be the ultimate hero, to be the ultimate contrarian.” Deutsche stated.

“Donald Trump has proven to be a coward.” Scarborough replied.

“He’s proven to be a small man. Why would Donald Trump stop being a coward now? Why would he stop being a frightened little man now?!”

“My hope is that his ego is bigger than his cowardice,” Deutsche responded, adding “we would forgive Russia!”

Elsewhere during the broadcast, Scarborough compared Trump to Pontius Pilate, saying that he was “Letting Christians get slaughtered in pews, letting country fans get slaughtered at concerts.”

“When a crazed man in Las Vegas guns down country music fans that just want to go hear to their country music stars and sing along and have a nice night out after working hard all week, Donald Trump has no answers. He’s clueless,” the host urged.

“He is letting our children get slaughtered. Week, by week, by week. And it will happen again.” Scarborough charged."

Breaking down in tears at one point, the Jimmy Kimmel Live host said Republican lawmakers, “should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.”

The video is YouTube’s number one trending video and has received well over a million views overnight.

Kimmel went on to slam politicians who “won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip,” adding that their “thoughts and your prayers are insufficient.”

He then turned the monologue into an anti-Trump rant, declaring, “There are a lot of things we could do about it. But we don’t, which is interesting because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls, we take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that.”

Breitbart’s Ian Mason debunks most of Kimmel’s claims, almost all of which had nothing to do with the weapons used by killer Stephen Paddock during Sunday night’s massacre.

But for Kimmel, it’s very much a case of do as I say, not do as I do.

A 2015 clip from his show uploaded to YouTube features one of the security guard’s whose job it is to protect Kimmel and his production staff.

When his shirt lifts up for a brief moment, the man is seen to be carrying a Glock pistol in a holster.

In other words – Kimmel is against gun rights, unless it applies to his own personal security.

Recent reports also confirm that Kimmel has beefed up his security due to the increasingly polarized and political nature of his rants.

According to the Mercury News, “Ever since the late-night show host began crusading against the effort by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, there have been “incidents with Trump supporters” that have forced him to increase security at his show tapings.”

In response, “the show has increased personnel at both the front and back entrances. This personnel consists of highly-trained, off-duty police officers.”

Judging by the video clip of the security guard above, these security guards are almost certain to be packing.

Kimmel’s hypocrisy is a reminder of the fact that many liberals rely on men carrying guns to protect them but want to deny that right to the rest of the American people.

Michael Moore, who built part of his career on tearing down the second amendment, admitted in a 2008 Larry King interview that he owns a gun and also relies on armed security.

Revealed by the Church Committee in 1975, the “heart attack gun” is a modified 1911 that can shoot a dart with a deadly poison that’s nearly undetectable – which is perfect for political assassinations.

“The poison was frozen into some sort of dart and then it was shot at very high speed into the person,” said CIA whistleblower Mary Embree. “When it reached the person it would melt inside them, and there would be a tiny red dot on their body, which was hard to detect.”

“There wouldn’t be a needle or anything like that left in the person.”

Then-CIA Director William Colby confirmed the gun could fire a special dart which “potentially would be able to enter the target without perception,” adding that an autopsy would fail to detect the dart’s poison.

Of course, the heart attack gun is 40-year-old technology, so it’s theoretically possible to now deliver heart attack-inducing toxins to someone without needing a dart.

But for Trump to suddenly die of a heart attack from “natural causes,” the public must be conditioned to believe he was at risk for one.

Conveniently enough, CNN now has this weird obsession with Trump’s “risk” of a heart attack:

According to the American Mirror:

Because of Trump’s calcium score, CNN predicted the president will have a “heart attack or heart disease” in “3-5 years.”

But [CNN medical analyst Sanji] Gupta was more aggressive.

“So the president has heart disease,” he declared.

Yesterday, CNN host Brian Stelter didn’t accept Dr. Ronny Jackson’s findings [Trump’s examiner], either.

Why is the network making an armchair diagnosis that Trump suffers from “heart disease,” despite his recent physical indicating excellent health?

inforwars186,inforwars,['Mikael Thalen'],2017-12-08 09:58:27-05:00,https://www.infowars.com/watch-researchers-hack-popular-bluetooth-gun-safe/,"Security researchers this week revealed three vulnerabilities that allowed one of the most popular Bluetooth gun safes to be exploited and opened remotely.

In a blog post published Wednesday, researchers with Two Six Labs announced “BlueSteal” – a set of attacks that bypassed the Vaultek VT20i gun safe’s security features.

The Bluetooth-enabled safe, said to be one of the most popular on Amazon, is designed to only allow access to users with the correct pin code or paired cellphone utilizing the company’s application.

The first exploit, detailed in a video published by Two Six Labs, shows how a simple computer script was able to unlock the safe without the attacker knowing the pin code.

The researchers first discovered that unlimited attempts could be made to pair an Android phone to the safe without being rate-limited for giving incorrect pairing codes. Upon finding the code, Two Six Labs was not only able to open the safe from within the app as intended but also found that the same code was used to unlock the safe by hand as well.

In an attempt to see, if once paired, a brute force attack could be made against the safe, the team then crafted a python script that resulted in the safe quickly popping open.

“This vulnerability could have been prevented or mitigated if the application or safe had timeouts for incorrect retries, or enforced some maximum retry limit,” the researchers note.

The second vulnerability exploited the Android app’s failure to use encryption when communicating with the safe. Despite the company claiming to use strong encryption, the team says it was able to simply sniff the pin code out of the air.

“There is no encryption between the Android phone app and the safe,” the researchers added. “The application transmits the safe’s pin code in clear text after successfully pairing.”

Two Six Labs says the company even advertised the use of AES256 bit encryption, despite it being unsupported in the specific type of Bluetooth implemented.

“AES256 bit encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth LE standard and we have not seen evidence of its usage in higher layers. AES-128 is supported in Bluetooth LE, but the manufacturer is not using that either,” the researchers say. “This lack of encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping on the communications between the application and the safe.”

The final vulnerability involved using specifically formatted Bluetooth messages to unlock the safe, also without knowing the pin code. The team found that the safe failed to verify whether the pin code it had been provided was legitimate so long as it came from the Android app.

“The phone application requires the valid pin to operate the safe, and there is a field to supply the pin code in an authorization request,” the blog post notes. “However the safe does not verify the pin code, so an attacker can obtain authorization and unlock the safe using any arbitrary value as the pin code.”

Although such exploits would require an attacker to be within close proximity of the gun safe, Two Six Labs concluded by stating that BlueSteal should serve as a “stark reminder” to companies developing smart products on the importance of security audits.

“In this case an audit before the product came to market would have revealed all of these vulnerabilities, which then could have been fixed in production,” the researchers add. “It is next to impossible for a manufacturer to fix these sorts of issues after sales begin. Thus, care needs to be taken to carefully engineer the security of the platform and its update mechanisms.”

Two Six Labs notes that it waited 60 days to release their findings after informing Vaultek of the issues in October, allowing the manufacturer time to patch the vulnerabilities and release an update to customers.

Vaultek says its update has “improved Bluetooth security with the option for disabling the Bluetooth unlock or the entire connection altogether” and that a “time out feature designed for brute force attacks and additional encryption for the communication between the app and safe” has been added.
