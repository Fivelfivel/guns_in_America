Enlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

An analysis published Friday confirms the state of American gun policy science is not good, overall.

The nonprofit RAND Corporation analyzed thousands of studies and found only 63 that establish a causal relationship between specific gun policies and outcomes such as reductions in homicide and suicide, leaving lawmakers without clear facts about one of the most divisive issues in American politics.

The analysis is notable for its depth, if not for its overall finding — RAND spent two years and $1 million dollars on the project, which, beyond the analysis, also included a survey of gun policy experts and the construction of a research database on state gun laws.

For decades, social scientists and other researchers have pointed to a profound, and purposeful, lack of federal funding for gun research and a lack of federal data-gathering on guns as enormous impediments to studying gun violence. The federal government has spent much less on research into gun violence than on similarly lethal issues, such as motor vehicle crashes, liver disease and sepsis.

""Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn't find any evidence,"" says Andrew Morral, a behavioral scientist at RAND and the leader of the project.

They found, for example, no clear evidence regarding the effects of any gun policies on hunting and recreational gun use, or on officer-involved shootings, or on mass shootings or on the defensive use of guns by civilians.

There were some categories with better data, however, Morral says. There is relatively strong evidence, for example, that policies meant to prevent children from getting access to firearms — such as laws that require guns to be stored unloaded, or in locked containers — reduce both suicide and unintentional injury and death.

Previous work has also found that places that require a permit (issued by law enforcement) for the purchase a firearm do reduce violent crime.

There is also some evidence that prohibitions against purchase by people who have been diagnosed with mental illness reduce violent crime, and that ""stand your ground"" laws, which allow citizens who feel threatened in public to use lethal force without retreating first, lead to an increase in violent crime.

In general, however, good studies were few and far between, the RAND researchers say.

To help bridge the data gap for scientists, RAND has now compiled an open-source database of state-by-state gun laws going back to 1979. A similar, unrelated database run out of Boston University was published last year.

""Given the lack of data in the firearm research field, [the RAND database] will be a welcome addition, and I'm sure it will be valuable to researchers,"" says Dr. Michael Siegel, the physician who leads the Boston University project. He notes that, since it launched, the Boston database has been most helpful for journalists writing about gun violence.

""It's funny because I didn't actually think about that as a purpose of the project when we started it,"" says Siegel, ""but it seems to have become the primary use of the database so far (in addition to use by other researchers).""

The RAND team also surveyed 95 gun policy experts from across the political spectrum about what they thought the effects of 15 different gun policies would be on 12 outcomes. The policies included universal background checks, bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanded mental illness prohibitions, minimum age requirements and required reporting of lost or stolen weapons.

Many of the policies are now being considered by state and federal lawmakers, after a man used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school in February.

The vast majority of the specialists RAND surveyed agreed that the primary objectives of gun policies should be reducing suicides and homicides, and that protecting privacy, enabling hunting and sport shooting and preventing mass shootings were secondary priorities.

""That was a surprise, actually,"" says Morral. ""I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values — or that it's a values problem, in any case. But that's not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order.""

However, those surveyed varied widely in their predictions about how different policies would affect each outcome.

""Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts,"" says Morral. ""And the facts are sparse."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption George Frey/Getty Images George Frey/Getty Images

An increasing number of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, want more gun regulation, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll that surveyed people in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting.

Three-quarters of people polled said gun laws should be stricter than they are today. That's an increase — in a short period of time — from October 2017, when NPR conducted a similar survey in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Then, 68 percent said gun laws should be stricter than they were.

The poll also found widespread bipartisan support for a range of gun-control policies, including:

requiring background checks for all gun buyers (94 percent),

adding people with mental illnesses to the federal gun background check system (92 percent),

raising the legal age to purchase guns from 18 to 21 (82 percent),

banning bump stocks (81 percent),

banning high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds (73 percent) and

banning assault-style weapons (72 percent).

The only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by President Trump — the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools.

The poll also found that while nearly every gun policy was supported by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, the one exception was arming teachers.

There was a clear-cut partisan gulf — 68 percent of Republicans favored the idea of training teachers to carry guns compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Arming teachers was by far the most polarizing policy suggestion; the poll found a 50-point divide between Republicans and Democrats.

Trump's in sync with his base

The president's outspoken criticism of schools as gun-free zones and his recent rhetoric calling for a comprehensive gun bill suggests he's acutely aware of how his base voters feel about gun policies — and the growing desire, even among Republicans, for some sort of stricter gun-control legislation.

""We see in this study, a majority of Republicans saying that they are supportive of a variety of different gun-control measures, many of which Trump mentioned explicitly in his [White House] briefing,"" said Chris Jackson, director of the public polling team at Ipsos. ""And that's in contrast to a lot of Republican elected officials, who have taken a much more Second Amendment absolutist stance.""

Although Trump remains friendly with the National Rifle Association and its leadership, he's recently shown a willingness to challenge GOP orthodoxy on guns.

In a televised White House meeting with legislators Wednesday, Trump surprised (and angered) many of his fellow conservative lawmakers with his ad-hoc approach to gun-control policy. He questioned his fellow Republicans' relationship with the NRA and dismissed a concealed carry provision that conservatives wanted as a trade-off for some restrictions.

""They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,"" Trump told GOP lawmakers at that meeting, adding, ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.""

Trump suggested he was open to expanding background checks and possibly raising the age to purchase an AR-15. (Both popular measures, according to the NPR/Ipsos poll).

""President Trump is actually closer to where the Republican base is on the issue of guns than a lot of Republican elected officials,"" Jackson said. ""And I think this is something that Trump has done a lot through his political career; he often times finds himself closer to the Republican base than the establishment does.""

Of course, the president has a history of adopting popular opinions and speaking to the polls, and then subsequently reversing his position and reverting to a more traditionally conservative attitude, as he did with his initial support for a bill that would protect DACA recipients from deportation.

Americans want Congress to act

Any hope for a quick legislative answer to the gun debate fell apart in the Senate Thursday. And although the Senate now has no plans to vote on gun legislation in the near future, the NPR/Ipsos poll finds that a majority of Americans (78 percent) say Congress needs to do more to address gun violence.

But the intensity for congressional action lies with the Democrats — 93 percent of whom want more action, compared to 68 percent among Republicans.

Loading...

Jackson said the biggest change he's noticed since the October survey is the overall importance people are giving to the gun debate. Crime/gun violence is now the No. 1 issue worrying Americans. (Last October, it was terrorism).

The shift since last fall is largely because more Democrats and independents say they're concerned about guns, but Republicans shifted some as well.

And the poll found Americans are currently saying guns will be an important factor in their vote this November. Roughly two-thirds, or 63 percent, said so.

Traditionally, gun control is one of those issues that's dominated by a small slice of the electorate — an energized group of committed gun-rights activists.

But the political winds may be shifting.

""This data indicates there's actually an increasing energy on the side of gun control,"" Jackson said. And ""given that guns have become very partisan, that may have really significant results in the midterms.""

And there are signs the NRA's influence among voters may be declining. The NPR survey shows a decreasing number of Americans overall (led by a shift in Democrats' attitudes) said the NRA represents their views — just 36 percent overall down from 43 percent in October.

Guns are still partisan

There are still some major disagreements along party lines that reflect the overall gun debate in the country.

On the question of whether the country would be safer if more people carried guns, there was a huge divide, for example — 55 percent of Republicans felt the country would be safer, compared to just 15 percent of Democrats.

Loading...

And likewise, when people were asked whether they believed the premise that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun — there was a split along partisan lines — 71 percent of Republicans agreed, compared to 24 percent of Democrats.

The split over Trump's handling of the Parkland shooting situation seems to mirror his overall approval rating and shows how much partisanship affects people's perspectives — 71 percent of Republicans approved of how the president handled the aftermath of the school shooting, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats.

The poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Robert Cianflone/Getty Images Robert Cianflone/Getty Images

Australia says it collected more than 57,000 illegal firearms during a three-month amnesty last year – the first such program since tough gun laws were enacted in the wake of the country's worst mass shooting in 1996.

The amnesty, which ran from July through September, netted almost 2,500 semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons that were the target firearms legislation beginning in 1996 that banned private ownership of such rifles.

Unregistered firearms are illegal in Australia and owning one carries a penalty up to 14 years in jail and a US$225,000 fine.

""Taking these unregistered firearms off the streets means they will not fall into the hands of criminals, who might use them to endanger the lives of innocent Australians,"" Law Enforcement Minister Angus Taylor said Thursday.

Among the more unusual weapons recovered were a rusting anti-armor rocket launcher, a German machine gun dating from World War I and a muzzle-loading pistol produced circa 1860.

The largest number were surrendered in New South Wales — 24,831, while Queensland handed in 16,375; Victoria 9,175 and South Australia 2,825, with Tasmania, Western Australia and the Northern Territory accounting for the rest, officials said according to 9 News.

Last year's amnesty was meant to absorb some of the country's estimated 260,000 illegal guns in circulation – although the figure could be much higher, officials say.

In 2016, Chris Dawson, the head of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, said that outlaw biker gangs and Middle Eastern crime groups were thought to be responsible for illegal gun trafficking, according to The Age newspaper.

Australia's response to the April 28, 1996, massacre in Port Arthur, Tasmania, is widely viewed as a model that those in favor of stricter gun measures say the U.S. could emulate.

The Port Arthur shooter used an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle – the same weapon that has been featured in a number of mass shootings in the U.S., including the one last month that resulted in 17 deaths at a Parkland, Fla., high school.

In the decade before the Port Arthur massacre, which killed 35 people, there had been about ten mass shootings in Australia; however, in the 16 years since changes to gun laws were fully enacted in 2002, the number of such crimes has fallen precipitously. The homicide rate has also dropped, although some experts debate whether changes in gun laws are the only factor.

As NPR wrote in 2012, ""The new laws [in Australia] prohibited all automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and imposed strict licensing rules. Even paintball guns need a permit. There are also background checks and lengthy waiting periods for all purchases.""

In a 2017 interview with NPR's Here & Now, former Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who was in office when the tougher gun laws were passed, said they show that a country ""can have a sensible policy on guns and reduce the number of people being killed by guns and the gun massacres.""

However, as we reported in 2013, the efficacy of gun-buyback programs in the U.S. – similar to Australia's gun amnesty, but with a monetary incentive — has been questioned.

""Getting at the weapons you really want is not easy,"" William Woodward, director for training and technical assistance at the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told NPR. ""Years ago, when they first tried gun buybacks, they ran into the same problem. People brought in guns that were broken so they could get the cash, or they'd go out and get someone else's gun to turn in — but not the one they were planning on using."""

Updated at 7:40 p.m. ET

Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods say they won't sell guns to customers under 21, and both are putting new restrictions on ammunition sales.

Dick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest sports retailers in the U.S., has announced it is immediately ending its sales of military-style semi-automatic rifles and is requiring all customers to be older than 21 to buy a firearm at its stores. Additionally, the company no longer will sell high-capacity magazines.

Walmart, which ended sales of modern sporting rifles such as AR-15s in 2015, has announced that it is raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21. The company notes that it does not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories.

Walmart is also removing items from its website ""resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys"" — like the air gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was shot by a Cleveland police officer who thought the 12-year-old was armed.

Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack announced the firm's decision on ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday, the same day that survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School returned to class. Stack said the 19-year-old gunman allegedly behind that massacre, which claimed 17 lives and wounded many more in Parkland, Fla., had purchased a firearm from the retailer last November.

While that the weapon — a shotgun — was not used in the shooting, the CEO said the revelation deeply affected Stack and his colleagues at Dick's.

""We did everything by the book. We did everything that the law required, and still he was able to buy a gun,"" Stack said. ""When we looked at that, we said the systems that are in place across the board just aren't effective enough to keep us from selling a gun like that.

""And so we've decided we're not going to sell the assault-type rifles any longer.""

The company, which operates more than 715 locations, already had pulled assault-style weapons from Dick's stores after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting; now it will also stop selling the weapons at its subsidiary Field & Stream stores.

Stack said the decision to eliminate assault-style rifles is permanent.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims and their loved ones,"" the company said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We have tremendous respect and admiration for the students organizing and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country.

""We have heard you. The nation has heard you. ... The systems in place are not effective to protect our kids and our citizens.""

The statement asserted the company's support for the Second Amendment but continued, ""we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic.""

In addition to changing its own policies, the company issued a plea to elected officials to enact ""common-sense gun reform,"" specifically calling for the following regulations:

Ban assault-style firearms

Raise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21

Ban high-capacity magazines, as well as bump stocks — gun accessories that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate like fully automatic weapons

Require universal background checks that include relevant mental health information and previous interactions with the law

Ensure a complete universal database of those banned from buying firearms

Close the private sale and gun show loopholes that waive background checks

With their moves, Dick's and Walmart join a host of major companies that made changes in reaction to the Parkland shooting. As NPR's Amy Held reported last week, many other high-profile companies — from MetLife Insurance and First National Bank of Omaha to Symantec and Hertz — have ended their corporate partnerships with the National Rifle Association.

Those moves have not been without controversy.

Earlier this week, for instance, Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle threatened to ""kill any tax legislation that benefits"" Delta Air Lines after the company ended its own relationship with the NRA. Delta, which is based in Atlanta, had announced two days earlier that ""we will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website"" — a decision Cagle described as an attack on conservatives.

Asked about the potential for pushback among gun rights advocates, Stack acknowledged the move ""isn't going to make everyone happy. But when we look at what those kids and the parents and the heroes in the school, what they did, our view was: If the kids can be brave enough to organize like this, we can be brave enough to get these [firearms] out of here.""

""We're staunch supporters of the Second Amendment,"" he added. ""I'm a gun owner myself. We've just decided that based on what's happened and with these guns, we don't want to be part of this story."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

Updated at 3:05 a.m. ET Friday

Plans for a speedy Senate vote on gun legislation crumbled Thursday as Senate leaders announced plans to move on to long-planned banking legislation, while congressional Republicans struggle to make sense of President Trump's wishes on guns.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Thursday that the Senate will move on to the banking bill after voting on several nominations this week. McConnell said he hopes to vote on changes to the background check system for most gun purchases but did not provide a timeline or any further details.

""We'd love to do that at some point,"" McConnell said. ""I'm hoping there is a way forward.""

The lack of commitment is the surest sign yet that Congress does not plan to quickly address gun access, despite pressure from the White House and survivors of last month's deadly shooting at a Florida high school.

There is no plan for any action on gun legislation ahead of the two-week Easter recess at the end of March. The Senate will next take up Idaho GOP Sen. Mike Crapo's bipartisan legislation to ease bank regulations. The Senate also plans to vote this month on Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman's legislation to combat sex trafficking, and Congress must pass a sweeping spending package by March 23.

There is no room in the agenda for guns, unless senators reach agreement on legislation that could move through the Senate via an expedited process known as unanimous consent. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who is opposed to any new restrictions on gun rights, said he did not believe that kind of consensus was within reach. ""Look, we've got a lot of disagreement on the Republican side, and I would be surprised if something moved anytime soon,"" he said.

Widespread confusion

The sharp departure was the result of widespread confusion on Capitol Hill over guns. Republicans spent the day Thursday struggling to respond to a set of vague instructions Trump laid out during a televised meeting at the White House.

That meeting followed a familiar pattern for many lawmakers who are trying to write and pass legislation that can meet Trump's shifting approval. Even many Republicans responded to the White House meeting with confusion and frustration over the lack of clear guidance from the president.

Over the course of the hourlong broadcast Trump seemed to embrace plans to expand background checks and increase age limits for purchasing long gun rifles, positions generally anathema to congressional Republicans. He also suggested pre-emptively taking guns away from potentially dangerous people, a policy that might draw significant legal challenges.

""I don't know, you saw it, right? It was wild,"" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a Republican. ""I think the president is going to have to narrow his list of what he'd like to see addressed and figure out what's realistic.""

The disconnect between Trump and congressional Republicans on core philosophical issues on display this week, coupled with the lingering partisan anger between the two parties following the failed immigration talks, is quickly lowering already dim expectations that 2018 will result in much legislative output.

Adding to the confusion, however, Trump and Vice President Pence met Thursday with Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm. The president tweeted that it was a ""Good (Great) meeting ..."" and Cox said in a tweet after the meeting that ""POTUS & VPOTUS support he Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control.""

The only must-pass measure on the agenda is the spending bill still being drafted to finalize the appropriations process for the year that, once passed, will free up lawmakers to focus their efforts on what is quickly overtaking Capitol Hill: the battle for control of Congress in the midterm elections.

Republicans say they all agree that something needs to be done to curb gun violence, but there is little, if any, consensus on the best way to do that while still maintaining gun rights. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters Thursday that he is not inclined to support any of the numerous gun-related bills that have been floated in recent days.

""I'm not inclined to do anything right now except to see what comes up,"" Shelby said. ""We all are interested in our children being safe in schools; we're all interested in the communities being safe. It's how do we get there?""

Trump often acknowledges that it's hard to pass any legislation in Congress, let alone laws to curb gun rights. But many lawmakers, including some Republicans, say Trump's own statements make the already difficult task of passing gun legislation even harder.

The meeting concluded with Trump asking lawmakers to go back and talk about the extensive list of proposals floated at the meeting, and without a White House endorsement of any specific plan.

""Element of unpredictability""

Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Ryan Costello told NPR's Morning Edition that he worries that kind of broad directive makes it harder for Congress to focus its attention on specific legislation that could pass and eventually become law.

""There's still an element of unpredictability on what the White House is willing to lean on from a gun safety reform measure,"" Costello said. ""There was a bit of contradiction in what he said.""

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of the leading lawmakers working on a proposal to update the criminal background check system, shared similar concerns Wednesday after the meeting adjourned. Cornyn told reporters that it is his experience that passing these measures is harder than it sounds.

""I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,"" Cornyn said. ""He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.""

Shock at tariff announcement

Republicans still reeling from the fallout of Trump's conflicting comments during Wednesday's gun meeting were again taken by surprise Thursday with the White House announcement of impending tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The decision upends long-standing GOP orthodoxy on trade policy and provoked fears among senators of a trade war with China and other traditional allies that threatens to harm the U.S. economy more than tariffs promise to help.

""Every time you do this you get a retaliation, and agriculture is the No. 1 target,"" said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kansas. ""I think this is terribly unproductive for the ag economy."" China is already signaling it could retaliate against U.S. sorghum exports. Kansas is the country's top sorghum producer.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the president's decision is counter to the view of the Senate GOP Conference, which has in prior meetings urged Trump not to impose these tariffs. ""I think every Republican is pretty well on the same side of the page from that standpoint, resisting what [Trump] and his trade advisers were talking about,"" Johnson said. ""We have been talking to the administration almost in a unanimous fashion, warning against protectionist measures, warning against these types of tariffs."""

Updated at 7:52 p.m. ET

In a freewheeling meeting with lawmakers on efforts to curtail gun violence, President Trump appeared to throw his support behind a number of conflicting measures, including some that are opposed by the powerful gun lobby.

Conservatives and allies of the president were angered by such signals on Wednesday, while others have begun to sound the alarm that Trump is continuing to demonstrate an unfamiliarity with basic policy proposals and a misunderstanding of the legislative process.

During the gathering at the White House of both GOP and Democratic lawmakers, the president showed an openness to expanding background checks, possibly raising the age to purchase AR-15 rifles and also overriding due process, if necessary, to take guns away from mentally ill people or those who have been red-flagged as potential dangers, as the admitted shooter in Parkland, Fla., two weeks ago had been.

Trump bluntly told GOP lawmakers that any effort to include a concealed-carry reciprocity measure with a gun bill would effectively sink its chances — which is because of firm opposition from Senate Democrats. But there were other moments where the president showed a naiveté of the lawmaking process, claiming that it would be easy to get 60 votes for a bill to pass the Senate, suggesting merging some incompatible ideas and chiding lawmakers for being too beholden to the National Rifle Association — a group from which he has enjoyed broad support and with whose leaders he remains particularly chummy.

The fallout from the meeting already has one pro-Trump news website turning on the president.

""Trump the Gun Grabber: Cedes Dems' Wish List— Bump Stocks, Buying Age, 'Assault Weapons,' Background Checks..."" was the headline on Breitbart News afterward.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters the White House meeting did little to advance the debate in Congress over legislation aimed at curbing gun violence.

""It's still unclear to me what can actually pass, and my experience is these things are harder to do than they sound. So I think we'll sleep on it and see where we are tomorrow,"" he said.

The president repeatedly challenged long-standing GOP orthodoxy on gun policy in Wednesday's meeting, leaving legislators bewildered by what happens next and what, precisely, Trump actually supports.

""I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,"" Cornyn said. ""He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.""

Emphasis on comprehensive legislation

Trump underscored that he wants a bill that will address many issues he believes has contributed to mass shootings over the past few decades, ranging from background check loopholes to mental health legislation.

""We can really get there but we have to do it,"" Trump said at the outset of the meeting.

There are two major bipartisan Senate bills the president seized upon and even suggested could be merged. First, he voiced support for the effort by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., which failed in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, that would have expanded background checks.

Trump expressed disbelief that such a bill didn't pass after such a devastating attack that killed 20 young children and six adults. And one reason it failed, he chided, was that then-President Barack Obama didn't sufficiently support it — despite the fact that Obama spent considerable time and political capital to back its passage, calling it ""a pretty shameful day for Washington"" when it fell just six votes short of the 60 needed to advance in the Senate.

Trump asked what that bill did to address raising the age from 18 to 21 for some firearm purchases like AR-15s, which have been used in several deadly shootings. Toomey responded that it didn't currently address it, to which Trump retorted that was because ""you're afraid of the NRA.""

Toomey spokesman Steve Kelly later pointed out in a statement that the NRA downgraded Toomey's rating and refused to back his re-election bid after his bill with Manchin and that he has never taken any money from the group since becoming a senator, which ""demonstrated that he is not afraid of the NRA or any other special interest group.""

The second bill Trump signaled his support for is the ""Fix NICS"" bill proposed by Cornyn and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., which would improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and, they hope, flag people who shouldn't be able to purchase guns.

Murphy, who has been a leading voice for gun control especially after the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., complained that they haven't been able to get anywhere significant in the past few years because ""the gun lobby has a veto power.""

""If all we end up doing is the stuff that the gun industry supports, then this just isn't worth it,"" Murphy said.

He also argued that implementing universal background checks is critical, citing statistics that gun murders in states with such checks have dropped by over one-third. Currently, background checks at gun shows and for Internet sales aren't federally mandated. The NRA has opposed such an expansion.

Later on, Trump again posited he would be willing to buck the NRA if necessary — despite the fact he has repeatedly assured the lobbying group he is a loyal ally, had lunch over the weekend with the group's leaders and said earlier in the meeting that he is a ""big fan"" of the group.

""They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,"" Trump said, latter adding that, ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.""

Trump also suggested merging the assault weapons ban bill that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has proposed with the Manchin-Toomey and Cornyn-Murphy bills.

""Dianne, if you could add what you have also — and I think you can — into the bill,"" Trump said at one point.

Any effort to ban assault weapons or AR-15 rifles would be a nonstarter with the NRA and Republicans.

Feinstein was visibly amused, exclaiming, ""Joe, are you ready?"" as the West Virginia senator hung his head.

And Trump also pushed back against House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. — who was shot and critically wounded last June during a congressional baseball practice — when he talked about the House's efforts to attach concealed-carry reciprocity across state lines to the Cornyn-Murphy bill.

""Steve, it's very hard to add the one thing that you want. ... Let's consider it for a separate bill,"" the president said.

""Take the gun first, go through due process second""

One of the more surprising stances Trump took appeared to flout due process for gun owners.

After Vice President Pence began to talk about how he and the president had conversations with governors earlier this week, Trump interjected that people should ""take the firearms first and then go to court"" if there is a concern about someone having a gun and potentially being unstable or likely to commit violence.

""A lot of times by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures, I like taking the guns early,"" Trump continued.

The president cited multiple warnings that lawmakers had about the Parkland shooter that went ignored by law enforcement.

""Take the gun first, go through due process second,"" Trump said.

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic, was not amused by such a suggestion.

""Strong leaders don't automatically agree with the last thing that was said to them. We have the Second Amendment and due process of law for a reason,"" Sasse said in a statement after the meeting. ""We're not ditching any Constitutional protections simply because the last person the President talked to today doesn't like them.""

At last week's Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump warned the crowd that it was Democrats who would ""take away your Second Amendment ... which we will never allow that.""

Doubling down on arming teachers

Trump did reiterate his support for one measure the NRA has heavily backed — arming some teachers and school personnel, ending gun-free school zones as a way to solidify school security.

""You've got to have defense too,"" the president said in his opening remarks. ""You can't just be sitting ducks, and that's exactly what we've allowed people in these buildings to be.""

""They're not going to come in when they know they're going to come out dead,"" Trump later added, though he did seem to suggest it could be an issue left up to individual states.

Some lawmakers, such as Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., and Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., spoke in support of such a proposal. Others, including Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., who represents Parkland, said he and many others oppose such measures.

Will any of this matter?

While the meeting did show that there could be some consensus reached on these issues, Trump has often thrown his support behind measures, only to see those endorsements walked back later by White House staff or contradicted by the president himself. That's on top of the fact that the president often appears highly influenced by the last person he talked to about an issue. So anything Trump appeared to get behind or suggest at the meeting should be taken with a grain of salt.

A similar bipartisan meeting happened in early January on efforts to field a comprehensive immigration bill that would address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In that meeting, Trump suggested he would sign any bill lawmakers sent him and that he would take any heat and expected backlash from the anti-immigration wing, which has been a major bloc of support for the president.

But later Trump insisted that any bill contain not only funding for his border wall but cuts to legal immigration, which was a nonstarter with Democrats and even some Republicans. Ultimately, many proposals failed earlier this month in the Senate.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. — a sometimes critic, sometimes ally of Trump's — expressed some skepticism after the meeting and also issued a warning.

""If the president has another one of these sessions and he doesn't follow through, it's going to hurt him. It's going to hurt the Republican Party,"" Graham told CNN. ""I've seen this movie before. If it ends up like immigration he's done himself a lot of harm.""

Cornyn also said many of Trump's comments would not sway the debate. ""I wouldn't confuse what he said with what can actually pass. I don't expect to see any great divergence in terms of people's views on the Second Amendment, for example.""

Cornyn is still supporting his incremental, bipartisan bill co-authored with Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, to improve the current background check system. But without broad agreement in the Senate, the legislation could easily get bogged down in more controversial gun debates.

""It's pretty clear to me that we're not going to get that consent agreement, so that means [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] is going to have to make a decision on how to proceed and how much floor time he's willing to commit to this,"" Cornyn said.

Earlier in the week Cornyn expressed hope that Congress could act on the bill this week, but he said Wednesday it is clear that will not happen. Like many lawmakers, he was candid that this gun debate may again yield no tangible legislative results.

""I think the deadline is going to be the next mass shooting. It's only a matter of time, and if we don't do something I think there's going to be a heavy price to pay,"" he said.

The Texas Republican added: ""I don't want to meet another family who lost a loved one in a mass shooting and think we could have done something which would have prevented this, but we didn't do it because we didn't act."""

A well-liked social studies teacher barricaded himself in a classroom and fired a handgun at Dalton High School, which plunged students and faculty into a lockdown and subsequent evacuation, according to the AP.

No students were in the classroom. The only injury was to a student who hurt her ankle running away, tweeted the police in Dalton, which is about 90 miles north of Atlanta.

Police confirmed that the teacher was Jesse Randal Davidson, 53. He taught social studies, and served as play-by-play voice of the school's football team. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Davidson had been at the school since 2004, and was recognized as the school's ""top teacher"" in 2012.

The incident occurred two weeks after a shooting incident at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., left 17 dead, and as its survivors are igniting a new debate over gun control around the United States.

After that shooting, both the National Rifle Association and President Trump have suggested that arming teachers could discourage would-be shooters from entering schools. ""We have to have offensive capability to take these people out rapidly before they can do this kind of damage,"" Trump said last week.

As NPR has reported, ""many educators are uncomfortable with the idea, and worry that it could put students in further harm and deter people from entering the field of teaching, which is already facing shortages.""

The AP reports:

""The teacher was taken into custody without incident after a 30- to 45-minute standoff with officers, police spokesman Bruce Frazier said. ... ""Police noted that Davidson didn't appear to want to hurt the students or faculty. He fired the gun at an exterior window when the principal tried to enter the classroom. ... ""The shooting happened about 11:30 a.m. during Davidson's planning period. At first, students tried to get into the classroom, but they couldn't. The students told the principal, who tried to enter. ""'I didn't get the door open very far, but he slammed the door and hollered ""Go away, don't come in here."" He had some nonsensical noises that were made as well,' Principal Steve Bartoo said. ""Bartoo returned a short time later and put his key in the door 'and again he slammed the door before I could open it and he said, ""Don't come in here, I have a gun.""' ""That's when Davidson fired and the school was placed on lockdown, authorities said.""

Students of the class took to social media to discuss the incident, including Chondi Chastain, who told the AP that she was scheduled to have Davidson's class later that afternoon. ""I dare you to tell me arming teachers will make us safe,"" she tweeted to the NRA.

Davidson has been charged with ""aggravated assault, carrying weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of gun during commission of a crime, and disrupting public school,"" according to Dalton Police.

Students are excused from coming to Dalton High School Thursday, but faculty and police will be there. The school will resume classes on Friday."

High school students across the United States have been leading the call for more gun control since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

Some have called them the ""voice of a generation on gun control"" that may be able to turn the tide of a long-simmering debate.

But past polling suggests that people younger than 30 in the U.S. are no more liberal on gun control than their parents or grandparents — despite diverging from their elders on the legalization of marijuana, same-sex marriage and other social issues.

""Sometimes people surprise us, and this is one of those instances that we don't know why,"" says Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of Gallup.

Over the past three years, his polling organization asked the under-30 crowd whether gun laws in the U.S. should be made more strict, less strict or kept as they are now. On average, people between the ages of 18 and 29 were 1 percentage point more likely to say gun laws should be more strict than the overall national average of 57 percent.

""Young people statistically aren't that much different than anybody else,"" Newport says.

'What a whole generation feels'?

Polling by the Pew Research Center last year came to similar conclusions: 50 percent of millennials, between the ages of 18 and 36, said gun laws in the U.S. should be more strict. That share was almost identical among the general public, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew.

Pew did find significant differences between millennials and older generations on two gun control proposals — banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The results showed that a greater share of millennials — both Republicans and Democrats — are more conservative when it comes to those bans compared with Generation Xers, baby boomers and members of the silent generation.

""What we're hearing now in the immediate aftermath of Parkland might not be representative of what a whole generation feels,"" Parker says.

To be clear, many demographers argue that millennials make up one part of today's generation of young people. Some say that millennials include people born in the 1980s and all the way through 2000.

The teenage high school activists who have been organizing since the Florida shooting, they say, are part of a separate group some call ""Generation Z."" Pollsters generally don't count the views of those under 18, so there probably won't be national polling on this group until more of these young people are officially adults.

'A more progressive generation'?

Still, for 19-year-old Abigail Kaye, who considers herself a millennial, these polling results about her peers come as a shock.

""I think that's surprising because I feel like we're a more progressive generation,"" says Kaye, who attends the University of Delaware.

Kaye says she remembers hearing about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., when she was growing up about a couple hours away in Scituate, R.I.

""We've grown up more, I think, with this kind of gun violence, so you'd think maybe we'd push for more regulations,"" she adds.

The poll findings also surprised some members of Students for the Second Amendment, a club at the University of Delaware.

The club's treasurer, Jordan Riger of Lutherville, Md., 22, says that after taking an National Rifle Association course on pistol shooting when she was 18, she has seen firearms as tools for self-defense. But she thinks many of her millennial peers don't.

""We are living in a time right now where we're seeing a lot more of these mass casualties,"" Riger says. ""I think when people don't know that much about firearms, when they see it on the news used in horrible fashion, that's like all they associate it with.""

Sitting outside a student center on the University of Delaware's campus, Cahlil Evans of Smyrna, Del., 20, says while he doesn't need a gun, he can understand why people would want hunting rifles and handguns. He draws the line, though, for assault-style rifles.

""There's no need for these high-caliber rifles that pierce through walls,"" Evans says. ""People can say they use them for hunting or whatever, but why do you need a weapon with such high caliber that it would pierce through the animal and like eight trees behind it?""

Still, 22-year-old Jeremy Grunden of Harrington, Del., says he is encouraged to hear that millennials are less likely to support banning assault-style weapons.

""I base what we need off of what the military has,"" says Grunden, who is president of Students for the Second Amendment at the University of Delaware. ""When it comes to ... the Second Amendment, we're supposed to be a well-armed and well-maintained militia and all that. Quite frankly, we need that and plus more."""

In Florida, state lawmakers continue to debate gun control. Gov. Rick Scott urged Republicans and Democrats to come up with legislation by the end of next week, when the legislative session ends.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Let's turn to Florida now, where the state Senate is holding a rare Saturday session. Members of the legislature are considering a number of gun and school safety measures following last month's shooting in Parkland. Sascha Cordner from member station WFSU has been following the debate in Florida and the ideas dominating the conversation.

SASCHA CORDNER, BYLINE: Lawmakers in Florida's capitol have been saying they want to pass some form of legislation since the parents and student survivors from Parkland began demanding it shortly after the shooting. Legislators have been considering whether to include things like a ban on bump stocks and raising the minimum age for a person to buy any firearm to 21. But provisions like those had one representative, Jay Fant, pointing to the Second Amendment.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAY FANT: This level of infringement upon our most sacred and highest regarded law is tremendously out of place. Instead, focus on the more positive pieces of the legislation proposed.

CORDNER: Like allowing designated teachers to carry firearms if they are deputized and complete law enforcement training. Incoming Florida House Speaker Jose Oliva says it's part of a school marshal program, another idea that's kept coming up during this debate.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOSE OLIVA: Those coaches, those teachers who threw themselves in the line of fire - if they could have had a way to defend themselves and their students, I think - I think that they would have wanted that.

CORDNER: Fant and Oliva our part of the GOP majority controlling the Florida statehouse. Among Democrats, the debate revealed opposition that goes beyond the specific provisions currently on the floor. Representative Kamia Brown is a member of the black legislative caucus.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KAMIA BROWN: While a vast majority of our teachers are wonderful people, there could be situations where guns are actually used against minority students because a teacher says that he or she fears for her life and the safety of others. In this bill, there is no exception to the already-law ""stand your ground"" included. Teachers authorized to carry up under this marshal program will be able to stand their ground when they are threatened by any student - not just an active shooter - and avoid all civil and criminal liability.

CORDNER: For decades, Republican majorities in the Florida legislature have not taken up gun restrictions and have instead passed pro-gun measures like strengthening ""stand your ground."" But there is now more movement on toughening Florida's gun laws. Governor Rick Scott took to the House floor Thursday to urge lawmakers to pass something before the end of the 2018 legislative session.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RICK SCOTT: As you all know, two weeks ago, Florida changed. Seventeen people in our state that didn't deserve to die died. It's horrible this would ever happen anywhere. And when you talk to the families, you just can't imagine what they're going through.

CORDNER: Representative Katie Edwards-Walpole is a Democrat. She says it's time for all sides to work past their differences.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KATIE EDWARDS-WALPOLE: And I would just ask that going forward that those individuals who can't get with it and be a part of this bipartisan compromise and work towards a solution - get the hell out of the way.

CORDNER: And the Florida legislative session ends Friday, so lawmakers have just the coming week to find that solution.

Donald Trump won the backing of the National Rifle Association and many gun owners by opposing limits to the Second Amendment's right to bear arms. But since his election and in the early months of his presidency, Trump has not been good for the gun business.

Shares of publicly traded firearms companies have fallen. The pro-gun president nicking the fortunes of the industry he vowed to protect may seem illogical on its face.

But the slump makes complete sense when seen through unusual economics underlying the gun business. Most businesses are influenced by things such as interest rates and consumer confidence.

In the gun industry, politics and fear matter. And they matter a lot. Over the last two years, there was plenty of both to go around amid terror attacks and school shootings. And, of course, there was the presidential race, which Hillary Clinton was heavily favored to win.

Guns and ammunition sold fast. The FBI processed a record number of background checks on potential gun buyers in 2016. (Background checks are considered the best available proxy for gun purchases since overall sales numbers are not made public.)

Analysts say when gun purchases quickly spike a clear connection can be made to fear, politics, or both. Sales jump when people are fearful for their personal safety following tragedies such as school shootings or domestic terror attacks. Buyers snap up firearms when politicians respond to those events by calling for stronger gun control. And sales are higher with a Democrat in the White House is in position to pick Supreme Court justices.

Since Trump's election, background checks have fallen three straight months from year-ago levels. And shops like Nova Firearms in McLean, Va., have detected a notable drop in sales of certain types of weapons such as AR-15 military-style semi-automatic rifles. During the heat of the campaign, says salesman Tom Jenkins, the shop couldn't keep those weapons in stock. Customers were worried the rifles would be singled out for a ban by Hillary Clinton.

""During the political crisis we had dozens of them downstairs, and then there would be zero. And it would go again and then go again. And right up to the election, literally, brought them in, brought them up and sold them.""

Since Trump's victory those guns aren't moving nearly as fast, says Jenkins, pointing to five AR-15 style weapons on a rack behind the counter of the shop. He says it's a certain type of customer whose buying decisions are influenced by politics.

""The hunter doesn't care who's president. The revolver shooter or the target shooter or the competition shooter really didn't care who was president. It's the self-defense market and the people think certain guns may be tied to politics.""

Jenkins is an ex-cop, former military, a public radio fan, and one of those rare people who talks about Trump's victory without glee or despair.

""It was interesting because it was a shock for pretty much everybody, whether you're on the conservative side or liberal side,"" he says. ""It was like, what's going to happen now?""

One answer to that question became apparent immediately. ""What happened probably quicker than anything is that the gun-related stocks were in freefall,"" says James Hardiman, an equity research analyst who follows the firearms industry for Wedbush Securities.

On the day after the election shares of gun maker Sturm Ruger fell 14 percent. And the price of Smith & Wesson, which has since changed its name to the generic sounding American Outdoor Brands, fell 15 percent. Shares of both companies are still down, in contrast to the overall stock market, which has enjoyed big post-election gains. All of this points to that weird dynamic in the gun business.

""I think people that follow this industry know this well, but maybe people that don't, it's a little counterintuitive, but generally Democrats are very good for gun sales,"" Hardiman says.

The fear that Democrats will make it a lot harder to buy guns has never been very likely, according to Hardiman. And the idea that they will ban guns altogether — he calls that pure fantasy.

""Nonetheless it's fantasy that has worked in the favor of the gun industry for quite some time,"" he says.

Those fears essentially melted away with Donald Trump's victory.

Over at Nova Firearms, Tom Jenkins says politics aren't driving the business right now. Customers are choosy. The basics of supply and demand are at work.

""And so for the first couple of months after the election no one's in a hurry anymore,"" he says."

Updated at 8:30 p.m. ET

The Air Force says a mistake allowed Devin Patrick Kelley to buy guns. On Sunday Kelley opened fire on a small church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

The former airman had an assault-style rifle and two handguns — all purchased by him, according to federal officials — when he shot and killed 26 people.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Texas Department of Public Safety via AP Texas Department of Public Safety via AP

He also had a known record of domestic violence. In 2012, while he was in the U.S. Air Force, he was court-martialed for assaulting his then-wife and stepson. He served a year in confinement at a Naval facility in California after a plea bargain.

Under federal law, his conviction disqualified him from legally possessing a firearm. But there was an apparent breakdown in getting information about his conviction to the proper federal database.

""Initial information indicates that Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations,"" said Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek in an email.

Top Air Force brass have ordered a complete review of the case.

Kelley purchased four guns over a four-year period beginning in 2014, according to federal officials; all those purchases were made after his court-martial conviction and discharge.

An official at the Pentagon tells NPR's Tom Bowman that a mistake resulted in neither the arrest nor the conviction being listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the database that would have flagged him as ineligible to purchase a firearm.

""This was mishandled by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, where Kelley was serving when he was arrested,"" Tom reports. ""An investigation is now underway, and the Air Force is taking it very seriously, said the source.""

""The Service will also conduct a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly. The Air Force has also requested that the Department of Defense Inspector General review records and procedures across the Department of Defense,"" said Stefanek.

Retired Col. Don Christensen, who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force at the time of Kelley's general court-martial, tells NPR that the case was serious.

""He fractured his baby stepson's skull,"" Christensen says.

Kelley accepted a deal, pleading guilty to a charge of assault on his wife and to a charge of ""intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm"" on the child, Christensen says. His crimes were punishable by up to five years confinement (the military equivalent of a prison term). As part of the deal, Kelley received an 18-month cap on his confinement and was ultimately sentenced to 12 months.

Kelley's punitive discharge — a bad conduct discharge — did not prohibit him from owning a gun, as a dishonorable discharge would have.

But under federal law, anyone convicted of ""a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"" is prohibited from possessing a firearm. The same is true for anyone convicted of ""a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" under a provision that allows no exception for the military or law enforcement.

Kelley's conviction qualified under both categories, Christensen says.

NPR's Martin Kaste reports that Academy Sports & Outdoors, a store that sold Kelley guns, says it ran a background check on Kelley twice in the past two years. Kelley passed each time, the company says.

If Kelley's convictions were never uploaded into the system, that could easily explain how he passed. But even if they had been uploaded, there might still have been trouble getting information into the right hands — there's a sort of language barrier between military and civilian justice systems, Christensen says, with different terms for the same kinds of crimes. If the military described a general court-martial for assault, with a sentence of one year, the civilian authorities might ""never realize"" it was a domestic violence conviction punishable by five years, he says.

In general, there are some ""gaping holes"" in the current background check system, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reported last year, which can allow people who should fail background checks to buy guns anyway. And if Kelley had purchased a gun from a private seller, he wouldn't have had to pass a background check at all, Martin notes.

Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says Kelley applied for a license to carry a gun and was rejected, Martin reports. He notes that Texas requires a background check but also has additional training and tests that Kelley may not have completed.

As NPR has previously reported, mass shootings are often linked to domestic violence. In fact, in a majority of mass shootings, the shooter's current or former partner, or another family member, is among the victims."

Updated at 5:14 p.m.

An FBI examination of the windshield of the Amtrak train that derailed last week in Philadelphia, killing eight people, has found no evidence of damage that could have been caused by a firearm, the National Transportation Safety Board says.

But, the agency said in a statement, ""The NTSB has not ruled out the possibility that another object may have struck the windshield.""

As we reported May 15, one of the assistant conductors on Amtrak Train 188, traveling between Washington and New York, told investigators that just prior to the crash she heard a radio transmission from the train's engineer that the locomotive had been struck.

At the time, NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said the agency had seen damage to the left-hand lower portion of the Amtrak's windshield. The engineer has no memory of what happened after the train passed North Philadelphia station. The NTSB says the train was traveling at 106 mph when it made the turn rated for 50 mph.

Commuter service between Philadelphia and New York City had been halted for a week after the derailment. But on Monday morning, trains began rolling. The Associated Press reports:

""Amtrak resumed service along the corridor with a 5:30 a.m. southbound train leaving New York City. The first northbound train, scheduled to leave Philadelphia at 5:53 a.m., was delayed and pulled out of 30th Street Station at 6:07 a.m. ""About three dozen passengers boarded the New York City-bound train in Philadelphia, and Mayor Michael Nutter was on hard to see the passengers and train off. ""All Acela Express, Northeast Regional and other services were to also resume.""

Amtrak President & CEO Joe Boardman said in a statement: ""The safety of our passengers and crew remains our number one priority. Our infrastructure repairs have been made with the utmost care and emphasis on infrastructure integrity including complete compliance with Federal Railroad Administration directives."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images

Gov. Jerry Brown has signed new gun control legislation for California, enacting bills that limit magazine capacity to 10 bullets; require a background check for those purchasing ammunition; and restrict the lending of firearms, among other effects.

In signing the bills, Brown said he wants ""to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.""

Two of the bills close the ""bullet button loophole,"" as member station KPCC reports:

""The loophole refers to the sale of 'California legal' firearms that don't fall under California's ban of guns with detachable magazines. ""To get around the law, manufacturers created versions of firearms that feature a button that can be pushed with a small tool — for instance the tip of a bullet — to release an empty magazine and insert a new one.""

Another bill that will now become law tries to limit ""straw purchasing,"" the practice of a person buying a gun legally with the intent of giving or selling the weapon to someone else. In addition to making it a misdemeanor to file a false report about a gun being lost or stolen, the new law will prohibit the purchaser from buying another gun for 10 years.

As KPCC reminds us, the classification of a gun as an ""assault weapon"" is a legal designation in California:

""Legislators established the 'assault weapon' as a new classification of firearm in 1989. Following a court challenge in 2000, the law was upheld. Gun owners could keep their assault weapons provided they registered with the state before Jan. 23, 2001.""

The legislation was signed almost exactly seven months after husband-and-wife shooters Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. In April, a relative of the murderers was charged with providing the guns they used.

All of the bills Brown signed were sponsored by Democrats — and so were the five bills that he vetoed, although one of those, which makes it a felony to steal a gun, was also sponsored by Republican Assemblywoman Melissa A. Melendez.

In rejecting that bill, Brown said a similar measure is already slated to appear as a state ballot issue in November.

Brown vetoed another bill that would make it a misdemeanor not to report the loss or theft of a gun, saying he doesn't believe the measure would help stop gun traffickers. He added that the bill wouldn't make irresponsible people become responsible.

Another bill that sought to classify the body of a firearm as a firearm, thus closing a loophole that has allowed unfinished gun frames or receivers to be sold under less scrutiny than a finished gun would require, was deemed to have wording that was too vague."

Renee Montagne and Ari Shapiro Discuss the Ruling on 'Morning Edition' Listen

Q&A: D.C. Gun Ban Overturned; What's Next? The Supreme Court ruling doesn't mean that anyone can now buy and own a handgun in Washington, D.C. Those who want a gun will still need to obtain a license. Read what else to expect as a result of the court's decision.

U.S. Gun Laws: A History The Supreme Court's decision on the right to bear arms is the latest milestone in the long history of U.S. gun legislation. Read our selected timeline of key laws.

Interpreting the Second Amendment The decision to overturn the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns is the Surpeme Court's first conclusive interpretation of the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791.

This is a great moment in American history. It vindicates individual Americans all over this country who have always known that this is their freedom worth protecting. Read the NRA's Full Statement

While we disagree with the Supreme Court's ruling, which strips the citizens of the District of Columbia of a law they strongly support, the decision clearly suggests that other gun laws are entirely consistent with the Constitution. Read Helmke's Full Statement

In a dramatic moment on the last day of this term, the Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to self-defense and gun ownership.

For most of the last century, the interpretation of the Second Amendment has been that the right to bear arms is a collective right, such as with military service; Thursday's ruling says gun ownership is also an individual right.

The 5-4 ruling grows out of a Washington, D.C., case in which a security guard sued the district for prohibiting him from keeping his handgun at home. In the District of Columbia, it is a crime to carry an unregistered firearm, and the registration of handguns is prohibited. The rules are so strict, they essentially regulate handguns out of existence. The regulations were intended to curb gun violence in the capital city.

The ruling struck down the ban on constitutional grounds, saying it flew in the face of the constitutional right to bear arms.

An Individual Right

The precise meaning of the Second Amendment — ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"" — has long been a subject for debate. In a decision nearly 70 years ago, the justices suggested it was a collective right, not an individual right to bear arms. This is the first time the court has defined the amendment so definitively.

The two sides in this case viewed the Founding Fathers' intentions very differently. The majority of the justices said the amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that firearm for lawful purposes, such as self-defense in the home. The dissenting justices said the amendment protects only the right to possess and carry a firearm in connection with militia service.

""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapons whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. But it did allow for individuals to have guns for lawful purposes, such as hunting and defending themselves, he said. The majority clearly saw the individual right to own a gun.

Other Restrictions Remain

The ruling will leave intact many of the restrictions in place at the federal and state level, such as bans on a felon's right to keep a gun, and bans on assault weapons and sawed-off shotguns.

But Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissent, said that the ruling leaves it to future courts to define the actual details of the right to bear arms. This should be the business of state legislatures, he said, and the court should stay out of it. Law-abiding citizens will be permitted to keep guns at home, but that doesn't address how state legislatures might want to regulate or curb gun ownership.

The court also struck down Washington's requirement that firearms be equipped with trigger locks.

In a separate dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said, ""In my view, there simply is no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the Second Amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime-ridden urban areas.""

Mixed Reactions

The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision.

""Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,"" he said. He also took a thinly veiled shot at the presumptive Democratic nominee, Sen. Barack Obama.

""Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness, today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right — sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly.""

Obama signaled his approval of the ruling in a statement Thursday.

""Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country,"" he said, adding that ""what works in Chicago may not work in Cheyenne,"" but the decision reinforced that ""if we act responsibly, we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe.""

Gun rights supporters hailed the decision. ""I consider this the opening salvo in a step-by-step process of providing relief for law-abiding Americans everywhere that have been deprived of this freedom,"" said Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association.

The NRA said it will file lawsuits in San Francisco, Chicago and several of its suburbs challenging handgun restrictions there based on Thursday's outcome.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a leading gun control advocate in Congress, criticized the ruling: ""I believe the people of this great country will be less safe because of it,"" she said.

D.C.'s Law

The capital's gun law was among the nation's strictest.

Dick Anthony Heller, 66, an armed security guard, sued the district after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his home for protection in the same Capitol Hill neighborhood as the court.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in Heller's favor and struck down Washington's handgun ban, saying the Constitution guarantees Americans the right to own guns and that a total prohibition on handguns is not compatible with that right.

The issue caused a split within the Bush administration. Vice President Dick Cheney supported the appeals court ruling, but others in the administration feared it could lead to the undoing of other gun regulations, including a federal law restricting sales of machine guns. Other laws keep felons from buying guns and provide for an instant background check.

Scalia said nothing in Thursday's ruling should ""cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons or the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.""

The law adopted by Washington's city council in 1976 bars residents from owning handguns unless they had one before the law took effect. Shotguns and rifles may be kept in homes if they are registered, kept unloaded and either disassembled or equipped with trigger locks.

Opponents of the law have said it prevents residents from defending themselves. The district says no one would be prosecuted for a gun law violation in cases of self-defense.

Switzerland has an entrenched gun culture that is embraced by most of its 8 million citizens, some of them as young as 10 years old.

Every Swiss community has a shooting range, and depending on who is counting, the alpine country ranks third or fourth in the number of guns per capita.

""You can walk into a cafe in a town where there is a shooting festival and you'll see rifles hanging on the hat rack. It's just incredible. It's just proliferation all over the place, but it's all for a peaceful purpose,"" says Stephen Halbrook, a Virginia-based lawyer who has argued cases for the National Rifle Association.

Halbrook, who has written books on Swiss history, is a frequent visitor to Switzerland and takes part in shooting contests there.

At a shooting range in the town of Dielsdorf outside Zurich, school-aged children like 11-year-old Greta Wolff are introduced to target shooting, a popular Swiss sport.

The sixth-grader — who immigrated to Switzerland with her family from Germany, where guns are far more restricted — is one of the best shots at a recent practice session. She and the other children use air guns to learn proper handling and technique before graduating to real guns.

Firing a gun was easier to learn than playing the piano, says Greta, who is also an accomplished swimmer: ""You have to be sure you stand still and breathe properly before you release the trigger.""

Her father, Markus Wolff, who also shoots for sport, says his daughter first learned to shoot more than 18 months ago after seeing her older brother do it.

Their enthusiasm is music to the ears of Rene Koller, a Swiss army veteran and collector who owns hundreds of guns and heads youth training at the Zurich Shooting Sports Association.

""These days there are too many hobbies available,"" Koller says. ""We have to work hard to get children to take up shooting sports.""

Lower Death Rate Than In The U.S.



But the Swiss — like Americans — are grappling with the question of gun control these days after shooting attacks like one on Feb. 27 that killed four people in a factory outside Lucerne.

Firearm deaths in Switzerland take place at just one-seventh the rate that they occur in the United States. But researchers say guns are often used in suicides and crimes of passion in Switzerland.

Interest in gun ownership is waning, partly due to the shrinking size of the conscripted militia that serves as Switzerland's army. Men between the ages of 20 and 30 report for training and are issued military weapons, which they keep at home.

It's a tradition that some historians say kept the Nazis from trying to overrun Switzerland during World War II.

Gun control advocates argue Swiss authorities have lost track of too many of these military-issued guns, which account for most of the 2.5 million-plus guns in Switzerland.

As well, says Susan Peter, who is the director of the Zurich Women's Shelters Association, one-fifth of her clients report being threatened with guns kept at home by their male spouse or partner.

""It's not a private problem when someone in the family is killed, it's a public problem,"" she says. ""The Swiss government has the responsibility to protect people.""

There's also pressure on the Swiss government to adhere to the Schengen agreement. The accord opens borders between 26 European countries, but makes buying and owning guns more difficult than the Swiss are used to.

In Europe, ""there is a mandate to register all guns and to have a central electronic registration,"" explains Halbrook, the Virginia-based lawyer. ""Germany just announced it was the first to do so — that was on Jan. 1 this year — and others are supposed to follow suit.""

Pro-, Anti-Gun Lobbies Spar

Strengthened by local shooting attacks and Swiss research on violence, a growing anti-gun movement in Switzerland is also pushing for increased gun control.

Marcel Zwahlen, a professor of epidemiology, was one of the key researchers on a study presented recently by the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern.

The study reviewed 158 Swiss murders and suicides that took place between 1991 and 2008. It found 90 percent of the cases involved firearms.

Zwahlen says that owning a gun in Switzerland is easier than owning dogs or cars — but shouldn't be.

""It's OK to regulate how you are allowed to have it, how you should use it and that this gets checked,"" he says.

Lawyer Hanspeter Uster agrees. The former justice minister from the Swiss canton, or state, of Zug was shot in the chest by a gunman who stormed the regional assembly there in September 2001. The assailant killed 14 people before turning the gun on himself.

It's certainly important that all these weapons are secured, legally speaking, Uster says.

""Having them registered in each Swiss state and having those states share the data is also important,"" he says. ""We need laws passed to make this happen as well as a committed government.""

But the Swiss equivalent of the NRA, ProTell, rejects any new restrictions. Named after Swiss folk hero William Tell, who used a crossbow to target his enemies, the group argues that there are plenty already, including a crackdown in the past 18 months on the purchase and transport of ammunition.

""You can't register weapons that are in the hands of criminals so it doesn't help you prevent a tragedy, you know?"" says ProTell Vice President Hermann Suter. He, like many Swiss, blame local gun violence on criminals from other countries, as well as the mentally ill who aren't supposed to own guns.

The majority of Swiss voters appear to agree that gun control is not the way forward. In February 2011, nearly 57 percent of them voted against storing military-issued guns in armories rather than at home. The reason? Suter says they saw it as undermining trust in Swiss soldiers."

The lead designer of the world's most popular firearm has died. Mikhail Kalashnikov, who helped invent the AK-47, was 94. David Greene talks to New York Times reporter C.J. Chivers, and author of The Gun, about the myths surrounding Kalashnikov and the weapon he made famous.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

1947 was the year the most notorious weapon in history was born. That is the Avtomat Kalashnikov, or AK-47. Today, millions of them - maybe 100 million - are in use. The man who helped bring the weapon to the world - Mikhail Kalashnikov - has now died, at age 94.

Joining me now is C.J. Chivers. He's a reporter for The New York Times and author of ""The Gun,"" a book about the AK-47. Chris, welcome back to the program.

C.J. CHIVERS: Thanks very much for having me.

GREENE: Can you tell me how you define Mikhail Kalashnikov's role in history?

CHIVERS: Well, there's sort of two takes on that. The one is a very popular take - that, you know, a light bulb went off in his head and he then, you know, through this momentary epiphany, sat down at a workbench and developed the weapon that became the most abundant firearm ever made.

It's really a lot more complicated than that. He was part of a state-directed design process where a lot of different people's ideas came together, and then his name was lent to it. And then he spent the next several decades, you know, essentially promoting the weapon, and refining the weapon with other design teams.

And sort of died yesterday a folk hero in Russia, and for much of the world. But also a little more complicated than that, in that there are a large number of people who see him as someone who lent his name to a killing machine and didn't show a whole lot of remorse.

GREENE: Yeah. A killing machine that, I mean, is used in conflicts everywhere. It's used by gangsters. I mean, can you just remind us - give us a sense how prolific this weapon really is.

CHIVERS: Well, no one really knows the precise numbers because this weapon was made in many countries; almost all of them secretive governments living in secretive times, and most of the transfers have been nontransparent. But there is this strong sense somewhere on the order of 100 million of these have been made.

GREENE: A lot of guns.

CHIVERS: A lot more than any standing army ever needed. And there's peculiar reasons for that. It's not just that the rifle was a well-conceived piece for what it was intended to do. It's that its production was hooked up to planned economies, and so it was made whether anyone ordered or bought them - or not.

GREENE: Well, is there something about it that makes it so popular, compared to other guns that might be available?

CHIVERS: There's a lot of things. I mean, its essential features are a compromise of many different firearms that come together in a way that make it very easy to use. It was well-conceived, and it's designed to be very reliable. I mean, it gets knocked on a lot for not being a very good-looking rifle, for the people who care about those things. But in practical terms, it was produced to very good standards.

It has excellent chrome finish on the inside, and an exterior coating that resisted rust. And all of these things came together to make it long-lasting. And you add that into the raw numbers of them that were made, and then were made by, you know, brittle states that in many cases fell apart and lost custody of their weapons, or were cash starved and sold them; and between the abundance and its own inherent qualities, it's a natural to show up in most anyplace where there's a war.

GREENE: You mentioned that Mikhail Kalashnikov does not feel remorse. I mean, given this legacy of death from this weapon, explain that emotion to me.

CHIVERS: He's a pretty complicated figure, with a very complicated past. He was born a peasant and as a child, his family suffered under the collectivization programs of the Soviet Union. And his family was driven to Siberia, and their home was burned to the ground. And his father died in the first winter in Siberia; his brother was in prison for seven years. And he rose to this pretty incredible ascension inside the Soviet arms bureaucracy. The same system that had destroyed his family was the system that rewarded him. So he did express remorse, at times. But other times, it was more than tempered with a pretty fierce pride in what he'd helped create.

GREENE: C.J. Chivers is a reporter for The New York Times, and also author of the book ""The Gun,"" about the AK-47, and we were talking to him about the death of Mikhail Kalashnikov. C.J., thanks so much for joining us.

CHIVERS: Thanks for having me.

David Strickroth does steady business at High Impact Tactical Firearms in Upland, Calif. It's a small shop, as gun shops go, with several dozen firearms hanging on the olive green walls and sitting in a glass display case below. He typically sells one or two guns a day.

Recently, though, things have picked up: ""Now I'm selling six or seven a day,"" Strickroth says.

The reason? Strickroth uses the word ""panic,"" but describes it more as angst that gun owners and would-be owners are feeling over the rhetoric of the presidential election, the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency and the potential for more regulation in California — a state that already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country.

""Doesn't matter what side somebody's on,"" Strickroth says. ""It's just that what's said [during the election] generates an angst in people that makes folks either feel 'I've got to get rid of this' or 'I've got to go get me one.' ""

That angst is not just limited to the Golden State, though.

The FBI processed more than 2.3 million background checks nationally last month — those background checks being the best available proxy for gun sale numbers. That was the most ever for the month of October and an increase of more than 350,000 background checks compared to the same month last year.

Gun shops around the country are seeing record sales. Others are offering pre-election sales. Major gun manufacturers Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. are reporting huge jumps in earnings. In its earnings report, Sturm, Ruger & Co. wrote that the ""stronger-than-normal industry demand during the summer [was] likely bolstered by the political campaigns for the November elections.""

As large as the recent surge in gun sales is, the trend is not new. Gun and ammunition sales jumped sharply after both of the last presidential elections, fueled by fears that an Obama presidency would lead to restricted access to firearms. Sales have also jumped following mass shootings and moments when gun control rises to the top of the national conversation.

October marked the 18th month in a row that the number of FBI background checks set a monthly record, putting 2016 on track to shatter the previous annual record.

Sales and angst have ramped up in recent weeks as the election grows closer.

The National Rifle Association has spent more than $26 million on advertising promoting Republican nominee Donald Trump and warning against Clinton, according to The Wall Street Journal. Most of those ads have been directed at swaying voters' opinions in battleground states like North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. One of the more recent ads shows a woman reaching for a gun case during a break-in, only to have it disappear.

""Hillary Clinton could take away her right to self-defense,"" a voice in the ad says. ""And with Supreme Court justices, Hillary can. Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.""

Clinton, for her part, has denied those accusations repeatedly on the campaign trail.

Her campaign has promised to expand background checks for gun sales; to keep guns from the hands of violent criminals, domestic abusers and the severely mentally ill; and to oppose the gun lobby. She has also promised to address gun deaths. But Clinton has refuted claims that she would do away with the Second Amendment.

""I respect the Second Amendment,"" Clinton said in the last presidential debate. ""I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with reasonable, common-sense regulation.""

Strickroth, the California gun store owner, says that many people are not convinced. He hears from gun owners and enthusiasts who are afraid that they'll lose their right to own certain types of firearms if Clinton becomes president.

Personally, he doesn't believe that will happen. Strickroth is no fan of Clinton and won't be voting for her on Tuesday, but he says that any restrictions on people's Second Amendment rights will ""eventually [get] to the court and the court will say, 'No, you can't do that,' "" he says.

He references the uproar and fear that followed the 1968 Gun Control Act and the last two presidential elections and gestures around his gun shop. ""I'm still here,"" he says."

Wyoming has the highest per capita suicide rate in the nation. Guns are also a big part of everyday life: The state has one of the highest rates of gun ownership.

It's not hard to find someone in the state who's been directly affected by a suicide in which guns were the lethal means. BJ Ayers has not one but two of those very tragic stories, and she has turned her grief into action.

""I got involved, I guess, volunteering, or ... just learning about suicide after Brett's death. And then when Beau died in August of 2009 — he was 26 — I just really felt compelled to do something,"" she says.

She started a suicide prevention nonprofit called the Grace For 2 Brothers Foundation. It's named after Brett, her 19-year-old son who took his own life in 2005; and Beau, her oldest son, who killed himself in 2009. Both shot themselves.

""I can say, 'Woulda, coulda, shoulda,' or ... 'If only.' But I can't go back and do that,"" she says. ""I think it's very important for people to realize that having that access to a firearm can be very tragic, and in our family, it was.""

Suicide isn't easy to talk about. In a state like Wyoming, its connection to guns makes it even tougher.

""It's not that we want to take the gun away from the gun owner,"" Ayers says. ""We know that we have responsible gun owners in Wyoming. Wyoming is a gun state. We're rich in that history.""

But the simple fact is a gun is used in about three-quarters of all suicides in the state. Nationally, guns are used about 50 percent of the time. Yet in Wyoming, Ayers says, you have to divorce guns and suicide.

""I think gun control is at one end of a very long table, and access to lethal means is at the other end of that very long table, and I think they're two different things,"" she says.

Ayers says suicide prevention has to be focused on firearm safety. That is, requiring that locks be included with all gun purchases. Much of her work is also in education. She stresses to people that guns should be locked away in homes, and she teaches everyone how to talk to people who may be suicidal, and get them immediate help. She's not alone in the effort.

YouTube

A broad suicide-prevention campaign launched recently by the Wyoming Department of Health includes dramatic public service announcements. Ayers and her story are also featured prominently in a series of Web videos. She also tells her story traveling around the state as one of Wyoming's four suicide-prevention coordinators.

Ayers says the suicide problem is starting to be talked about more. And for Ayers, that talk is not just about the tough subject of access to guns. Her son Brett refused to get help when he was battling his mental illness.

""I think we have a cultural norm here in Wyoming, where, for lack of a better word, you know, 'Cowboy up ... Be tough,' "" she says. ""It's not OK to get help, and that's what we want to break. We want to break that stigma and realize that it's OK.""

One way Grace For 2 Brothers is trying to break that stigma is through an annual suicide-prevention walk in Cheyenne. The first one in 2010 drew a crowd of a couple hundred. Next month, Ayers expects more than 700 people."

Firearms have been in the news again as calls for increased gun control measures resurface. But the gun industry has been going through it own ups and downs — just last week when firearms giant Remington said it would file for bankruptcy. And they aren't the only company facing increasingly difficult challenges as market demands shift.

Michael Cargill owns and operates Central Texas Gun Works, a gun store in Austin.

He shows a Ruger 308, saying ""these were very difficult to get while Obama was in office.""

His inventory is fully stocked, a far cry from how it was a few years ago, when he'd have to beg and plead with manufacturers to get him the inventory when the demand was high. Now the tide has turned.

""Now they are offering wonderful deals,"" Cargill says. ""You buy six of these you get one gun free.""

Cargill says he still moves a lot of product, but the prices are lower than they were before, and that has to be hurting the manufacturer. It all goes back to a boom in the industry that started nearly a decade ago, when sales that hit a 60-year high.

Jurgen Brauer, an emeritus professor of economics at Augusta University in Georgia who studies the arms market, says the rise in gun sales during the last decade is unprecedented.

""We go from about 1,000 weapons per 100,000 people per year, to just about 3,000 weapons per 100,000 people per year. So that's a tripling of the market in the last 10 or 12 years. That's a dramatic increase,"" Brauer says.

And Brauer's analysis lines up with what the federal government has seen. According to the FBI, 8 million background checks for firearm purchases were run in 2005. That number skyrocketed to 25 million in 2017. Analysts concluded the sales boom was this perfect storm — a mixture of regulatory fears on the part of buyers, military technology trickling into the civilian gun market, and also consumers simply having more buying power in the aftermath of a recession.

""Part of it, certainly after the financial crisis had ended is recovery of the U.S. economy. So incomes are recovering and its only to be expected as people have more disposable income that people buy all kinds of things, and if you are interested in firearms you buy firearms,"" Brauer says.

And the gun industry reaped the benefits: The National Shooting Sports Foundation released a report showing that between 2008 and 2016, the arms and ammunition industry saw an 81 percent increase in jobs, and a 137 percent increase in wages for workers.

But all is not well in the firearms market. Gun companies have recently seen a sharp decline in sales something many refer to as the ""Trump slump."" Robert Farago, a gun enthusiast and blogger for the website The Truth About Guns, says gun companies made a critical mistake during 2016.

""The gun manufacturers ramped up production,"" he says. ""They figured this is it – the motherlode we are gonna get another one just like we did the Obama surge. We are gonna get a Hillary surge. It didn't happen.""

""So you put those two together, you have a 40 percent increase in production and a 20 percent decrease in demand and you have sliding prices and you also have people buying guns who say 'I've had enough now, I've bought enough guns,' so the market has gone down because of that.""

And financial reports show this pretty clearly. The stock price for American Outdoors, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, was at a five-year highs right before the 2016 election. Since then, the company's stock has plummeted by nearly 70 percent. Ruger, another gun manufacturer, followed a similar trajectory, with its stock dropping by 40 percent in the same time period.

This has caused some companies to explore lines of business other than firearms, such as clothing, camping equipment and firearm accessories. One salvation for gun companies is the market for highly-regulated items, such as short-barrel rifles and suppressors. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives requires hefty amounts of paperwork for buyers of these items. James Willi, an attorney in Austin, specialized in helping customers with that paperwork. It soon turned into a business.

""Some of the dealers started seeing my work, and they started asking me if I wouldn't mind occasionally doing a gun trust for one of their customers,"" Willi says. ""And occasionally the phone would ring. And then little by little the phone would begin to ringing and more dealers started asking if I didn't mind doing trusts for their customers as well.""

The ATF keeps tabs on items like suppressors. In 2014, about 600,000 suppressors were registered. Last year that number ballooned to over 1,300,000. Willi says however that it's still a small market for companies to rely on.

Meanwhile, the firearms industry is hoping to mitigate some of those barriers for potential customers. Last year a bill known as the Hearing Protection Act was introduced in the House of Representatives. That law would make it easier to buy suppressors. Likewise, companies have recently found a way to work around a ban on short-barrel rifles by creating an accessory that, once attached to a gun, technically classifies the weapon as a handgun.

A Florida vacation got off to an odd start for Judith Fleissig, 58, of Rochester, N.Y., when she and her daughter realized the car they'd rented had an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. More oddness followed: The gun was left there by the wife of Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill, police say.

Fleissig and her daughter rented the Nissan Rogue in South Florida on Jan. 4. Only hours earlier, it had been rented and returned by Lauren Tannehill, reports Florida's Sun-Sentinel, citing a Broward County sheriff's report.

The Miami Dolphins have told the newspaper that the couple views the incident as a personal matter.

The AR-15 is often called the civilian version of the military M-16, as NPR's Ailsa Chang reported in a profile on the weapon last June.

""This is certainly the kind of item you don't want to forget anywhere, but forgetting isn't a crime,"" Broward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Keyla Concepcion tells The Miami Herald.

And unlike a GPS, the rifle is not on the list of equipment options for vehicles rented from E-Z Rent-A-Car, where Fleissig picked up the car at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport complex.

The Sun-Sentinel says Fleissig and her daughter, who was also in town to interview for a job, had been driving the Rogue around with a powerful gun onboard for a couple of days before they realized there was a bag in the SUV's rear compartment.

Fleissig tells the newspaper they intended to contact the owner themselves when they opened the bag, which she says had no ID tag.

Her daughter opened the bag and said, "" 'Oh my God, it's a gun,' "" Fleissig says. ""I said, 'I think I'm going to throw up.' ""

""We got out of the car; we were kind of freaked out. I didn't want to touch it. I took a picture, zipped it back up and went to the police station. They came out and took it. ""[I thought] 'this vacation is getting better and better.' ""

The rental company told the pair to give the gun, valued at an estimated $2,000, to police. The company also says it cleans cars between rentals as a matter of routine.

It seems that the Tannehills only used the Rogue for a couple of hours before deciding to return it for a different vehicle.

The Sun-Sentinel reports:

""The gun is legally owned by Ryan Tannehill, and the couple immediately called the rental car company to report a missing item and was given 'the run around,' but the couple didn't specify what was lost in the bag, a source said.""

It's not yet clear whether the Tannehills have claimed the gun from the police. As The Sun-Sentinel reports, Lauren Tannehil's Twitter feed includes photos of the couple firing rifles — though seemingly not an AR-15 — at a shooting range."

The shooting in San Bernardino has focused attention on a ""loophole"" gun manufacturers use to get around weapons bans. It's the target of some lawmakers, but AR-15 owners say the gun is misunderstood.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Assault-style rifles including the AR-15 are under scrutiny again after recent mass shootings. They were used by the gunman in Newtown, Conn., and more recently Roseburg, Ore., and San Bernardino. AR-15s, in particular, are often called America's gun. They're some of the most popular rifles in the country, especially when it comes to sports shooting. NPR's Kirk Siegler has been talking with AR-15 enthusiasts and filed this report.

KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: The A-R in the AR-15 actually stands for Armalite, not assault rifle, as it's sometimes mistaken for. Armalite was one of the first companies to develop AR-15s in the late 1950s. And pretty much ever since, sales have been robust, especially in states like Florida that place few restrictions on them.

AARON GANN: Very common, very easy to use, you know. It's good for new shooters. It's very safe. It's easy to make safe for storage.

SIEGLER: Aaron Gann (ph) lives near Tampa, where he's a nursing student. He's been shooting for sport and hunting since he was a kid growing up in Texas.

GANN: I shoot this weapon a lot just for target. I enjoy shooting for target, then also nostalgia from being in the military.

SIEGLER: Gann was deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq in the Army. He is a gun enthusiast, make no mistake. And like a lot of self-described Second Amendment advocates, he thinks there's a lot of misperception around rifles such as the AR-15.

GANN: Unfortunately, the media likes to try to make it as some kind of high-power assault rifle. But actually the bullet that it uses is mainly used for what they call varmint hunting, like groundhog and coyote. It's not super powerful. You can go to any range, and it's safe to use.

SIEGLER: And Gann bristles when right after mass shootings like Newtown or San Bernardino, there's this rush of criticism around AR-15s. In San Bernardino, he says, no one was there to stop the shooters, so it wouldn't have mattered even if they had just had handguns.

Now, California is one of six states that, for the most part, bans all assault-style weapons including AR-15s. So how was it that the guns used in San Bernardino were purchased legally at a gun store nearby?

ARI FREILICH: Unfortunately, gun manufacturers have attempted to infiltrate California's market, despite the clear spirit and intent of California's voters, by introducing California-compliant assault weapons is what they're called.

SIEGLER: Ari Freilich is a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. He says some gun manufacturers have gotten around California's 1989 assault weapons ban with what he calls the bullet button loophole.

Basically, California compliant means you can't just use your finger to detach and reload a magazine. You need a separate tool to push a separate button. This creates a lag time to reload. But Freilich and other gun control advocates want California lawmakers to close this loophole when they reconvene next year.

FREILICH: They are military-style weapons for a reason. They are designed for and intended to allow the shooter to kill as many human beings as possible in as short as time as possible.

SIEGLER: Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a similar effort two years ago, even as other so-called blue states like Connecticut and Maryland had moved to ban the AR-15s after the Newtown massacre. The gun debate is so complex and cuts across party lines in red or blue states. Just take Mike Freeland (ph). He lives in Tulsa. He owns several AR-15 and loves building them.

MIKE FREELAND: For a good part of the country, it's - shooting is just part of the culture.

SIEGLER: Freeland says he doesn't identify politically with what he calls the stereotypical gun owner. He leans left, but he also doesn't think banning AR-15s or other guns is the way to go.

FREELAND: Yeah, I think the AR-15, for incidents like we hear way too often - I think it's just the availability of it.

SIEGLER: He wants to see tighter restrictions on buying guns in first place. He talked to people on both sides of this debate, and if nothing else, it seems like there's this general agreement on one thing. There's a huge appetite for a broader conversation on gun violence that cuts past the rhetoric. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Los Angeles.

""With recent events and political environment, these weapons will be harder to get a hold of."" ""This is what your AR-15 dreams it could be when it grows up."" ""I can meet ... near the FL Mall in Orlando or any other time."" ""Cash is king.""

These classified advertisements for semi-automatic weapons were listed this week on Armslist, a website where anyone can advertise a firearm they'd like to sell, and anyone can contact a seller with an offer to buy. The site is legal. But there's no way to know whether buyers and sellers who meet through Armslist are following federal, state or local background check rules.

We wanted to see how many semi-automatic firearms — defined here as handguns and rifles able to rapidly fire a large number of bullets, one shot per trigger pull, without having to reload — can be currently found on Armslist, and how quickly new listings appear. This provides a window into the difficulty of regulating access to a type of weapon frequently used in mass shootings.

Omar Mateen, the Orlando mass shooter, used semi-automatic weapons. So did the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, the San Bernardino killers, and at least 70 percent of shooters listed in a database of all mass shootings in America since 1982 compiled by Mother Jones.

Our data analysis shows that semiautomatic weapons comprised at least 1 in 4 firearms listed on Armslist in the days following the Orlando shootings.

Those shooters acquired their firearms in a variety of ways, and there's no evidence that any of them used Armslist. But this site, and others like it, are coming under increased scrutiny by law enforcement, gun control advocates, and researchers as debate over access to these kinds of weapons heats up.

In October, New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs subpoenaed Armslist for transaction and advertising records. ""Through this investigation into Armslist, DCA is stepping up and doing its part to keep our city safer for every New Yorker — civilians and officers alike,"" NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time.

We analyzed data on all firearms currently advertised at Armslist, and found that in the four days following the mass shooting in Orlando — from Sunday, June 12, through Wednesday, June 15 — 15,500 unique new listings for all types of firearms were posted to the site; 3,625 — or about 1 in 4 — were listed as semi-automatic weapons by the seller; more than 2,000 firearms were not categorized by weapon type.

This chart shows how many of these listings were posted, by state:

Armslist, often described as ""the Craigslist for guns,"" doesn't vet sales arranged through its website, and its existence is legal. Its terms of use say users have to follow all laws, federal or otherwise, and that it's ""the sole responsibility of the buyer and seller to conduct safe and legal transactions.""

We tried to reach Armslist for response to this story but did not hear back.

There's no federal law requiring a private gun owner to run a background check before selling someone a gun. At least 18 states (and the District of Columbia) have their own laws for private firearms sales, and some require background checks in some cases. So do some cities. But — and more on this in a bit — there's evidence that not all private buyers and sellers follow the rules. Illegal sales happen, and currently, there's no way to stop them.

Armslist isn't the only site of its kind, though it is considered to be the biggest and most popular. All ads are listed in the U.S. But there's no way of knowing exactly how many sales are arranged through sites like Armslist each year. ""We aren't able to track those,"" says Corey Ray, a spokesman at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Gun sales are tracked through applications for background checks, but since private sellers don't have to run background checks, they can't be counted that way. Under federal law, private sellers can't sell to someone they know — or someone whom they suspect — wouldn't pass a background check, but they don't have to verify it either way. And unlike federally licensed dealers, like gun shops, they don't have to keep sales records or ask to see permits, either.

In October, Harvard researchers surveyed 2,000 gun owners and found that roughly 40 percent got their most recent gun without submitting to a background check. That finding lines up with an earlier survey from 1994.

Our Armslist analysis showed that, on average, about 3,800 new ads were posted on the site each day since the mass shooting in Orlando. On average, 900 of those each day were advertised as semi-automatics. It should be noted that gun sales tend to rise immediately after mass shootings, so this may be higher than usual. But a 2013 New York Times analysis of three months of listings estimated that 20,000 new ads were posted on the site each week.

Gun shops and other vendors ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms — meaning they have to run background checks — can also advertise through Armslist. But in our analysis, 75 percent of all sellers were listed as ""private.""

It should be noted that one investigation into Armslist found that nearly 30 percent of its private gun ads were listed by ""high-volume"" sellers, i.e. people who seemed to be ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms but operating without a license.

So, who buys firearms at sites like Armslist? It's impossible to know for sure, since Armslist doesn't require users to create an account through the site or divulge any personal information to post ads, browse listings, and contact other users. In our analysis, 2,634 listings — 17 percent — were created by users who haven't registered on the site (though registered users don't have to divulge personal information, either).

There are lots of reasons someone might look for a gun through Armslist: to save money, to hunt for hard-to-find models, to buy directly from the current owner. These sites can also appeal to people who might have a hard time legally acquiring a weapon at a gun store, or even through online gun retailers like Grab a Gun or auction sites like GunBroker — all required to run background checks.

On its website, Grab a Gun details the six-step process all buyers have to go through to buy a gun there.

Grab a Gun/Screen shot by NPR

But using Armslist, sellers and buyers don't have to go through this process. As Alex Yablon at the investigative gun news site The Trace, which aims to reduce gun violence, puts it, ""If you think of online gun stores as being like Amazon and online gun auctions as like eBay, then sales arranged online but conducted in person are like Craigslist. And like transactions arranged on Craigslist, they are essentially beyond regulation.""

Of course, most people using Armslist and other sites like it are there to purchase guns legally, and intend to use their guns legally and responsibly. Some of the semi-automatic weapons currently listed on Armslist wouldn't be very useful in combat or an assault situation, and are valued mostly by collectors and hobbyists.

Our examination of Armslist listings found a number of sellers who say they will only complete the sale at an ""FFL"" — a federally licensed dealer, usually a gun shop, where the buyer's background check can be run on the spot.

Law Breaking Down Gun Terminology Amid New Debate Over Gun Control Breaking Down Gun Terminology Amid New Debate Over Gun Control Listen · 3:21 3:21

""Will only meet at local FFL to complete transfer. No hand to hand transactions will be done,"" writes one seller advertising a .223/5.56 caliber Colt AR-15. Some sellers refuse to ship items, while others stipulate they'll only ship to licensed dealers. Others say they will need to see the buyer's permit to purchase or carry before making a sale.

But other listings are far more relaxed — or more desperate.

""I will travel very far to met [sic]. Asking $275 or OBO. Really looking to selling [sic] considering any serious offer,"" reads one current listing for a semi-automatic rifle.

""Forsale [sic] ar-15 300 blackout in good condition need to get rid of it to pay bill 750 obo,"" reads another.

A 2013 investigation by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that 3 percent of prospective buyers on Armslist had a criminal record that could have disqualified them from buying a gun.

That year, the New York Times traced one ""handgun wanted"" listing on the site back to a prospective buyer with ""a pair of felony convictions for burglary and another for motor vehicle theft, as well as a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction — all of which bar him from having guns."" This January, The Guardian found Armslist users willing to sell without a background check.

In its Terms of Use, Armslist states that buyers and sellers are responsible for ensuring that all transactions facilitated through the site are legal. It also lists the main phone number and website for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, for those who need to brush up on the rules. But during a 2011 NYPD undercover operation of Armslist and similar sites, in which investigators pretended to be buyers who stated they couldn't pass a background check, 62 percent of sellers they contacted said they were willing to sell them a gun anyway.

A handful of sales have ended in death. As Stephanie Mencimer at Mother Jonesreported in 2013, an NYPD investigation found that guns used in four murders, and one suicide, could be traced back to Armslist transactions.

And in 2012, a Wisconsin man named Radcliffe Haughton bought a pistol in a McDonald's parking lot from a seller he had met on Armslist. He had posted a ""gun wanted"" listing on Armslist three days after his wife acquired a restraining order against him for domestic violence — making it illegal for him to purchase a gun. He wrote:

""Looking to buy ASAP. Prefer full size, any caliber. Email ASAP. I constantly check my emails. Hoping it has a high mag capacity with the handgun, ammo, accessories. I am a serious buyer. Email me ASAP. Have cash now and looking to buy now. I am mobile.""

The next day, Haughton murdered his wife and two of her co-workers before killing himself.

In January, President Obama announced a new executive action on guns, saying he wants to close a ""loophole"" that makes it easy to buy guns online without a background check. But this plan would not affect private sellers at sites like Armslist. It calls for stronger enforcement of existing laws requiring anyone ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms to run background checks. But for an ordinary person looking to quickly trade a gun for cash, nothing would change under this plan.

Armslist released a statement following Obama's announcement, saying, ""Many, if not most, private sellers want to do background checks. Oftentimes, the reason they do not is because under the current system, their only recourse is to physically go to a licensed dealer and pay the dealer a fee to do the check. This is costly and burdensome."" The statement recommended making it possible for individuals to run background checks themselves, saying that ""would be a force multiplier and have a meaningful impact in reducing crime."" (ATF spokesman Corey Ray said that proposal brings up a number of security and privacy issues.)

Much has been made of the fact that Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, who purchased both of the weapons he used in his deadly rampage legally, was twice investigated by the FBI for suspected terrorist ties and statements, but didn't end up on the terrorist watchlist. Even if he had, Mateen could still have legally purchased his guns; terrorism suspects aren't prohibited from owning firearms. Now, some typically on opposite sides of the gun control debate are pushing to change that.

But even if Mateen were on the watchlist, and even if known terrorists were barred from purchasing weapons from licensed dealers, unregulated private sales — made easier through online marketplaces like Armslist — still could have enabled him to buy his weapons.

The Bushmaster semi-automatic assault rifle used in Friday's attack on an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., is a style of weapon used often in mass shootings. Melissa Block speaks with Malcolm Brady, retired assistant director of what was then known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, about the style of weapon and why it's so often linked to these tragedies.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

That weapon that David just mentioned, the AR-15, was not only used in last Friday's school shooting. It was also used this month by a gunman who killed shoppers at a mall in Oregon. And it was used back in July in the attack on a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The semiautomatic AR-15 is essentially a civilian version of the military's M-16. And it is, according to the NRA, the country's best-selling firearm.

To better understand its appeal to gun owners, we turn to Malcolm Brady. He's a retired assistant director with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. And he used to carry an AR-15 in the military.

MALCOLM BRADY: It probably is the best-selling weapon and it's probably because it's a very well-made weapon. They can fashion that weapon to pretty much be whatever you want it. You know, it can come in different colors. It can come with different magazines. It can come with different stocks. And it carries a very popular round that's easy to buy and it's not that expensive. The weapon has a, shall we say, a Rambo effect, just cool to carry.

BLOCK: You said not that expensive, what would the price range be?

BRADY: You can get a real knocked down model for probably for around 500. I mean, that is really a scaled-back model. Anything with good sights and good target pooling and magazines and stocks, it's going to run near a thousand dollars or more.

BLOCK: I have to ask you, Mr. Brady, you're talking about the coolness of a weapon that was just used to mow down 20 children.

BRADY: When I say cool, it's cool because a lot of dedicated people that are entitled to carry that weapon, and carried it in the military, would like to shoot it. They see it from the aspect of reliving their days in the military. That's when I say cool.

BLOCK: Do you think, Mr. Brady, that a shooting like we've seen will tarnish the reputation of this weapon, will make gun owners less likely to want to buy it?

BRADY: I think you'll see a very large increase in the people that want to buy it.

BLOCK: Really?

BRADY: And it may be for protection. It may be for the coolness. And it may be for the fact that people will be in fear that the weapon will be put back on a banned level, and they want to obtain it before it is banned again. But I think you will see the popularity of it and the purchase of them increase drastically, in between now and the holidays, near Christmas.

BLOCK: But let me go back to this notion that in the aftermath of this horrific shooting, where we have seen the faces of these children who were killed by this weapon, how can you say that that will actually increase sales?

BRADY: Because the people that will be buying them are buying them in the premise that: I can prevent that same thing happening at my house or my business or my location. Well, you know, I don't necessarily agree with it, but that's the perspective. And that's why I say you'll see an increase in the sale of these type weapons between now and the holidays.

BLOCK: In terms of the lethality of the AR-15, Mr. Brady, would this weapon be considered any more deadly, say, than the handguns that the shooter in Newtown was carrying, the Glock and the Sig Sauer?

BRADY: At the range that he shot this weapon and the amount, as I understand it, the amount of rounds that he used on each individual child, it would have made no difference if it were the Glock or the Sig Sauer.

BLOCK: I wonder, Mr. Brady, if this shooting at the school in Connecticut has made you rethink anything about this weapon; that you said as you yourself carried this in the military.

BRADY: Personally, I don't own one. I don't intend to ever own one. If I were a target shooter, maybe. But with all weapons - and I do have my own - I keep them under lock and key, as I did growing up. And I've taught safety to my children, which is paramount. And even to this day, if my son and I are looking at weapons, the first thing he does, and the first thing I do if it's put into my hand, is check it for safety factors. It's just hard to say, you know, if it will change or not. Myself, I would never own one of them. But I can understand why people would.

BLOCK: Malcolm Brady is a retired assistant director with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Mr. Brady, thank you.

BRADY: Thank you very much. Have a good day.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Ben Dickmann Courtesy of Ben Dickmann

Ben Dickmann has been hunting since he was a child. The 40-year-old Florida man enjoyed going out on the gun range to practice firing at targets and was the proud owner of an AR-57, a semi-automatic rifle.

But, after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student using a semi-automatic rifle, Dickmann, who lives just over 30 minutes away in Fort Lauderdale, did something unexpected.

Dickmann turned in his AR-57 to the sheriff's office and asked them to destroy it. He posted about it on Facebook, and that post has now gone viral. It's been shared more than 100,000 times.

Dickmann spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about his love of the firearm and why he decided to give it up.

Interview Highlights

On the decision to turn in his AR-57

It's come after a lot of soul searching. Everybody always says - you know, it's the big argument right now - everybody's offering thoughts and prayers but nothing else. And I thought, well, this is something I can do that I think is right. And it's something I can do that might spark a change. You know, my whole goal was maybe to inspire one friend on my Facebook page to do the same thing. And maybe that friend would inspire one other person. And who knows? I totally didn't expect for this to go the way it did and as fast as it did.

On the issue of obtaining a concealed carry/weapon permit

The concealed weapons permit program here in the state of Florida, as far as I'm concerned, is a joke. Literally, it's three hours of PowerPoint, and then you go down to the range with a very, very low caliber handgun, and you have to put five out of 10 rounds on a paper plate at 5 feet. Probably half the class that I had are people that had never touched a gun before in their life.

On the challenge to give up his AR-57

After Las Vegas, I had thought long and hard about it, and thought, well, you know, it's not hurting anything sitting in my gun safe here. But it wasn't really until this last tragedy at Stoneman Douglas where it really hit home with us - and me.

Actually, one of my friends on Facebook rather sarcastically said, well, if you really feel this way, why don't you go turn in your gun at Broward Sheriff's Office? I'll even drive you. And that's what spurred me to think. Even though he was being extremely sarcastic about it because he's a very staunch conservative, gun rights activist person, it kind of spurred me to say, you know what? Yeah, I'll do that.

On what he plans to do next

For me, to be honest, I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, and nothing that I had this grand master plan going into this for. So I'm happy that this sparked a debate and hopefully causes some action. I hope somebody - be it the students, be it the next generation - picks up the torch and does something.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images

Wal-Mart, thought to be the largest seller of firearms in the U.S., will stop selling military-style modern sporting rifles, such as the the AR-15, this fall.

Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said the decision to phase out the controversial semi-automatics was based in business, not politics, citing declining demand.

""If you have a product customers aren't buying, you phase it out,"" he said, according to Bloomberg.

He added that Wal-Mart shoppers ""were buying shotguns and rifles, and so we are increasing assortment in that.""

Lundberg tells NPR the move is happening now because of the change in seasons:

""As our Sporting Goods departments are resetting this week from Summer to Fall, the MSRs are being taking out of the assortment and replaced with new rifles and shotguns.""

The soon-to-be phased out AR-15 was used in several high-profile shootings over the past few years, including the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook school in Newton, Conn., and the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo. Gun control advocates support bans on these types of weapons and welcome Wal-Mart's decision to remove them from the shelves.

Spokeswoman Lori Haas from the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, based in Washington, D.C., praised Wal-Mart's decision.

""I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great signal that things are changing and that we have responsible citizens reacting to the gun violence in our country,"" Haas told NPR.

But while Haas embraced Wal-Mart's move, she questioned its claim that demand had indeed dropped. Wal-Mart does not disclose gun-sales figures.

""It would be lovely if there had been a decrease in demand,"" Haas said, adding, ""I would be very interested to learn of the gun manufacturer's sales.""

According to a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, Amy Hunter, the AR-15 is highly popular in the U.S.

""The AR-15 is America's most popular general use rifle,"" Hunter told NPR.

In Hunter's emailed statement, the NRA called Wal-Mart's recent move disappointing.

""While we're disappointed in Wal-Mart's decision, we appreciate the firearms retailers who continue to carry these firearms and enable law-abiding citizens to purchase the firearm of their choice.""

In 2006, Wal-Mart also cut back on gun sales, removing firearms from about a third of its stores, again chalking the decision up to ""diminished customer relevancy."" But then in 2011, it reintroduced guns to more stores around the country.

According to CNN Money, a Wal-Mart spokesman said at the time that the retail giant ""realized there is broader appeal for guns in some areas because of sporting needs.""

Wal-Mart will be selling the discontinued rifles at steeply discounted rates as it phases them out."

A North Carolina man pleaded guilty Friday to charges from an armed encounter within a Washington, D.C., pizzeria that was the focus of pernicious and baseless Internet rumors.

On Dec. 4, 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch entered the Comet Ping Pong restaurant and fired an AR-15 rifle into a door. The 28-year-old man told police that he had driven from his home in Salisbury, N.C., to ""self-investigate"" the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory that the restaurant was the site of a child sex-abuse ring involving powerful Democrats such as Hillary Clinton.

Welch was charged with illegally transporting firearms over state lines and assault with a dangerous weapon. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said in a statement that Welch will may receive far less time — likely a range of 18 to 24 months for the federal firearms charge and 18 to 60 months for the District of Columbia assault charge.

The statement goes on to read:

""According to the government's evidence, on Sunday, December 4, 2016,Welch transported three loaded firearms, together with ammunition, from North Carolina to Washington, D.C. The firearms included a 9mm AR-15 assault rifle loaded with approximately 29 rounds of ammunition, a fully-loaded, six-shot, .38-caliber revolver, and a loaded shotgun with additional shotgun shells. He drove directly to the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Connecticut Avenue in Northwest Washington. ... ""Upon arriving at the restaurant, Welch parked his car and armed himself. At about 3 p.m., he marched inside the restaurant, which was occupied by employees and customers, including children. He was carrying the AR-15 assault rifle and the revolver. He was carrying the AR-15 openly, with one hand on the pistol grip, and the other hand on the hand guard around the barrel, such that anyone with an unobstructed view could see the gun.""

Welch surrendered to law enforcement following the incident, but his armed entrance shocked the pizzeria's staff and management, already beleaguered by the fake news story.

Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis talked with NPR about the Internet rumors about a week before the incident:

""Well, it started when I was receiving many direct messages on Instagram and comments on my Instagram page. And I realized that something had come up. It turned out that there was a worldwide conspiracy theory ... based inside of Reddit and was being sent out through YouTube and Facebook and other places and that's sort of an insanely complicated, made-up, fictional lie-based story. This was a coordinated political attack. ... ""They would go into our social media accounts and they would take photographs that were on my Instagram of my friends' children or of my associates' children and post them around thousands and thousands of fake news sites and on Reddit and on YouTube and use these images of happily playing, innocent children as proof of some kind of human trafficking scheme led by the Clintons.""

Welch, who has been in custody since his arrest, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 22."

(This story last update at 4:00 p.m. ET)

Investigators in Santa Monica, Calif., were trying to piece together a motive in a shooting rampage in which four people were killed before police fatally shot the gunman.

The assailant, dressed in black and carrying a semi-automatic rifle, first shot and killed two men – believed to be his father and brother – at a home about a mile from Santa Monica College. Authorities were soon called to the burning home, but it wasn't immediately clear if the fire was arson.

Police say next the armed assailant carjacked a woman and ordered her to drive to the Santa Monica campus, where he shot at a bus, injuring three women. Authorities say their injuries were minor.

As he approached campus, the gunman fired on two people in an SUV. The vehicle crashed into a wall, killing the driver and seriously injuring the passenger, who doctors said was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, according to The Associated Press.

The gunman then exchanged fire with police before fatally shooting a woman outside the library.

Trena Johnson, a longtime administrative assistant working in the dean's office was quoted by the AP as saying she witnessed the library shooting. Looking out the window around noon on Friday, she described seeing a man with a ""very large gun.""

""We saw a woman get shot in the head,"" she said. ""I haven't been able to stop shaking.""

Police then exchanged gunfire with the suspect in the school's library, killing him.

Authorities say the gunman was carrying a canvas bag that included a rifle, a handgun and magazines of ammunition. A small cache of ammunition was also found at the house.

NPR's Sam Sanders reports that authorities have not identified the victims or the gunman, who they said was a white male in his 20s or 30s carrying an assault-style weapon.

Update at 4:00 p.m. ET. SUV Passenger's Prognosis 'Grim'; Suspect Had Attended College



Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said the condition of the passenger in the red Ford Explorer is ""grave"" and that her prognosis is ""grim.""

Seabrooks, speaking at a Saturday news conference, said the suspect had been enrolled at Santa Monica College as recently as 2010.

She said his identity could not be released until next of kin were notified — they ""may be out of the country,"" she said.

Seabrooks said police ""had contact"" with the suspect in 2006 but that he was a juvenile at the time, so she could not reveal details. She later said that Saturday would have been the suspect's 24th birthday.

The police chief says the gunman, who was armed with a .223 caliber semi-automatic ""similar to an AR-15."" tried to kill several people hiding in a safe room in the library and that it was ""remarkable"" that they were unhurt. She said the gunman was also wearing a ""load-bearing vest"" that was designed to take bullet-proof panels, but there were none in it.

She said the bag that he was carrying contained various clips and ammunition and that had he not been stopped, he could have fired some 1,300 rounds.

Update at 2:45 p.m. ET. Why The College?

The Los Angeles Times says police are trying to determine why the gunman wanted to go to the Santa Monica College campus.

The newspaper says the woman who was carjacked by the unidentified man, Laura Sisk, 41, said he specifically asked to be taken to the college.

""You're going to drive me to Santa Monica College and let me out,"" Sisk told the Times in an interview.

She said the man was dressed in black body armor and carried an AR-15 assault rifle.

Officials have been careful, however, not to characterize the rampage as a ""school shooting"" and to stress that while two people were killed on campus, the incident started elsewhere.

Update at 11:50 a.m. ET. Victim Identified

The driver of the vehicle who was killed has been identified as Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, according to police investigator, Joyce Kato.

Franco drove a red Ford Explorer that the gunman sprayed with bullets, killing him and wounding his passenger."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of TrackingPoint Courtesy of TrackingPoint

A new rifle goes on sale on Wednesday, and it's not like any other. It uses lasers and computers to make shooters very accurate. A startup gun company in Texas developed the rifle, which is so effective that some in the shooting community say it should not be sold to the public.

It's called the TrackingPoint rifle. On a firing range just outside Austin in the city of Liberty Hill, a novice shooter holds one and takes aim at a target 500 yards away. Normally it takes years of practice to hit something at that distance. But this shooter nails it on the first try.

The rifle's scope features a sophisticated color graphics display. The shooter locks a laser on the target by pushing a small button by the trigger. It's like a video game. But here's where it's different: You pull the trigger but the gun decides when to shoot. It fires only when the weapon has been pointed in exactly the right place, taking into account dozens of variables, including wind, shake and distance to the target.

The rifle has a built-in laser range finder, a ballistics computer and a Wi-Fi transmitter to stream live video and audio to a nearby iPad. Every shot is recorded so it can be replayed, or posted to YouTube or Facebook.

""Think of it like a smart rifle. You have a smart car; you got a smartphone; well, now we have a smart rifle,"" says company President Jason Schauble. He says the TrackingPoint system was built for hunters and target shooters, especially a younger generation that embraces social media.

""They like to post videos; they like to be in constant communication with groups or networks,"" Schauble says. ""This kind of technology, in addition to making shooting more fun for them, also allows shooting to be something that they can share with others.""

A team of 70 people spent three years creating the technology. Schauble says there's nothing else like it, even in the military. For civilians, TrackingPoint sells its high-end, long-range guns directly. With price tags of up to $22,000, they're not cheap.

One hunter who doesn't want one is Chris Wilbratte. He says the TrackingPoint system undermines what he calls hunting's ""fair chase.""

""It's the traditional shooting fish in a barrel or the sitting duck. I mean, there's no skill in it, right? It's just you point, you let the weapon system do its thing and you pull the trigger and now you've killed a deer. There's no skill,"" Wilbratte says.

This new rifle is being released as the gun control debate continues to simmer in Washington.

Chris Frandsen, a West Point graduate who fought in Vietnam, doesn't believe the TrackingPoint technology should be allowed in the civilian world. The gun makes it too easy for a criminal or a terrorist to shoot people from a distance without being detected, he says.

""Where we have mental health issues, where we have children that are disassociated from society early on, when we have terrorists who have political cards to play, we have to restrict weapons that make them more efficient in terrorizing the population,"" Frandsen says.

Schauble says because the company sells directly — instead of going through gun dealers — it knows who its customers are and will vet them. And he says there's a key feature that prevents anyone other than the registered owner from utilizing the gun's capabilities.

""It has a password protection on the scope. When a user stores it, he can password protect the scope that takes the advanced functionality out. So the gun will still operate as a firearm itself, but you cannot do the tag/track/exact, the long range, the technology-driven precision-guided firearm piece without entering that pass code,"" he says.

Schauble says demand has been ""overwhelming."" TrackingPoint now has a waiting list. Others are interested, too: Rifle maker Remington Arms wants to use the technology in rifles it wants to sell for around $5,000."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Claudiad/Getty Images/Vetta Claudiad/Getty Images/Vetta

Maybe money does grow on trees after all.

Households in several African countries grow more trees than scientists previously realized. And those trees may account for an average 17 percent of a farm's income, according to a study funded by the World Bank's Program on Forests and published online in January in Forest Policy and Economics.

""Trees play a really important role in farmers' lives,"" says lead author Daniel Miller of the University of Illinois. The impact of farmed trees has received relatively little attention because previous studies have focused either on trees in forests or other types of crops on farms.

Before beginning their project, Miller's team had to answer a basic question: What counts as a tree? The group decided to include ""any woody perennial with a trunk or elongated stem that supports branches and leaves."" This definition included fruit trees, trees grown for timber and shrubby cash crops like coffee and tea.

Next the scientists analyzed five African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda — all of which had interview data from national surveys on farmland use and household income. The surveys asked households to report all crops grown for economic reasons as well as the amount of money derived from each crop. The team then calculated the annual income (including non-agricultural sources like other wages and rental income) reported by each household, and the share that trees contributed.

Miller says he was surprised by how many households planted trees for economic purposes: Overall, 30 percent of landholder respondents said they grew trees on their land for agricultural reasons — like selling timber or fruit. ""This is actually an underestimate,"" says Miller, ""because these surveys were designed for agricultural purposes and didn't explicitly ask about all trees. The tree that the interviewee is sitting under to answer questions might not be taken into account.""

The trees in the survey supplied more than shade. Farm trees accounted for almost as large a share of annual income for farmers as forest trees do for people living near forests: 17 percent compared to 20 percent.

Because trees take time to grow, some farmers may be disinclined to invest in them, Miller says. But trees also have benefits. Many varieties are drought-resistant. Plus, they mitigate climate change by consuming carbon dioxide.

Trees were not equally popular across all countries. In Tanzania, 55 percent of farmers grew trees while only 16 percent did so in Nigeria. What's more, households led by women were less likely to grow trees than male-led households. This difference, Miller says, may underscore the importance of property law. Women, he conjectures, may worry about losing their land to men before their seedlings grow up to bear fruit.

But women particularly stand to benefit from trees grown for timber, because they often have to travel long distances to fetch firewood from forests, according to Alice Macharia, director for African programs at the Jane Goodall Institute, a community-based conservation nonprofit. The institute runs programs in Uganda and Tanzania to educate communities about the perks of cultivating trees and provides farmers with popular seedling varieties.

Macharia, who was not part of the study, says she was glad to see work highlighting the benefits of trees to farmers. Next, she said she would like to see research comparing the ability of different tree species to survive harsh conditions.

Miller's team also wants to understand more about how trees make money for their growers. Do they help people out of poverty? Or protect households from sliding into poverty during tough times? They hope to answer these questions in future research.

""What is the role of trees?"" asks Miller. ""We don't have good answers to that question. Stay tuned."""

NPR's Scott Simon talks with Georgetown University Asia expert Victor Cha about the global repercussions of the deadly nerve gas attack on Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea's dictator.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

A backchannel meeting between the United States and North Korea scheduled for March in New York City has been canceled after the U.S. withdrew the visa for North Korea's envoy. This follows the assassination of the half-brother of North Korea's leader, apparently by a lethal nerve gas. We are joined now by Victor Cha of Georgetown University.

Thanks very much for being with us.

VICTOR CHA: It's my pleasure.

SIMON: According to The Wall Street Journal, you were supposed to be part of those talks. Can you confirm that?

CHA: Well, there were supposed to be what are called track II talks that were going to take place sometime next month. But those are not going to happen now, I think, largely because of this - the finding that it was this VX nerve agent that was used in this assassination.

SIMON: VX, that's a chemical banned in most countries but in - not in North Korea. So presumably, this can be traced to North Korea.

CHA: Yes. North Korea's one of just a handful of countries that has not signed onto the CWC, the Chemical Weapons Convention. And they have a large stockpile of VX and other chemical weapons that they have as a part of their military hardware.

SIMON: So you can confirm for us, Professor Cha, that there were supposed to be talks between the Trump administration and North Korea. You were going to be in them. But there won't be talks now.

CHA: Well, I wouldn't say they were talks between the North Koreans and the Trump administration...

SIMON: The United States of America.

CHA: Right. Track II is largely academics and experts on the U.S. side, some former U.S. government officials from different administrations. On the North Korean side, reportedly, the head of their delegation would have been a foreign ministry official who is dual-hatted as a think tank person. So that person would have been coming, presumably, in a track - what we call 1.5 capacity.

SIMON: Yeah. Professor, what's there to talk about if North Korea wants nuclear weapons and the U.S. and much of the world don't want them to?

CHA: It's a really good question. I think the - part of the idea is to be able, at least try to get back to some sort of dialogue. We're in a cycle now of North Korean missile tests, this assassination attempt. And on the side of the rest of the world we're in a cycle of sanctioning and U.S.-ROK, U.S.-South Korean military exercises coming up next month. So when all those things are happening, I think most people want at least some sort of dialogue channel open. Otherwise things could escalate pretty quickly. And I think that's mainly the purpose of trying to keep a dialogue channel open.

SIMON: Yeah. But is there anything the world realistically can offer North Korea if they are really intent on getting nuclear weapons and chemical weapons?

CHA: Yeah. You know, it's a great question. I think that the core of the problem is that they say that they pursue these weapons out of insecurity. So the logical thing is can the world provide them some sort of security? And in past agreements that I have participated in, we provided them security guarantees and offered to negotiate a peace treaty with them. The problem is I think the security - insecurity that they feel is generated by the regime itself. You know, these sorts of totalitarian regimes never feel secure. And that's the core problem.

SIMON: Because there's mass starvation. There's mass poverty. There's mass oppression.

CHA: Right. And that they - all those things, and that they don't rule by the consent of the legitimacy of the people. And that's the basic problem.

SIMON: Yeah. China has a role in this?

CHA: Yes. China is both part of the solution, in terms of putting more pressure on North Korea, but they're also part of the problem because they still consider North Korea to be an ally. And they don't want to put so much pressure on the regime that they risk collapsing it. About 85 percent of North Korea's external trade is with China. So if they feel like they put too much pressure on, they could completely destabilize the regime. And that worries them because they don't want a collapsing Korean Peninsula on their border.

SIMON: Victor Cha is director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. Thanks so much for being back with us, professor.

CHA: Sure, it's my pleasure.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/AP

Malaysian authorities say initial autopsy results show a chemical weapon — VX nerve agent — was used in the fatal poisoning of Kim Jong Nam, older half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.

VX is an odorless substance that can exist as liquid or gas. It can kill within minutes if it's passed through the skin. It is 10 times more toxic than sarin and classified as a weapon of mass destruction.

Early last week, while Kim Jong Nam was traveling through the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, two women approached him, touched his face and held a cloth over it. He was able to walk to a help desk, which took him to an airport nurse area, but soon fell severely ill and died before making it to the hospital.

The women who approached him were caught on airport security cameras and captured within days of the attack. They are from Southeast Asian countries and are now in custody. But police believe the plot involved far more people than the two women. Authorities are seeking at least seven North Koreans, including a diplomat, in connection with the crime.

That VX nerve agent is responsible for Kim's death strengthens the claims made by South Korea that the North Korean regime ordered the hit. VX is man-made and not that difficult to produce, according to chemical weapons experts. But it tends to be used by state actors. For example, Saddam Hussein is believed to have used VX nerve agent on Kurdish citizens of Iraq in the 1980s.

South Korea last week blamed North Korea for the killing and called the rather public assassination a terrorist act. North Korean officials in Malaysia, meanwhile, were rejecting the autopsy's results before it was even concluded. And to add to all this drama, someone this week apparently tried to break into the morgue where Kim's body is being held. That incident is under investigation.

The body believed to be that of Kim Jong Nam has yet to be identified by next of kin, so Malaysia is refusing to release the remains. Malaysian authorities have asked the North Koreans to provide a DNA sample from a Kim family member. But North Korea is not cooperating.

The Malaysian police inspector general has been talking with the press this week, but not answering many questions, saying instead that a lot of answers reporters are seeking are ""subjects of the investigation."" Later he said that the investigation could last years.

npr32,npr,[],,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125184572,"World's Hottest Pepper: The Perfect Weapon?

The Indian military has announced plans to use the world's hottest pepper — otherwise known as the ghost chili — in a new series of smoke grenades used to combat terrorists. NPR's Melissa Block speaks to Joey Prado, owner of Chunky's Burgers in San Antonio, who has been using the pepper in his recipes and says it would make a perfect weapon.

MELISSA BLOCK, host:

The bhut jolokia, otherwise known as the ghost chili, is so powerful, so spicy that the Indian army wants to use it to fight terrorists. They're working on a stun grenade harnessing the power of the chili, which has been deemed the hottest pepper in the world at more than one million Scoville heat units. By comparison, a jalapeno might have a Scoville rating of 5,000.

Well, it turns out the ghost chili has been deployed for the last year and a half, not in a grenade but on a burger, at Chunky's Burgers in San Antonio, Texas, where Joey Prado is the owner.

Mr. JOEY PRADO (Owner, Chunky's Burger): It was a curiosity thing. You know, we get people in here, being in south Texas, people like spicy. So I thought, let's see how spicy we can get it. I'd heard of this pepper and finally found it, somebody who could bring it in out of New York, actually. And we tried it here. I said, well, let's try it on a burger, see how hot we can make it and see what people could tolerate. They find out pretty quick, the first bite into it.

BLOCK: I guess the ghost chili makes a jalapeno seem like vanilla ice cream or something.

Mr. PRADO: It's like an olive compared to the ghost chili.

(Soundbite of laughter)

BLOCK: An olive?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah. Literally, it's about 100 times hotter than a jalapeno. So, yeah, jalapenos are just literally like olives compared to it. I eat them all day long.

BLOCK: Is this kind of a bragging rights thing, do you think, for people who come in? They want to put themselves up to the test, see if they can handle the ghost chili?

Mr. PRADO: That's exactly what it is. I guess being here in south Texas, it's a machismo thing. You know, they want to see they think they can handle hot, and if this is the hottest pepper, they want to do it. They want to try to do it, anyway. I would say maybe one out of every 30, 40 people can actually eat that burger because it's just crazy hot.

BLOCK: What do they look like when they're eating it, tears streaming down their face?

Mr. PRADO: Oh, yeah. The tears coming down, the nose is running, the lips are bright red from being on fire. They're just constantly - they're having trouble keeping it down because they just want to spit it out, it's just so hot. It looks like, you know, their puppy died or something because they're just crying, and nose running, and it's crazy.

BLOCK: Well, what about for the poor folks who are having to work with this pepper in the kitchen?

Mr. PRADO: In the kitchen, yeah, they got to be very careful because if they keep it on the grill too long when they saut� them, it can clear the restaurant out. I mean, it's like tear gas. You start coughing, your throat itches, your nose starts to run. It's a dangerous pepper.

BLOCK: Well, I guess that's why the Indian army would want to use it as a weapon, right?

Mr. PRADO: I can easily see that because, yeah, it's just crazy. I mean, if they can weaponize it, it's going to be fairly easy for them because I think we have a weapon here in the kitchen every time the guys forget to take them off the grill.

BLOCK: Do you get complaints from your neighbors?

Mr. PRADO: You can actually smell it outside. Here, I've been outside, and I know when they're making the burger. You can feel it in your throat. It just tickles, and you just start coughing nonstop, and of course, everybody clears out the restaurant. So I know for a fact that they're making a couple of burgers back there.

BLOCK: Are the cooks wearing special gloves when they're handling these chilis?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah, they wear latex gloves because if they get it on their hands, even if you wash it, it'll transfer, you know. The next thing you know, their arms will swell up, and even if you wash it, it's still on there. You've got be very careful with this pepper.

BLOCK: Do you have some kind of warning on your menu?

Mr. PRADO: Actually, if they come in and order the burger, they have to sign a waiver.

BLOCK: Really?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah, they have to be over 18, can't be pregnant, have no medical conditions that may be affected by it because it'll raise your blood pressure. You'll start to sweat. And we have people say their hands start to tingle, their ears start to burn. It's crazy hot. If they don't sign the waiver, we won't make them the burger.

BLOCK: Proceed at your own risk.

Mr. PRADO: Pretty much. I think we've had EMS out here a couple times, actually.

BLOCK: Really?

Mr. PRADO: Yeah, believe it or not. People have tried it, and they come in with their buddies, so they try to force it down. It's hot, but they're going to do it.

BLOCK: Well, Joey Prado, thanks for talking to us about it.

Mr. PRADO: Not a problem, Melissa. You can come in any time.

BLOCK: Joey Prado is the owner of Chunky's Burgers in San Antonio, Texas, where you can try a burger with the scorching hot ghost chili, if you dare.

A new study released Monday from the International Institute for Strategic Studies says North Korea's recent success with intercontinental ballistic missiles was facilitated by black market purchases of Ukrainian rocket engines. NPR's Robert Siegel speaks with the study's author, Michael Elleman.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

North Korea's threat against Guam underscores this disconcerting fact - the North Koreans have made dramatic improvements in developing nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Researcher Michael Elleman says they could not have done that alone. In a study for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Elleman says that help may have come from a factory in Ukraine. And, Mr. Elleman, thanks for joining us today.

MICHAEL ELLEMAN: Thanks for having me.

SIEGEL: You write that North Korea has acquired a high-performance liquid propellant engine from a foreign source. First, how do we know that the North Koreans couldn't have engineered an engine like that on their own?

ELLEMAN: Well, we haven't seen them develop and use any kind of engine that was based on their technology development. We haven't seen even small engines. The engine that powers these particular missiles is quite powerful. It's large. It's sophisticated. So to me, it stretches credulity to think that they suddenly were able to develop this on their own.

SIEGEL: How much do you actually know about these particular engines?

ELLEMAN: Well, we're able from the videos to understand approximately what the total amount of power released by the engine is. We know how long it operates for, and from that we can back out the amount of fuel consumed. And with that and some of the visual characteristics of the engine, we're able to determine that it comes from the - what they call the RD-250 family of engines that were developed in the former Soviet Union.

SIEGEL: When you say we know it was - it came from Ukraine or was made in Ukraine, how do you know that?

ELLEMAN: Well, I don't know that it came from Ukraine. In my writing, I think I was very specific in saying that the most likely source would be Ukraine. We've seen the modifications that were incorporated into the engine that the North Koreans are using. I have two independent sources that have said they've seen that engine in Ukraine. It doesn't mean that it came from Ukraine, but it strongly implies that.

But I want to make one point very clear. I don't think the Ukrainian government was involved in this at all. I don't even know that executives from the Yuzhnoye plant would have been involved. This, to me, sounds like criminal gangs were able to access something and export it from either Ukraine or Russia.

SIEGEL: Last month, the factory Yuzhmash said it had not, does not and will not participate in the transfer of potentially dangerous technologies outside Ukraine. You say it could have been a criminal gang. In a way, that seems almost scarier than the notion that a government might have supplied the Koreans with this technology, the idea that it's on the loose and being sold on the black market.

ELLEMAN: Well, again, you know, because there are so many sites where a large number of engines might have been stored or kept, not all of them would be protected to the extent that we would like to see. And the Yuzhmash - Yuzhnoye facilities are not too far away from the area where Russian separatists in Ukraine and the Ukrainian armed forces are actually fighting, so undoubtedly there would be a number of criminal elements.

And we know from the past in the 1990s that a number of Russian missile technology left Russia and ended up in North Korea. And we know that there were North Korean agents seeking missile technology from Yuzhnoye in 2012 because they were arrested by the Ukrainian government.

SIEGEL: Just curious - if, in fact, these engines were transported from somewhere in Ukraine near Russia to North Korea, how would they get - how would you do that? Would you send them by truck? Would you fly them somewhere? How would they move?

ELLEMAN: You could move them in any one of those methods. So the actual engine could fit into a - you know, like a wooden crate 1 meter by 1 meter by 2 meters. So you could pack them into, you know, a large aircraft. You could put them in the back of trucks. You could put them on trains. So, you know, the possibilities are almost endless. For me, the big question going forward is how many of these engines were actually transferred? And I just don't have any information to suggest that it's a small number or a large number.

SIEGEL: Michael Elleman is a senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Thanks for talking with us today.

ELLEMAN: Thanks for having me.

In the days before the Manchester Arena attack, Salman Abedi, the man police have identified as the bomber, ""made most of the purchases of the core components"" of the weapon himself and was largely alone as he moved about the city, British police say.

""Many of his movements and actions have been carried out alone during the four days from him landing in the country and committing this awful attack,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit said, referring to Adebi's recent return from a trip to Libya.

""With specialist support, we have also had a good understanding of the likely component parts of the bomb and where these came from,"" Jackson said.

When the bomb detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on May 22, it killed at least 22 people and wounded dozens.

Police are still trying to find the distinctive blue suitcase Abedi was seen carrying as he moved around Manchester's city center and other areas ahead of the attack. The suitcase is ""a different item"" than what was used to carry out the bombing, Jackson said — but he added that people should be cautious and contact police if they can help track it down.

""We are especially keen to find out why he kept going back to the Wilmslow Road area, and we need to find the blue suitcase which he used during these trips,"" Jackson said.

Officials have not ruled out Abedi's acting as part of a wider network — a crucial question that arose last week because of the sophisticated and effective nature of the attack and the timing of his visit to Libya.

Last week, a high-ranking Western government official told NPR, ""Our assessment is he did not have the skills to build such a bomb, and the conclusion is there is a bomb-maker out there.""

Manchester police have made at least 16 arrests in connection to the attack and were still holding 11 men in custody, according to the department's latest updates.

As we have reported, Abedi's father and brother were also detained in Libya last week. Another brother was arrested in England.

The latest police findings are the results of painstaking work, Jackson said, with more than 1,000 officers working on the case and helping to track Abedi's movements through security camera footage, his phone calls and his interactions with people.

Calling the scale of the investigation ""enormous,"" Jackson said there are more than 7,000 entries listed on the counterterrorism unit's lines of inquiry. Investigators are talking to hundreds of witnesses and looking at ""almost 300 pieces of digital equipment, including phones,"" he said.

""There has been huge progress made over the week, and the speed of the inquiry remains the same,"" Jackson said."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Handout/South Korean Defense Ministry Handout/South Korean Defense Ministry

President Trump's unorthodox approach to foreign policy is causing rising anxiety among lawmakers and experts who worry about his singular authority to launch nuclear weapons.

While the first use of nuclear weapons is generally prohibited under international law, the speed of executing a strike means it would be difficult to stop the president if he decided to launch a unilateral attack, says Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer and co-founder of Global Zero, a group that advocates eliminating nuclear weapons.

""The president has absolute authority, unilateral power to order the use of nuclear weapons,"" he tells Here & Now's Robin Young. ""The legal question falls by the wayside if the president has carte blanche authority to order the use of nuclear weapons and all the means at his disposal to ensure that his decision is quickly implemented.""

Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said that he would challenge an order from Trump if it were illegal.

""I provide advice to the president,"" Hyten said. ""He'll tell me what to do, and if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm gonna say, 'Mr. President, that's illegal.' Guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works.""

But the president's sole launch authority has ignited a debate about whether there should be more checks and balances on the president's actions. As tensions between the U.S. and North Korea escalate, a group of senators raised concerns about Trump's temperament to handle this responsibility at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week.

""We are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests,"" said Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy.

Blair says that in order to launch a weapons strike, the president must alert his military aide who holds a suitcase, the so-called nuclear football, which contains attack options. Once the president orders the strike using a special code, the Pentagon immediately transmits the order to launch weapons.

Strategic Command also receives the order, but Blair explains, ""If they felt that it was a really bad call or illegal, and they wanted to try to override it, they could try to transmit a termination order, but it would be too late.""

Blair also says the legality of using nuclear weapons is unclear, which means the decision really is up to the president.

""The first use of nuclear weapons is almost invariably going to be illegal because they're not necessary and because they will cause collateral damage against civilian populations and in other ways violate the law of war,"" Blair says. ""But that's not really the way that it's viewed from the inside.""

In a 1996 advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice concluded that the threat or use of nuclear weapons generally violates international law governing armed conflict and humanitarian law, declaring that ""states must never make civilians the object of attack.""

But according to the Arms Control Association, a legal gap allows for the possible lawful use of such weapons.

The court stated in its opinion ""that it cannot reach a definitive conclusion as to the legality or illegality of the use of nuclear weapons by a State in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which its very survival would be at stake.""

Though only Congress has the power to declare war, retired Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler, former commander of Strategic Command, testified last week that ""only the president of the United States can order the employment of U.S. nuclear weapons."" Massachusetts Republican Sen. Ed Markey has proposed legislation that would require congressional approval for any first use of nuclear weapons.

When pressed further by senators, Kehler said he didn't know what would happen if Trump ignored the military's order to stand down on a nuclear strike deemed illegal. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed this would amount to a constitutional crisis.

Blair agrees there are not enough people in the chain of command to slow down the authorization process.

The nuclear codes are ""the length of a tweet,"" he says. ""It would take them one or two minutes to format and transmit that directly down the chain of command to the executing commanders of the underground launch centers, the submarines and the bombers."""

Look at this map, and notice that deep, deep in the Republican South, there's a thin blue band stretching from the Carolinas through Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. These are the counties that went for Obama in the last election. A blue crescent in a sea of red.

Enlarge this image Matt Stiles/NPR Matt Stiles/NPR

These same counties went mostly blue in 2004 and 2000. Why? Well, the best answer, says marine biologist Craig McClain, may be an old one, going back before the Civil War, before 1776, before Columbus, back more than 100 million years to the days when the Deep South was under water. Those counties, as he writes here, went for Obama because trillions and trillions and trillions of teeny sun-loving creatures died there. He's talking about plankton. That's why the Republicans can't carry those counties. Blame plankton.

[Don't leave. I know some of you bounced here because my headline was political, and the word ""plankton"" will send you scuttling back to HuffPo, Politico and Drudge, where politics is plankton-free. But before you go, check out this next map.]

It's an image of North America as it looked during the Cretaceous era, 129 million to 65 million years ago. As you can see, much of the continent was still covered by water. The Deep South had a shoreline that curled through the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, and there, in the shallow waters just offshore, were immense populations of floating, single-celled creatures who drifted about, trapped sunshine, captured carbon, then died and sank to the sea bottom. Those creatures became long stretches of nutritious chalk. (I love chalk.)

When sea levels dropped and North America took on its modern shape, those ancient beaches — so alkaline, porous and rich with organic material — became a ""black belt"" of rich soil, running right through the South. You can see the Cretaceous beaches in this map, colored green. McClain got these maps from geologist Steve Dutch's website, at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay.

And because this stretch was so rich and fertile, when cotton farmers moved here in the 19th century, this stretch produced the most cotton per acre. Harvests of 4,000-plus bales were common here. Notice that the most productive plantations mirror the ancient coastline.

Then came slavery.

McClain, quoting from Booker T. Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery, points out: ""The part of the country possessing this thick, dark and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers."" After the Civil War, a lot of former slaves stayed on this land, and while many migrated North, their families are still there.

In this 2000 census, you can see that the counties with the biggest populations of African-Americans still trace that Cretaceous shoreline.

This, says marine biologist McClain, explains that odd stretch of Obama blue; it's African-Americans sitting on old soil from ancient organisms that turned sunshine into fertilizer. So plankton remain a force in Southern elections — though not always, not continuously. After the Civil War, when the South voted solidly Democratic and Jim Crow laws ruled, many blacks couldn't vote, so the pattern disappears. Voting rights laws hadn't been passed during the Goldwater-Johnson election of 1964, so in this map, the African-American difference is invisible.

But some African-Americans were still there. So was the soil (though it's not as rich as it once was), and so were the rocks that geologist Steve Dutch ""found immediately familiar"" because they mapped those ancient shores. All of which is to say, when you cover politics, sometimes, without realizing it, you are also telling rock tales. Geology, every so often, peeks through.

Geologist Steve Dutch's detailed maps, and careful analysis, come from a study he did of the Bush-Gore election in 2000. He called it ""Geology and Election 2000."" You can find that here. ""Dr. M"" (that's Craig McClain's Nom de Blog at ""Deep Sea News"") wrote his geology analysis here."

The civil war in Syria has left millions of people dependent on food aid. But delivering that aid to rebel-held areas is an enormous challenge. And food aid is being used as a weapon to control the population in both government and rebel territory.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

The civil war in Syria has left four million people dependent on food aid. That's what Muhannad Hadi, the World Food Program's emergency coordinator for Syria, told us on the program last week, and he expects that number to grow to seven million by the end of this year.

The ongoing conflict between the government of Bashar al-Assad and anti-government fighters means residents constantly move in search of security and basic necessities. And many groups, including radical Islamists, are winning over those communities by providing food.

NPR's Deborah Amos has covered the Syrian civil war since it began, and joins me in the studio. And Deb, it's great when your travels bring you home for a bit and we can see you. Thanks for coming in.

DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: It's very nice to be in the studio.

GREENE: Give me a sense of how desperate Syrians are for food right now?

AMOS: No one is starving. It would be wrong to think that. But there are shortages. There are many Syrians who are now so poor that their staple diet is bread, which is why people would risk their lives to stand in a bread line, because they can't afford anything else. And in places that are controlled by the rebels, it is very, very difficult for international aid agencies - almost impossible in some areas - to get food aid to those places, and these are the places where people are most in need.

GREENE: Why isn't it getting to them?

AMOS: The food aid goes through the United Nations, that has many offices inside Damascus, the capital of Syria. And that aid goes through the government. They have not wanted that food aid to go to contested areas, rebel-held areas, and the international system doesn't really promote something called cross-border aid.

GREENE: Cross-border aid. Make sure we understand what that is, here.

AMOS: So what happens is if the UN wants to deliver aid to a rebel-held area, it has to get government permission. That has happened rarely. There were two cases earlier this year where aid was moved from Latakia on the coast, driven all the way up to the Turkish border on the Syrian side, and it was delivered to refugee camps that were in sight of Turkey. So logistically, it would've been easier, cheaper, safer, to bring those trucks from Turkey into Syria.

GREENE: Just drive a truck across the border.

AMOS: Just drive a truck. But it...

GREENE: But it can't happen.

AMOS: ...instead it can't happen. No government really wants to break that system.

GREENE: They have their own conflicts, countries like Turkey, and they don't want the UN coming in into their borders and deciding who's going to get food.

AMOS: And not asking them.

GREENE: Well, the people who are in rebel-controlled areas, who is getting food to them?

AMOS: Well, the rebels have taken it upon themselves in places that they control to be the humanitarian aid organizations, along with Syrian civilians who have set up shop. But I can tell you that the most radical Islamist guerilla rebel groups have begun a hearts and minds campaign. They are fighting for an Islamist state in Syria. They're very open about that.

GREENE: Mm-hmm.

AMOS: And how to convince people to come with them is to be the deliverer of aid.

GREENE: And is that enough, in some cases, to turn people?

AMOS: In the beginning it was, because these groups were less likely to loot, less likely to steal, more likely to give bread fairly. In the last few months, there have been some additions that you also have to swallow with your bread, and that is Sharia law, and people are rebelling. So food isn't enough to turn a population pro-al-Qaida in Syria, because the package is much bigger.

GREENE: What are governments like the United States and others doing about this?

AMOS: The United States, USAID, is actually running a covert, cross-border aid operation. It is rather large on the Turkish border, smaller on the Jordanian border. And they have partners, some rather large international aid agencies that take their names off the trucks. There are no American flags on any of this aid, and it goes in every day across the Turkish border, and they have Syrian partners who distribute that aid in the north.

There are times when Islamist groups take credit for that bread that comes, because the Americans don't want to brand it. There is a bit of an argument in Congress, in the White House, about: Should we be branding this aid? But the concerns, of course, with everybody who is looking at this as a humanitarian disaster, is any way you that can get flour into Syria stops one Syrian from crossing the border and becoming a refugee.

GREENE: Deb, it's great to see you. Thanks for coming in.

AMOS: Thank you.

GREENE: That's NPR's Deb Amos.

Three years ago, the Islamic State overran large swaths of Iraq and Syria, and soon declared a caliphate that straddled the border between the two countries. Today, the group's physical caliphate is declining — and the group is preparing its base of fighters for a future under siege.

One of the ways it is doing that is through its musical propaganda.

In the most austere interpretations of Islam, musical instruments are prohibited. But the a cappella hymn nasheed, in Arabic, is permissible. The Islamic State has used nasheeds to spread its message since its founding, disseminating battle hymns online through its own media unit and other affiliated propaganda outlets.

Most ISIS nasheeds are in Arabic, but the language of delivery can be as diverse as the foreign fighters who have joined its ranks.

The Islamic State's latest nasheed, released earlier this month, is titled ""Dawlati Baqia"" or ""My State Is Remaining."" Like other nasheeds circulated by ISIS, it sounds like it was professionally recorded and has an Auto Tune quality to it.

The song begins:

My state is remaining, firing at the enemy.

Its soldiers shout that it is remaining.

Its path will not be eliminated; its light seeks to expand.

Like other ISIS nasheeds, this one was disseminated across the Web, on encrypted messaging applications and likely on the group's radio station — still broadcasting in areas under its control. The verses are a defiant reply to those who believe ISIS' battlefield setbacks signal the group's demise.

Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi , a research fellow at the Middle East Forum, has been tracking the Islamic State's full range of propaganda, including its music, since the group emerged. He says the nasheeds reflect the group's evolution from a battlefield force implementing its rule over an expanding territory and population to an embattled base now under intense pressure.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mohamed El-Shahed /AFP/Getty Images Mohamed El-Shahed /AFP/Getty Images

The past few months have been a struggle for the group. The physical caliphate, which at its height drew adherents from as far afield as Europe and Chechnya, is dwindling. In Iraq, U.S.-backed Iraqi troops are closing in on the last ISIS-held enclave of Mosul, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced his caliphate three years before. And in Syria, ISIS is facing separate offensives from U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab tribal forces as well as from Syrian pro-government forces, backed by Russia and Iran.

""My State Is Remaining"" warns that the fight isn't over, though:

The Muslim nation has been awoken from its slumber.

Oh people of error! The state is remaining — not vanishing,

Anchored like the mountains, anchored, anchored.



The ""people of error"" may refer to Islamic State's battlefield enemies, including the U.S.-led coalition — or even those trapped under ISIS control, seeking to flee.

Between 2013 and 2015, Tamimi says, ""You see [in the songs] the rise of the Islamic State, implementation of Islamic law and how it creates its realm of justice. But now what you see is the nasheeds are responding to the current situation faced by the Islamic State, which is the setbacks — territorial setbacks, potential loss of Raqqa and almost loss of Mosul.""

In response to its losses of territory and people, ISIS released a nasheed in May titled ""Heed the Call,"" referring to the call to jihad. The lyrics exhort the fighters ""in the era of epic battles and conflict"" to hold their ground in the face of death. ""Where are the real men?"" the song asks. ""Where are the lions of the struggle?""

""The idea behind this messaging is two things,"" Tamimi says. ""One is [a message that] we'll still remain, and the second one, encouraging people to keep up the fight.""

Two years ago, when ISIS was still expanding geographically and attracting recruits to its nascent caliphate, the group was producing threatening battle hymns. They often served as the background music for its terrifying and bloody propaganda videos.

The nasheed ""Soon, Soon"" can be heard in the background of one of the most horrific ISIS execution videos — in which a captured Royal Jordanian air force pilot, Moath al-Kasasbeh, appears to be burned alive in a cage. ""You'll see the battle come to your very home,"" the lyrics go. ""To destroy you, my sword has been sharpened.""

The nasheed was released within a day of the pilot's death, an emblem of the unapologetic brutality and defiance of ISIS at the height of its power.

But the murder did not stop the anti-ISIS coalition's bombing campaign. And in the years since, the physical caliphate has largely crumbled.

Tamimi says that as ISIS has lost territory and men, its nasheed production and variety also fell off. Foreign-language nasheeds — in Turkish or Uighur, for example — that were once churned out for ISIS' global following are becoming scarcer. Even the Arabic nasheeds directed at its base appear less and less often.

Tamimi says at first he thought perhaps the singers had been killed in airstrikes. But then ISIS released ""Heed the Call"" and ""My State Remains"" in May and June.

Despite the mournful tone of ""My State Remains,"" the latest nasheed, the lyrics reveal a group keenly aware — and even proud — of the terror and upheaval it has unleashed, and the many lives it has destroyed. ""Our state has made the tears of our enemies flow,"" the song says. ""We have killed them by the thousands and led them to their deaths."""

Updated at 11 p.m. ET

Two students were hospitalized with gunshot wounds in Los Angeles after what police describe as an accidental shooting Thursday morning at Salvador Castro Middle School. A 12-year-old girl has been arrested.

Late Thursday, The Associated Press reported:

""[Police] spokesman Josh Rubenstein says the 12-year-old girl arrested in Thursday's shooting was being booked on a charge of negligent discharge of a firearm on school grounds. ""Twelve-year-old Jordan Valenzuela, a classmate, tells The Associated Press that he talked to her just after the shooting. ""He says she was sobbing and kept repeating, 'I didn't mean it.' He says she told him that the gun was in her backpack and that it accidentally went off when she dropped the bag.""

Both students who were shot are 15 years old — a boy who is in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head and a girl who was shot in the wrist and is in fair condition. Erik Scott of the Los Angeles Fire Department said three other people, ranging in age from 11 to 30, ""suffered abrasions"" during the attack.

The 15-year-old boy is expected to fully recover. Trauma surgeon Aaron Strumwasser said the victim was lucky the bullet that struck him in the temple did not cause life-threatening damage. ""I think he will do fine,"" said Strumwasser at the LA County-USC Medical Center, as quoted by the Los Angeles Times.

""As a parent, this is everyone's worst-case nightmare — a worst-case scenario and a nightmare for all of us,"" Robert Arcos, commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's Operations-Central Bureau, told reporters Thursday.

He said at the time it was too early know how the girl obtained the weapon.

As AP explains, district policy dictates that ""students at middle and high schools in Los Angeles are subject to daily random searches for weapons using metal-detector wands, but officials have not said whether any such screenings occurred at the school Thursday.""

The Los Angeles Times notes Castro Middle School sits just across the street from Belmont High School, in a building that ""used to be part of Belmont High when the high school had a higher enrollment.""

""I'm just scared for all the kids,"" Gloria Echeverria, mother of a 13-year-old student, told the AP while standing outside the police tape ringing the campus. ""School is supposed to be a safe place for them, and apparently it's not.""

Updated at 9:30 p.m. ET Saturday

Police in Kissimmee, Fla., just south of Orlando, reported late Friday that two officers there had been shot.

Officer Matthew Baxter, a three-year veteran of the department, was killed, and Sgt. Sam Howard was in ""grave critical condition,"" Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell told reporters early Saturday.

Later Saturday, Howard died of his injuries, the police department said in a statement on posted to Facebook.

Baxter was married to another officer and had three children. Howard is also married and a father.

Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs had earlier written on Twitter that both had been killed, calling the shooting a ""[h]eartbreaking loss of two of Kissimmee's finest officers.""

President Trump sent his condolences to the officers on Twitter.

Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O'Dell said Saturday that 45-year-old Everett Miller was arrested several hours after the shootings, charged with first-degree murder for killing Baxter. Authorities didn't say if Miller is facing charges for Howard's death.

According to the police chief, Miller was a Marine veteran recently committed involuntarily for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, and had threatened law enforcement on Facebook, O'Dell said.

""This is a tough time for each one of us,"" he told reporters early Saturday. O'Dell said the department hasn't ""experienced this in over 25 years.""

""At this point, I'd ask you to please keep the men and women of the Kissimmee Police Department, the families of the fallen officers, the law enforcement personnel in the central Florida area in your thoughts and prayers,"" he added.

The officers were shot in an area with ""some drug activity,"" he said.

""There are no county or jurisdiction lines when it comes to our Law Enforcement Brotherhood,"" Osceola County Commissioner Fred Hawkins Jr. wrote in response to the shootings.

Later in the same night, two other officers were shot in a separate incident about 165 miles north, in Jacksonville, Fla.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office wrote that one of the officers was in critical condition and one was in stable condition in local hospitals.

Mike Bruno, the director the office's Department of Patrol and Enforcement, told reporters that four or five officers responded to an ""attempted suicide call"" at a home around 11 p.m. They thought it was an active shooter situation after hearing gunshots from inside.

A suspect ""began shooting through the door at the officers,"" using a ""high-powered rifle,"" then went outside and exchanged gunfire with the officers, Bruno said.

The suspect was shot by police and died at a hospital.

In a third separate incident, in southwestern Pennsylvania, two Pennsylvania state troopers were shot in Fairchance on Friday. The suspect in that incident was also killed.

Federal health officials are urging all Americans to get their flu shots as soon as possible, and are especially concerned that too few elderly people are getting vaccinated.

""Flu is serious. Flu is unpredictable,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters during a joint briefing Thursday with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. ""Flu often does not get enough respect.""

While the influenza virus causes relatively mild illness in most people, the disease can lead to tens of thousands of deaths during severe flu seasons, Frieden noted. About 100 children die each year from the flu.

The CDC and other infectious disease specialists are concerned by a recent drop in seasonal flu vaccination. About 45 percent of the U.S. population got vaccinated against the virus last year, which was down 1.5 percentage points from the previous year.

The largest decrease was among people ages 50 and older. There was a 3.4 percentage-point drop among people ages 50 to 64, and a 3.3 percentage-point drop among those ages 65 and older. The elderly are among those most vulnerable to life-threatening complications of the flu.

As many as 168 million doses of flu vaccine should be available this year, and more than 93 million have already been distributed, according to the CDC.

""There's plenty for everybody,"" Frieden said.

Although some questions have been raised about whether getting the flu vaccine too soon may diminish its effectiveness, federal officials recommended against anyone waiting. Similarly, some research recently questioned whether protection from the vaccine may wane more quickly among people who get vaccinated every year. But the CDC and other infectious disease specialists still advocate annual vaccination.

The nasal spray vaccine, which many parents have preferred for their children, is not being recommended this year because recent research has questioned its effectiveness. Researchers are still trying to confirm if and why the nasal version might be less effective than the shot.

But two new flu vaccines are available this year. One protects against four strains of flu instead of just three. The other contains a substance known as an ""adjuvant,"" which boosts the vaccine's effectiveness.

Health officials recommend that most people simply get whichever version of flu shot is most readily available to them rather than wait for a specific version."

A Navy SEAL testified Wednesday in Fort Bragg, N.C., that he was shot and badly injured during a heavy firefight while searching for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl after Bergdahl walked off his combat outpost in Afghanistan.

The military judge, Army Col. Jeffery Nance, is allowing the testimony of three service members whose injuries are considered a direct result of the searches for Bergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban and held for five years. He has pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.

The Navy SEAL, Senior Chief Petty Officer James Hatch, was forced to retire from the military after nearly 26 years of service because of the injuries sustained while searching for Bergdahl. He testified that he underwent 18 operations in the years that followed.

On Wednesday, he walked to the witness stand with a heavy limp, accompanied by a black service dog.

Hatch said that before Bergdahl went missing, the unit's mission was capturing and killing high-value targets. Members of the unit got word that they were going to focus on rescuing Bergdahl.

""Someone is going to get killed or hurt trying to get this kid,"" Hatch recalled saying.

Nine days after Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance, Hatch led a team with two helicopters on a mission into Afghanistan's Paktika province. He said the team was taking heavy fire even before they landed.

As they began advancing to the position where they believed Bergdahl was held, he said, a trained dog with them lunged after three figures, who turned out to be children.

Shortly afterward, the dog was shot in the head and killed, he said. Hatch spoke in formal, controlled language, with his voice only wavering when he spoke about the dog.

Hatch was then shot in his right leg, just above the knee. He described screaming in pain and worrying that he was endangering fellow troops. ""I really thought I was going to die,"" he said. The Navy SEAL was then airlifted out.

""Everyone on that mission was aware [Bergdahl] walked off,"" Hatch said. When asked why they went after him, Hatch responded: ""Because he's an American.""

Another witness, Capt. John Billings, was Bergdahl's platoon leader and described the searches immediately after Bergdahl went missing.

""The next 10 days were just kind of a blur,"" he said. ""Everybody in Afghanistan was looking for Bergdahl.""

On Monday, the military judge probed whether recent comments by President Trump could challenge the fairness of the legal proceedings. As we reported:

""Under the military justice system, it's unlawful for commanders to influence legal cases, or even give the appearance of influence. That principle covers the president as commander-in-chief. ""Bergdahl, who spent five years in Taliban captivity, was a frequent target for Trump when he was a candidate. Trump suggested in 2015 that Bergdahl 'should be shot,' as NPR's Rebecca Hersher reported. ""In previous filings, lawyers for Bergdahl cited at least 45 instances where candidate Trump called their client a traitor.""

On Monday, Trump said: ""I can't comment on Bowe Bergdahl. ... But I think people have heard my comments in the past.""

Nance said at the beginning of Wednesday's hearing that he hasn't decided whether these comments constitute undue influence and would rule at a later point. The defense wants a motion to dismiss the whole case. The judge's decision on this could factor into Bergdahl's sentence.

Nance has broad discretion in determining that sentence — he could sentence Bergdahl to life in prison or he could let him walk out of court a free man, saying in a sense that the five years he spent in Taliban captivity is punishment enough."

Some might chalk it up to bad luck; others, to karma.

Robert Meilhammer, 51, of Crapo, Md., was struck in the head Thursday by a dead Canada goose that plunged from the sky after a fellow waterfowl hunter fired a blind shot on a flock overhead. Meilhammer was in the midst of a hunting party with three friends in Easton, Md.

The goose fell about 90 feet, knocking the hunter out instantly and causing head and facial injuries. When Meilhammer came to, he was coherent but ""hazy,"" according to the Maryland Natural Resources Police.

Natural Resources police officers and EMS responders transported Meilhammer via ambulance to the Easton Airport, where he was airlifted to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore.

Talbot County EMS responders called his head injury ""severe."" The dead bird also knocked out two of Meilhammer's teeth.

Thousands of Canada geese in the United States migrate south each year, filling the sky with long, V-formations. Adult Canada geese weigh about 12 to 14 pounds, and can have a wing span reaching nearly 6 feet. The ""honkers,"" as the bird are called for their noisy calls, are found in every contiguous U.S. state.

Meilhammer is in stable condition."

Kuki Gallmann, a conservationist best known for her book I Dreamed of Africa, was ambushed and shot while she drove across her conservancy in Kenya Sunday morning.

Gallmann, 73, was shot in the stomach and ""severely injured"" while surveying her property with rangers of the Kenya Wildlife Service, according to her brother-in-law Nigel Adams and a press release from a farmers' association of which she's a member.

She was flown to a hospital in Nairobi for treatment, and was still conscious and speaking after the attack, according to The New York Times.

Her conservancy, the Laikipia Nature Conservancy, has been the center of a bloody battle for weeks, as a large-scale drought has pushed cattle-herders to extreme measures to try and find grazing land.

NPR's Eyder Peralta spoke on All Things Considered earlier this month about the issue, after the owner of another ranch was shot and killed.

""You have nomadic herders who are moving into private wildlife conservancies with thousands of heads of cattle,"" Peralta said. ""And in response, the Kenyan government launched a military-style operation to push the herders out. But what we've seen is an escalation of violence. Police have killed lots of cows. And the herders have responded by burning tourist lodges on the properties.""

In fact, Gallmann was said to be surveying arson damage inflicted on her property, when she was attacked.

Members of the Pokot and Samburu tribes have long grazed on conservancy land in Kenya, but over the past few years things have changed. Herders have brought more and more cows, killed other wildlife, and begun to vandalize property. Gallmann's daughter, Sveva Gallmann, told NPR last month that the escalation concerned her.

""That's not just grass,"" she said. ""That is heavily politicized violence. And that is what's much more worrying about this situation.""

She added that she doesn't think the herders even own many of the cows.

""There's a lot of, actually, politicians, people within the police, people within the administration storing their wealth in cattle and laundering ill-gotten money through cattle,"" she said.

Government officials deny those claims.

Kenya has a national election coming up in August, and local land owners also blame politicians for inciting herders to push their cattle onto privately-owned land as a way of boosting their popularity, reports the United Kingdom's The Telegraph.

In an interview with NPR Sunday, Martin Evans, the chair of the Laikipia Farmers' Association, agreed that the battle between the herders and the Kenya Defense forces is politically motivated.

""It started a year ago,"" Evans said. ""At the time it started, there was plenty of rain, it was nothing to do with lack of grass at that time so yes, I think it's definitely being pushed by politicians.""

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's office issued a statement warning politicians in the area not to inflame the situation with ""reckless rhetoric.""

""Politicians encouraging invasions of privately-owned property or attacks on individuals can expect strong deterrent action in terms of the law,"" Kenyatta's spokesman, Manoah Esipisu, said.

In the last month, the violence seemed to be escalating on the Gallmann ranch. Herders burned down a famous resort on her property, and she exchanged text messages last week with The New York Times that showed her concern.

""Pokot militia openly carrying firearms,"" Gallmann wrote on April 15. ""Not just herders. Group of armed men without livestock. 13 firearm spotted.""

Gallmann was born in Italy, and published her memoir I Dreamed of Africa in 1991. It was turned into a movie starring Kim Basinger in 2000.

Aja C. Holmes planned to go to work last week, but her flu symptoms — a cough, fever and severe body aches that worsened overnight — had other ideas.

""It felt like somebody took a bat and beat my body up and down,"" said Holmes, 39, who works as a residential life director at California State University, Sacramento. ""I couldn't get out of bed.""

The nation is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad flu season.

Flu is widespread in 46 states, including California, according to the latest reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Nationally, as of mid-December, at least 106 people had died from the infectious disease, according to the CDC. At least 27 Californians younger than 65 had died as of Friday, seven of them during the week before Christmas, according to the California Department of Public Health. And states across the country are reporting higher-than-average flu-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits.

In California, the flu struck surprisingly early and hard this season. The state's higher temperatures typically mean people are not as confined to the indoors, leading to a later flu season compared with other regions. Health experts aren't sure why this season is different.

""We're seeing the worst of it right now,"" said Dr. Randy Bergen, a pediatrician who is leading Kaiser Permanente-Northern California's anti-flu effort. ""We're really in historic territory, and I just don't know when it's going to stop."" (Kaiser Health News, which produces California Healthline, is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.)

Here is what you should know about this flu season:

1. It's shaping up to be one of the worst in recent years

The H3N2 influenza A subtype that appears to be most prevalent this year is particularly nasty, with more severe symptoms including fever and body aches. Australia, which U.S. public health officials follow closely in their flu forecasting in part because its winter is our summer, reported a record-high number of confirmed flu cases in 2017. Another influenza B virus subtype also is circulating ""and that's no fun, either,"" Bergen said.

Flu season in the U.S. typically starts in October and ends in May, peaking from December to February.

2. This season's flu vaccine is likely to be less effective than in previous years

U.S. flu experts say they won't fully know how effective this season's vaccine is until the end of the season. But Australia's experience suggests effectiveness was only about 10 percent. In the U.S., it is 40 percent to 60 percent effective in an average season. Vaccines are less protective if strains are different from what was predicted and if unexpected mutations occur.

3. You should get the flu shot anyway

Even if it is not a good match to the virus now circulating, the vaccine helps to ease the severity and duration of symptoms if you come down with the flu. Young children are considered among the most vulnerable to complications from the disease, and a shot can significantly reduce a child's chances of dying. High-dose vaccines are recommended for elderly people, who also are exceptionally vulnerable to illness, hospitalization and death related to the flu, according to the CDC.

""Some protection is better than no protection,"" Bergen said, ""but it's certainly disappointing to have a vaccine that's just not as effective as we'd like it to be.

Shots may still be available from your doctor or local health clinic, as well as at some chain drugstores. Check the Vaccine Finder website for a location near you.

4. Basic precautions may spare you and your family from days in bed

As much as possible, avoid people who are sick. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes.

Masks aren't particularly effective in keeping you from catching the flu, although they may help keep sick people who wear them from spreading their germs further.

If you are sick, cover your cough and stay home from work if you can, Bergen said. Remaining hydrated, eating nutritious foods and exercising can also help strengthen your immune system.

Because elderly people are so vulnerable to the flu, some nursing homes and assisted living facilities may limit visitors and resident activities, depending on the level of illness.

5. Don't mistake flu symptoms for those of a common cold

The hallmarks of flu are fever and body aches that accompany cough and congestion, Bergen said.

If you feel as if you're having trouble breathing or if your fever can't be controlled with medication like Tylenol, check with your doctor. It's even more important for patients to see a doctor if they have a chronic medical condition like diabetes or heart disease or if they are young or elderly.

Kaiser Permanente doctors now are being advised to prescribe antiviral drugs like Tamiflu — given as a pill or, for kids, an oral suspension — even without a lab test for influenza, Bergen said. According to a report in The Los Angeles Times, however, Tamiflu supplies are running low.

And Bergen cautioned that these medications are only partly effective, reducing the time of illness by just a day or two.

The pitches from pharmacy chains started in August: Come in and get your flu shot.

Convenience is touted. So are incentives. CVS offers a 20 percent-off shopping pass for everyone who gets a shot, while Walgreens donates toward international vaccination efforts.

The start of flu season is still weeks, if not months, away. Yet marketing of the vaccine has become an almost year-round effort that starts when the shots become available in August and is hyped as long as the supply lasts — often into April or May.

Not that long ago, most flu-shot campaigns started as the leaves began to turn in October. But two things have stretched the flu-shot season: the decade-long increase in the number of drugstores that have a retail medical clinic inside, and state laws that allow pharmacists to give vaccinations.

Drugstores have figured out how ""to deliver medical services in an on-demand way,"" says Tom Charland, founder and CEO of Merchant Medicine, which tracks the walk-in clinic industry. The approach appeals to customers, particularly millennials, and turns out to be good business.

""It's a way to get people into the store to buy other things,"" Charland says.

But some doctors warn that the marketing may be overtaking medical wisdom, since it's unclear how long the immunity imparted by the vaccine lasts, particularly in older people.

Federal health officials say it's better to get the shot whenever you can. An early flu shot is better than no flu shot at all. But the science is mixed when it comes to how long you'll get optimal protection from a flu shot promoted and given during the waning days of summer; the typical flu season peaks in midwinter or beyond. Immunologists and public health officials are divided on how patients should respond to such offers.

""If you're over 65, don't get the flu vaccine in September. Or August. It's a marketing scheme,"" says Laura Haynes, an immunologist at the University of Connecticut Center on Aging.

A combination of factors makes it more difficult for the immune systems of people older than 65 to respond to the vaccination, she says, and the protective effect may also wear off faster than it does in young people.

So, when is the best time to vaccinate?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises physicians that it's safe to make flu shots available to all age groups whenever the vaccine becomes available, each year. While ""delaying vaccination might permit greater immunity later in the season,"" the CDC notes, citing evidence from a 2013 study, that ""deferral could result in missed opportunities to vaccinate.""

How long will the immunity last?

""The data are very mixed,"" says Dr. John J. Treanor, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Rochester medical school. Some studies suggest vaccines lose some protectiveness during the course of a single flu season. Flu activity generally starts in the fall, but peaks in January or February and can run into the spring.

""So some might worry that if [they] got vaccinated very early and flu didn't show up until very late, it might not work as well,"" he says. But other studies show ""you still have protection from the shot you got last year,"" Treanor adds, ""if it's a year when the strains didn't change.""

In any given flu season, the effectiveness of immunization varies, partly dependent on how well the vaccine matches the strain of flu virus that's predominant that year. In the overall population, the CDC says studies show a vaccine can reduce the risk of flu by about 50 to 60 percent when the vaccine is well-matched.

It's especially important to vaccinate children, to help keep parents and grandparents healthy, as well as the kids themselves, doctors say. While most people who get the flu recover, it is a serious disease responsible for many deaths each year, particularly among older adults and young children.

The intensity of illness provoked by each influenza strain can vary, too; U.S. deaths associated with the flu have ranged from about 3,300 a year to 49,000 in the past 31 seasons.

To develop vaccines, manufacturers and scientists study what's circulating in the Southern Hemisphere during its winter flu season — June, July and August. Then, based on that evidence, they forecast what flu strains might be circulating in the U.S. the following November, December and January, and incorporate that information into flu vaccines that are generally ready by late July.

For the upcoming season, the vaccines will include three or four strains — including two influenza A strains, an H1N1 and an H3N2, as well as one or two B strains, according to the CDC. The federal health officials recommend that everyone older than 6 months gets vaccinated, unless they have a health condition that would prevent it.

The vaccines can't give a person the flu because the virus is killed before it's used in the shot. This year, the nasal vaccine — a squirt of liquid that includes a live attenuated virus — is not recommended for use, as studies showed it was not effective during several of the past flu seasons.

So, talk to your doctor, and weigh your options for the timing of that flu shot. ""The ideal time is between Halloween and Thanksgiving,"" says Haynes, who specializes in the immunity of older people. ""If you can't wait, and the only chance is to get it in September, then go ahead and get it. It's best to get it early rather than not at all.""

Altered consciousness, dreamy detachment and a healthy streak of escapism have long been hallmarks of psychedelic music. TOY is well aware of this — but at the same time, the British band is savvy enough to know just how far a pop song can be pushed, pulled and stretched. On the group's first two albums, 2012's TOY and 2013's Join The Dots, infectious indie rock bleeds into trippy studio effects, hypnotic rhythms and otherworldy textural manipulation. Much of the credit goes to frontman Tom Dougall, whose spun-sugar voice and dynamic songwriting ties together the outfit's ambitious, wide-angle soundscapes.

After a three-year break from studio albums, TOY is releasing its third full-length, Clear Shot, and it's even further proof of just how vivid and inviting psychedelia can be in the 21st century. Dougall — along with guitarist Dominic O'Dair, keyboardist-guitarist Max Oscarnold, bassist Maxim Barron and drummer Charlie Salvidge — infuses songs like ""Another Dimension"" and ""Clouds That Cover The Sun"" with the wide-eyed enchantment of a kids' magic show. ""Time runs free / Stretches and it squeezes / Everything and anyone it sees,"" Dougall coos at the start of ""Another Dimension,"" marveling at the elasticity of space-time before the song erupts into a serotonin-triggering chorus. Despite its title, ""Clouds That Cover The Sun"" is just as euphoric, even as its melancholy undertow pulses along at the speed of Oscarnold's gently burbling keys.

For all its billowy, pillowy bliss, Clear Shot can also get intense. ""Spirits Don't Lie"" is more of a droning meditation than a gleeful traipse, with Salvidge's nervy percussion feeling like a palpitating heartbeat. Still, for each of the album's pockets of shadow, there are a dozen bursts of sun. There's a buoyant skip in ""We Will Disperse"" that's reminiscent of The Flaming Lips' bubblegum grandeur, while ""I'm Still Believing"" slinks along with a silky flourish. ""So simple, so fine / She perfectly read my mind,"" speak-sings Dougall, too caught up in butterflies to worry about being melodic.

Snatches of everyone from Can to Stereolab to MGMT can be heard in Clear Shot's chugging-yet-supple anthems to ecstasy. ""Dream Orchestrator"" is the catchiest of the lot; propelled by a throbbing beat and effervescent synths, it's by far the danciest track on the album, not to mention the most forward-gazing. The chorus alone could be bottled and sold as an antidepressant, fueled as it is by easygoing hooks, squalls of breathless noise and upward-spiraling rapture. Rather than relying too heavily on the work of psychedelia's past masters, Dougall and crew have put a futuristic spin on hallucinatory pop — that is, if the future were something to be viewed with romance and wonder instead of today's all-too-pervasive doom."

Not only can the NRA marshal its grassroots to boost its preferred candidate, but it holds in reserve the power to fund and support primary challengers. That threat became real for an eight-term incumbent Democratic lawmaker from Oklahoma who voted for the assault weapons ban in 1994.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

There was a time when the National Rifle Association was known mostly for promoting gun safety and personal ownership of firearms. These days, the NRA is better known as an uncompromising political force. It defends its interpretation of the Second Amendment and works to defeat politicians it sees as enemies. Now, this transition has happened over several decades. NPR's Don Gonyea looks at one early and telling race that signaled the change.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Congressman Mike Synar was just 28 years old when he went to Washington, a Democrat from Muskogee. Yes, Oklahoma still sent Democrats to Congress back then. In those early years, Synar counted the NRA among his supporters.

NATHAN GERTH: What we're looking at here in terms of the letter...

GONYEA: That's Nathan Gerth of the University of Oklahoma reading a letter from 1980 found among boxes and boxes of documents from Synar's career.

GERTH: The National Rifle Association's Political Victory Fund is pleased to announce its endorsement of Congressman Mike Synar for the re-election from Oklahoma's 2nd District.

GONYEA: But the honeymoon did not last. After the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981 and several mass shootings, Synar supported stricter gun laws. Here he is on the House floor in 1993.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MIKE SYNAR: The Brady Bill, my colleagues, was introduced in 1987. Six long murderous years have passed. One hundred thousand of our best and brightest citizens have been killed by handguns since it was first introduced.

GONYEA: He would also co-sponsor the ban on assault weapons. The NRA responded by pouring cash and energy into defeating him. They backed Democrats to oppose him in primaries. In '92, Synar's opponent used that support, including full-page ads funded by the NRA, to force a runoff in the primary. At the University of Oklahoma, Nathan Gerth points to the headlines on one of those now-yellowing newspaper ads.

GERTH: You see point blank that the NRA Political Victory Fund is making some bold statements about Synar. Right up front, it's saying he's not only anti-hunter, anti-gun, but he's anti-Oklahoman.

GONYEA: Synar survived that runoff, but in '94 - another Democratic challenger. Synar would defend himself in ads like this one, again, from the University of Oklahoma archive.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: He's not afraid to make powerful enemies if it means standing up for the people of Oklahoma - Mike Synar for Congress.

GONYEA: Painted as too liberal, Synar lost the primary to a retired school principal named Virgil Cooper who would himself go on to lose in November. The NRA did back then something it has since perfected. It got its voters out in large numbers, making guns a hot-button issue. Gene Wallace worked for Mike Synar in those years. He says they didn't fully appreciate that Synar's votes on gun control would hurt him.

GENE WALLACE: We did dismiss it because it wasn't a part of the public square debate. There wasn't anybody calling our office. There wasn't anybody coming to our office and saying, hey, we're fearful that someone is going to take our guns.

GONYEA: The NRA declined a request for comment. There is tragic end to Mike Synar's story. Less than a year after his defeat, he was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1996. He was 45 years old. President Bill Clinton spoke at the memorial service.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BILL CLINTON: And if I hadn't been elected president, he never would have had to vote on that assault weapons ban.

GONYEA: Clinton added...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: He always had that wonderful saying, you know, that if you don't want to fight fires, don't be a fireman. If you don't want to cast votes, don't be a congressman.

GONYEA: That audio from the William J. Clinton Presidential Library. In the decades since, the NRA has escalated its political activity. It wins by painting its opponents as out of touch with the values of their district. In 1994, Congressman Mike Synar was among the first to learn that. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

Biathlon links two things that don't often go together, at least in the United States: cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. It's the only Winter Olympic sport in which the U.S. has never medaled.

The sport ""combines the power and aggression of cross-country skiing with the precision and calm of marksmanship,"" the Olympics website says, adding that biathlon ""has its roots in survival skills practised in the snow-covered forests of Scandinavia, where people hunted on skis with rifles slung over their shoulders.""

Its practitioners must power across the course, heaving themselves up and down inclines — then stop, calm their breathing, and fire rifles at a target 50 meters (164 feet) away.

For biathletes, the fact that their sport involves firearms isn't always comfortable. And following last week's school shooting in Parkland, Fla., some members of the U.S. team are adding their voices to the rising chorus calling for stricter gun control.

On Tuesday night, after he finished competing, American biathlete Lowell Bailey spoke out about the gun he uses to compete — and the type of gun that was used to kill 17 people in Parkland.

""We're a sport that uses a .22-caliber rifle,"" Bailey said, according to Yahoo Sports. ""A .22-caliber rifle that shoots a single round is a much different thing than an AR-15. In my opinion, there's just no reason for assault rifles to be in the hands of ordinary citizens.""

The Florida shooter used a semi-automatic rifle similar to an AR-15.

""I support an assault weapons ban,"" Bailey said, according to The Washington Post. ""I really do. Our country needs to wake up. Our country needs to change. There's just no excuse. I compete against all of these other World Cup nations — Germany, Norway. How good are they on the range? They're great at rifle marksmanship. Do you know how strict their gun control laws are? It's a travesty America hasn't changed and continues to go down this path. It just makes me want to cry.""

His teammate Susan Dunklee has previously described the tension between needing to use a gun for biathlon and hating gun violence.

""Watching the news after the Las Vegas shooting, I just had this disgust about anything gun-related,"" Dunklee told NPR's Melissa Block. ""It really took away the joy that I enjoy doing my sport, just thinking about that and the whole gun culture. Most of the time, I kind of forget that my sport is a gun sport. It's just biathlon: To me it's something totally different.""

""I look at what's happening with all these mass shootings and it's so sad, and it's not OK,"" she added. ""It almost makes me want to just put the rifle down and never touch it again. Sometimes.""

The biathletes experience for themselves how gun control laws vary from country to country. In Pyeongchang, for example, their rifles are stored in lockers. The athletes must check them out each time they practice.

""They're under lock and key,"" Dunklee told Yahoo Sports. ""We each have our own key. We ski around with them, then we bring them right back. Very controlled. Russia does that too.""

""It would be like if you're a runner and someone locked up your running shoes,"" teammate Joanne Firesteel Reid told Yahoo.

Biathletes from other countries are similarly skeptical of the permissiveness of America's gun laws.

""In Norway, it's really strict to buy weapons,"" Norway's Tiril Eckhoff told USA Today. ""I think that's the main thing in America. Everyone can buy a gun, and that's totally wrong, I think.""

U.S. biathlete Tim Burke said that he was devastated when he read what had happened in Parkland. ""What happened back home really put things in perspective,"" he told USA Today. ""I'm an avid hunter. But if locking up all of my sport rifles and hunting rifles meant saving one life, I would do it."""
npr53,npr,['Kayla Williams'],,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15285761,"Queen for a Year

... A woman at war: you're automatically a desirable commodity, and a scarce one at that. We call it ""Queen for a Year."" Even the unattractive girls start to act stuck-up. It's impossible not to notice.

""Queen for a Year."" You won't find the phrase in the dictionary or any compilation of military terms. But say it among soldiers, and they'll know immediately what you mean. That's what we've called American women at war since nurses traveled to Vietnam in the sixties.

There's also this ""deployment scale"" for hotness. Let me explain. On a scale of ten, say she's a five. You know — average looks, maybe a little mousy, nothing special. But okay. Not a girl who gets second glances in civilian life. But in the Army, while we're deployed? Easily an eight. One hot babe. On average every girl probably gets three extra points on a ten-point scale. Useful.

After you're in-country for a few months, all the girls begin to look good — or at least better. It changes — how should I say this? — the dynamics of being deployed.

You could get things easier, and you could get out of things easier. For a girl there were lots of little things you could do to make your load while deployed a whole lot lighter. You could use your femaleness to great advantage. You could do less work, get more assistance, and receive more special favors. Getting supplies? Working on the trucks? It could be a cinch — if you wanted it to be. It didn't take much. A little went a long way. Some of us worked it to the bone. Who says the life of the Army girl has to be cruel? Lots of girls succumbed to temptation. The younger girls were the most susceptible. Many thrived and fed on the male attention they were getting for the first time in their lives.

I did my personal best to resist. So did my friends and the girls I respected. (That's why I respected them.) But many girls became full-fledged Queens for a Year. We saw it. And the guys talked.

The guys loved to talk. It didn't even especially matter what girls did or did not do. By the time it circled back to us (and in Iraq, everything that went around came around extra-fast), it might as well have been true.

""I watched her doing PT today. She was doing dips. She wants it!""

""I saw her in line for chow — she was wearing a tight brown T-shirt. She's looking for some action!""

Creepy.

And the locals? Even worse than Joes. At least some American guys have learned some subtlety about staring at our t***. They'd look out of the corner of their eyes. Or when we were looking away. Either Iraqi guys didn't care or didn't have the practice.

They just blatantly and openly stared at our t***. All the time.

Apparently Iraqis asked our guys if we were prostitutes.

Employed by the U.S. military to service the troops in the same way the Russian army managed sex for its soldiers in Kosovo. I didn't want anyone to think we were the U.S. equivalent of that! None of this means that life in the Army while deployed to a combat zone has to be celibate. ""What goes TDY stays TDY."" It's a longstanding military tradition. License to do as we please while on ""temporary duty"" — that is, while away from our permanent post. And it stays TDY when we return home.

Sex is not specifically prohibited for deployed soldiers. It's just implied that it is not allowed. Yet the PX in Iraq sells condoms.

The general attitude is: ""Don't get caught."" The one rule is: ""Be discreet."" Probably most of the single girls do it. Most of the single guys, too, if they ever get the chance. It becomes a simple matter of supply and demand.

And even though it's not okay, it's true — if a girl was indiscreet, if she got caught, or people knew, everyone lost respect for her. Like she was some slut. It was different, of course, for the guys. Somehow everyone got it that getting laid was okay for the guys.

So get real. The Army is not a monastery. More like a fraternity.

Or a massive frat party. With weapons. With girls there for the taking — at least some of the time.

The guys are there for the taking too. And we took. I took.

But mostly I chose to be a bitch. I was nowhere as young as most of the other girls over there. Nowhere as innocent — at all.

I'd hung around guys almost all my life; my punk rock scene in high school was overwhelmingly male. I'd dealt with sex from a young age. I'd been married.

In Iraq I felt I could deal with being Queen for a Year. But it still got to me. It still got me angry. Sometimes. I remember walking through the chow hall (once it was built) at the airfield was like running a gauntlet of eyes. Guys stared and stared and stared. Sometimes it felt like I was some f****** zoo animal. Guys hitting on us or saying inappropriate things — just constant.

Then sometimes I got in the mood. I'd enter the chow hall with a swing to my step. Check me out. Look. Don't touch. So occasionally it went to my head.

The girls joked, too. Some guys we met in Iraq were no prime specimens themselves. Funny nose, bad posture, bad teeth, whatever.

But they also looked better. Always. So it worked both ways.

Location, location, location. It played with all our minds.

It was like a separate bloodless war within the larger deadly one.

Family members of some of the victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., have filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and seller of the rifle used by the gunman to kill 26 people.

The lawsuit filed on behalf of 10 victims claims that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle never should have been sold to the public because it is a military weapon. Nine of the families suing lost members in the shooting. Natalie Hammond, another plaintiff, was a teacher at the school who survived the rampage.

The Associated Press reports:

""In addition to Bushmaster, the families have named Camfour, a firearm distributor, and Riverview Gun Sales, the store where the Bushmaster rifle was purchased in 2010. Messages seeking comment from the defendants were not immediately returned. ""The 40-page complaint was filed in superior court in Bridgeport.""

It was two years ago yesterday that 20-year-old Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and opened fire, fatally shooting 20 children — some as young as 5 years old — and six adults.

President Trump speaks to the National Rifle Association, the gun rights group that strongly backed him in the 2016 campaign. NPR takes a look at what is on his agenda when it comes to gun rights.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

The nation's powerful gun lobby spent a lot of money in last year's presidential race. And today the winner of that race showed up to thank them for their effort.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The eight - year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.

(APPLAUSE)

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

That's President Trump delivering the keynote speech at the National Rifle Association's annual convention in Atlanta today. In a few moments, we'll hear how gun control advocates are focusing their strategy in the Trump era.

SHAPIRO: First, with a friendly president and a Republican controlled-Congress, the NRA is ready to go on offense. NPR's Scott Horsley takes a look.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Donald Trump is the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to attend an NRA convention. He told the gathering in Atlanta, he's well aware the NRA worked long and hard to put him in the White House.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.

HORSLEY: The NRA did come through for Trump, spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising in last year's election at a time when many conservative groups were sitting out the presidential race.

Sheila Krumholz directs the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign money. She says the NRA and its affiliates were among the top 10 spenders in last year's race.

SHEILA KRUMHOLZ: They're a powerhouse. The NRA has long been one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington. They have money and members, and they use both to great effect.

HORSLEY: The NRA seemed less concerned about electing Trump last year than defeating Hillary Clinton. Krumholz says the group spent more than $10 million on pro-Trump TV ads. But it spent almost twice that much on commercials targeting Clinton like this one, which shows a woman reaching for a handgun when an intruder breaks into her house.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: She'll call 911. Average response time - 11 minutes. Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.

HORSLEY: These ads ran heavily in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina. Trump won all three. And at today's convention, Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre of the NRA was ready to celebrate.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WAYNE LAPIERRE: Our victory in that fight has made possible the fights we continue to face, and face them we will.

HORSLEY: In Washington at least, the NRA no longer has to worry about fending off gun safety proposals like expanded background checks or limits on magazine sizes. Instead, it can push its own affirmative agenda. And topping that list is national reciprocity for concealed carry permits. LaPierre notes the NRA has been pushing for concealed carry for 20 years.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: The NRA is the reason today that 15 million Americans legally carry a firearm for personal protection.

HORSLEY: If the group's successful in winning national reciprocity, anyone with a permit to carry a concealed weapon in one state would be allowed to do so in all 50 states, essentially overriding the rules in states with stricter concealed carry laws. Trump has backed the idea. Though, he didn't discuss it in his speech today.

Instead, the president made an appeal to hunters and fishermen, noting his interior secretary has reversed a last-minute Obama rule restricting lead shot and fishing sinkers. Over the last two decades, though, personal protection has eclipsed hunting as the leading rationale for gun ownership. And the NRA has shifted its focus, too. LaPierre today sounded a populist, nationalist tone very much in keeping with Trump's own campaign rhetoric.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: It's up to us to speak up against the three most dangerous voices in America - academic elites, political elites and media elites. These are America's greatest domestic threats.

HORSLEY: The NRA leader is putting gun rights dead center in the culture wars. And there's nothing concealed about the political weapons he's carrying. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House.

Not all gun-rights advocates support the NRA's opposition to gun control. NPR's Scott Simon speaks to Mike Weisser, a semi-automatic rifle owner and seller, who wants much stricter controls.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Mike Weisser knows about guns. He spent half of his life in the gun business - selling guns, importing them, writing about them, teaching people how to use guns. He owns six semi-automatic rifles, and he likes to shoot them. But he wants to see the weapons heavily regulated. Mike Weisser joins us now from the studios of New England Public Radio in Springfield, Mass. Thanks so much for being with us.

MIKE WEISSER: My pleasure. Thank you for having me on.

SIMON: What do you own those six semi-automatics?

WEISSER: I like guns. So I don't really make a distinction between one gun or another. If I like it and I want to shoot it, I own it. I also own I don't know how many handguns. I don't know how many shotguns. It's a lot.

SIMON: And you're a collector?

WEISSER: No. No, I'm simply a gun nut. We're people who are hobbyists with guns the way other people are hobbyists with ham radios. I mean, if you go to a weekend model train show, same kind of people.

SIMON: Well, but you - I mean, as I don't have to tell you, I'm sure, guns are lethal in a way model trains or stamps aren't.

WEISSER: That's right. And that's one of the reasons why I've always felt very uncomfortable with the argument of not regulating them Because, you know, we have a long history of regulating all kinds of dangerous products. You know, regulation does not mean you can't get your hands on it.

SIMON: What kind of regulations would you like to see for semi-automatics?

WEISSER: What I would like to see is that there'd be a measurement of how lethal a particular weapon is. And the more lethal it is, the more it has to be regulated in a sense of what the buyer has to do to buy one and what the buyer has to do to show that he or she knows how to use it properly and what the buyer has to do to show that he or she is keeping their hands on the gun.

Because if we don't have a really good system - and it's not hard to do it - to keep track of guns in people's houses so that this theft rate starts to drop, we can talk all we want about law-abiding citizens, you know, and doing background checks, but if you've got a couple hundred thousand guns going out into the population that are there to be used as crime guns, then you're going to have an awful lot of gun violence.

SIMON: I'm told you're a lifelong - lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.

WEISSER: I'm a life member, correct. I've been a member of the NRA since I was 11 years old in 1965.

SIMON: Why are you still a member of the NRA?

WEISSER: Because when I joined the NRA, the NRA focused on the two things that I think guns should be used for by people who aren't in the military. And that's sports shooting and hunting. They still do that, although that's become really not their major focus. They also are the premier training organization. And I'm a certified NRA trainer. So, you know, I don't want to be on the outside just kind of yelling at them. Frankly, if they would get off this kick of the armed citizen and using guns for protection against crime, they wouldn't hear any noise from me. I just don't happen to like the position they've been taking over the last several decades to promote the sale of guns.

SIMON: And how (laughter) - how congenial do you find your viewpoint among gun owners? I know you hear from a lot of people.

WEISSER: Well, you know, I'm - it's not a congenial viewpoint. It's not something that most of the gun owners feel comfortable with. You know, I didn't start coming out publicly on these positions because I wanted to win any popularity contests. I thought it had to be said.

SIMON: Mike Weisser, who writes about guns for the Huffington Post - thanks very much for being with us.

WEISSER: My pleasure. Thank you very much for having me on.

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Sommers II/Reuters John Sommers II/Reuters

Editor's note, June 16: An earlier version of this story said Omar Mateen carried an AR-15, based on comments from Orlando Police Chief John Mina, who said Sunday that the gun was an ""AR-15-assault-type rifle."" Law enforcement officials subsequently told NPR that the gun was a Sig Sauer MCX, a rifle similar to an AR-15 but also different in fundamental ways. This story reflects the change.

When Omar Mateen embarked on his deadly rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday, he carried an assault-type rifle called a Sig Sauer MCX, law enforcement sources tell NPR.

The MCX is described by its manufacturer as ""the ultimate modern hunting rifle"" that is ""engineered from the ground up to be short, light and silenced.""

It is similar in appearance and lethality to the AR-15, the name given to a very popular family of rifles made and sold by nearly two dozen companies. Law enforcement sources call the MCX an ""AR-15 equivalent made by a different manufacturer.""

AR-15's were used in some of the most infamous mass murders in recent history, including the 2012 shootings of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

They were also used in the killings that same year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and last year's ISIS-inspired shootings at a government office building in San Bernardino, Calif.

After Sunday's massacre in Orlando, the New York Daily News dubbed the AR-15 ""the mass murderer's best friend.""

The AR-15 is popular with gun owners, in part because it's lightweight and easy to handle. Its long barrel generally makes it shoot more accurately, especially at great distances, and it tends to come with a high-capacity magazine.

""They've really caught on, just because of their military styling and because of their ease of use and customization. They're very highly customizable. You can put on your own component parts to it, take things out and easily put new things in. So some people have likened it to the iPhone of guns,"" says Adam Winkler, professor of constitutional law at UCLA and the author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in an interview with NPR.

Despite its similarities, the MCX is also fundamentally different from an AR-15.

Its internal operating system — its method of propelling bullets from its chamber and cycling to the next round — works differently, and several gun experts contacted by NPR say they do not consider it to be part of the large family of AR-15 rifles.

""With an innovative short-stroke gas piston operating system, users can change barrels, calibers, stocks and handguards in the field,"" according to a company brochure.

Weapons such as these — often referred to as assault-type rifles — were prohibited by Congress in 1994, but the ban expired a decade later, and since then their popularity has only grown, says Winkler.

Mateen bought the MCX legally, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He also carried a 9 mm pistol.

""He is not a prohibited person, so he can legally walk into a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms. He did so. And he did so within the last week or so,"" ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Trevor Velinor said Sunday."

Updated at 6:35 p.m. ET Saturday

As a groundswell grows against the National Rifle Association in the aftermath of last week's school massacre in Parkland, Fla., several businesses say they are ending their partnerships with the gun advocacy group.

The brands — ranging from insurance companies to airlines to rental car agencies — announced their decisions on social media, many apparently in direct response to tweets demanding change under the trending hashtag #boycottNRA.

Activists are seeking to name and shame business affiliates of the group.

On its website the NRA says, ""It pays to be a member! Get back hundreds of dollars more than you pay in dues"" and offers ""benefits"" running the gamut from home and auto insurance to prescription drug discounts to the ""Official Wine Club of the NRA.""

By Saturday, Delta and United Airlines both joined a growing list of companies distancing themselves from the NRA. Both said they would no longer offer discounts to members.

First National Bank of Omaha got the ball rolling on Thursday when it announced via tweet that it ""will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card."" It was responding to a tweet saying ""Please END your relationship with the @NRA. #NRABloodOnYourHands."" The bank said ""customer feedback"" spurred it to review its relationship.

A day later, Symantec, the cybersecurity company, said it had halted its NRA discount program.

About an hour after that, insurance company MetLife followed suit, tweeting, ""We value all our customers but have decided to end our discount program with the NRA.""

Then rental car companies hopped on board. Enterprise Holdings, which owns and operates car rental agencies Alamo, Enterprise and National, announced via tweets Friday from each brand's account that by March 26, it would sever its NRA member discount program.

Hertz's move came later in the day.

And the list went on.

On Tuesday, ThinkProgress, a project of the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund, published a list of some two dozen ""corporate partners"" that offer incentives to NRA members. ThinkProgess says it asked all of the corporations ""whether they plan to continue their relationships with the gun lobby. A growing number of those companies have ended their relationship with the NRA since this list was initially published.""

By their count, more than a dozen have already ended their relationships.

Company spokespeople reached by NPR would not elaborate on the announcements.

In a statement released Saturday, the NRA said the companies were punishing NRA members, ""in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice. In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve.""

The statement went on, ""Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.""

Many social media users have maintained their support for the group, which says it has 5 million members. Some said they would boycott the companies severing ties with the NRA.

The Huffington Post reports that several companies are continuing to stick by the NRA.

But it is not a novelty for companies to distance themselves from the group after mass shootings.

ThinkProgress reports Wyndham Worldwide stopped offering NRA discounts after a pressure campaign in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012.

But the parent company of major hotel brands including Travelodge, Howard Johnson, Ramada and Days Inn emphasized the distance by tweeting Friday that it ""is no longer affiliated with the NRA.""

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre addressed the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday and spoke of ""the breakneck speed for gun control laws,"" following the Florida shooting. ""As usual, the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,"" he said.

Meanwhile, some teachers in Florida were unsettled to learn earlier this week that the retirement funds to which they've been contributing invest in the gun company that produced the weapon used in the Parkland attack. Bloomberg News reports the Florida Retirement System Pension Plan held more than 41,000 shares in American Outdoor Brands Corp. (formerly Smith & Wesson), maker of the AR-15 rifle used by the shooter.

The president of the Florida teachers union has called for the fund to divest itself of shares. But The Washington Post reports that a spokesman with the state pension fund said that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

Student survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that left 17 of their classmates and educators dead are also using their platform to increase pressure on the NRA.

On Wednesday, at a CNN town hall, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio broke with an NRA stance when he announced he would support raising the age from 18 to 21 for ""buying a rifle."" He was responding to a question from student survivor Cameron Kasky. However, during the same exchange, Rubio refused to say he would renounce NRA donations. (Rubio has earned the NRA's highest rating, A+.)

Demonstrations by Stoneman Douglas survivors have mobilized students across the country, who have been protesting, staging school walkouts and calling on legislators to act.

""March for Our Lives,"" a national rally, is planned in Washington, D.C., on March 24."

After last month's mass shooting a Florida high school, students around the nation have staged walk-outs, rallies and other demonstrations to advocate for stricter gun measures. In response, some school administrators have threatened to suspend students who protest, and are being criticized for cracking down too hard. At the same time, many colleges are sending the opposite message, encouraging and congratulating students' activism.

In Boston, New Mission High School junior Ariyana Jones says many students at her school have been scared off from participating.

""Teachers will tell you straight up if you walk out, you will get written up and suspended,"" she says. ""They are trying to intimidate us, and I feel like it's working because they don't want to get that on their record or get in trouble.""

Needville, Texas Superintendent Curtis Rhodes, was more explicit, posting a warning on Facebook forbidding demonstrations during school hours, and threatening 3-day suspensions for anyone taking part. ""Life is all about choices, and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,"" he wrote. ""We will discipline no matter it if is one, fifty or five hundred students involved... and parent notes will not alleviate the discipline.""

The post has since been taken down, and the school declined comment, but the warning got students worried — and got lawyers involved.

""Really what that is, is retaliation for a student expressing their first amendment rights,"" says Texas ACLU Staff Attorney Kali Cohen. She says the hard line approach is not only unconstitutional, but also flies in the face of public schools' mission, as affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, to prepare young people to be engaged citizens.

And colleges couldn't agree more. Scores of colleges have posted and tweeted to reassure students that if they get suspended for taking part in a peaceful protest, it will not diminish their chances of getting accepted. As MIT put it, students do not have to ""choose between speaking out and getting in.""

Brandeis echoed the sentiment, tweeting ""#Brandeis supports students' right to stand up for their beliefs."" The tweet not only assured students their admission would not be jeopardized if they were disciplined for peaceful protest, but the tweet went further to urge them to go for it, saying ""Speak up, speak out.""

Brandeis says such activism, not only won't hurt students' chances of getting accepted, but may actually help.

""Having the bravery to stand up, to organize people, that takes a lot of courage and that is certainly something that I think would be applauded here,"" said Brandeis University Dean of Admissions Jennifer Walker. ""From a Brandeis perspective, I think speaking up and speaking out is a good fit for our campus culture.""

Students like Michael Martinez, a junior at Weston High School in Massachusetts, are taking comfort in the overwhelming support from colleges. Having personally lost a close relative and a family friend to gun violence, he's volunteering to help coordinate students across Massachusetts to join the National Walk-Out planned for March 14. ""We want this to be more than just a march,"" Martinez says. He's organizing an afternoon of lobbying at the State House, to follow the walk out.

""This is an opportunity for students to really, really get involved in a way that I don't think a lot of students have ever been before,"" he says. ""Young people to practice civic responsibility, service, community leadership and advocacy. I mean, it's a real life lesson, and a lot more valuable than anything a student would be learning in a classroom that day.""

Student organizer Vikiana Petit-Homme, a junior at Boston Latin Academy, agrees.

""Schools should be encouraging youth to speak,"" she says. ""They are there to prepare kids for the future, and [that means] learning to make sure we're heard. They should not be silencing us.""

The outcry from students and parents and the response from colleges seems to have prompted some high schools to soften their stance.

In Virginia, the Prince William County schools sent out a letter last month warning students that those who disrupt classes or leave school without permission will face disciplinary action. But after a bit of a uproar, officials sent a second letter the next day saying they had ""clearly sent the wrong message"" and promising to ""allow for some flexibility.""

But neither can it just be anarchy, says Associate Superintendent Phil Kavits; Schools have to balance students' rights with student safety.

""There have been examples in the past where people have had walk outs and decided to march down busy streets,"" Kavits says. ""And when they do that, we've lost the ability to keep them safe.""

Just this week, some 700 middle school students staged a walk out, after informing school officials that it was coming, and getting their blessing.

In Boston, high school students gathered to plan their March 14 walk out were waiting to hear how friendly their administrators would be to the idea, when School Superintendent Tommy Chang popped in unexpectedly, and pleasantly surprised them. He praised their work, and assured them they will not be disciplined for it.

It was welcome news to students like Petit-Homme. But she's quick to add, no official policy would have stopped her anyway.

""At this point, we've seen the adults are not doing what they're supposed to be doing, which is to keep us safe,"" she says. ""So we're done with going to them and asking for permission. At this point we're just going to do what we have to.""

Yes, Petit-Homme says, protests will be peaceful, but she says students cannot promise that they'll never disrupt the school day.

""The whole point is to be disruptive, to make sure we catch your attention. It's to make sure that you are hearing us. So causing a disruption is exactly what we're going for.""

There's no guarantee if, or when, it may result in real change. But it will almost certainly make for a college application essay the admissions committee will love."

After the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas last year, lawmakers discussed imposing restrictions on ""bump stocks."" The Las Vegas shooter used that type of gun modification, which makes a semiautomatic weapon fire like an automatic weapon, and killed 58 people.

After a gunman killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November, lawmakers discussed how they could improve the background check system.

No new laws came of those discussions.

Now, after a gunman killed 17 people at a Florida high school, President Trump has given some indication of what he thinks could stop further shootings.

""We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health,"" he said in a statement.

Whether that will inspire legislation remains to be seen. Mass shootings often inspire gun-control legislation — legislation that, in recent years, more often than not has languished.

While the president and members of Congress consider how to respond to the Florida shooting, the tool below allows you to see how your state's representatives and senators have voted on major gun legislation over the past two-and-a-half decades.

Because some bills aim to loosen gun restrictions (such as the February 2017 bill to ease restrictions on mentally ill people's ability to get firearms) and some bills aim to tighten them (Dianne Feinstein's 2016 amendment to stop people on the terrorist watch list from getting guns), we have color-coded people's votes in terms of whether they — broadly speaking — voted to increase or decrease gun restrictions.

Votes below include senators' votes from when they were in the House, if they ever served there.

Note: Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby was a Democrat until 1994, when he changed parties.

And here's a brief description of each bill represented above:

Brady Bill (1993, House and Senate): Enacted into law. Refers to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Passed in 1993, the Brady bill established five-day waiting periods and required background checks for gun purchases.

Assault Weapons Ban (1994, House and Senate): Enacted into law, expired in 2004. This law banned people from making, selling or owning certain types of semiautomatic weapons.

Closing Gun Show Loophole (1999, House and Senate): Did not become law. This refers to separate measures in each chamber that would have (broadly speaking) required people purchasing guns at gun shows to undergo a background check and a three-day waiting period.

Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (2005, House and Senate): Enacted into law. This measure protects firearm manufacturers from being sued for crimes committed with the firearms they manufactured.

Concealed Carry Reciprocity (2011 and 2017, House; 2013, Senate): Did not become law. These bills would have allowed a person with a concealed-carry permit in one state to legally carry a concealed firearm in other states.

Manchin-Toomey Bill (2015, Senate): Did not become law. This bill would have required background checks for the purchase of guns at gun shows and online.

Murphy Amendment (2016, Senate): Did not become law. This measure would have expanded background checks to cover guns sold online and at gun shows.

Feinstein Amendment (2016, Senate): Did not become law. This measure would have barred people on terrorist watch lists from buying firearms.

Mental Health (2017, House and Senate): Enacted into law. This bill undid an Obama-era regulation that added some people with mental illnesses to the FBI's background check database.

Part of the reason some gun laws fail, as stated before, is that gun control votes tend to fall so sharply along party lines. But the data show that Democrats, who favor gun control more than Republicans, tend to be more likely than Republicans to break ranks.

Of the bills we analyzed, here is how House votes broke down within the two parties:

Loading...

On the Senate side, the split is more straight along party lines, but there are a few exceptions — for example, with the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

Loading...

We broke out the people who broke with their party most often on the bills we studied here. On the Senate side, North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp has voted against stricter gun control (or for looser gun control) on every major gun control bill we studied since she took office in 2013. In the chart below, a white X denotes votes where a member of Congress voted differently from most of their fellow party members.

And on the House side, Georgia Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop has voted against his party on five gun control bills.

Again, though, there are more gun control bills than represented here. The point isn't to capture every gun bill vote ever, but to allow people to see how the people who represent them have voted on some key pieces of legislation.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Lawmakers in Washington and Tallahassee have discussed a lot of ideas to reduce school shootings, but on the hardest questions — like what to do about guns — there is just no clear consensus.

There are few signs of clarity from President Trump, who has taken a leading role in the debate without providing strong direction to solve the problem.

Trump started out voicing support for several options that crossed party lines. But lately the bipartisan message has gotten muddled. For one thing, Trump has been spending more time with the National Rifle Association, and it's beginning to show.

No consensus

Some Republican lawmakers want to raise the age limit to buy a long gun to 21 from 18; others, like the NRA, do not.

Trump voiced support for this proposal last week but didn't mention it at last week's Conservative Political Action Conference, where the NRA had a big presence, nor did Trump talk about it at a White House meeting with governors on Monday, after he had lunch with NRA leaders over the weekend.

Background checks have broader support. On Meet the Press on Sunday, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who has sponsored a bill to vastly expand background checks, said it may be up to Trump whether this happens or not.

""The president's expression of support for strengthening our background check system is very constructive. The president can play a huge and, in fact, probably decisive role in this,"" Toomey said.

But even though Trump says he wants ""comprehensive"" background checks, he has only supported a House bill that would tweak the current background check system. It would not make it universal nor close the gun show loophole, as would the bill that Toomey sponsored with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. in the months after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

The House bill, which is backed by the NRA, also includes a provision to loosen existing gun restrictions. It would allow people with permits to carry concealed weapons in their states to carry anywhere in the country — even in states that don't offer conceal-carry privileges. That provision is opposed by Democrats in the Senate.

The president also says he wants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to ban bump stocks, a gun accessory that allows a semi-automatic weapon to fire like an automatic weapon. But the ATF says that it doesn't have the power to ban bump stocks and that a ban would have to be legislated by Congress.

The NRA says it does not support banning bump stocks, despite coming out for more regulation of them after the massacre on the Las Vegas Strip last year.

Democrats and some Republicans are willing to reinstate the ban on some styles of assault weapons, but others including Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Trump and the NRA are not.

This suggests the debate may follow the same path we've seen after other mass shootings — a spike in support for gun control in the polls, no action by Congress, then fading interest as the moment passes.

Trump's familiar pattern

The main thing the president talks about now is ""hardening"" schools and arming some teachers. Those ideas represent the essence of the NRA approach to preventing school shootings — an echo of NRA executive Wayne LaPierre's CPAC speech — but they lack broader support.

The idea of arming teachers hasn't gone through any kind of policy process at the White House. There are numerous questions about how it would work and whether the federal government could have any role in this, since K-12 education is the responsibility of the states.

A White House spokesman admitted last week that there is no plan to turn Trump's idea of arming some teachers into legislation — in other words, the president was just musing about it.

Look back over the past several months of the immigration debate when Trump started by claiming he was searching for consensus, then retreated to a hard-right, maximalist position.

With immigration, the president first said that he would sign whatever Congress sent him and that he would ""take the heat"" if lawmakers compromised. Then, when faced with a bipartisan deal that would have given him full funding for his border wall and a path to citizenship for the people in the U.S. illegally who were brought here as children, he rejected it and insisted on a proposal that would drastically reduce legal immigration instead.

In the gun debate, he has managed to dominate the media narrative — one of the ways Trump measures success — with his proposal to arm some teachers. It's a proposal that has few supporters outside the president's hard-core base — just like the proposal to limit legal immigration.

At the White House meeting with governors, Trump didn't mention the idea of raising the age limit to purchase assault rifles to 21 — a proposal he had seemed to embrace earlier. That left the White House facing questions about whether the NRA twisted his arm when he had that luncheon with the organization's leaders.

""The president's still supportive of the concept,"" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. But the administration is holding out for the details.

The president revealed the NRA lunch to reassure people once again that he can handle the gun lobby.

""I will tell you, they are doing what they think is right. But sometimes, we're going to have to be very tough, and we're going to have to fight them,"" Trump said.

Tipping point for the NRA?

If a Republican president stood up to the NRA and changed the dynamic on gun control, it would be a tipping point in American politics. However, tipping points are most clearly seen in the rearview mirror.

Lots of observers have suggested that this time is different. And it does feel different because of all those young, articulate, social media-savvy students.

They became activists and household names overnight.

But the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting has also been considered a tipping point because of the horror of first-graders being massacred — and nothing happened.

Still, the decision by a growing number of businesses to sever ties with the NRA shows that many companies now feel doing business with the gun lobby is bad for their bottom line.

Whether it's bad or good for Trump and Republicans won't be known until November."

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

In the Florida House, Jared Moskowitz has been one of the more outspoken voices in this debate. He's a Democrat who represents the Parkland area. And when we spoke with him almost two weeks ago, he was frustrated with Washington but optimistic that Florida could come through.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

JARED MOSKOWITZ: Washington is broken. Nothing's going to happen in Washington. But Tallahassee has three weeks. We have three weeks. We have a unique opportunity.

CHANG: Now, with just one week left in their legislative session, some of that optimism is gone.

MOSKOWITZ: The bill is still moving along. But this obviously is not where I thought the process was going to go. The bill does keep guns out of the hands of people like Nikolas Cruz, but now it also potentially could do other things that really were never part of this conversation. And so we have a bill in which the two sides have come together. We are talking. We are compromising. And sometimes when you do compromise, that means both sides have to get something.

CHANG: And both sides have to give something up.

MOSKOWITZ: And both sides have to give something up. I, obviously, am against arming teachers. I was against it from day one. I filed the amendment to take it out in committee. I filed the amendment on the floor to take it out of the House bill on the floor. But at the same time, in the bill is monumental gun control for the state of Florida, which we've not been able to do in 20 years and may not get another crack at it again for a long period of time.

CHANG: What would you be willing to give up in order to get a gun control legislation package passed?

MOSKOWITZ: I am willing to give up certain things to get the marshal program, which is the optional program to arm teachers out of the bill. And I am working on that. You know, what specific I'm willing to give up - I'm not willing to tell the other side exactly what I'm willing to give up yet because we're still having negotiations. And they might listen to NPR. You know, we'll continue to have that dialogue, continue to have that conversations. We got a week left to get this done. A week is an eternity when it comes to negotiating a bill.

CHANG: Are there any lines in the sand that you would draw? Is there anything the other side wants that you absolutely will not consider?

MOSKOWITZ: I mean, the answer to that is of course, which is that this can't just turn into a bill that doesn't answer the ultimate question. Would this have prevented another Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting? Would this bill keep guns out of the hands of people like Nikolas Cruz? So if they want to start getting rid of things like, well, you can be under 21 and still buy guns or you're not going to have a waiting period - if they start getting rid of stuff like that, then at the end of the day, then we have to kill the bill.

CHANG: Is there any middle ground that you could stomach with this proposal to possibly arm teachers or other staff at schools?

MOSKOWITZ: Well, listen, it gives me indigestion. I mean, I'm already stomaching the optional program. I mean, I can tell you if they wanted to mandate the program, that's a complete deal breaker I think. We - then this bill would die under its own weight. It's objectional (ph) to me because I'm trying to take guns off the streets. I'm trying to get guns out of the hands of people like Nikolas Cruz. I'm not trying to put more guns in places. And so we've got to be very careful as we move forward on what we can get accomplished here and then give these kids - give these kids a win that they can take to D.C. so they can accomplish what they've been working so hard on since this tragedy happened at Douglas.

CHANG: There are so many conflicting forces going on here. You've had a lot of people traveling to the Capitol to put pressure on you guys, on the lawmakers. You have the NRA and their supporters. You have the survivors of the Parkland shooting. What do you think? Which side seems to have more influence over your colleagues right now?

MOSKOWITZ: Well, that's tough to say. It's obviously based on where they're from and their district. I mean, I would tell you that, you know, Democrats are hearing from parents that want gun control. We're also hearing from teachers that don't want this program, this Marshal program, even though it's optional. I think Republicans are hearing from the NRA big time. The NRA is sending out emails saying we need to find people to primary these Republican-elected officials. The NRA is saying we're going to spend more money in Florida in races than we've ever spent before. So the NRA is in full force. You may not see it if you're in a Democratic district, but if you're in a hardcore Republican district, they're getting hammered. And they're also hearing from teachers that don't like the optional marshal program.

So everyone right now is hearing from their constituents, hearing from their activists, hearing from their neighbors. We cannot leave here without a bill. That's just got to be the ultimate, ultimate answer of whether or not we succeeded or failed these kids. This bill is already not what they want. They want different stuff. But the idea that we did nothing and we failed them - that's got to be totally unacceptable.

CHANG: Jared Moskowitz is a Democrat and represents the Parkland area in the Florida House of Representatives. Thank you very much.

MOSKOWITZ: Thank you.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wallheiser/AP Mark Wallheiser/AP

House and Senate Republican lawmakers in Florida unveiled a package of sweeping gun control proposals on Monday, which they hope to pass before a legislative recess in two weeks.

The measures are aimed at making schools safer for children but present a challenge to the National Rifle Association's grip on the state's Republican leaders, including the self-professed gun-toting governor, who presented his own plan Friday.

If passed, it will be the first time in more than a decade that lawmakers advance any legislation opposed by the NRA, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

The bills under consideration by the Senate Rules Committee address several concerns raised by gun-control advocates who have been pressuring politicians to enact more protective measures in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Many advocates attended Monday's hearing wearing orange T-shirts with the slogan Gun Reform Now.

The GOP plan bears several similarities to the one proposed Gov. Rick Scott; both would raise the legal purchasing age of firearms to 21 from 18, implement a ban on bump stocks, increase school safety protocols and give police and courts more authority to take guns out of the hands of anyone deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.

Where they diverge, is in the debate over arming qualified school teachers. Like President Trump, Republican lawmakers argue student safety would be bolstered if teachers with concealed-carry permits and at least 132 hours of weapons training could carry guns on campus. Under the changes they would be acting under auspices of local law enforcement.

House Speaker Richard Corcoran is a gun-rights activist and helped craft the plan. NPR's Greg Allen reported the Republican called it the most far-reaching proposal of any of the 50 states.

Student victims, Democratic leaders and Scott oppose the strategy, which is being called a ""marshal plan.""

In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Scott said he opposes the idea of giving teachers guns. ""I want our teachers to teach. And I want our law enforcement officers to be able to protect the students,"" Scott said on the show. ""I want each group to focus on what they're good at.""

But, the Herald-Tribune reported, the governor would ""authorize sheriff's offices to train school personnel to help protect students, if sought by local school boards.""

The state GOP also goes a step further in seeking to impose a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases.

One provision not included in the bills lawmakers are considering is a primary concern for student activists from Douglas High School: a ban on high-powered semiautomatic rifles, including the AR-15 which was used by the gunman to kill 17 students and employees. The Tampa Bay Times reported Democrats, who are largely outnumbered, are seeking to add an amendment to one of the bills that would make buying an AR-15 illegal.

Other security measures backed by leaders from both parties include additional funding to ""harden schools"" with metal detectors, bulletproof glass, steel doors and upgraded locks. And Greg reports, there is bipartisan support for expanding mental health services in schools.

The House Rules Committee will take up a similar package on Tuesday."

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks to Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman, who chairs the Florida Supreme Court Task Force on Mental Health, about gun violence and mental health. Leifman offers a look at what role courts can play in preventing something that hasn't happened yet.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Lawmakers are trying to figure out if there is a way to prevent the next mass shooting, and part of that challenge lies with the mental health system. Yesterday we spoke to psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl from Vanderbilt.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

JONATHAN METZL: Psychiatric diagnosis is itself not a predictive science. In other words, there's nothing in psychiatric diagnosis that's going to tell you how somebody is going to act in one week or one year. And in that sense, putting psychiatrists in the position of having to predict something in the future is really at odds with their expertise.

CHANG: We wanted to look at the legal side of the prevention puzzle. If a judge commits someone to a mental hospital, their name can be added to a list that would show up on a background check for buying a new gun. The law varies from state to state, but Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman says in his state of Florida, the bar is very high.

STEVE LEIFMAN: What we're looking at in order to meet the criteria for actual involuntary commitment is they have to be imminently dangerous to self for others, meaning that they have to basically have a gun to their head or someone else's head. And anything short of that, they don't generally meet that criteria anyway.

CHANG: I asked Judge Leifman how he makes these assessments about someone's mental state even though he's not a clinician.

LEIFMAN: You know, the reality is most judges, particularly on the criminal bench, see more people in a week with serious mental illnesses than a psychiatrist may see in a month. I mean, that's - the bigger story here is that we have this horrific, fragmented, under-resourced mental health system that does not provide the resources that people need for recovery.

And so the default system for people with serious mental illnesses is a criminal system, even more than this probate system, that looks at people that have gone to a hospital, that are deemed dangerous to self for others. Or they're self-neglecting so bad that they're putting their own life at risk.

CHANG: When you're deciding whether they meet that criteria, as you say, are you thinking to yourself at some point that you could be taking away someone's Second Amendment rights, so you have to be very careful? Does that weigh on you as you're trying to make your assessment?

LEIFMAN: Honestly I think the primary concern of the court is not necessarily at the moment thinking about what their Second Amendment right is. And it's not that we're diminishing that. But the immediate concern is that they may be in a state where they could kill themselves or they could kill somebody else. And so it's less about, at that moment, what their Second Amendment right is and more about making sure that they are safe and secure and that the public is safe and secure.

CHANG: As we heard, the psychiatrist we spoke to was pretty adamant that there is no crystal ball out there for knowing when someone is going to be dangerous. And yet both psychiatrists and judges are put in the position of trying to anticipate violence. How do you feel about being put in that position?

LEIFMAN: It's difficult. The doctor is absolutely correct. There are no screening tools out there that can predict dangerousness. We have very good screening tools that can predict future criminality, and we use those in our criminal system with our mental health program here. But there is no crystal ball. And so...

CHANG: Does that make you uncomfortable, that you are put in the position to make hard judgment calls but there is no crystal ball?

LEIFMAN: I don't think judges feel uncomfortable. I mean, we make difficult decisions every day. And what you do is you just rely on the evidence that's in front of you, and you apply it to the law. I think where judges might get in trouble is if they start trying to guess what may happen. And so as long as you stay focused on what the evidence is and what the law requires, you're usually in a pretty good position.

CHANG: Yesterday at the White House, President Trump said it should be simpler to take guns away from people who pose a threat. Let me play some of the tape for you.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man's case that just took place in Florida. He had a lot of firearms. They saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So you could do exactly what you're saying but take the guns first; go through due process second.

CHANG: Take the guns first; go through due process second. As a judge, what do you think about that?

LEIFMAN: Well, I don't think any judge likes to hear putting due process in the backseat. Due process is required in any situation. Now, there are some states that have these red-flag types law...

CHANG: Yeah.

LEIFMAN: ...That actually allow you to go to court first similarly to what we do for injunctions on domestic violence. The judge signs the order very quick as long as there is some evidence that the person meets whatever the criteria is under the law, and then law enforcement should then be able to take the weapon. But I think you're going to probably run in some - to some constitutional issues if you just start seizing property from people without some kind of due process.

CHANG: When we think about legislative options to limit rights such as the Second Amendment, can you tell us a little bit about what we should be weighing?

LEIFMAN: You know, there are limits on most, if not all constitutional protection. The First Amendment, which comes before the Second Amendment, also has limitations. You cannot go into a movie theater and yell fire. Even though that's free speech, it clearly could cause a danger to public safety. So there are limits to all fundamental rights. They can't be abused. And so I think people can be foolish sometimes when they say they are absolute rights because they just aren't. You have to always be able to weigh these against the public safety.

Look; we don't allow convicted felons to own firearms. We don't allow people that have been convicted of domestic violence to own firearms. And so I don't think anyone that may be exhibiting at a particular moment a very serious situation should probably be able to hold onto their firearm. That doesn't mean that there shouldn't be some kind of due process to make sure that happens, but I do think a lot of what we do is balancing rights against protecting the public.

CHANG: What more authority would you want as a judge that you don't have right now to try to play a greater role in preventing mass shootings or gun violence?

LEIFMAN: So in Florida, we do not have the authority to take guns away from people that may have been found dangerous to self or others. We only have authority to put them on a list to stop the purchase of the firearm. But if they already own a gun, there's nothing we can do, which makes no sense at all.

And I think that it's hard for us to just think that if we point fingers at people with mental illnesses, we're going to fix this horrible problem of, you know, gun violence at schools or mass shootings. It's bigger than that. And people with mental illnesses are only a small part of the problem. And so it's about fixing the broader issues.

And I think one of the laws that the legislatures are contemplating around the country is not just removing firearms for people that may have a mental illness. But if someone is acting dangerous period, the police would have the authority to remove the firearm at that point. Just to single just people with mental illnesses out is not going to fix the problem.

CHANG: Judge Steve Leifman chairs the Florida Supreme Court Task Force on Mental Health. Thank you very much.

LEIFMAN: Thank you.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Colin Hackley/Reuters Colin Hackley/Reuters

Florida's Republican governor is calling for a range of measures that aim to prevent shootings like the one that occurred last week in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and staff were killed.

In a news conference Friday in Tallahassee, Rick Scott said he wants new laws and programs that fall into three categories: gun laws, school safety and mental health.

PBS NewsHour YouTube

He did not ask for any specific weapons to be banned and more than once mentioned that he is a member of the National Rifle Association.

""I know there are some who are advocating a mass takeaway of Second Amendment rights for all Americans,"" Scott said. ""That is not the answer. Keeping guns away from dangerous people and people with mental issues is what we need to do.""

Here's what he called for in Florida:

People under 21 will be banned from buying or possessing firearms, with some exceptions for military and law enforcement.

President Trump has left his Republican allies confused about his intentions on guns, concerned about his moves on trade and curious about the state of his White House staff.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Here are just two data points from a chaotic week. On Wednesday, President Trump held a televised meeting with lawmakers. He appeared to endorse gun legislation, including measures opposed by the NRA. He accused fellow Republicans of being afraid of the NRA. Well, then yesterday, Chris Cox, the top NRA lobbyist, dropped by the Oval Office. Cox came out saying that the president does not support gun control. And the president wrote on Twitter he had a, quote, ""good, great meeting with the NRA."" NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here to help us figure this out. Hey, Tam.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey.

GREENE: So do we know after these last few days where the president stands on gun control?

KEITH: Not exactly. So Chris Cox, the NRA lobbyist, came out of that meeting and, as you say, he tweeted that the president and vice president support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control. Now...

GREENE: Seemed in very good spirits compared to what we thought the NRA was feeling just a day before.

KEITH: Well, that's because they had just talked to the president in the Oval Office late at night and apparently had a good meeting. And, you know, this follows, earlier in the week, President Trump had this televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers where he seemed to side with Democrats on all kinds of things, including - and he went farther than Democrats on this - the idea that you would take the guns first and go through due process second. He endorsed all sorts of legislation. Well, now today, Sarah Sanders, his spokesperson, who, we should say, doesn't always exactly represent the president's views - but she was on ""Fox & Friends"" and was asked, OK, what does the president support now?

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX & FRIENDS"")

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Look, the president's already expressed support for Senator Cornyn's legislation. He's also supported the Stop Gun Violence Act. Those are two pieces of legislation in their current form that the president supports. The Toomey bill he has not fully gotten on board with. They're still kind of working out some of the final pieces of that legislation. Until it gets into its final stage, we're not going to weigh in. But we're continuing to closely watch that.

GREENE: OK. So she's throwing out the names of a lot of bills there, Tam, but safe to say that she's talking about some of the things that the president had originally said he would support that the NRA is against.

KEITH: Yeah. So the first bill she talked about is a narrow change that would basically make it so that more information gets into the background check system. That has been even supported by the NRA. The Toomey bill that she's referring to is a more comprehensive background checks bill that, at that meeting on Wednesday, President Trump had said, hey, this should be the base bill. Add all kinds of other stuff into it and let's do something comprehensive. Now, the White House is saying, well, we don't really know if the president's going to support that bill or not.

GREENE: All right. I want to play you a little tape here and then ask you something. This is Republican Senator John Thune describing that televised meeting with the president where the president seemed to be siding with Democrats the other day.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN THUNE: You guys saw - you saw it, right? It was - it was wild.

GREENE: I mean, he seems kind of perplexed. Is what Sarah Sanders said this morning going to help out Republicans as they look at this issue and try to figure out where the president is guiding them?

KEITH: Not necessarily. There's just not that much clarity. When things change from day to day and hour to hour, members of Congress aren't going to stick their necks out on an issue that isn't really, you know, on the Republican side, their issue. And already Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate has said that they aren't even going to vote next week on gun legislation as they had thought they might. They're moving on to a banking bill.

GREENE: And all of this comes, of course, in a week where there was a big personnel move at the White House - the resignation of Hope Hicks, the president's very close aide, maybe the most loyal person outside his family. She's leaving the White House. What does this say about the state of things on the Trump team and the president's inner circle?

KEITH: The president's inner circle has fewer and fewer true loyalists in it, and it seems like the president may not be listening to some of those people who are left. The move that he made this week, yesterday, on trade, sort of surprising everyone, making an announcement - he's wanted to do that for a long time. A lot of people have been telling him not to do it. And now, it seems like he's just doing what he wants to do.

GREENE: Including these tariffs that you mentioned on steel imports. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Tam, thanks. We appreciate it.

KEITH: You're welcome.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images

Congress is under intense pressure to pass legislation to curb gun violence, but lawmakers are deeply split over how far to go in limiting access to guns.

Lawmakers from both parties say they want to take action to prevent another deadly attack like the Feb. 14 shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people. Disagreements over gun control measures go beyond a clear partisan split between Democrats and Republicans, leaving even the most popular bipartisan proposal stalled in Congress.

Senate leaders had hoped to fast-track a bill to improve the national background check system and send it to the House for quick consideration. But conservative Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, placed a hold on the bill, preventing speedy passage. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Tuesday that he does not plan to take up any gun measures until the Senate acts first.

""We're waiting to see what the Senate can do,"" Ryan said at a weekly press conference. ""We'll find out what the Senate can do, and we'll address that then.""

Ryan said he is deeply disturbed by the shooting and he wants Congress to delve into failures in the existing law enforcement and background check systems that happened in the lead-up to the Florida shooting.

Many Republicans oppose any limits on gun rights for most people. Ryan said the House is focused instead on preventing criminals and people with a history of mental illness from accessing deadly firearms.

""We do know that there are gaps in the background system that need to be plugged,"" Ryan said. ""We shouldn't be banning guns for law-abiding citizens, we should be focusing on making sure that citizens who shouldn't have guns in the first place don't get them.""

The Senate bill would address some of those concerns with narrow changes to how local, state and federal law enforcement agencies share information. It would make it easier for the FBI and local police to update the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Conservatives like Lee say that the Senate bill doesn't address the core problem with the background check system and that they worry it would deny gun owners their right to due process. Lee and Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and John Kennedy, R-La., sent a letter to Senate leaders opposing that bill, saying they worry it ""might lead to an increase in the likelihood of abuse and administrative error.""

The Senate bill has also drawn criticism from some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who say the bill doesn't go far enough. Schumer is calling on Congress to pass new, broader background checks.

""Not just a little something here, a little something there,"" Schumer said Tuesday in a speech on the Senate floor. ""But comprehensive background checks are supported overwhelmingly by the American people.""

Schumer is also co-sponsor of the narrower Senate bill, which was written in part by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.

Cornyn has complained that the infighting over the narrow bill could be standing in the way of the best opportunity Congress has to pass a gun bill this week.

""This is our chance to show the nation that we refuse to accept shootings at schools and churches as the new normal,"" Cornyn said Tuesday. ""If our attitude is 'I want everything on my list or nothing,' we're going to end up with nothing."""

Rachel Martin talks to Charles Cooke, National Review Online editor, about how the Florida shooting may have started a change of heart on gun policy in the White House, that sentiment isn't universal.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And this week, President Trump pressed lawmakers to come up with a unified plan on gun policy that he can support.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to pursue commonsense measures that protect the rights of law-abiding Americans while keeping guns - and we have to keep the guns out of the hands of those that pose the threat.

GREENE: But it is not entirely clear what measures the president really supports. An NRA lobbyist met Trump yesterday and said that the president does not support gun control. Charles Cooke is editor of National Review Online. And while Cooke supports some regulations, he told Rachel Martin that the recent school shooting has not shaken his belief in gun rights.

CHARLES COOKE: We need to give law enforcement, as long as there is a due process component - a strong due process component - more leeway in removing guns from people who have shown themselves to be violent or have made threats. But in terms of sweeping gun control, I haven't changed my view. And the reason for that is not that I don't care about what happened, or that I don't think it was a disaster for those involved, or that I wasn't personally affected - I have children myself - but because I just strongly disagree that that is - that gun control is the way you will stop this.

RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: President Trump met with Democrats and Republicans from both House and Senate. And in that discussion about what to do about gun violence in the country, the president, a Republican, actually suggested that an assault weapons ban could be a good idea.

COOKE: Well, I think the president is entirely incoherent. He's also somebody who does not have particularly strong views in favor of guns. I understand that he has been defended by the NRA, both on his policy positions and also, oddly enough, just in general. But if you go back to Donald Trump 20 years ago, you will find somebody who was in favor of an assault weapons ban and waiting period and so forth. So we're dealing with an anomaly within the system.

I do think it is much more useful politically to look at the underlying political reality here. And that means looking at what Republicans think of this issue. And, you know, as much as Donald Trump flails around, I don't think that's going to change.

MARTIN: There have been other Republicans who have at least softened their language when thinking about an assault weapons ban. I interviewed a top Republican donor recently who said that he was going to stop supporting candidates who didn't fully embrace an assault weapons ban. Why do you argue that that's a bad idea?

COOKE: Well, I think it's a red herring. I don't think it will do anything. I mean, there are already 10 million AR-15s in the country. It's peculiar to me that we focus in on this weapon. It doesn't have a more lethal capacity than a handgun, especially in a close-range situation.

MARTIN: Do you support raising the age limit for someone to buy an assault-style weapon from 18 to 21, as the president has suggested and which is getting traction among Republicans right now?

COOKE: I don't know. I'm not quite sure whether we have thought this through. At what point do we think somebody is capable of exercising their own judgment? And I feel as if what's happened here is that we looked at the age of this guy in Florida - he was 19 - and we said, well, we would like to stop that post hoc. And so why don't we change the age at which he would have been able to buy a rifle?

The fact that this guy was on the radar and there weren't any tools with which the local sheriff's office could stop him is a big problem. And that proposal, which has been picked up by Marco Rubio, among others, strikes me as the most fruitful one.

MARTIN: So this is the idea of expanding these so-called red flag laws that because so many people had warned about Nikolas Cruz's behavior, there were red flags, right? And a handful of states in this country have already passed these laws that say, listen, someone like Nikolas Cruz, a parent, a teacher, someone in his life, if they had alerted a judge, and a judge had made a decision that this young man should not have weapons, they could have removed those guns from him. Would you advocate a more expansive set of those laws across the country?

COOKE: Yes, absolutely, providing, of course, that there is sufficient due process. But I think, in this case, there would have been more than enough evidence. I mean, the big fear that gun owners have is that the system will be abused. So, for example, you know, I'm a semi-public figure. So someone will call the FBI and say, you know, Charles Cooke is crazy. He made this joke on Twitter, and he's probably going to shoot up a school.

But the point is that if that happened, a judge or a police officer would come and see me, and they would ask my wife and my employer and my friends and others whether I was a threat. And they would, of course, say no. But with Nikolas Cruz, they would have said yes.

MARTIN: You just explained a scenario in which you have faith in American institutions to some degree, and we are living in a moment where a lot of people don't. And, quite frankly, the NRA has spun up that fear, that paranoia that you will not get due process, that this will be left up to some subjective liberal judge who wants to strip you of your Second Amendment rights.

COOKE: Well, I think there are two reasons for that, and I think they're both fair. One is that often, when these laws are implemented, they are implemented by left-leaning politicians. The second thing here - and, again, I think Democrats have themselves to blame for this - is that you have seen over the last two years an almost endless push to restrict Second Amendment rights and strip them, in many cases, from people who the government has put on secret lists. Which is so flagrantly unconstitutional and is obviously going to inspire a lack of trust.

But again, that bill, when it was introduced, was defeated. Hopefully, it will be defeated again. And just because, you know, that bad idea has been put to the - doesn't mean that this can't be done correctly. I'd also just say, I do have a lot of faith in American institutions. Yes, maybe I have the optimist eye as an immigrant, but I think that our institutions are holding up pretty well.

MARTIN: What do you make of this moment writ large when you think about the gun debate in America and how it has been intractable for so many generations now? Do you think this is a moment where something might change if you agree that something should change?

COOKE: Well, as I say, I hope that the Cornyn-Murphy bill passes, which would fix the background check system. And I hope that we have some sort of gun violence restraining order bill. So I do hope something changes. I still think the gun debate is intractable, both because there are so many guns in circulation that it seems to me that we are always going to be tinkering around the edges and also because this issue has, over the years, largely been won by conservatives. And so to dismantle the victories that they have won would take such a long time, that even if you could somehow do it, I'm not convinced there would be a great change.

MARTIN: Charles, thanks so much for your time.

COOKE: Thank you for having me.

GREENE: Rachel was talking there to Charles Cooke. He is the editor of National Review Online.

The House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines – a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas.

On a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle.

In the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him.

However, as The New York Times reports: ""... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.""

The bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures.

Connecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty — who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting – said the bill would undermine states' rights, ""hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,"" according to The Associated Press.

The NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a ""watershed"" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure ""all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.""

In the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats."

A <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/why-own-a-gun-protection-is-now-top-reason/"" target=""_blank"">new national survey</a> shows that protection is the top reason gun owners say they have firearms. In an earlier survey, hunting was their main reason. Melissa Block talks with Michael Dimock of the Pew Research Center about this and other results of the new gun survey.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

A new national survey on gun ownership indicates that 37 percent of U.S. households have guns. The Pew Research Center looked further into who owns guns and why. They surveyed about 1,500 Americans last month and Michael Dimock, the Pew Center's director, joins me to talk about what they found. Michael, welcome back.

MICHAEL DIMOCK: Hi.

BLOCK: Let's look at that 37 percent number first. These are people who report having a gun in their household, a gun either owned by them or by someone else.

DIMOCK: That's right. That's right. About 24 percent of Americans say they themselves own a gun. Another 13 percent live in a household where somebody else owns a gun.

BLOCK: This is a tricky number to get a handle on, right? How reliable do you think those numbers are? Because there are conflicting data on this.

DIMOCK: It is a surprising difficult question to get a good read on. You'd think it would be very concrete but it's not. And you have very different findings from different polls. The General Social Survey has probably one of the most reliable long-term trends on this and they've shown a decline in gun ownership rates, both personal and at the household level, over the past 40 years.

But the Gallup organization has also asked this question for 40 years and they've seen no decline in the rate of gun ownership and they get different proportions saying they have guns in their home. I think some of the complication is, some people may or may not be aware of guns, not just they don't know that it's there at all, but they may have forgotten about it. Some people have inherited a gun from their father. It's an old hunting rifle. It's out in the barn. I think there are different ways people know about guns or think about guns that make it an actually more difficult thing to measure than you'd think. But I think it's safe to say that most Americans today don't have a gun in their home.

BLOCK: I wonder if there would people who might not want to tell people they have a gun in the home, might be reluctant to divulge that information.

DIMOCK: I think it's a possibility. I mean, there are stereotypes associated with gun ownership and there's also a privacy issue. There may be some people who don't want to talk about it.

BLOCK: Or if you have any concerns that your guns might be confiscated, maybe that would be one question you wouldn't want to answer.

DIMOCK: That's true.

BLOCK: Well, of the gun owners whom you surveyed, who are they? What did you learn about them? What are the demographics?

DIMOCK: Well, the demographics are about what you'd expect. There's an enormous gender gap in gun ownership. Men are far more likely to own guns than women. That means that among gun owners, about 74 percent of gun owners are men and only 26 percent of gun owners are women. There's also an enormous divide along racial and ethnic lines.

Whites are far more likely to own a gun than minority groups are. And you also see a big age disparity. Younger folks are less likely to own guns than older Americans. And regional differences; South and Midwest, a little more likely to own guns than in the Northeast, but more so along an urban/rural dimension, much more prevalent in rural areas.

BLOCK: You asked people what the main reason is that the own a gun and you saw a pretty big shift on that, an interesting shift.

DIMOCK: Yes, yes. About 15 years ago, most people who own a gun told us that the main reason they had it was for hunting. Well, it was about half, 49 percent said hunting was the main reason they had a gun. Twenty-six percent said it was for protection. Those numbers have basically flipped around today. We have about half, 48 percent of gun owners, saying that protection now is the main reason that they have their gun and hunting has declined as a focus.

Other data suggests that just fewer Americans hunt these days.

BLOCK: You also asked women gun owners their thoughts on having guns and what did they tell you?

DIMOCK: Right. Well, again, women are far less likely to own guns, but if they do, they overwhelmingly cite protection as the main reason they have it. Again, I think that may reflect that women are less likely to be hunters as much as that they're more likely to be concerned about safety.

BLOCK: And they say 80 percent of them said having a gun makes them feel safer.

DIMOCK: Right. And we find that to be a very, very broad attitude, not only among gun owners, but even among people who live in a household where somebody else owns a gun, that people tend to feel that the gun makes them safer. They feel safer by having it in the household.

By contrast, people without a gun in the household, most of them say they'd be uncomfortable having a gun and the main reason they give is that they're worried about the safety of having a gun in the household. So the division in perspectives on how guns relate to our safety is really, really stark.

BLOCK: Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center, thanks very much.

DIMOCK: Thank you.

The U.S. Supreme Court delivered a major victory to gun control advocates on Monday. The 5-4 ruling allows strict enforcement of the federal ban on gun ""straw purchases,"" or one person buying a gun for another.

The federal law on background checks requires federally licensed gun dealers to verify the identity of buyers and submit their names to a federal database to weed out felons, those with a history of mental illness and others barred from gun ownership.

Significantly, the federal form and identification procedure make clear that only the actual buyers are eligible to make the purchase. It features in boldface these words: ""Warning: you are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm to you.""

In this case, Bruce Abramski Jr. offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun in Virginia for his uncle in Pennsylvania because Abramski thought he could get a law enforcement discount on the gun. Abramski had previously been a policeman but had been fired from the Roanoke, Va., police department for alleged theft.

At the gun dealership, Abramski filled out the federal forms, stating that he was the actual buyer of the gun. He even signed a separate form certifying his understanding that giving a false answer to that question is itself a federal crime.

After he was cleared by the federal database, Abramski gave the gun to his uncle, deposited the uncle's $400 check, and gave him a receipt.

Police later found the receipt after searching Abramski's home in connection with another crime. He was sentenced to five years of probation for lying on the federal form by representing himself as the actual buyer.

He appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that his answer on the form was ""not material to the lawfulness of the sale"" because his uncle could have bought the gun legally on his own.

On Monday the high court rejected that argument by a 5-to-4 vote. Writing for the majority, Justice Elena Kagan said that Abramski's reading would completely gut the twin purposes of the law — to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have them, and to assist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious crimes.

Kagan noted that according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, nearly half of its gun trafficking investigations involve straw purchasers. In the first six months of the 2014 fiscal year, there were 42 prosecutions in which the straw purchase violation was the lead charge, and many others in which it was a charge secondary to another crime, according to the Syracuse University Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Kagan said that were Abramski's view of the law to prevail, it would ""render the required records close to useless"" for aiding law enforcement. ""Putting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a gun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper trail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw,"" she said.

Writing for the four dissenters, Justice Antonin Scalia accused the court majority of making it ""a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner."" Joining his dissent were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

Particularly interesting in Monday's ruling was the vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who in 2008 sided with the court's conservatives in declaring for the first time that individuals have a constitutional right to gun ownership. That decision, written by Scalia, also had language pointedly allowing gun regulations — language that many experts believe was added at Kennedy's insistence.

Monday found Kennedy lining up instead against court conservatives to support the ban on straw purchases.

Many experts, like UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, were somewhat startled by the closeness of the vote. ""It surprised me that there were four justices who would go so far as to say federal law does not outlaw straw purchasing,"" said Winkler. ""That was a pretty significant step toward gutting one of the few viable and effective gun control laws we currently have on the books.""

Reaction from various interest groups was pretty predictable, though the closeness of the vote seemed unexpected.

""The government's out of control, and all three branches are united against the people and the Constitution,"" said Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.

In contrast, Jon Lowy, legal director of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, was relieved. ""The gun lobby was seeking to blast a gaping hole in our federal straw purchase law,"" he said. ""Fortunately, the court rejected that."""

Opponents of expanding background checks for gun sales often raise the fear that it would allow the government to create a national gun registry — a database of gun transactions. In fact, federal law already bans the creation of such a registry. And the reality of how gun sales records are accessed turns out to be surprisingly low-tech.

The trace begins after police seize a gun at a crime scene and then reach out to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives National Tracing Center in Martinsburg, W.Va. — the one place in the country that can investigate where the gun came from.

Here, in a warren of cubicles, ATF contractors are busy on the phones pursuing trace after trace. On a recent visit, they had 700 calls to make. Last year, ATF processed more than 344,000 crime gun trace requests.

Many people assume that ATF has a massive database of gun owners at its fingertips and can instantly access that information. The reality is very different. It involves lots of phone calls — and often, manual labor.

Here's how it works:

Local law enforcement sends ATF the particulars on the gun they've seized: the manufacturer, model, caliber, serial number. ATF then starts running that information back through the distribution chain, contacting the gun manufacturer — say, Glock or Smith & Wesson — and the manufacturer checks its records and identifies the wholesaler it sold the firearm to.

Then, ATF contacts the wholesaler and goes down the record chain until it finds the retail gun dealer. It's that dealer who should be able to say who bought that firearm.

It's up to the federally licensed gun dealer to keep the record of each gun purchase. It's a three-page form called a 4473 that the buyer and dealer have to fill out before a sale.

Scott Hester leads an ATF team that handles urgent gun traces for things like gun trafficking, homicide and violent crime.

""I take it personally that these traces come across my desk, and I'm doing what I can to help solve a crime,"" Hester says.

His cubicle is lined with newspaper headlines about the cases he's proudly handled.

""The very high-profile traces like Gabby Giffords, I worked on that case,"" he says. ""I worked on a case where four officers ... were having coffee [one morning] and they got killed. Newtown, we got called in on that one.""

If they're lucky, the trace can be completed really fast.

""It does not happen very often. But imagine the delight on the cop's face when we can put that gun in that bad guy's hand in 15 minutes,"" Hester says. ""It makes them very happy.""

Hester calls that ""winning the trace lottery.""

About 70 percent of the time, ATF says it can successfully trace a gun back to a buyer. Of course, for local law enforcement, that doesn't necessarily solve things.

That gun could have traded hands many more times after the original sale. It could have been transferred in private sales or maybe stolen. And for ATF, there's a whole other level of complication.

For about a third of the traces, it turns out the gun dealer, the wholesaler or manufacturer has gone out of business.

By law, when they close up shop, they have to ship all their gun purchase documents here to the ATF tracing center in West Virginia.

On a recent visit, the center received a dozen boxes of records from an Alabama gun dealer who's gone out of business. But these gun sale records can come in by the truckload — as many as 3,000 boxes at a time, hundreds of millions of pages in all. Those pages are stored in stacked cartons that line the walls and reach the ceiling. Boxes are everywhere. All of these cartons hold records of gun sales from businesses that have folded.

""On any given day, we will have to hand-search these records,"" says ATF Special Agent Charles Houser, who runs the National Tracing Center.

That's right, hand-search.

That means that if it's a gun maker or seller who's gone out of business, the workers here have to painstakingly leaf through these documents one page at a time looking for a match to the gun they're trying to trace.

""The idea that we have a computer database and you just type in a serial number and it pops out some purchaser's name is a myth,"" Houser says.

The idea that we have a computer database and you just type in a serial number and it pops out some purchaser's name is a myth.

They don't have that searchable, central database because the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby have successfully blocked that through Congress. They argue that a database of gun transactions would be a dangerous step toward a national gun registry.

So tracers comb through page after page of records as they stand amid boxes stacked head-high. ATF gets more than 1 million of these out-of-business records every month. And when they open those boxes of paperwork, who knows what they might find.

Houser points to a table filled with battered, burned and waterlogged gun sale records.

""These look like the Dead Sea Scrolls to me,"" he says. ""These are Hurricane Katrina records we kept. Businesses went underwater, and they went out of business. But they still shipped their records here, and we dried these out in the parking lot.""

And occasionally a gun dealer might deliver a not-so-subtle message with the ledgers — the acquisition and disposition books — he sends in.

""So those not so friendly with the government have maintained their A & D books on paper towel or toilet paper,"" Houser says. And it turns out, that's fine with him. ""As long as you get the records, I'm OK.""

ATF used to put these documents on microfilm. Now, the agency scans them.

""We have to have seven scanners running 16 hours a day or we fall behind,"" Houser says. But even once the pages are scanned, Houser points out, they're still not searchable. They're just making a digital image.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Cliff Owen/AP

""The only difference between the digital images and searching the boxes is that now somebody can sit at a TV screen, and they will flip through page by page. It's not searchable by anybody's name,"" he says.

With so much paperwork flooding in — there's a backlog — about 3,000 boxes right now are waiting to be scanned.

""When we pass 10,000 boxes here, GSA [the General Services Administration], who owns the building, warned us that the floor will collapse,"" Houser says. ""So what we've had to do is rent shipping containers, and then we put those out in the parking lot, and we have to send people out into the shipping containers to search boxes.""

Houser figures that 90 percent of the time, ATF can complete an urgent trace within 24 hours. For a routine trace, it might take a week.

Houser admits that this whole process looks pretty ugly, but he maintains that it is effective.

On the day of NPR's visit, the National Tracing Center completed 1,500 gun traces — with another 5,000 cases still in process."

When Jared Loughner walked into the Tucson gun store where authorities allege he put down his money for a Glock 19 in November, the store owner sent a request to run Loughner's name through the FBI's database of criminals, fugitives, illegal immigrants and mentally ill to see if Loughner was among them.

Loughner had had several run-ins with police for possessing drugs and had been told to leave his community college for erratic behavior. But the arrests never became convictions, and his behavior was never evaluated by state mental health professionals. So like 10 million others across the U.S. last year, Loughner passed and got his gun.

Despite the outcome, it's not people like Jared Loughner — people who may have questionable but not criminal backgrounds — that have gun control advocates worried. It's the database itself, which is only as good as the records that states put into it.

Several studies and experts say those records are often incomplete or missing.

""The [background check system] is gigantically better than nothing, and it is helping to keep people who are not supposed to have guns from getting guns,"" said Matt Bennett, spokesman of the nonprofit group Third Way, formerly known as Americans for Gun Safety. ""But it has very significant holes that are problematic.""

'That's Not Very Reliable'

The database is a 13-year-old system called NICS — the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It pulls records from not only state and local police, but also dozens of other agencies, including the U.S. Park Police, campus police and the U.S. Border Patrol. Except for a few additional restrictions in some states, as long as you're 21 and not in it, you can buy a handgun. If you're 18, you can buy a long gun.

But according to the FBI and a 2005 study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a significant problem is the number of states that are slow or fail entirely to update the final outcome of court cases. For example, the database may include the arrest record of someone charged with murder, but it may not know whether that person was convicted if the state court did not provide that information.

""If there's an open warrant for someone's arrest, the database is usually correct,"" said Robert McCrie, professor of security management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""Where it is not correct is in the disposition of cases — if the charges are later dismissed or the case is continued. That's not very reliable, and that's a problem.""

""Many counties and states don't see it as their duty to put substantial information into the system,"" McCrie said.

Digging Through Records — With A Time Limit

McCrie and other experts say that leaves it up to database researchers to figure out what happened. In some states, researchers have to track the information down at the specific courthouse where the trial occurred, calling a busy clerk's office to ask someone to manually pull the file. Some records are in storage in warehouses or basements.

And according to the law, the researcher has only three days to do it. If the FBI cannot determine whether someone is permitted to buy a gun in three days, in most states the dealer is allowed to proceed with the sale. It's called a ""default proceed.""

In 2005, the latest figures available, the Justice Department determined that more than 3,000 people walked out of a gun store with a firearm that they should not have been able to buy, because records later revealed they were felons or otherwise prohibited from owning a gun.

At that point, it's up to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearm and Explosives to get the gun back.

""Imagine you're law enforcement and you're sent to retrieve the firearm from the felon who bought it or the domestic violence offender,"" said Becca Knox, director of research for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""Not exactly the situation we want to put our law enforcement officers in.""

Some of the biggest challenges for the database, experts say, are domestic violence and drug cases, which often have inconclusive ends. Defendants are sometimes given a year or two to attend treatment, complete community service or enter therapy before a court decides whether a conviction will stand. An arrest is not enough to prohibit someone from buying a gun.

According to the Justice Department, some states are still entering those records manually. In states where records are fully automated, a clerk in a courtroom can punch the information into the database. Other states pass a handwritten piece of paper from one office to the next before it gets entered — a delay that can be costly for victims of domestic violence who have requested immediate restraining orders.

""You can see there's uneven performance,"" Knox said. ""The database is an incredible step forward, but we still have to figure out where the administrative and financial roadblocks are.""

In 2009, the FBI ran 10.8 million background checks on potential gun buyers. About 150,000 people were rejected. Most had felony or domestic violence convictions, or a restraining order, on their records. Less than 2 percent were rejected because of a mental illness."

President Obama announced executive actions Tuesday, intended to curtail gun violence. But if history is any guide, the president's effort may have the unintended effect of boosting gun sales — 2015 was a banner year.

""After San Bernardino, our business went up probably 50 percent,"" John Lamplugh, who has run gun shows in Maryland and Pennsylvania for more than three decades, said, referring to the recent shooting in California. ""It's either two things: They're scared and need to protect [themselves]. Or they're afraid that [the government is] going to take it from them. There's the two things that drive our business.""

According to the Congressional Research Service, there are roughly twice as many guns per capita in the United States as there were in 1968: more than 300 million guns in all.

Gun sales have increased in recent years. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. gun-makers produced nearly 11 million guns in 2013, the year after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre. That's twice as many as they made in 2010.

""There's a gun for every man, woman, and child, more or less,"" says Deborah Azrael of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.

But that doesn't mean every man, woman and child has a gun. The number of armed households has actually declined to about 1 in 3. So an ever larger number of guns is concentrated in a shrinking number of homes:

One of Obama's executive actions would try to expand background checks and improve background check processing. According to the FBI, 23 million background checks were performed in 2015, nearly three times the 8.5 million performed in 2000.

Researchers say a decline in hunting is partly responsible for the shrinking number of households with a gun. Gun ownership rates remain higher in rural areas. And there is considerable variation from state to state. Fewer than 6 percent of households in Delaware and Rhode Island have guns, compared with more than 50 percent in Arkansas, West Virginia and Wyoming."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

Since 1993, the United States has seen a drop in the rate of homicides and other violence involving guns, according to two new studies released Tuesday. Using government data, analysts saw a steep drop for violence in the 1990s, they saw more modest drops in crime rates since 2000.

""Firearm-related homicides dropped from 18,253 homicides in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011,"" according to a report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, ""and nonfatal firearm crimes dropped from 1.5 million victimizations in 1993 to 467,300 in 2011.

There were seven gun homicides per 100,000 people in 1993, the Pew Research Center study says, which dropped to 3.6 gun deaths in 2010. The study relied in part on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate was 49 percent lower in 2010, and there were fewer deaths, even though the nation's population grew,"" according to the Pew study. ""The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults, robberies and sex crimes—was 75 percent lower in 2011 than in 1993.""

All of that is good news — but many Americans don't seem to be aware of it. In a survey, the Pew Research Center found that only 12 percent of Americans believe the gun crime rate is lower today than it was in 1993; 56 percent believe it's higher.

In an effort to explain that finding, the Pew researchers noted that while mass shootings are rare, they capture public interest and are often viewed as touchstone events that help define the year in which the crimes occur. As examples, they cite three shootings in the past two years, in Tucson, Ariz.; Aurora, Colo.; and in Newtown, Conn.

The U.S. gun crime rate peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Pew study says, ending years of growth in gun violence that began in the 1960s. But the rate of suicides committed using a firearm hasn't fallen as fast, they add, noting that 6 out of every 10 gun deaths in America stems from suicide.

""Looking at the larger topic of firearm deaths, there were 31,672 deaths from guns in the U.S. in 2010,"" according to the Pew Center study. ""Most (19,392) were suicides; the gun suicide rate has been higher than the gun homicide rate since at least 1981, and the gap is wider than it was in 1981.""

The study also analyzed the people who've lost their lives to gun violence.

In 2010, 84 percent of those killed were male; 69 percent were between the ages of 18 and 40. And 55 percent of gun homicides that year were black, the researchers found — far higher than their share of the population (13 percent).

The study also notes that while the number of gun homicides has dropped, the number of guns in America hasn't.

Noting that it isn't clear how many Americans have guns in their households, the Pew researchers found that the ""2009 per capita rate of one person per gun in the U.S. had roughly doubled since 1968.""

The federal report included data about where criminals had acquired their weapons.

""In 2004 (the most recent year of data available), among state prison inmates who possessed a gun at the time of the offense, fewer than two percent bought their firearm at a flea market or gun show,"" according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. ""About 10 percent of state prison inmates said they purchased it from a retail store or pawnshop, 37 percent obtained it from family or friends, and another 40 percent obtained it from an illegal source."""

In the wake of the horrific shooting in Las Vegas this week, the White House faced questions about whether President Trump would support stricter gun legislation.

Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn't give a definite response to these questions, but her statement showed a White House hesitant to create new regulations.

""I think one of the things we don't want to do is try to create laws that won't stop these types of things from happening,"" Sanders said Monday. ""I think if you look to Chicago where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn't helped there.""

Pointing to Chicago to suggest that gun laws don't work is not a new talking point — Trump claimed Chicago had ""the toughest gun laws in the United States"" in a 2016 presidential debate; his fellow Republican candidate Chris Christie likewise pointed to Chicago as a place with high crime despite tight gun laws.

And the rhetoric goes beyond politicians. The right-wing site Breitbart has on many occasions posted articles with headlines containing the phrase ""gun-controlled Chicago.""

This can sound like a potent talking point — it is a huge city with a notorious crime problem, which Trump already used regularly to talk about creating law and order. It also packs the added rhetorical punch of being closely linked to President Obama, whose actions Trump has worked hard to undo.

But while gun violence in Chicago is high, the rest of this common talking point doesn't really hold water.

High crime and tough gun laws

It's also true that there were more than 4,000 shooting victims in Chicago in 2016. It's also true that Chicago has suffered a massive amount of gun crime recently. In 2016, homicides in Chicago sharply rose, mostly as a result of gun homicides, as the University of Chicago crime lab found in a January report.

Gun homicides in the city rose by 61 percent between 2015 and 2016. That helped make the gun homicide rate in Chicago particularly huge compared to other similar cities. The rate was 25.1 per 100,000 residents in 2016, compared to 14.7 in Philadelphia and just 2.3 in New York.

It also had a relatively high number of guns recovered — 243 per 100,000 residents. That's roughly on par with Philadelphia and much higher than Los Angeles or New York.

But it's not true that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the country, as other fact checkers have also repeatedly found.

It is true that Illinois has tougher gun laws than many other states. The state is one of seven that requires licenses or permits to buy any firearm, and it's one of five that requires waiting periods for buying any firearm. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks gun laws nationwide, has given the state a B+ for its gun laws.

Chicago itself has some tough laws — there is an assault-weapons ban in Cook County, for example. But it's not true that Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country. At one point, it did have much tougher laws — it had banned handguns in the city limits, but a 2008 Supreme Court ruling declared that ban unconstitutional, and a 2010 ruling reaffirmed that. The city also had had a gun registry program since 1968, but ended it in 2013 when the state passed a law allowing the concealed carry of weapons.

""We generally think of California as having the strongest gun laws in the country,"" said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The whole state's laws are pretty strong.""

The center has given California an A rating and ranks it No. 1 in terms of the tightness of its gun laws. California bans the open carry of guns and requires background checks on private firearm sales, among other things.

""Some cities go even beyond that,"" Shearer added. ""San Francisco has a safe storage law, requiring that guns kept in the home are kept locked.""

That's a regulation that Chicago, for example, does not have.

Quibbling over exactly what part of the U.S. is No. 1 in terms of gun-law strictness, however, isn't the most compelling part of Sanders' statement. She also said that having gun regulations ""certainly hasn't helped"" in Chicago.

That's a much more controversial claim — and it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

State lines don't stop guns

It's important to remember here that Chicago is very close to two states that have relatively weak gun laws: Wisconsin and Indiana. So while it's easy to pick on Chicago (or any other high-crime city) for its ugly statistics, says one expert, taking bordering states into account weakens this gun-advocacy talking point.

""It's not a scientific study. It's an anecdote,"" said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University. ""They might have pointed to Washington, D.C., back in the days when D.C. banned handguns and yet had high gun-violence rates. Those bans are only at best partially effective, because the borders are permeable.""

D.C. borders Virginia, which does not have strong gun laws. (It gets a D from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.)

Neither Wisconsin nor Indiana requires licenses or permits to purchase a gun, for example, nor do they require waiting periods. While Illinois has that B+ rating from the law center, Wisconsin has a C- and Indiana a D-.

And there's good evidence that being next-door to those states keeps Chicago criminals well-supplied with guns. A 2015 study of guns in Chicago, co-authored by Cook, found that more than 60 percent of new guns used in Chicago gang-related crimes and 31.6 percent used in non-gang-related crimes between 2009 and 2013 were bought in other states. Indiana was a particularly heavy supplier, providing nearly one-third of the gang guns and nearly one-fifth of the non-gang guns.

Other evidence corroborates this — a 2014 Chicago Police Department report found that Indiana accounted for 19 percent of all guns recovered by the department between 2009 and 2013.

New firearms trace data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released last week likewise shows that Illinois as a whole faces a massive influx of guns. Of around 8,700 firearms recovered in Illinois and for which the bureau found a source state, more than half came from out of state — 1,366, nearly 16 percent, came from Indiana alone.

By comparison, 82 percent of guns recovered in Indiana and traced were from within Indiana, suggesting that criminals in that state don't have to cross state lines, like those in Illinois, to get their weapons.

All of this might suggest that criminals will just go to whatever lengths necessary get their hands on guns, regardless of whatever laws are in place.

But that's the wrong way to think about it, Cook said.

""No one's in a position to say that Chicago's various special regulations and Illinois's regulations are doing no good,"" he said, ""because we don't know what the homicide rate would be in the absence of those.

1791: The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is ratified. The amendment reads: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""

1871: The National Rifle Association was formed by Union Army veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate.

1934: The National Firearms Act passes in response to gangster culture during Prohibition. The law implements a tax on the making and transfer of automatic-fire guns, shotguns and rifles.

1939: Supreme Court upholds a federal ban on sawed-off shotguns, implying that the Founding Fathers adopted the amendment to ensure the then-new federal government could not disarm state militias.

1968: Congress passes the Gun Control Act. The law calls for better control of interstate traffic of firearms. Lee Harvey Oswald used a mail-order gun to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.

1976 D.C. City Council bars residents from owning handguns.

1986: The Firearm Owner's Protection Act is approved by Congress. The law prohibits felons from owning or possessing guns or ammunition. The Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act is also passed.

Each year more than 32,000 people die in the United States as a result of suicides, homicides and accidents with firearms.

For years doctors have tried to reduce the toll by addressing gun injuries and deaths as a public health issue; there's ample evidence that ease of access to is linked to the number of suicides and homicides. But those efforts haven't gained much traction.

On Monday, six medical organizations including the American College of Physicians and professional societies for surgeons, family doctors, obstetricians and gynecologists, pediatricians and emergency physicians joined with the American Public Health Association and the American Bar Association in a ""call to action"" aimed at reducing the health consequences of firearms. Shots talked with Dr. Steven Weinberger, executive vice president and CEO of the American College of Physicians and leader of the effort, on what the doctors hope to change. This is an edited version of the conversation.

Your top priority is expanding criminal background checks to cover all firearm purchases. Why is that so important?

Right now there are loopholes in the background checks and there are certainly quite a few people who end up purchasing firearms through those loopholes, whether through private sales from an individual or gun show sales. All of a sudden the background checks are no longer effective. We feel that should be a universal requirement.

But you're also worried about laws that require doctors to report people who have mental health or substance abuse problems; some states bar them from buying or owning firearms. Why is that?

This is the tricky one. There needs to be better access to mental health care in the United States, I think there's no question about that. People who get adequate treatment are less likely to commit acts of violence. But if reporting of all people with mental health and substance abuse disorders is made a requirement, then people have a disincentive to seek care. We feel this has to be done on a case-by-case basis, not merely based on the presence of a mental or substance abuse disorder, but whether that person is at risk of doing harm to himself or herself or to others.

The paper says that private ownership of assault weapons represents a ""grave danger to the public"" and you want tighter restrictions on their use. How did you decide on that?

The tricky thing was how to define these particular types of firearms. We chose ""military"" type. We know gun manufacturers have done all sorts of things to get around those requirements in the past. It's relatively easy for the general public to say this is a military-style assault weapon in terms of the appearance and the magazine capacity. We really don't see any need for civilian use for those types of weapons or ammunition. And they have been of major import in mass shootings. So we feel it's critical to eliminate private use of those.

Obviously the gun lobby has been against anything at all that has any sort of restrictions on firearms or the type of person who can use firearms. Our hope is that there may be some ability to move this forward since we have the American Bar Association on this with us. We can speak to the medical and public health issues on this, but we are not constitutional law scholars. They have confirmed that these recommendations are constitutionally sound.

Some states have attempted ""gag laws"" that bar doctors from talking with patients or parents about gun safety or asking them if they have firearms in the house. As doctors you think this is a very bad idea. Why?

This is something that unfortunately comes up all the time. The idea that a pediatrician can't be speaking with a patient about the issue of firearm safety and whether there's a firearm in the home is really problematic. It does violate First Amendment rights, but beyond that it interferes with the physician-patient relationship in a really inappropriate way. With the things we've seen with a child going into a mother's pocketbook and pulling out a gun and shooting someone, it's tragic and it's unconscionable.

Doctors have been fighting this battle for years and not making much progress, frankly. It's got to be frustrating.

It is frustrating. One of the other authors on the report said that the number of people who are killed with firearms is the equivalent of a 747 going down with all its passengers once a week throughout the year. If we saw that would there be public uproar.

And these are preventable deaths. Homicides and suicides are things we can control. Obviously we recognize that this is an uphill battle. But it's such an important public health issue, we can't give up on it."

Facebook and a top Republican Senator have responded to allegations from the tech website Gizmodo that Facebook is suppressing ideologically conservative news or stories from conservative organizations from its ""trending topics"" column.

According to an article Gizmodo published on Monday, Facebook wasn't just relying on algorithms to determine which stories made it onto the list of developing news on the right-hand side of its homepage. The article alleged that contracted employees called ""human curators"" helped decide what stories appeared, and that it ""often depended on the taste of individual supervisors — some of whom were said to favor liberal causes such as Black Lives Matter,"" reports NPR's David Folkenflik for All Things Considered.

The article, citing several unnamed former curators, said some stories in which conservatives may have more interest were passed over.

It said that some of the topics that the curators suppressed included ""former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately scrutinizing conservative groups; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report; Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was murdered in 2013; and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder.""

The Gizmodo report adds that some former curators said they were ""instructed to artificially 'inject' selected stories into the trending news module, even if they weren't popular enough to warrant inclusion — or in some cases weren't trending at all.""

Some of these topics included the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, the article said, also citing Black Lives Matter and the conflict in Syria as other subjects that former curators said were ""injected"" into the module.

In a rebuttal Monday night, Facebook's Tom Stocky, who is in charge of the trending topics section, denied the report's allegations and said the company has ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true.""

""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers,"" he wrote, adding that the company ""does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin."" He added:

""There have been other anonymous allegations — for instance that we artificially forced ‪#‎BlackLivesMatter‬ to trend. We looked into that charge and found that it is untrue. We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so.""

With more than one billion users a day, Facebook has become indispensable to many news organizations, David reports. He says, for example, that nearly 5 million people have ""liked"" NPR's Facebook page, and are therefore directed to NPR content. He also adds that Facebook has recently started paying NPR and other news organizations to produce live video streams for the tech giant's new foray into live video, which the company calls Facebook Live. Facebook has no say over the content of NPR's live videos. (For more information on the arrangement, read this post from NPR's ombudsman Elizabeth Jensen.)

For Facebook detractors, Facebook's bid to expand the social media platform's influence using video makes the allegations regarding the company's methods for sorting trending topics even more problematic.

""With 167 million US Facebook users reading stories highlighted in the trending section, Facebook has the power to greatly influence the presidential election,"" the Republican Party said in a statement Monday. ""It is beyond disturbing to learn that this power is being used to silence view points and stories that don't fit someone else's agenda.""

On Tuesday, Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee John Thune of South Dakota also weighed in.

""Facebook must answer these serious allegations and hold those responsible to account if there has been political bias in the dissemination of trending news,"" Thune said in a statement, according to The Hill. ""Any attempt by a neutral and inclusive social media platform to censor or manipulate political discussion is an abuse of trust and inconsistent with the values of an open Internet.""

David reports that on Tuesday afternoon, Facebook told NPR that it will review its practices more deeply and address the Senator's questions."

A North Carolina man who fired an AR-15 rifle inside a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., last year as he was ""investigating"" a baseless conspiracy theory has been sentenced to four years in prison.

Edgar Maddison Welch pleaded guilty in March to federal charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and transporting a firearm over state lines. The case is seen as a clear example of the potential real-world consequences of fake news stories.

During the sentencing hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson stressed that Welch's actions ""literally left psychological wreckage,"" The Associated Press reported.

The unfounded ""Pizzagate"" Internet rumor at the center of this case accused the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria of being the home of a Satanic child sex abuse ring involving top Democrats such as Hillary Clinton. ""Speculation and fabrications tied to the bizarre conspiracy theory have been relentlessly circulated by politically motivated fringe sites,"" as The Two-Way has reported.

Welch heard about the conspiracy theory last December and spent three days reading about it and watching videos, according to a statement that was part of his plea agreement. He then decided to go investigate the matter himself.

""The defendant then took it upon himself to act in what he believed would be a violent confrontation at the restaurant,"" the statement reads. Welch unsuccessfully attempted to try to persuade friends to join him. He said he believed it would involve ""sacraficing [sic] the lives of a few for the lives of many,"" according to court documents.

Welch then drove to Washington and entered Comet Ping Pong, where numerous children were present. He was brandishing the 3-foot-long rifle and had a loaded revolver in a holster on his hip. Employees and clients fled the pizzeria while Welch looked around the restaurant and moved furniture.

He terrified an employee who inadvertently returned to the restaurant during his ""investigation,"" briefly pointing a gun at him before the employee ran for his life. Welch also shot through the lock of a closet, damaging a computer. Nobody was injured, and he ultimately surrendered to the police.

In court documents, prosecutors said they were seeking a sentence of four and a half years, while Welch's defense had requested a sentence of one and a half years.

In a letter to the court, Welch stated that he was ""truly sorry for endangering the safety of any and all bystanders who were present that day."" He claimed that he ""came to D.C. with the intent of helping people.""

Comet Ping Pong advertises itself as a ""hipster-heavy pizza parlor"" that features ""table tennis galore."" Its owner, James Alefantis, told NPR in December that the conspiracy theory has been difficult for the restaurant, calling it ""an insanely complicated, made-up, fictional lie-based story"" and a ""coordinated political attack."""

The Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident who exchanged gunfire with the suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at a church insists he is not a hero, saying that he was ""scared to death"" during the encounter.

""I think my God, my Lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done,"" Stephen Willeford, a former National Rifle Association instructor, tells KHBS/KHOG television in Arkansas.

Willeford says his daughter alerted him to what sounded like shots being fired at the nearby First Baptist Church. That is when, he said, he got his rifle out of his safe.

""I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots — just 'pop pop pop pop' and I knew every one of those shots represented someone, that it was aimed at someone, that they weren't just random shots,"" Willeford said.

""I was scared to death, I was,"" a visibly shaken Willeford told the television station. ""I was scared for me. I was scared for every one of them and I was scared for my own family that lived less than a block away.""

Willeford said he loaded a magazine in his rifle and ran across the street without even taking the time to put on his shoes.

When he saw the suspect, identified by police as Devin Patrick Kelley, the two exchanged gunfire.

""He saw me and I saw him,"" Willeford said. ""I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover.""

""I know I hit him,"" Willeford said. ""He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again.""

Kelley was reportedly wearing tactical gear and wielding a variant of the AR-15 rifle.

When the gunman sped away, Willeford saw a pickup truck and quickly explained the situation to the driver, later identified as Johnnie Langendorff, and the two set off on a high-speed chase to run down the attacker.

Langendorff told KSAT that Willeford ""came to my vehicle in distress with his weapon"" and said "" 'we need to pursue him. He just shot up the church.' ""

Langendorff said he and the other man pursued the shooter at high speed before Kelley appeared to lose control and go off the road. ""The other gentleman jumped out and had his rifle on him and he didn't move after that,"" Langendorff told the TV station.

Kelley's vehicle, a truck, hit a road sign and flipped before landing in a ditch, KHBS/KHOG says. Willeford says he put his rifle on the top of the truck and yelled to the suspect: ""Get out of the truck, get out of the truck"" but never saw any movement until law enforcement arrived a few minutes later.

Freeman Martin, regional director of the state's Department of Public Safety, said the cause of Kelley's death had not been determined. ""However, investigators found evidence at the scene that indicates the subject may have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound."""

Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the debate over gun control has been reignited. Many have said that if there is going to be any action on gun control, law-abiding, responsible gun owners will need to be a part of the conversation. Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep talks to Steven Rinella, a writer and avid hunter, about how he views the current debate.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

The events in Newtown have put gun violence high on the minds of many Americans. Last week, President Obama called for new gun control measures, and he said he hopes gun owners support him.

A Pew Research Center poll taken after the Newtown shootings shows that 65 percent of gun owners still believe it's more important to protect gun rights than to control gun ownership.

Steve Rinella, an author and lifelong hunter, has been watching closely as this debate has been reignited. He spoke with our colleague Steve Inskeep.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

If we talked about the time before the Newtown, Connecticut shooting, where did you stand before that shooting on gun control?

STEVE RINELLA: Before the shooting, I stood on gun control where I've stood on gun control for my whole life. And my understanding of gun ownership was formed as a very young child. I grew up in a home with guns. I was taught to use them at a young age.

INSKEEP: Mm-hmm.

RINELLA: My father was very strict about handling them, what were appropriate uses for guns. I own guns now. I know how to use them. I was brought up knowing that I could use them to feed myself, and I do that now. I could use them to defend myself. And it was never something to be ashamed of. It was a responsibility to be proud of.

INSKEEP: What weapons do you own?

RINELLA: I own a lot of hunting weapons now. I use bolt-action rifles...

INSKEEP: Mm-hmm.

RINELLA: ...and I use pump-action shotguns.

INSKEEP: OK.

RINELLA: But I don't own a lot of the types of weapons that are being discussed right now.

INSKEEP: You don't own an AR-15, for example.

RINELLA: No, I don't. I've never been interested in them. But at the same time, I'm a member of the National Rifle Association, because I do have concerns that I want to safeguard. I have family in Montana and Alaska. I travel to those places to hunt.

Now, if someone were to come forth and say, you know, we've decided that it's a bad idea that American citizens can move from state to state with firearms, I know that the NRA would notify me of that risk, and they would defend my rights in that sense. So when I joined the NRA, it's not that I'm necessarily joining the NRA to help safeguard a particular high-capacity weapon that I own. It's I trust them to generally ensure and look out for my Second Amendment rights.

INSKEEP: Let me just ask you, as a hunter who has spent time with a lot of other hunters: When the subject does narrow down to assault weapons, as happened in the '90s and as seems to be happening again, and we do have some kind of definition of an assault weapon as a weapon where you can quickly fire a lot of shots.

RINELLA: Yeah.

INSKEEP: What kind of conversations do hunters have about those? Do people say, man, I use that? Do people say, I don't use that, but I want anybody else to be able to use that? What do they say?

RINELLA: Well, let me say this: I hunt year-round. I don't hunt - personally, I don't hunt with one guy who hunts with an AR-type rifle.

INSKEEP: All right.

RINELLA: I know guys that do. I don't have any desire to do it, because for me, like, culturally, like, my definition of a hunting rifle is fixed on a specific image. And I would say the guys that I hunt with feel the same way. But, again, we know that there are vulnerabilities that we have, you know, that we have the ability to drive around to our hunting locations with firearms, to fly in airplanes with firearms. So we have a sympathy or empathy for other gun owners who are feeling the same way. But, with all that said, I'll tell you, I just got a text message the other day from my brother who basically announced to me that he just made a radical departure from his own viewpoint and is rethinking this whole issue in light of the recent shooting. So I can't speak to how many hunters are feeling that way.

INSKEEP: You know, I want to ask another question, because Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association held a press conference on Friday in which he proposed that there ought to be armed guards, armed police officers in every school in America. And that hits an interesting philosophical divide. There's the old saying that an armed society is a polite society, that if there are more guns around, it can actually be more peaceful. The flip side of that is the idea that the more guns are around, the more likely it is that someone is eventually going to fire a gun. I wonder what your instinct is there.

RINELLA: Well, what he said, I expect what came out of the NRA press conference to be, like, widely lampooned in the media. But I'll tell you this: I have two young children, OK. I have a two-and-a-half-year-old son. I have a week-old daughter. They're not in school yet. When I imagine forward to when they do begin school and I think about their safety, would I feel better about their safety knowing that there was an assault weapon ban possibly in the future? Or would I feel better about or more secure in their safety knowing that they were going to go to a school that had a similar type of armed guard presence that you'd find at a sporting event, that you'd find in a bank? I would feel better about them going to school where they were protected by armed guards.

That, to me, seems concrete and tangible, and it addresses whatever persons that might want to attack children, whatever their motivations are, whatever their capabilities are, however they decide to go about doing it, it would present a level of safety - if I was selecting a school for my kids.

INSKEEP: Is it fair to say that the Newtown, Connecticut shooting, as awful as it was, has not really changed your thinking about guns and gun control, or at least has not yet changed your thinking?

RINELLA: Steve, I'll tell you honestly - and this is a bold statement, because, like I said earlier, we have a new daughter in our home - I've thought about these issues every hour of every day since that happened, all right. I don't know where I'm going to come down in the end. I've thought about them every day, and it's weighing on my mind heavily. In a year, if we talk, I might tell you where I landed, but right now, my mind is a whirlwind.

Audie Cornish talks to Shawn Harris of Conflict Arms Research about how the Islamic State militants acquire weapons. Harris embedded with Kurdish troops in order to trace weapons from the battlefield.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

One concern critics of the plan to support moderate rebels have raised in the past - whether weapons meant to fight ISIS could in up in the hands of ISIS. A group called Conflict Armament Research traces weapons in warzones and is studying arms used by ISIS. An investigator with the group, Shawn Harris, recently embedded with Kurdish troops fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. He says they've already come across some U.S.-made weapons on the battlefield.

SHAWN HARRIS: Yeah, we encountered a number of M-16A4s and an AR-15, which is actually a civilian rifle, but we did come across American-made weaponry.

CORNISH: So help us understand how you work exactly. Is it you're traveling with these local troops as they fight ISIS and then you pick stuff up or - how do you trace it?

HARRIS: With the Kurdish troops, what we do is we'll usually be based in the larger city that's safe, and there's not a lot of ISIS movement. And then the troops will notify us when they have captured something and will go in and document the weapons afterwards in a safe and secure location.

CORNISH: Walk us through the process of tracing the weapon. When you pick up an individual weapon, what are you looking for?

HARRIS: First we're looking for individual, unique markings and serial numbers, and so what we'll do is we'll take pictures of the entire weapon. Also there's little stamps, sometimes little symbols and whatnot, that'll tell you certain customs markings, or it'll tell you which component was made in which factory.

CORNISH: And we should mention there were several countries - right? - that you were able to trace weapons back to.

HARRIS: In terms of manufacturing, yes. However the tracing process goes much further than just getting the serial number and say, OK, well, it was made in China. That's all fine and good, but who did they sell it to, and then who did they sell it to? And then at what point did that weapon become an illicit weapon or basically fall off a truck or, you know, loose a receipt?

CORNISH: I think the question most people will have listening to this is, how do we know how ISIS got a hold of these weapons, especially in the case of U.S. weapons? Is there any way for you to determine that?

HARRIS: In terms of the U.S.-made weapons, the best guess we have right now is that they acquired it when they routed the Iraqi security forces back in June. There's no way to verify that. We know that the weapons have property of U.S. government stamped on them, but we can't really speak to the countries that are the intermediaries at this point. That's going to be in a few months or six months when we're able to actually track down the paperwork which actually takes longer than finding the weapon itself.

CORNISH: Now, besides military assault rifles that you might expect to find in a conflict zone, you found some more exotic weaponry, like anti-tank rockets. What have you been able to learn about those?

HARRIS: Again out best guess before the tracing requests come in is that the M79 rockets that we found were transferred from Saudi Arabia to the Free Syrian Army. There was a previous report about a large shipment of M79s to the Free Syrian Army to fight Assad in 2013, and so they matched the profile.

CORNISH: Based on what you've seen, is there any way to understand the scale of weaponry that ISIS has access to or the amount that it's captured that can be sourced back to the U.S.? I mean is there any way to know kind of what is out there in the battlefield?

HARRIS: It's a very good question, and it's very difficult to be able to tell because these captures that we do are the weapons that were left behind a lot of times. Sometimes they were forced to leave it because they had to move quickly, you know. A lot of the times, they're able to pick up the best stuff and take it with them. The variety of different calibers tells us that they have a pretty wide range of weaponry, and so it's not simply just a bunch of rebels with AK-47s. They have what could be called professional armies - set of ammunitions.

CORNISH: In the end, based on what you've seen, how confident could the U.S. be that any weapons that come into the region - no matter who they're intended for, won't end up in the hands of ISIS?

HARRIS: Well, every conflict has the element of arms changing hands. You know, when one group will win a battle with another group, they will take their food, they will take their trucks and their weapons. There's always that risk, you know, in terms of strategic policy. That's something that we don't want to comment on because that's not our area of expertise. But there are - we can say that there are American-made weapons in the hands of ISIS and that has given them an advantage.

CORNISH: That's Shawn Harris; he's a field investigator with Conflict Armament Research. He's investigating the weapons used in Syria and Iraq by ISIS. Thank you so much for coming to speak with us.

HARRIS: Thank you so much.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images

A Connecticut judge has ruled that a lawsuit against the manufacturer and seller of the weapon used in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 can proceed.

The gun companies had sought to dismiss the lawsuit filed by nine victims' families and a survivor, which names Remington Arms, maker of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle, model XM15-E2S; as well as the distributor and seller.

Gunman Adam Lanza used the firearm to kill 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Conn.

Katie Toth of NPR member station WSHU reports that Thursday's ruling ""is a victory for the survivors and families of shooting victims who filed the lawsuit.""

She says lawyers for the gun companies had pointed ""to a federal law that prevents certain lawsuits against gun makers when those guns are used in a crime."" But Toth notes, ""The companies could still try to get the lawsuit thrown out based on the merits of the case.""

Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis ruled that the law ""does not prevent lawyers for the families of Sandy Hook victims from arguing that the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle is a military weapon and should not have been sold to civilians,"" The Associated Press reports.

As the Two-Way reported in February:

""The lawsuit was initially filed in state court in Connecticut in December of 2014, two years after 20 children and six adults were gunned down at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn. It then went to a federal court before being shifted back to a state court last fall, in what's seen as a possible advantage for the plaintiffs, who are acting on behalf of 10 victims.""

The lawsuit, we reported, ""seeks damages and an injunction against selling the AR-15 rifle.""

Now that the case has been cleared to move forward, both sides are due back in court on Tuesday."

Updated at 10:50 p.m. ET on Friday

In the shooting Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, 17 people were killed. Three were on the staff as coaches or teachers; 14 were students. On Thursday afternoon, the Broward Sheriff's Office identified them.

Here are their names.

Alyssa Alhadeff

Alyssa was 14. In a Facebook post, her mother said Alyssa was a talented soccer player and creative writer and had an amazing personality, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

She was remembered at a funeral service and burial this morning in North Lauderdale, Fla. Some 400 people gathered for the service, spilling out onto the sidewalk, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

""I wish I could have taken those bullets for you, Alyssa,"" her mother Lori Alhadeff said at the funeral, according to the Miami Herald. ""I would have protected you.""

""This has changed our entire community forever,"" said Rabbi Goodnick at the beginning of the service, the Herald reported. ""It's not just a loss to our community. It's a loss to humanity as a whole. Parents aren't supposed to send their child to school, like so many of you did today, thinking that they may never come home.""

At a vigil on Thursday night, teammate Madison Ciccone said that Alyssa had started the season on the J.V. soccer team, but by the end had been called up to varsity.

""She was ecstatic [when she was called up],"" Ciccone told the Sun-Sentinel. ""It's an amazing feeling being a freshman on varsity.""

The summer camp she attended in northern Georgia also shared the news of her death. ""May Alyssa's memory forever be for a blessing,"" Camp Coleman posted.

Yesterday, Lori Alhadeff issued an emotional challenge to President Trump.

""I just spent the last two hours putting the funeral arrangements for my daughter's funeral, who's 14,"" Lori Alhadeff said in an interview on CNN. ""President Trump, please do something. Do something! Action! We need it now! These kids need safety now!""

Scott Beigel

Beigel, 35, was a geography teacher and the school's cross-country coach.

He was killed after he unlocked a door to allow students in to hide from the shooter, according to the Sun-Sentinel:

""Stoneman Douglas student Kelsey Friend said in an interview with ABC's Good Morning America that Beigel saved her life. "" 'He unlocked the door and let us in,' Friend said. 'I had thought he was behind me, but he wasn't. When he opened the door, he had to re-lock it so we could stay safe, but he didn't get the chance to.' "" 'He was in the doorway and the door was still open and the shooter probably didn't know we were in there because he was lying on the floor. If the shooter had come in the room, I probably wouldn't be [alive].' ""

""Mr. Beigel was my hero, and he still forever will be my hero,"" Friend told CNN. ""I will never forget the actions that he took for me and for fellow students in the classroom.

""If his family is watching this,"" she said through tears, ""please know that your son or your brother was an amazing person and I'm alive today because of him. Thank you for bringing and having this amazing person in life, and giving him the power to be stronger than I could have ever been. ... I will not let this shooting go down as another one.""

Martin Duque Anguiano

Martin, 14, was a freshman at the school, according to the Miami Herald.

""Words can not describe my pain,"" his brother Miguel wrote on Instragram. ""I love brother Martin you'll be missed buddy. I know you're in a better place. Duques forever man I love you junior!!! R.I.P Martin Duque!""

In a GoFundMe solicitation to raise funds for his brother's funeral, Miguel wrote, ""He was a very funny kid, outgoing and sometimes really quiet. He was sweet and caring and loved by all his family. Most of all he was my baby brother. My family and I have no words to describe the event that has happened on this date, all my prayers to the lost ones. My family and I will appreciate anything that we can get helped with. R.I.P Martin Duque.""

Nicholas Dworet

Nicholas, 17, was a senior at the school with Olympic ambitions.

Andre Bailey, head coach at Dworet's swim club, told The Indianapolis Star that the swimmer made huge strides in his life in the last 18 months: working hard at school and in the pool.

Nicholas had just earned an academic scholarship to the University of Indianapolis and had committed to its swim team in the fall.

""I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, he just took his life in his hands and he chiseled and molded his life,"" Bailey told the Star:

"" 'This is a kid who went from middle of the pack last year to being just lights out,' Bailey said. 'He helped put our program on the map.' ""Nicholas was a team captain known as the 'swim daddy' for the way he helped teammates train and practice. "" 'Everybody loved him,' Bailey said.""

The Miami Herald reports that Nicholas was just making a name for himself as a state-ranked swimmer.

Dworet was one of the top short-distance high school swimmers in Broward County over the past two years and had success at the state level as well. He finished fifth in November at the Class 4A state swimming and diving championships in the 100-yard freestyle in a personal-best time of 46.53 seconds, according to his College Swimming profile. The Miami Herald named him as a third-team All-County swimmer this season. ""'He dreamed of making the Olympic swim team and going to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo,"" the Dworet family wrote in a statement posted to father Mitchell Dworet's Facebook page Friday morning. ""He believed he could accomplish anything as long as he tried his best.'""

Aaron Feis

Feis, 37, graduated from Douglas High School in 1999 and had been an assistant football coach at the school since 2002, the ­Sun-Sentinel reported. He had worked as a security guard at the school for at least eight years.

Now he's being heralded as a hero.

He reportedly died from wounds he sustained while shielding students from bullets.

""He was a great guy,"" sophomore Douglas lineman Gage Gaynor told the Sun-Sentinel. ""Everyone loved him. Shame he had to go like this. Always gave his all to making us better. Definitely learned a lot from him.""

When he heard the gunshots, Feis — along with Chris Hixon — raced to the scene in a golfcart. He told football coach Willis May, ""That was no firecracker.""

Broward Sheriff Scott Israel told the Miami Herald that the stories about Feis' response fit his character.

""'I don't know about the incident yet or what actually his performance was, but I know Aaron personally. I coached with him. My two boys played for him,'"" Israel said. ""'I don't know when Aaron's funeral is, I don't know how many adults are going to go, but you'll get 2,000 kids there. The kids in this community loved him. They adored him. He was a phenomenal man.'""

Feis is survived by his wife, Melissa, and a young daughter.

Jamie Guttenberg

Jamie was 14.

""My heart is broken,"" her father, Fred Guttenberg, wrote on Facebook, according to the Miami Herald. ""Yesterday, Jennifer Bloom Guttenberg and I lost our baby girl to a violent shooting at her school. We lost our daughter and my son Jesse Guttenberg lost his sister. I am broken as I write this trying to figure out how my family get's through this. ... Hugs to all and hold your children tight.""

Speaking at a candlelight vigil held Thursday night, Fred Guttenberg spoke of Jamie in a moving tribute: ""I sent her to school yesterday, and she was supposed to be safe,"" he said choking back tears. ""My job is to protect my children, and I sent my kid to school.""

Chris Hixon

Hixon, 49, was fatally injured after he raced to the scene of the shooting to try to help students, the school's head football coach told NPR.

Hixon was the wrestling coach, along with his role as athletic director. ""It's hard to be AD and a coach but he did it because he just loved it so much,"" says Willis May Jr. Hixon loved being with the students — ""he'd get out there and wrestle with them."" May described Hixon as a ""great man"" with a ""great sense of humor"" who loved his family. He added that Hixon was very proud of his military background.

Last year, Hixon was named Broward County Athletic Association's athletic director of the year, the newspaper reports.

Jason Stein, athletic director at neighboring Taravella High School, told the Sun-Sentinal that Hixon was survived by his wife and a son with special needs.

""It is devastating,"" Stein told the newspaper. ""His son was with him everywhere. Chris epitomized what an athletic director was all about.""

Luke Hoyer

Luke, 15, was a freshman who played basketball and was an NBA fan — and he was quiet but happy, his cousin Grant Cox told The New York Times.

""I know Luke loved his family,"" Cox said. ""He had a huge heart.""

Luke's aunt, Joan Cox said her nephew was a loving, sweet person who ""smiled all the time, according to the Miami Herald. She also said that Luke's parents, Gena and Thomas Hoyer searched local hospitals for their son before going to the law enforcement command center where they were informed he had died. He was the youngest of three children.

Luke's funeral is scheduled for Feb. 19 at Church of the Glades in Coral Springs.

Cara Loughran

Cara was 14 and loved the beach, according to the Times.

""We are absolutely gutted,"" her aunt, Lindsay Fontana, wrote in a Facebook post seen by the newspaper. ""While your thoughts are appreciated, I beg you to DO SOMETHING. This should not have happened to our niece Cara and it cannot happen to other people's families.""

Gina Montalto

Gina was 14 and a member of the school marching band's winter guard, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

Joaquin Oliver

Joaquin was 17. He moved with his family to the U.S. from Venezuela when he was 3, the Herald reports.

Friends told the Times that he played basketball in a city rec league and loved to write poetry.

Alaina Petty

Alaina was 14, according to a Facebook post by her church in Coral Springs. It said that another member of the church had been shot twice but was expected to recover.

""It is impossible to sum up all that Alaina was, and meant, to her family & friends,"" the family wrote in a statement to the Herald. ""Alaina was a vibrant and determined young woman, loved by all who knew her.""

She was in the JROTC and helped with a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints cleanup of the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma, the statement said.

Meadow Pollack

Meadow, 18, was a senior who planned to attend Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., in the fall, The Herald reports.

""Everyone should know how great she was,"" her cousin Jake Maisner told the Sun-Sentinel. ""She was a beautiful girl, inside and out.""

More than 1,000 people attended her funeral including Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Reps. Ted Deutch and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and County Commissioner Michael Udine.

Meadow's father yelled in anger at the accused killer at the funeral service held at the Temple K'ol Tikva in Parkland, the Associated Press reports.

""You killed my kid,"" he told the congregation at the funeral. ""'My kid is dead' goes through my head all day and all night. I keep hearing it over and over.""

""This is just unimaginable to think I will never see my princess again,"" her father added. ""This piece of s—- killed my kid, and I wasn't able to do anything about it,"" as quoted by the Sun-Sentinel.

Pollack was the youngest child in her immediate family and of 10 grandchildren, family members told the Sun-Sentinel.

Helena Ramsay

Helena was 17 and headed for college next year, according to her family.

""My family lost an absolutely beautiful member today, due to a senseless school shooting,"" her relative Curtis Page said in a Facebook post.

""Helena was a smart, kind hearted, and thoughtful person. She was deeply loved and loved others even more so. Though she was somewhat reserved, she had a relentless motivation towards her academic studies, and her soft warm demeanor brought the best out in all who knew her,"" he added.

Alex Schachter

Alex, 14, played trombone in the marching band, the Times reports.

His father told the Times that he was ""a sweetheart of a kid"" who ""just wanted to do well and make his parents happy.""

His older brother, also a student at Douglas, survived the shooting.

Carmen Schentrup

Carmen, 16, was a standout student. In September she was named a National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.

Peter Wang

Peter, 15, was in the [J]ROTC program, according to the Herald. His cousin told the newspaper that Peter was in study hall when the shooting began and that he had been holding a door so others could escape.

His family reportedly owned a Chinese restaurant and was preparing to celebrate Chinese New Year on Thursday."

Around the U.S., a worsening heroin epidemic has more and more cities turning to the anti-overdose drug naloxone to reduce deaths from abuse. Also known as Narcan, the medication blocks the effects of opioids and reverses the respiratory depression that occurs during an overdose.

Baltimore recently stepped up its naloxone training, focusing on drug users, and their families and friends. So far this year, city health workers have taught nearly 4,400 people how to use naloxone. That's more than quadruple the number trained in 2014.

A big concern for Baltimore and other cities is the price of naloxone, which has risen dramatically as demand has gone up. In February, the Baltimore City Health Department was paying about $20 a dose. By July, the price had climbed to nearly $40 a dose.

Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, places the blame squarely on the manufacturers and, in particular, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, the company that makes the naloxone most widely used by health departments and police.

""When drug companies increase their prices and charge exorbitant rates, they decrease the access to the drug,"" Cummings said this summer. ""There's something awfully wrong with that picture.""

Amphastar says it raised prices because of increased manufacturing costs, including a rise in the prices of raw materials, energy and labor.

Naloxone isn't a new drug. It was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1971 as an injectable medication, used primarily in hospital settings.

Today, Baltimore and other cities are choosing intranasal naloxone for community use — naloxone that can be sprayed into the nostril and doesn't require needles. The intranasal delivery method isn't explicitly approved by the FDA. Amphastar is currently the only company that makes naloxone in a dosage that can be administered that way.

Daniel Raymond is policy director for the Harm Reduction Coalition, which advocates for broader access to naloxone. He discussed naloxone pricing over the years, the changing market for the drug and what it means for prices and competition. Here are highlights, edited for length and clarity, from a conversation with All Things Considered's Audie Cornish.

On the price of naloxone a decade ago

When we started following this issue, it was over 10 years ago, and for the injectable naloxone it was about a dollar a shot. Each vial was dirt cheap. So it's been a really dramatic increase over a fairly short period of time.

On how the market for naloxone has changed

Emergency rooms have traditionally been the main purchasers of naloxone. It's also used by anesthesiologists, and it's been used on some ambulances. So it was typically a hospital market. The hospital would buy in bulk, and there wasn't a whole lot of prescribing going on.

Now we've got over 40 states that have passed laws facilitating access to naloxone, and have first responders carrying it and community distribution. That's the majority of the country that's moving in this direction of making naloxone more accessible.

On intranasal naloxone and potential new competitors

Amphastar is currently the only manufacturer in the U.S. who makes the dosage of naloxone used for intranasal administration. They have no competition. They can set whatever price they want, and almost a year ago, they decided to almost double that price. It's hitting programs and health departments and first responders across the country really hard.

There are a couple companies that saw the need for an FDA-approved intranasal naloxone device. They've designed new devices that they've submitted to FDA for approval. So, I'm hoping by the end of the year, we'll have one or two other intranasal naloxone devices available. The challenge will be whether these companies decide they want to compete on price, or they just want to take a share of the market.

On Evzio – the naloxone auto-injector

What the makers of Evzio — a company called kaleo — thought about was: Can we make something that your grandmother could use? So they designed this cartridge that's an auto-injector. It actually talks you through the process of reversing an overdose. Now, they needed to do the research to show they had the right dose, to show that people could actually follow the instructions and use it without any training at all. And they needed to do all the manufacturing and assembling. So those R&D costs start to add up. The costs of the production line start to add up. Their gamble was, if they could take the complexity of educating somebody out of the picture, then they could drive more doctors to prescribe this.

On pharmaceutical companies' pricing strategies

I think their choice in front of them is that they can have a narrow market at higher prices, or a much broader market at lower prices. Either way, they're going to making money. The latter way, they're saving more lives.

NPR and All Things Considered will continue reporting from Baltimore in the coming months, checking in with Baltimore Health Commissioner Leana Wen and her team periodically. Stay tuned for future stories."

NPR's Art Silverman reads a lot of crime thrillers. In the last year, he's noticed ""The Internet of Things"" seems to being playing a big role as the weapon of choice.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

For writers of crime fiction, those vulnerabilities in the Internet of things present an opportunity. NPR's Art Silverman realized that when he picked up some of the new books coming into our office.

ART SILVERMAN, BYLINE: Each week, I produce this All Tech Considered segment. It's a lot of work to keep up with the tech world, so when the day's over, I look for an escape. I grab a good book, even a bad book. As long as it's a crime fiction, I'm happy.

But lately, I can't escape. That's because writers are putting technology into their plots. Why should murderers use a gun when they can tamper with a toaster, fiddle with a freezer or pose a threat to a thermometer?

JEFFERY DEAVER: My job really is to scare the socks off my readers.

SILVERMAN: That's Jeffery Deaver. His detective story ""The Steel Kiss"" came out this year. In it, his villain, a man named Vernon Griffith, runs around New York City doing dirty digital deeds like hacking into the controls of an escalator.

Unlike pulling a trigger, which most of us understand, hacking home appliances is a bit complicated, so Deaver occasionally has to stop mid-story to explain to readers what's up. He does that in the voice of the nerd helping the detectives.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEAVER: (Reading) OK, you want to know about the Internet of things. OK, smart products from household lights all the way up to the dangerous ones our boy is using are embedded with wireless connectivity circuits.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SILVERMAN: Despite all these modern-day complications, Deaver says he's still abiding by a rule he set for himself 40 books ago - frighten readers by using the things they deal with every day.

DEAVER: The high-tech elements of the book are really no different from traditional police work, a car chase scene. It simply is another tool of storytelling for me.

SILVERMAN: And those tools do the job. I got chills when the bad guy spooks a young couple by hacking into their baby monitor in ""The Steel Kiss.""

DEAVER: They hear a voice and saying, hi, Honey, how are you doing? Do you want to come live with somebody else? And of course this is on the baby monitor. And the woman drops her phone, races to the door. And it turns out the villain had hacked in as an act of revenge to make the parents feel uncomfortable.

SILVERMAN: That scene really hit home. I've listened through a baby monitor to my grandchild sleeping. All this hacking of the Internet of things in these novels is not over yet. Folks at a website called crimefictionlover.com told me that next summer, be ready for ""Flashmob"" by Christopher Farnsworth and ""The Dark Net"" by Benjamin Percy.

Most crime writers are new to technology, so they have to research everything carefully. But some come from the tech world. Author William Hertling worked for 20 years as a software engineer and was a big reader.

WILLIAM HERTLING: I always loved reading spy thrillers. And of course the spy thrillers of the '80s had a particular set of technology that they worked with. And today, though - right? - what we have to do with computers is completely different. It's a whole other type of game, but it's the same kind of cat-and-mouse game.

SILVERMAN: He says that old spy game was played with miniature cameras and microphones. It's just the tools that have changed. His latest book is ""Kill Process."" A tech expert named Angie uses her skills to exploit smart home devices. She wants to kill men she thinks are abusing their spouses. Here Hertling reads a typical scene.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

HERTLING: (Reading) I go after the furnace, a smart device like every appliance built in last five years. The furnace doesn't possess any protection at all besides the original factory password shared on countless...

SILVERMAN: Hertling takes us step by step as Angie penetrates the system. No need for breaking and entering - just jump over digital hurdles, and Angie is all set to kill.

HERTLING: (Reading) And now the furnace generates copious quantities of carbon monoxide as it also runs the ventilation fans backwards with the cleaning duct open. These three things should never ever happen at the same time, but they are now.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SILVERMAN: A furnace as a weapon - I had to ask William Hertling how much he thought any of this stuff was even possible.

HERTLING: I kind of call it science fiction because I think of myself as a science fiction author. And it wasn't till I finished the book and I thought, well, can I even call this science fiction?

SILVERMAN: Well, that's a great thing. Now I have absolutely nowhere to go to escape from technology, not even in crime fiction.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SHAPIRO: NPR's Art Silverman - he produces All Tech Considered. The authors he spoke with are William Hertling of ""Kill Process"" and Jeffery Deaver of ""The Steel Kiss.""

Donald Trump seems to be running his presidential campaign lately with an old playground adage in mind:

I am rubber. You are glue. Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.

At least, that seemed to be the case at a campaign rally Friday night in Pensacola, Florida. During his speech, several of the more inflammatory attacks lobbed at his opponent appeared to be direct projections of criticisms once aimed at himself.

At the rally, Trump said that the only thing Clinton has done well is keeping herself out of trouble. He was specifically referencing the Department of Justice investigation of Clinton's private email server.

In response to ""lock her up"" chants from the crowd, Trump seemed to veer off his prepared speech.

""Because she is being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart,"" Trump said, ""and she wouldn't be prosecuted.""

That assertion mirrors something the GOP nominee said about himself — one that many people found shocking at the time.

""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters."" Trump said at a campaign event in Sioux Center, Iowa, nearly nine months ago.

Later in Friday's speech, Trump echoed another talking point from the campaign trail. This time, he bent a criticism that's been aimed at him back onto her.

""She's trigger happy,"" Trump said of Clinton. ""Personally I think she's an unstable person.""

Clinton has made the same argument repeatedly about Trump, saying that he is ""temperamentally unfit"" to be president and that his ideas are ""dangerously incoherent.""

""This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes — because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin,"" she said during a June speech on national security.

Trump's projection of criticism of himself onto others has developed into a pattern recently.

This is that Trump projection thing again. https://t.co/1eu9L2cFcd — Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) September 7, 2016

Last week, the GOP candidate criticized Clinton for not providing specific policy details, even though she had released a 288 page book detailing her proposed policies that same day, according to NPR's Tamara Keith. Not providing concrete policy plans is a criticism Clinton often brings up about her opponent.

Late last month, Trump tweeted that Clinton was ""pandering to the worst instincts in our society."" The tweet was in response to a speech Clinton gave that day in which she made a similar criticism about him, saying he ""built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia"" and ""is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.""

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016

For the rest of Friday night in Florida, Trump mostly stayed on his standard messages, both those in line with traditional conservative values and his own lines: he'll build the wall (Mexico will pay) and it wouldn't be so bad to be friendly with Russia.

But he did veer off course one other time, suggesting that he would shoot Iranians circling U.S. destroyers:

""With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,"" Trump told the crowd.

Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs tweeted that this remark, along with the earlier comment that Clinton could shoot someone and not be prosecuted, were both instances when Trump went off teleprompter."

A ticking time bomb. That's what some health officials say the Zika virus is in Southeast Asia.

In the past two weeks, an outbreak in Singapore has climbed from a few dozen cases to nearly 300. ""They're starting to have a situation in Singapore, which is really quite worrying,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said at a recent meeting on Zika at Georgetown University Law Center.

And it's true. Southeast Asia has all the right ingredients for a massive Zika outbreak.

It's home to more than 600 million people. Many are packed into densely populated cities, which often lack mosquito control. And just like Latin America, Southeast Asia has the perfect climate for the mosquitoes that transmit Zika — hot and moist.

""When you go outside in Malaysia, you get bitten everywhere. It's not like in the U.S. Mosquitoes are everywhere!"" says Jamal Sam, a virologist at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.

But there's something hiding in Southeast Asia that may protect the continent's people from Zika. It's in their backyards, their flower pots and birdbaths. And this secret weapon is the exact opposite of what you might expect.

""There's lots of evidence that Zika is already present in Southeast Asia,"" Sam says.

That's right: Zika could protect Asia from Zika.

Scientists first detected the virus in the region in the 1960s. Over the next 50 years, multiple studies found sporadic cases across a massive swath of land — in Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Those studies suggest Zika has been lurking in Asian mosquitoes and possibly infecting people silently, for decades — maybe longer. And that means people in the region may already be immune to Zika.

It's almost like the people are vaccinated, Sam says. ""Because once you get Zika, you probably can't get it again, probably. We don't know for sure, but that's probably true.""

That natural immunity could stop — or temper — potential outbreaks, Sam says.

""It's possible,"" Sam says. ""But it depends on how much immunity we have [in the population]. And those studies haven't really been done.""

Decades ago, a few studies suggested up to 30 percent of Malaysians may have immunity to Zika. But, Sam says, no one really knows about other parts of Southeast Asia. And even that Malaysian percentage is a bit dubious.

""Those studies are old,"" he says. And the tests used back then — and even now — aren't good at differentiating Zika antibodies from those of similar viruses, such as dengue. ""So you get a lot of false positives,"" Sam says.

Of course, Southeast Asia has changed over the past decade in ways that could make Zika outbreaks worse. Many countries have gone through massive development, with cities growing both up and out. Mosquitoes that carry Zika thrive in urban environments.

And the Zika virus itself has also changed over time. Viruses with RNA genes, such as Zika, are known to mutate quickly. Some scientists have worried that Zika has turned into a more dangerous form that causes birth defects

But recent studies suggest that doesn't seem to be the case, says Jasper Chan, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

""We think the Zika virus hasn't mutated that much over the years,"" Chan says. ""We don't see very significant changes, at least, not in the key genes.""

So, he says, the version of Zika in Asia will probably act similarly in people as the one in Latin America. ""Microcephaly, Guillan-Barre and all the other concerns about Zika are still a threat to people in this region"" — unless those people have already been infected with Zika.

So in the end, it's really a mystery about how much of a problem Zika will be in Southeast Asia. ""The virus could spread explosively or not,"" Chan says. ""We'll have to wait and see how the story unfolds."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption General Photographic Agency/Getty Images General Photographic Agency/Getty Images

President Obama has said that the use of chemical weapons could change the U.S. response to the Syrian civil war. But why this focus on chemical weapons when conventional weapons have killed tens of thousands in Syria?

The answer can be traced back to the early uses of poison gas nearly a century ago.

In World War I, trench warfare led to stalemates — and to new weapons meant to break through the lines.

Poisoned gas was described as ""the most feared, the most obscene weapon of all.""

Paul Baumer, the protagonist of Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, recalls some of the horrors associated with gas in World War I: ""We remember the awful sights in the hospital, the gas patients who, suffocating, cough up their burnt lungs in clots. Better to take your chances in the open rather than stay in the hollows and low places where the vapors settle.""

Ban Followed WWI

Despite the horrific injuries, gas caused only a small percentage of the war deaths. But as Greg Thielmann of the Arms Control Association notes, it left a frightening legacy in the form of a million survivors.

""[That] meant painful lung diseases, a lot of people blind for the rest of their lives,"" he says. ""That meant, for example, in America, there were tens of thousands of people who were scarred by exposure to mustard agent in World War I.""

Reaction to those deaths and injuries was swift. By 1925, the League of Nations had approved the Geneva Protocol, which banned the use of chemical weapons.

In World War II, their use was extremely limited. Adolf Hitler, himself a victim of gas in World War I, never used his stockpiles on the battlefield.

But during the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union produced massive quantities of chemical and biological weapons. The end of the Soviet Union paved the way for a historic step: the 1993 treaty that banned the production, stockpiling and use of these weapons.

""We have now verified the destruction of about 80 percent of all the chemical weapons stockpiles that have been declared to us,"" says Michael Luhan, spokesman for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which oversees enforcement of the treaty.

Possible War Crime

But that success has not removed chemical weapons from the list of global threats. A century after their first use, these weapons still have the power to terrify, in part because civilian populations are so vulnerable.

Thielmann, who worked in the State Department for decades, points out that militaries have learned how to shield their troops with protective gear.

""And what that meant is that the main victims of chemical weapons in modern war are those who were not so equipped, which means mostly civilians,"" he says.

Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association says the use of chemical weapons in Syria could constitute a war crime — especially if used deliberately against civilians. He says Syrian commanders on the ground should take note.

""Those that do not cooperate in any orders to use these weapons, they will be treated much more leniently, and their actions will be taken into account in the postwar situation,"" he says.

Yet Kimball concedes that international prosecution of such a crime would be difficult."

South Africa was filled with drama in 1993. Violence raged as the white president, F.W. de Klerk, negotiated with black leader Nelson Mandela to end apartheid.

Amid this uncertainty, de Klerk appeared on TV one night and made a startling announcement: South Africa secretly built six nuclear weapons, but had dismantled them and shut down the program, he said.

""Let us convince the world we are not playing games, that we have broken those bombs down, that we can account for every milli-milli-milligram of material in it — and that is exactly what we did,"" de Klerk said at a 2012 event in Washington, recalling his decision two decades earlier.

To this day, South Africa is the only country that's built its own nuclear weapons and then relinquished them. Three former Soviet republics — Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan — inherited nukes when the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991, and then gave them up.

President Trump is now calling for North Korea to relinquish its nuclear arsenal, a step it says it will never take. History shows that countries are unlikely to give up their weapons unless there's a dramatic change in circumstances, as was the case in South Africa.

Visiting a nuclear plant



A week after de Klerk's 1993 announcement, his government invited a few reporters, including me, to a nuclear research center where the bombs were built in Pelindaba, outside the capital, Pretoria.

We put on protective clothing from head to toe and received a guided tour of the mostly deserted plant, though it still had sealed drums of waste along the walls. One worker said he and his colleagues constantly speculated on the nature of their work, but were never told the details.

De Klerk said the weapons were a deterrent never intended for actual use. The white rulers feared the Soviet Union was plotting with local black and communist groups to gain control of South Africa, with an eye on the country's vast gold and mineral wealth.

But when the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, the Cold War was over and the Soviet threat was gone. The following year, de Klerk released Mandela from prison and opened negotiations with his African National Congress. At around the same time, de Klerk decided to scrap the nuclear weapons program. South Africa signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1991, but did not announce the dismantling of its weapons until two years later.

The nuclear weapons became ""a millstone around the neck,"" he said.

South Africa's case was unique. With North Korea, neither threats nor diplomacy has worked. But does the South African example hold any lessons?

""Absolutely. No country has been compelled to give up its nuclear weapons. But countries have been convinced to do so. South Africa is the classic example,"" said Joe Cirincione, the head of the Ploughshares Fund, which works to eliminate nuclear weapons. The group has provided financial support to NPR in the past.

Few choices

There are no great options when it comes to North Korea, but Cirincione says the U.S. should push for negotiations.



""Coercion has failed. Everything we've tried, sanctions, military threats, etc., has only increased North Korea's desire to get the bomb,"" said Cirincione.

South Africa gave up its weapons when the threat went away. Dealing with such fears is sure to be part of the equation no matter how the U.S. addresses North Korea.

Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, said North Korea fears a U.S. attack that would topple its ruler, Kim Jong Un, and that's what's driving its push for a long-range missile that could threaten the United States.



""I think the first order of business for the Trump administration is to find a way to halt further long-range ballistic missile testing and nuclear testing,"" Kimball said.

Many demands

In any talks, the North would make many demands that could include an end to U.S.-South Korean military exercises, the withdrawal of nearly 30,000 U.S. troops in the South and a formal peace treaty between the two Koreas.

(The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, so the two sides have technically remained at war all this time.)

But even those deals might not be enough for North Korea to give up its nukes, which it sees as an invaluable deterrent in the face of its larger and more powerful rivals. And South Africa may never be the nuclear example that resonates with North Korea, Kimball said.

Ukraine relinquished its arsenal for a promise of security that didn't hold up. Russia seized and annexed Crimea in 2014 and has supported Ukrainian separatists in the eastern part of the country, near the border with Russia.



""Ukraine has not felt as though that bargain has been respected by Russia,"" Kimball said.



There's also the cautionary tale of a pair of dictators — Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi — who gave up their nuclear programs before acquiring a bomb. As Cirincione notes, that didn't save them.

""This is exactly, unfortunately, the lesson that Kim Jong Un has learned — that if you give up your weapons, America will kill you,"" Cirincione said.

Saddam was executed by Iraq after the U.S. invaded in 2003, toppling his regime and seizing him. Gadhafi was killed by rebels in 2011, after U.S. air strikes helped the opposition forces oust him. Observers say North Korea's Kim wants a nuclear arsenal so badly because he believes it'll protect him from suffering the same fate.

Glock The Rise of America's Gun by Paul Barrett Paperback, 300 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Today the Glock pistol has become the gun of choice for both criminals and law enforcement in the United States.

In his book Glock: The Rise of America's Gun, Paul Barrett traces how the sleek, high-capacity Austrian weapon found its way into Hollywood films and rap lyrics, not to mention two-thirds of all U.S. police departments.

The Glock was created in 1982 by curtain-rod manufacturer Gaston Glock. Glock didn't like the handguns available on the market and decided to manufacture a new gun from scratch. Before starting, he asked gun experts in his native Austria what could be done to improve a handgun for the modern era.

""They said, 'A gun with much larger ammunition capacity, a gun that is much more durable and reliable ... [and] the gun should be easy to fire [and] easy to learn how to use,'"" Barrett tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. ""He integrated all of those elements into the Glock, and that's how he won his original contract with the Austrian army.""

The original Glock 17, the model adopted by the Austrian army, contained only 36 parts and could hold 17 bullets in its magazine. It didn't have an external safety like other semiautomatic handguns. It also didn't have a decocking mechanism. The result? A lightweight, interchangeable model that could be dropped, submerged and subjected to temperature extremes — and still accurately fire.

Coming To America

In 1988, the Glock made its way to the United States. It was perfect timing, coinciding with the rise of the American drug trade, when many cops were feeling outmanned by gangs on the street. The Glock's large capacity and light body gave it advantages over other guns.

""Police departments were amazed when they took their officers out to the range and found out not only could they learn to use the Glock pretty quickly, but the Glock also made them more accurate as marksmen,"" he says. ""And that's in part because it has a very light, very steady trigger pull. ... Critics of the guns say the trigger pull is so light that it makes accidental discharges so likely. But the Glock always has had that dual nature to it — the advantages can be reframed as disadvantages.""

One early advantage for police departments, says Barrett, was that Glock gave them large discounts when purchasing the gun for their departments.

""This was smart, because the point was to get the police departments to adopt the gun, and that would give the gun credibility in the much larger, much more lucrative civilian market, where you can charge full price and get your full profit margin,"" says Barrett. ""So this was ... a very crafty strategy.""

Another strategy, says Barrett, was to get the Glock screen time in Hollywood. In 1990, the Glock began to appear in the hands of police officers in Law and Order and other police procedural shows. It was also used by Bruce Willis in the movie Die Hard 2. Willis' character gave a long soliloquy touting the advantages of using a Glock.

""[He] introduced the gun as a character to people who don't know anything about guns,"" says Barrett.

That publicity helped the Glock, as did its frequent mention in rap lyrics.

""The Glock was adopted early on by some of the biggest names — Tupac, Dr. Dre. As soon as it appeared here, they began to embrace it for its dark, futuristic side,"" he says. ""The fact that it looked tough, [had a] large magazine capacity, and, not incidentally, the fact that it rhymed so well with words you might want to use in rap lyrics. Within the space of a few years, you not only had the Glock showing up in lyrics — you had song titles with the name in it and people changing their stage names to incorporate Glock into them.""

Gun Control And Debate

In 1991, the first Glock shooting spree took place in Texas. Twenty people were killed. Hours after the shooting, members of Congress were debating whether guns like the Glock should be restricted.

""It took awhile, but by 1994, a bill was passed — this is what we remember as the Assault Weapons Bill — and was signed into law by President Clinton,"" says Barrett. ""It had a variety of restrictions. One of them was limiting the pistol magazine capacity to 10 rounds.""

Glock's executives would pop up on television and say, 'Who are you accusing of putting guns on the street? We've done business with the very business in the city that's suing us. It is their guns on the street.'

The legislation, which expired in 2004, was initially seen as a terrible blow to the Glock. But the company quickly found a way to use the ban on high-capacity magazines to their advantage, he says.

""Glock had seen this bill coming for years and had been running the factory nonstop — three shifts a day, seven days a week — building up the large-capacity firearms and the large-capacity magazines,"" he says. ""When the law was enacted, it allowed for a loophole that grandfathered in pre-existing equipment before the ban went into effect. [And] Glock had this huge stockpile of the very equipment that many gun owners wanted to get because it was banned — and the value of that equipment skyrocketed.""

Glock also encouraged police departments to trade in their old equipment for newer, higher-capacity weapons. The old equipment — which contained the higher-capacity magazines manufactured before the ban — was then sold on the used-gun market, and found its way to the streets.

""Police departments were implicated in the proliferation of handguns all across the country,"" Barrett says, a fact that came to haunt the municipalities that, a decade later, tried suing the gun industry for flooding the streets with guns.

""Glock's executives would pop up on television and say, 'Who are you accusing of putting guns on the street? We've done business with the very business in the city that's suing us. It is their guns on the street.' ""

Glock's statements helped undercut those lawsuits, says Barrett.

""This process of always finding the exceptions, finding ways around efforts to restrict the Glock became a trademark for the company,"" he says. ""Right from the start, it helped the company, and it continue[s] on through its entire history.""

Interview Highlights

On selling the Glock to U.S. law enforcement

""[Glock] was smart enough to hire a genius salesman. ... This man Karl Walter was really a guru in figuring out how to appeal to the police — whether that meant offering them extremely attractive financial terms or hosting police procurement officers at [a famous strip club] in Atlanta. This was a guy who could make a deal with anybody and figure out how to sell the Glock.""

On an article in Soldier of Fortune magazine touting the Glock's body, which was made out of plastic

""[The writer] said, 'I was skeptical, too. I went over to Austria. I tried this gun. People, you've got to try it, too.' This was a huge door-opener for Glock. The focus on plastic soon developed into a controversy that was also a selling point because the gun control advocates [said], 'Because the gun is plastic, it'll become a terrorist tool. You'll be able to sneak it into airports, past the metal detectors.' This created a genuine controversy. ... Suddenly people were talking about the Glock before there were even more than a handful of guns in this country. This kind of attention is priceless. ... And then it turned out that the allegations weren't true, that you could see a Glock on an airport X-ray machine because a big piece of industrial-shaped plastic shaped like a gun looks like a gun.""

On selling guns using beautiful women at trade shows

""It's extremely similar to the way cars are sold, by means of sex and models and lots of other products. In the same way you have models at trade shows of all sorts, you certainly have them at gun trade shows. The appeal is just as obvious as it might seem. Guns are to some people an expression of virility. ... A buxom, scantily clad woman appeals to some customers.""

On current efforts to strengthen gun control

""No new federal gun control legislation was passed in the wake of [Columbine and other school shootings], which is in some ways more remarkable that in the wake of Virginia Tech and in the wake of Tuscon, we have similarly seen no new efforts to restrict the legal sale or ownership of guns. In fact, it's quite to the contrary. Over that time, gun laws in the United States are getting looser, not tighter. It is easier to carry a gun in many states. It is easier to get gun permits. And we have now had a Democratic president for three years, and he's said barely a word about gun control one way or the other. I think it's very fair to say that the gun control debate has really been won for the moment by the NRA and by the industry that it cooperates with, and by those people who are in favor of widespread civilian ownership of guns.""

I think it's very fair to say that the gun control debate has really been won for the moment by the NRA and by the industry that it cooperates with, and by those people who are in favor of widespread civilian ownership of guns.

On taking shooting lessons

""People who don't own guns really need to think about this: It's just darn fun to fire a gun. It's interesting. It requires a lot of attention. It's competitive. And it's just as people say — it's a real feeling of power to handle a firearm. That appeal is, in my view, undeniable and part of the reason that guns symbolize individualism, self-sufficiency to such a large portion of the population. I felt it myself."""

What weapon did the gunman use in the recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida?

If you said the AR-15, you'd be wrong. And we'll explain in a moment.

For more than a half-century, the AR-15 has been popular among gun owners, widely available in gun stores and, for many years, even appeared in the Sears catalog.

Yet over the past decade, the AR-15 and its offshoots have been used in many of the country's worst mass shootings. This has reignited the debate about their widespread availability.

Dick's Sporting Goods announced Wednesday that it would no longer sell these assault-style weapons.

""I'm a gun owner myself,"" Ed Stack, the company's chief executive officer, told ABC's Good Morning America. But, he added, ""We've just decided that based on what's happened and with these guns, we don't want to be part of this story.""

Many versions

Here's a quick history lesson on why AR-15 has become the umbrella term for a range of semi-automatic rifles made by a host of gun makers.

""AR"" comes from the name of the gun's original manufacturer, ArmaLite, Inc. The letters stand for ArmaLite Rifle — and not for ""assault rifle"" or ""automatic rifle.""

ArmaLite first developed the AR-15 in the late 1950s as a military rifle, but had limited success in selling it. In 1959 the company sold the design to Colt.

In 1963, the U.S. military selected Colt to manufacture the automatic rifle that soon became standard issue for U.S. troops in the Vietnam War. It was known as the M-16.

Armed with that success, Colt ramped up production of a semiautomatic version of the M-16 that it sold to law enforcement and the public, marketed as the AR-15.

When Colt's patents for the AR-15 expired in the 1970s, other manufacturers began making similar models.

Those gun makers gave the weapons their own names, yet the popularity of the AR-15 turned it into a generic term for all types of AR-15-style rifles.

These weapons can go for less than $1,000, though they can be customized and cost in the thousands of dollars.

The National Rifle Association estimates there are some eight million AR-15s and its variations in circulation, and says they are so popular that the ""AR"" should stand for ""America's Rifle.""

The Florida shooting

Which brings us back to our original question about the weapon used in Florida, which is commonly described as an AR-15.

Police say the gunman actually used a Smith and Wesson M&P15, that manufacturer's version of the AR-15.

AR-15-style rifles were around for more than 40 years before one was used in a mass killing, at an apartment in Crandon, Wis., in 2007. The shooter killed six people and then took his own life.

However, gunmen (and at least one gunwoman) have used AR-15-style weapons in most all of the deadliest shootings in this decade.

A partial list includes:

- The Las Vegas slaughter of 58 people last October.

- The Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooting that claimed 26 lives in November.

- The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., that left 49 dead in 2016.

- The San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that killed 14 people in 2015.

- The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that took 27 lives in 2012.

Similar to military weapons

AR-15-style semiautomatic weapons are civilian versions of military weapons. So what's the difference?

Gun control advocates say the difference is minimal, arguing the AR-15, like its military version, is designed to kill people quickly and in large numbers - hence the term assault-style rifle. They say it has no valid recreational use, and civilians should not be allowed to own them.

The gun industry, gun owners and their supporters say AR-15s are used for hunting, target practice and shooting competitions and should remain legal.

Because AR-15-style weapons are semiautomatic, the shooter must pull the trigger to fire each shot from a magazine that often holds 30 rounds.

In contrast, a shooter with a fully automatic assault rifle can pull and hold the trigger and the weapon will keep firing until the ammunition supply is exhausted.

Fully automatic weapons have been tightly restricted in the U.S. since the 1934 National Firearms Act, which was directed against machine guns at the time.

However, a bump stock — a legal device in many places — can be added to a semiautomatic weapon to approximate an automatic rifle.

The Las Vegas shooter had a bump stock, which brought the device to national attention, and has led to calls to ban it in the current gun debate.

A temporary ban

In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an assault-weapons ban, which outlawed the AR-15 and other similar semiautomatic rifles.

Mass shootings were down in the decade that followed, compared to the decade before (1984-94) and the one after (2004-14), but they did not end entirely.

After the assault-weapons ban expired in 2004, gun makers quickly reintroduced them and sales were brisk.

""One of the things that we have seen in recent years after the assault weapons ban ended in 2004 was this really huge explosion of these boutique kind of rifle companies that are producing these very high-end rifles that are very customizable,"" said Alain Stephens, who's part of NPR's criminal justice team and a former member of the military.

On several occasions, AR-15 sales have spiked when there's renewed talk about banning them.

Laws vary by state, but in Florida, for example, anyone who is 18 or older with a clean record can purchase an AR-15-style rifle with no waiting period.

Republican lawmakers in the state have proposed several steps that include raising the age to 21 for the purchase of all guns, and imposing a three-day waiting period.

However, the Republicans who control the legislature are not calling for a ban on AR-15s or any other gun, and the steps fall far short of what gun-control advocates want to see."

She was the alpha female of a wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park, sought after for photographs because of her unusual white coat.

Hikers found her suffering from severe wounds last month. The animal was euthanized by park staff shortly after.

The park now says the recognizable wolf suffered a gunshot wound, based on preliminary results of a necropsy by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The animal likely was shot sometime between April 10 at 1 a.m. and April 11 at 2 p.m. on the north side of the park, near Gardiner, Mont.

""Due to the serious nature of this incident, a reward of up to $5,000.00 is offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual(s) responsible for this criminal act,"" Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said in a statement.

She was said to be one of only three known white wolves in the park and, at 12 years old, was about twice the age of the average wolf there. ""As the alpha female for over nine years with the same alpha male, she had at least 20 pups, 14 of which lived to be yearlings,"" the park said.

A local wolf advocacy group called Wolves of the Rockies subsequently doubled the reward, offering an additional $5,000 that later grew to $5,200 after additional donations. Marc Cooke, who leads the group, ""suspects opponents of wolves in Yellowstone were responsible,"" according to The Associated Press.

""Many hunting outfitters and ranchers have been unhappy about wolves since their reintroduction to the park more than 20 years ago,"" the wire service adds. ""The wolves prey on big-game animals and sometimes cattle.""

This isn't the first well-known Yellowstone wolf to die from a gunshot wound — the park's most popular wolf was shot dead in 2012, as NPR reported.

""People in this world today crave something real, and our society is lacking that, and they could come to Yellowstone and see real nature unfolding in front of their eyes with this very unique personality of a wolf, and they loved her,"" biologist Douglas Smith told NPR about that deceased wolf, known as 832F."

A former Russian parliamentarian named Denis Voronenkov, who fled Russia last October and has criticized President Vladimir Putin's government, was killed in Kiev on Thursday, in an apparent assassination that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is reportedly calling ""state terrorism.""

Voronenkov, 45, had just left the Premier Palace hotel when he was shot twice in the head on a sidewalk along a busy street in Ukraine's capital, according to the Kyiv Post. Citing police, the newspaper adds that both Voronenkov's bodyguard and the attacker were wounded and in the hospital.

The killing has the ""handwriting"" of the Russian special services, Poroshenko said in a statement Thursday. According to a translation by Reuters, he said Voronenkov's murder was ""an act of state terrorism on the part of Russia, which he was forced to leave for political reasons.""

Responding to those accusations, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""We believe that all speculations about a Russian connection are absurd,"" according to state-run Tass media. He also said Ukraine ""had proved unable to take care of Voronenkov's security,"" the outlet reports.

Poroshenko said Voronenkov was a key witness in Ukraine's inquiry into former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and Russian military involvement in the country.

When he fled Russia, Voronenkov did so along with his wife, Maria Maksakova, who is also a former lawmaker. She was seen at the site of her husband's killing today, being restrained by police and emergency workers.

Here's how Radio Free Europe recently described Voronenkov:

""A former Communist Party legislator elected in the 2011 Russian vote viewed by many as rigged, Voronenkov is perhaps best known for co-authoring the 2014 bill in the State Duma that banned the foreign ownership of Russian media, a move Bloomberg View columnist Leonid Bershidsky called 'perhaps the single worst thing that happened to press freedom as an institution in Putin's Russia.'"" ""Now, though, Voronenkov appears to have flipped, becoming a fiery critic of most everything he once supported in Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, to boot.""

In an interview last month, Voronenkov told RFE that Russia ""has gone crazy. People are behaving in a pseudo-patriotic frenzy.""

Describing the dynamic in Russia, he and Maksakova told the news outlet that lying had become commonplace, and ""the lack of professionalism has been replaced by loyalty to power."""

Seven people were shot and killed at a home in a Dallas suburb where they had reportedly gathered to watch a football game, authorities and neighbors say. A police officer who arrived on the scene exchanged gunfire with the suspected shooter, who was killed.

Two other people were wounded in the incident, police said. There was no immediate word on their conditions.

The shooting occurred around 8 p.m. local time Sunday in Plano, about 20 miles northeast of Dallas. The victims, who were all said to be adults, had held an afternoon barbecue ahead of the Dallas Cowboys-New York Giants game, according to neighbors.

A nearby officer heard gunfire and responded, The Dallas Morning News reports.

The officer ""made entry, and that's when he observed several victims inside and then engaged the suspect,"" police spokesman David Tilley was quoted as saying by the Morning News.

""We're looking into a motive,"" Tilley said, adding that the relationship between the victims and the shooter was unknown as yet. However, the newspaper writes that:

""A neighbor said a friend of one of the homeowners said the violence had been sparked by a domestic dispute. ... The couple identified in public records as the homeowners sought a divorce in July.""

The police spokesman said the shooting was unusual for Plano. He declined to say whether police had been called to the house in the past, according to The Associated Press.

One neighbor, Stacey Glover, told the Morning News that the party had started in the afternoon, with people laughing and grilling outside. The newspaper reports: ""She heard shots about 8 p.m., opened her door and smelled gunpowder. When police arrived, she heard them yelling, 'Hands up' before more shots rang out."""

A police officer attempting to help at the scene of a car accident was fatally shot, apparently by an occupant of the vehicle, near Indianapolis on Thursday.

The Indianapolis Star reports Allan was responding to a report of a flipped car around 3 p.m. Thursday when one of the vehicle's occupants opened fire, hitting Allan. Two other officers, one of whom was off-duty, were nearby and both returned fire, authorities said. One of the car's occupants was hit and both were taken to the same hospital as Allan.

Allan was awarded the Officer of the Year award in 2015, according to the Southside Times. He told the local paper he had ""wanted to be a cop since I was 5 years old."""

Updated at 9:36 p.m. ET

A shooting Wednesday morning at a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., left the third-highest-ranking member of the House of Representatives lying at the edge of the outfield with a gun wound to his hip. The shooter has died, President Trump announced.

Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, headed into surgery at a hospital in Washington at 10 a.m., according to a statement from his office. He remained ""in critical condition"" as of 8:15 p.m., according to a statement from the hospital, following a surgery and multiple blood transfusions, with more operations to come. The bullet that struck his left hip traveled across his pelvis, ""fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding,"" the hospital said.

When the shooting started earlier that morning, he was playing second base, his normal position on the congressional baseball team.

""All of a sudden, we heard a loud, what sounded like a gunshot, very loud and very close,"" Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., told NPR's Morning Edition. ""[Scalise] went down and dragged himself off of the infield into the outfield about 10 or 15 yards and was laying motionless out there.""

Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a doctor, plays on the team and was among the first out to Scalise to apply pressure to the wound, according to CNN. Capitol Police were also on hand because Scalise was present, NPR's Scott Horsley reports, and exchanged gunfire with the suspect. Two officers were wounded, and lawmakers and the president said the outcome would have been worse if they were not there.

At a press conference Wednesday morning, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was ""visibly emotional,"" according to The Washington Post:

""Asked about Scalise, McCarthy started to well up. "" 'I've known Steve since Young Republicans. Long before we ever served in the House,' he said before walking away.""

Scalise is married and has two children. According to his office, he spoke to his wife by phone before going into surgery.

A highly popular politician in Louisiana, Scalise, 51, represents the state's 1st Congressional District. He was elected in 2008 in a special election to replace Bobby Jindal, who had just been elected governor.

Since then, Scalise has always gotten more than 65 percent of the vote in primaries, avoiding runoff elections, the New Orleans Times-Picayune has reported. In November, he garnered 75 percent of the votes in his district.

The former systems engineer got his start in politics at Louisiana State University, where he was twice elected speaker of LSU's Student Government Association. He served as a member of Louisiana's state Legislature for 12 years before being elected to the U.S. House.

The turning point in his career was a 2012 win that made him chairman of the influential Republican Study Group. He beat Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., who had been unanimously recommended by the group's founders prior to the election.

After his victory, Scalise told reporters that his goal would be to pull Republican leadership ""as far to the right"" as possible.

""There are going to be times when we disagree with our leadership, but ultimately, we've got to work hard to pull our leadership to the right,"" Scalise said, according to The Hill, ""and to move a conservative agenda forward and unite as conservatives if we're going to get things done.""

Two years later, he won the race for the House majority's third-highest position. Scalise ran for majority whip against Peter Roskam of Illinois and Marlin Stutzman of Indiana, after the former whip, McCarthy, was elected majority leader.

""Scalise was the more conservative voice many members have been clamoring for and he's from a red state,"" NPR's Ailsa Chang reported at the time.

Right around the same time, the congressman came under scrutiny when it was revealed he may have inadvertently spoken at an event organized by a white supremacist group when he was a state representative.

""I didn't know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group,"" he told the New Orleans Times-Picayune at the time. ""At the end of the day, you are judged by your character. And look, I'm proud of my record of working to help people throughout my years of public service.""

Louisiana has gone for the Republican presidential candidate every election since 2000. Even so, Scalise wasn't an early endorser of Trump last year. Once he committed, however, he stayed that way even as negative press rained down on Trump in the months leading up to the election."

Dr. Christopher Fisher was working at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center just off the Las Vegas strip on Sunday evening when the patients starting arriving.

""It did look a bit like a war zone, can't say that it didn't,"" he remembers. ""Frantic families, blood in the hallways.""

People came in so grievously injured and so many at a time that Fisher, who is the medical head of trauma services for the hospital, and his colleagues used markers, writing directly on patients, to do triage.

When someone arrived, an emergency room physician would mark their wounds. It was quick, simple and impersonal by necessity.

Fisher says in those first few hours, the patients were functionally anonymous to the surgeons trying to save their lives. ""There's no paper charts prepared for all those patients,"" says Fisher. ""No documentation, so literally they just write on the patient. Just write where the wounds are.""

Fisher did seven surgeries in about 12 hours.



""What stuck out to me was probably my first patient of the night,"" Fisher remembers. ""I literally didn't even meet the guy, see the guy's face. He was just on the operating table, ready to go when I walked in the room.""



The man had been shot in the abdomen. Fisher's job was to find all the damage the bullet, or bullets, had done. And a bullet does terrible things to a body. ""It tears the tissue, it rips the tissue, it bruises the tissue as it goes through,"" says Fisher.



That first patient made it through surgery. As Fisher worked, he saw people with wounds all over their bodies. ""Literally everywhere,"" he says. ""We had people shot in the head, shot in the spine, chest abdomen, extremities."" The gunman fired from above, and from a distance, into a crowd of about 20,000 people and ""a lot of the gunshot wounds went side to side, so you anticipate that people were either running away or ducking.""

This is where, in addition to the controlled chaos of triage and the sheer volume of patients, the counting of gunshot wound victims gets even more complicated. At other Las Vegas hospitals, such as St. Rose Dominican, people came in with scalp lacerations where bullets grazed their heads. Others came in with a range of injuries from shrapnel, from bullets striking objects near them. Those types of injuries may or may not have been labeled as gunshot wounds by emergency room staff.

And even counting the total number of people treated at any given facility is challenging. For example, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo revised the estimate for the total number of people injured, from about 520 down to about 500, saying some people had been counted twice initially. Meanwhile, some suburban hospitals in the St. Rose Dominican network said they were still receiving some patients who were seeking treatment for the first time after being injured in the shooting and initially going home, rather than checking into the hospital immediately.

For the major hospitals, it has taken days to do their own counting of patients and cataloging of injuries. A spokesperson for University Medical Center, the only Level 1 trauma center in the city, said Tuesday night that it was unclear how many patients the hospital had treated specifically for gunshot wounds.

On Wednesday, Sunrise Hospital revised the total number of patients it had treated down — from 214 to 200, of whom 16 died and 29 were still in critical condition. Of those, the hospital estimates about 120 had gunshot wounds, but did not release an exact figure."

Jordan Edwards, a high school freshman, was leaving a house party in a Dallas suburb late Saturday night with several friends when police officers arrived outside. The officers were investigating a complaint about noisy teenagers in the neighborhood, and they had heard gunshots in the area as they approached.

Within minutes, the black 15-year-old passenger had been killed — shot in the head by an officer through the front passenger window and pronounced dead at the hospital shortly afterward.

The next day, Balch Springs police Chief Jonathan Haber apologized to Edwards' family at a news conference, explaining the situation by saying the vehicle was backing toward officers ""in an aggressive manner.""

By Monday afternoon, however, Haber had retracted that account.

NPR's Wade Goodwyn explains the discrepancies as Haber laid them out:

""In fact, the car with five teenagers inside was moving forward, not backward, and away from the officers, not toward them. There was no altercation, known or otherwise. ""Nevertheless one of officers fired a rifle multiple times into the passenger window, killing young Jordan Edwards. None of the teens were carrying weapons, nor were they drunk. ""Chief Haber said his review of the officer's body camera video indicated the shooting may not meet his department's standards.""

The officer, who remains unnamed, has been placed on administrative leave. Both the Dallas County Sheriff's Department and the Dallas County district attorney's public integrity unit are investigating the shooting.

""We offer our sincere condolences to Jordan's family and will continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers as we move forward expeditiously, with a commitment to justice and transparency,"" District Attorney Faith Johnson's office said in a statement Monday.

The attorney for Edwards' family, Lee Merritt, said at a news conference Monday that the teen's parents will continue to push for the officer to be arrested and charged.

""We are declaring war on bad policing. This has happened far too often,"" Merritt said, while flanked by Edwards' family. ""America must find a way to police its citizens without killing them."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images

As health departments in Texas try to assist people with immediate medical needs following Hurricane Harvey, they're also looking to ensure that those affected can get the prescription drugs they need and stay as safe as possible.

""Our best advice is always to avoid floodwater as much as you can,"" says Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. ""Of course, people have had to be in the water — they haven't had a choice.""

The state has already begun filling requests for tetanus vaccinations and is sending supplies of the vaccine to the affected areas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults get a tetanus booster every 10 years; the bacteria can enter the body through breaks in the skin and can cause serious illness. The CDC also has specific recommendations for children on its website. People who are not up-to-date on their tetanus vaccination or do not know when they last had one should try to get one, health officials say.

Van Deusen says water contamination from household chemicals and possibly industrial chemicals could be a problem, although as of midday Monday, he had yet to hear of a major industrial facility being flooded.

Dr. Phil Huang, medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health in the state capital, urges people to clean wounds with soap and water. ""Certainly, there can be contamination with high levels of water — fecal contamination, things like that.""

He also warns that well water could be contaminated as a result of flooding. He says it's important that people boil water for at least a minute before using it, or get bottled water.

Huang says in the days ahead, safety concerns could include carbon monoxide poisoning in households using generators; the consumption of contaminated food stored without refrigeration; and injuries suffered when people try to get back to their homes. Longer term, he says, mold will be an issue.

Huang says one of Austin's community health centers has set up mobile clinics to help people in shelters there who need prescription drugs, either by filling existing prescriptions or writing new ones as necessary.

The state has also contracted with the grocery chain H-E-B to work with patients on filling prescriptions as long as there is some way to verify the prescription, Van Deusen says.

A total of 14 hospitals have been evacuated in the affected region since Friday, he says, noting that two emergency departments have since reopened.

On Monday morning, MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the country's top cancer hospitals, tweeted that it was closed for all patient appointments. Since Sunday, the hospital has been surrounded by water, and roads have been impassable. Staff continue to care for hospitalized patients.

""Our patients are safe,"" tweeted Dr. Karen Lu, chair of gynecologic oncology at MD Anderson, on Sunday.

Starting last week, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission has been contacting long-term care facilities in the state to ask about evacuation and shelter plans, according to commission spokeswoman Carrie Williams.

As of midafternoon Monday, 39 nursing facilities and 19 assisted living facilities housing more than 2,280 residents had been evacuated, according to Williams.

""[We] will continue to contact providers to assess unmet needs,"" she wrote in an email. ""If we spot an emergency situation, we refer that to the State Operations Center and/or law enforcement as warranted.""

On Sunday, a photo of elderly residents surrounded by high water inside their nursing home went viral on social media, generating huge concern and some outrage. Hours later, emergency personnel evacuated 15 senior citizens from the home, La Vita Bella in Dickinson, Texas, Dickinson's emergency management coordinator David Popoff told The Daily News."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Historical Archives Sarajevo/AP Historical Archives Sarajevo/AP

A hundred years ago Saturday, Gavrilo Princip shot the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. That event triggered World War I, charting the course for the 20th century. Today, the legacy of the Bosnian Serb nationalist remains the subject of intense debate — nowhere more than in Sarajevo itself.

In the one-room museum on the corner where the assassination took place, tour guide Mirsad Nazerovic points to a black-and-white photo of a pillar that used to stand outside this building. It was a monument with a very short life.

""Construction started in 1916. It was finished in 1917. And it was destroyed in 1918,"" says Nazerovic.

That was the first in a long string of short-lived memorials to the assassination.

""The question you're faced with is very stark,"" says historian James Lyon, an expert in Balkan history. ""Was Gavrilo Princip a terrorist, or was he a national hero? There have been tug-of-war interpretations, and they have changed over time.""

Lyon runs through about a half-dozen monuments that have been erected on this site, built up and torn down with each change in power.

There was a plaque in the 1930s that said Princip fired shots expressing the longing of people to be free. It was removed when the Germans arrived.

Then World War II ended, and a plaque went up noting that this was ""where Gavrilo Princip threw off the German occupiers,"" says Lyon, ""obviously with references to the recent war in mind.""

For a while, there were footprints in the sidewalk where tourists could stand in Princip's shoes. Those were torn out during the Balkan war in the 1990s.

Today, a resolutely apolitical plaque stands on the corner of where the assassination took place. It reads: ""From this place on 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia.""

And this isn't the only place where the battle over Princip's legacy is raging.

A visit to Princip's grave requires a taxi ride outside of the town center. The site doesn't look like a historic place of consequence. People sell used books outside the cemetery fence. There's a grungy cafe, and a highway overpass casts a shadow on the graves.

Inside, Princip and most of his co-conspirators are buried in a small chapel. He died in prison after being convicted of the assassination. Some of the others were executed.

Historian Edin Hajdarpasic of Loyola University says the inscription on the chapel refers to the assassins as heroes.

""And above it is a citation from the Montenegrin poet Njegos,"" says Hajdarpasic. ""And it reads: 'Blessed is he who lives forever. He had something to be born for.' ""

Not what one would think of as the grave of a villain. Instead, says Hajdarpasic, ""it has hero written all over it.""

In every era, people with power have tried to use this assassin as a symbol. The meaning of the symbol changes depending on who's talking.

Even Hollywood got in on the act. The real Princip was a scrawny, malnourished guy.

But in the 1975 movie The Day That Shook the World, he's a smoldering heartthrob who murmurs to a gorgeous woman, ""Try to understand. I must do it.""

To people with firsthand experience of the assassination, this all seems very odd. Haaris Pasovic is a theatrical director in Sarajevo. His grandfather was a teenager working in the family shop on June 28, 1914, and actually heard the gunshots that killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

""My grandfather mentioned that once to me in passing,"" says Pasovic. ""The Sarajevo assassination wasn't ever the big deal in Sarajevo.""

Not for locals, anyway. But politicians know a powerful tool when they see one. And for the past 100 years, Gavrilo Princip has been a more potent symbol in death than he ever was in his life."
npr107,npr,[],,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98578531,"Book Explores History Of The American Rifle

A new book traces American history — though the sight of a gun. Alexander Rose, author of American Rifle: A Biography, and host Andrea Seabrook visit a shooting range to tell the story.

ANDREA SEABROOK, host:

SEABROOK, host:

Ask writer Alexander Rose about the icons of U.S. culture, and he'll tell you there is one innovation that represents the ingenuity, the independence, the pioneering spirit of America - the rifle.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: Rose is the author of a new history called ""American Rifle."" He calls it a biography.

Mr. ALEXANDER ROSE (Author, ""American Rifle: A Biography): Well, I kind of treat the rifle almost as a human being. The American rifle is completely and inextricably intertwined with American culture, technology, business, war and society.

SEABROOK: Rose met me at the firing range of the National Rifle Association outside Washington D.C., to take a tour through two centuries of American history, and how it was shaped by the rifle. That history begins with the Red Coats. In the 18th century, British soldiers were mainly armed with muskets - loud, slow, clunky things that were horribly inaccurate. And the British style of fighting with these rifles?

Mr. ROSE: Essentially, line up all of your men in a very long line and tell them, and this is actually from an 18th century British drill book, that when you fire your gun, make sure to close your eyes because you don't want to actually aim because you just waste time like that. And so what they would do is they would send this proverbial hail of lead towards the enemy in the hopes that some of it would actually connect.

SEABROOK: But the American rebel had a new invention.

Mr. ROSE: The famous Kentucky rifle, or long rifle, which was created specifically in America for a specific purpose - frontier warfare and frontier living.

SEABROOK: It could shoot farther and more accurately. That led to a uniquely American style of warfare - taking aim and firing on specific targets. Rose argues that is what won the revolution. While the Red Coats fired their muskets indiscriminately, the rebels picked off British officers. You know the rest of the story. Back to the firing range, the NRA is letting us shoot a few of the guns we're talking about.

Mr. ROSE: OK, I want you to grab a seat and we'll get you set up.

SEABROOK: OK. The mid-1800s brought a new American original, the Winchester. Doug Wickland, a curator at the NRA's National Firearms Museum, gives me a tutorial. OK.

Mr. DOUG WICKLAND (Curator, National Firearms Museum): It's loaded with five cartridges. Now to work the action each time, you just work the lever like that.

SEABROOK: And that loads a new bullet?

Mr. WICKLAND: It loads it and cocks the hammer.

SEABROOK: So you just have to pull a trigger. OK. Now I feel like Annie Oakley.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: OK, so now I pull this back. Oh, and it pops out the cartridge.

Mr. WICKLAND: And you're ready to shooting again.

SEABROOK: And now it's cocked again. My God, that's easy. OK, I'm going to do it again.

The Winchester's big innovation? It's a repeater. With a quick pump of the lever, you're reloaded. This rifle is the co-star of a thousand movies.

(Soundbite of movie ""Winchester '73"")

Mr. JIMMY STEWART: (As Lin McAdam): Seems they knew all about your Springfield being single shot.

Unidentified man: You mean they had repeaters?

Mr. STEWART: (As Lin McAdam): Yep, only this time we just might outfox them.

Unidentified man: On account of we got two Winchesters.

SEABROOK: Jimmy Stewart leading a posse in the movie ""Winchester '73."" If the Kentucky rifle won the American Revolution, Alex Rose says the Winchester won the American West.

(Soundbite of gunshots and fighting)

SEABROOK: By the end of World War I, modern warfare demanded, as Alex Rose writes, a light, full-powered, rapid-fire rifle. Enter the M1 Garand.

Mr. ROSE: The Garand was a semi-automatic which really means that every time you pull the trigger a bullet is unleashed.

SEABROOK: You didn't have to mess with it. You didn't have to reload.

Mr. ROSE: It was very simple, you just pushed your magazine in. You fired, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Clip came out, filled it with a new one quite quickly - quite an advance over the older guns of the early 20th century and late 19th century.

SEABROOK: The German and Japanese armies were still using bolt-action rifles. They had to manually work the lever between each shot. The M1 gave the Americans an advantage, but the Garand changed U.S. culture in another important way. General Douglas MacArthur appealed to President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal sensibilities. MacArthur made the case that by spending lavishly on updating American forces with the latest technology, he would be creating thousands of new jobs and turning unskilled laborers into skilled gunsmiths. The military-industrial complex was born.

(Soundbite of shooting range)

Mr. WICKLAND: The safety for this gun is inside the trigger guard. It's a blade that you push forward to remove.

SEABROOK: Back on the range, Doug Wickland hands me an M1 Garand. OK. Now this thing is heavy. This is not for wimps.

Mr. WICKLAND: You want to hold this into your shoulder as well.

SEABROOK: Is this one going to kick me?

Mr. WICKLAND: Just a little bit, but you've got experience. Now you can have one.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: The Garand was the last of the old rifles, says Rose. It was used straight through World War II, Korea, and into the beginning of Vietnam. Then came the rifle that brings us right up to today, the M16.

Mr. ROSE: The M16 is the first gun of the space age. I mean, even looking at it with that characteristic carrying handle and the fiber glass stocks.

SEABROOK: It's a jet black scary looking thing. Again, Doug Wickland sets me up.

(Soundbite of shooting range)

Mr. WICKLAND: It latches into position. Now flip off the safety, and you're ready to shoot.

SEABROOK: OK.

(Soundbite of gunshot)

SEABROOK: That is so easy to fire. That's all - the first thing that comes to mind is that it's easy to pull the trigger. It doesn't kickback on you. It's just - it's simple. Now of course, I didn't even come near. I didn't hit the target, but ...

(Soundbite of laughter)

Mr. ROSE: Well, this is how these modern guns go, they're not supposed to be as quite as accurate as the old-time guns. But it is interesting that the M16 is - that you're not supposed to fire more than a couple of rounds at a time. It was designed deliberately so you conserve your ammunition and you take your aim, which is a very American idea about fighting wars.

SEABROOK: Rose says it may look different, but the M16 is still a direct descendant of that first Kentucky rifle.

Mr. ROSE: In its civilian and military aspects, the American rifle to this day mirrors traditional American ideas about individualism and self-control and discipline under fire and, you know, being able to think for oneself. You know, rifles are, I mean, they are part of the American character. The Americans have a relationship to rifles that others countries simply do not have.

SEABROOK: Now, I have to say, there are going to be listeners who aren't going to like the idea of looking at American history through the evolution of rifles.

Mr. ROSE: I mean, I just talk about the technology of them and the ideas behind them and what they represent and exemplify, that's my job as an historian. I am not a polemicist one way or the other. The real point is it doesn't really matter whether you like guns or whether you don't like guns. The point is that much of what you see about you today was indirectly or directly created by the rifle.

SEABROOK: Alexander Rose, his new book is called ""American Rifle: A Biography.""

(Soundbite of movie ""A Christmas Story"")

Mr. PETER BILLINGSLEY: (As Ralphie Parker) There it is, the Holy Grail of Christmas gifts, the Red Ryder 200-shot range model air rifle.

SEABROOK: That was the gun Ralphie Parker absolutely pined for in the movie ""A Christmas Story."" In a few minutes, our film critic, Bob Mondello, shares some of his favorite holiday scenes with a dysfunctional family twist.

(Soundbite of movie ""A Christmas Story"")

Mr. JEFF GILLEN: (As Santa Claus) You'll shoot your eye out, kid. Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho!

Mr. BILLINGSLEY: (As Ralphie Parker) No!

Attention all deer! As hunting season approaches, please be aware that the guy who's about to shoot you may be invisible. Or so he thinks.

W.L Gore and Associates, (makers of Gore-Tex rain gear), working with the HyperStealth Corporation — I kid you not — have designed a line of hunting clothes they call ""Optifade."" These clothes, they say, ""fool the deer's vision system at its roots,"" meaning when a hunter slips into his cap, vest, pants and hood, you, poor deer, won't see him (or her) there.

Skeptical deer should check this demo. Here are 2 outdoor settings. Use the slider to switch from human vision to deer vision. When you're a deer, can you find the hunter?

The company's professional consultants, Jay Neitz, an animal-vision expert at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and Timothy O'Neill, who pioneered the United States Army's digital camouflage as a researcher at West Point, have carefully studied the limits of deer vision. Deer, they told the New York Times, have a slightly blurrier view of the world. They see in 20/40, rather than 20/20. They are also colorblind in the red/green spectrum. Humans have three color receptors; deer only two.

W.L.Gore says its camouflage design combines two strategies: a ""micropattern"" colored so the hunter fades into the forest background. Plus, they've added a ""macropattern"" for moments when the hunter moves — which hunters do from time to time. The macropattern breaks up the hunter's silhouette. So even though the deer knows something's moving, it doesn't know that the mover is a person. Deer can't tell what it is.

But Does It Work?

One could argue, of course, that hunters don't need Invisibility Cloaks when they've already got rifles, ammo, and scopes — but the more intriguing possibility is that these clothes may not give the hunter that much of an advantage.

Optifade hasn't been around that long. While I didn't find any bad reviews on-line (and the deer aren't talking, of course), there is reason to be skeptical. These camouflage techniques have a history. And that history is spotty.

A hundred years ago, around World War I, the French, British and American military experimented with camouflage techniques borrowed from nature.

Inspired by the work of artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, (can you find his ""Peacock in the Woods""? There is one in there...) artists-in-uniform used pattern, color and then added sharp angles to break the silouettes of boats, cannons - hoping to make them disappear.

By the end of the war, 3,000 soldier/artists were using paint to hide things from the Germans.

In Britain, they tried painting ships. An artist named Norman Wilkinson, dubbed this ""dazzle"" painting. Boats were given abstract, angular, black and white zigzag skins, so from a distance, they didn't look like boats, and if they did, it was very hard to figure out front from back or which way the thing was going.

The idea got so popular, by June 1918, 2,000 British ships were painted in the ""dazzle"" style.

By the end of the war 1,200 American ships got the same treatment, nicknamed, ""Jazz painting"" or ""razzle dazzle.""

So why don't we still paint our ships like this? Why are modern battleships so often grey? What happened?

According to David Rothenberg at the New Jersey Institute of Technology:

The British navy conducted a study and determined that dazzle painting was not particularly effective. Sixty percent of attacks on dazzled ships resulted in damage, compared to 68% of attacks on nondazzled ships. And 40 percent more dazzled ships were initially attacked than the nondazzled ones [though the numbers were small].

In other words, British commanders decided that plain old grey ships didn't get much safer when they got dazzled. The Germans could see them, at least some of the time. We know this from the torpedoes they fired at ships they supposedly wouldn't see.

iStockphoto.com

We don't get the same data from deer. They don't shoot back. They just leap and dash off. So we can't measure Optifade's performance as easily. But the dazzle design and the Optifade designs are similar enough in principle, that it just makes me wonder: Who are the real victims here? The deer being shot by invisible predators? Or the hunters who think they're invisible?

David Rothenberg considers the history of military camouflage (among many other things) in his new book, Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution (Bloomsbury Press, 2011)."

Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47 rifle who died last month at the age of 94, wrote a letter in 2012 to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church expressing ""spiritual pain"" over the deaths caused by the ubiquitous weapon.

More than 100 million AK-47 and variants have been sold worldwide since it was first produced in the Soviet Union in 1949. The Kalashnikov rifle quickly developed a reputation for being cheap to make, reliable and easy to use, making it the weapon of choice for many of the world's infantry soldiers, freedom fighters and terrorists.

As we reported in December, when Kalashnikov died, the inventor had hinted publicly at some remorse over the deaths that resulted from the weapon but never said so unequivocally.

However, the Russian Orthodox Church says that in a May 2012 letter addressed to Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov — who converted to the religion at the age of 91 — wrote:

""My spiritual pain is unbearable. ""I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths? ""The longer I live, the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression.""

The penitent letter, published in the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper and quoted above in English by the BBC, was typed on the inventor's personal stationery and signed ""a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.""

Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying that she believes a priest helped her father with the letter.

The BBC reports:

""The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. "" 'The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,' Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. "" 'He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.' ""

The report of Kalashnikov's letter of remorse comes on the same day RIA Novosti reports that the rifle's manufacturer plans ""to sell up to 200,000 hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns in the United States"" each year.

""Scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet,"" Kelly wrote. ""We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole.""

On Monday, Douglas MacKinlay, the owner of Diamondback Police Supply Co. in Tucson, said he would give Kelly a full refund.

""While I support and respect Mark Kelly's 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use,"" MacKinlay said on Facebook. ""In light of this fact, I determined that it was in my company's best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store to complete the Federal From 4473 and NICS background check required of Mr. Kelly before he could take possession this firearm.

NPR via YouTube

Once again, and sadly not for the last time, a mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 stunned the nation and shocked the rest of the civilized world, spurring a national debate about guns and gun laws.

And once again, and surely not for the last time, that debate features the pre-eminent organization of gun owners, the National Rifle Association, known as the NRA.

Founded in 1871, the group now has about 5 million members. More to the point, it is among the most feared and effective players in Washington and the 50 state capitals, where it lobbies, raises money and prepares field campaigns.

The power of the organization is legendary, especially the widely published report cards it issues giving A to F grades to lawmakers. The cards have been credited with the election (or blamed for the defeat) of many a candidate, including incumbents.

Even the nuances of the group's affection, an A+ over an A grade, for example, can make the difference for candidates, especially in Republican primaries.

That is why the NRA has anchored the opposition in every major gun-related debate since it altered its main aim from marksmanship to hard-edged political activism. That change came 40 years ago and was related to other shifts in political sentiment, including the departure of Southern rural conservatives from the Democratic Party. All these helped elect the first presidential candidate to ever be endorsed by the NRA, Ronald Reagan, in 1980.

So what exactly is this juggernaut of influence and how did it become the de facto arbiter of firearms laws in our society?

The group's website has this modest introduction:

""While widely recognized today as a major political force and as America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights, the NRA has, since its inception, been the premier firearms education organization in the world.""

Started by Union officers upset over Civil War recruits' poor shooting skills

That inception dates back almost to the Civil War and two former Union officers, who had despaired over their wartime recruits' poor shooting skills. (An official study estimated that Yankee troops fired 1,000 rounds for every bullet that actually struck a Confederate soldier.)

The idea was to educate a new generation of marksmen, whether for war or hunting or recreational target shooting.

New York helped the NRA buy its first shooting range

Well into the 20th century, the NRA was known primarily for promoting the safe and proper use of firearms, often in some form of cooperation with the government. The Army, at times, donated surplus equipment for training, and the state of New York helped the NRA buy its first shooting range.

Of course, the idea that people owned and used guns was a given in the early years of America. They were integral to frontier survival and rural life, and inherent in the wider American culture — a feature of legend and lore, a symbol of individuality and independence.

In time, however, controversy over guns arose.

Four presidents shot began a split of Americans on guns

After Abraham Lincoln, two other presidents were shot by assassins, and Theodore Roosevelt sustained and survived a short-range gunshot wound.

People began to talk about the availability of guns and the desirability of some restrictions.

And the NRA wanted to be in on that conversation.

The NRA wasn't always staunchly opposed to gun restrictions

Many are surprised to learn that the NRA of past generations worked with the federal government to limit the traffic in guns — for example, where ex-convicts or mental patients were involved.

When handguns became the focus, the NRA spawned a subgroup devoted to them and supported state-level permit requirements for concealed weapons.

In the Prohibition Era, the conversation changed again with the urban use of shotguns and the fully automatic Thompson gun.

These lurid hallmarks of bank robbers and warring gangsters became a target for lawmakers. In the legislating beehive of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1938 regulated such guns, banned some buyers and made gun dealers register with the government.

The NRA worked with Congress and the White House on those acts and supported their enforcement. The same was true when these restrictions were extended and tightened following the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and again by a 1968 gun bill responding to the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy.

But in the late 1960s, there was also widespread concern about rising crime rates and the deadly riots that flared in the nation's major cities. Citizens were concerned about their safety and turned to gun purchases for their personal protection. And many NRA members wanted their organization to get out in front of that.

The hard-liners took over the NRA after an NRA member was killed by federal agents.

In 1971, agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms killed an NRA member who was hiding a large number of illegal weapons. This, too, stirred a restive reaction within the NRA rank and file. To address it, the NRA's top managers created the group's first lobbying organ, the Institute for Legislative Action, in 1975.

The ILA was headed by a Texas lawyer named Harlon Carter, an immigration hawk who had headed of the Border Patrol in the 1950s.

""You don't stop crime by attacking guns,"" he said. ""You stop crime by stopping criminals.""

Hard-charging and uncompromising, Carter was soon at odds with the Old Guard of the parent NRA, who downsized his ILA staff. He fought back by organizing an uprising at the annual NRA convention in 1977 and forcing the power struggle to burst into the open.

In the end, Carter won, ascending to NRA's de facto leadership as its executive vice president. He installed another hard-liner, Neal Knox, to head the ILA. The new marching orders were to oppose all forms of gun control across the board and lobby aggressively for gun owners' rights in Congress and the legislatures.

Becoming a political force

This change in mission coincided with a new surge in political money. Decisions by the Federal Election Commission and the Supreme Court had opened the spillway on vast new reservoirs of cash.

Soon, the NRA became a formidable force in fundraising and campaign spending, making band breaking candidacies at the state and federal level.

This, in turn, gave the group the muscle to move pro-gun legislation as well as to stop efforts at gun control. Carter proclaimed his group would be ""so strong and so dedicated that no politician in America, mindful of his political career, would want to challenge our legitimate goals.""

YouTube

The NRA has followed the path blazed by Carter (who retired in 1985) and Knox.

The group has since had presidents whose personal views were less rigid. That included the one-time movie star Charlton Heston, who served from 1998 to 2003. But, ironically, Heston is arguably most famous in his role as NRA president for proclaiming: ""From my cold dead hands!"" at the 2000 NRA convention, as he hoisted a rifle above his head.

""So, as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away,"" Heston said, trying to rally the membership against Vice President and Democrat Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election. ""I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed, and especially for you, Mr. Gore: 'From my cold, dead hands!'""

The rallying cry is on NRA bumper stickers and symbolizes the modern-era NRA attitude when it comes to gun restrictions. And since Carter's hard line, picked up by the subsequent leaders of the organization, the NRA has also seen seen its membership and coffers swell. And when a mass-shooting happens or a Democratic president looks like he or she might win, gun stock prices soar.

A setback and backlash

That speech also took place after eight years of a Democratic presidency that saw an assault-rifle ban go into effect. Gore, of course, narrowly lost in 2000. Often when there's momentum in one direction, there is a backlash, and that happened that year.

The NRA experienced setbacks on gun restrictions in the 1990s, stemming from the 1981 attempted assassination of Reagan. It created a new groundswell for gun control and led — eventually — to the 1993 law known as the Brady Bill (for Reagan's press secretary Jim Brady, wounded in the attempt on the president's life).

The Brady Bill established a waiting period and other restrictions and had the support of NRA member Ronald Reagan. The following year, a Democratic Congress enacted a domestic ban on ""assault weapons,"" the combat style semiautomatics so common in war zones around the world.

But the NRA managed to insert a 10-year sunset on the law, and when it came due in 2004, the control of Congress had passed to the GOP, which allowed the law to expire.

Over the years, the NRA has also become involved in litigation, such as the lawsuit challenging the personal handgun ban in the District of Columbia. That case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law in the landmark Heller decision in 2008.

The decision enshrined the longstanding NRA tenet that the Second Amendment right to firearms was meant for a private individual as well as a ""well-regulated militia.""

The majority opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia, who had been appointed to the court by Reagan, the first president endorsed for the office by the NRA.

The modern-day NRA has a well-established response formula after mass shootings

This is the NRA we know today, the one to whom lawmakers and the media turn after a firearm massacre such as in Las Vegas.

When this happens, the NRA has a well-established protocol for its response.

First ... the organization remains silent for a period of days, offering only a message of sympathy for the victims and a request that the tragedy ""not be politicized.""

Then ... the organization begins to engage, usually through a few officers and spokespersons who have been through this multiple times, such as the chief lobbyist, Chris W. Cox, and its executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

LaPierre made the rounds of TV talk shows and cable channels this weekend, reciting a well-practiced catechism defending his faith in guns, their use in self-protection and the NRA view of the Constitution.

That is, as follows:

1. That the Second Amendment guarantees the right to ""keep and bear arms,"" and the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that this right applies to private individuals and not just to organized militias (as referenced in the Constitution), but also to private individual citizens.

2. The organization lays the blame for gun violence on criminals and the producers of Hollywood movies and video games and the failures of the mental health system.

3. It reminds that it is not possible to legislate away the evil in the world.

Finally, and repeatedly, the NRA repeats its mantra: ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.""

Or, as LaPierre put it Sunday, ""It comes down to ... if your glass breaks in the middle of the night, there is not a government authority on the planet that substitutes for your right to own a firearm.""

After Vegas, a shift? Maybe not so fast

In the case of the Las Vegas shooting that took 58 lives and wounded or injured hundreds more, the NRA has deviated only a degree from its pattern. In its original response, the NRA said it was willing to discuss the Las Vegas shooter's reliance on a weapon modification known as a ""bump stock.""

This enables someone holding a semiautomatic weapon to fire many rounds without squeezing the trigger for each. This does not modify the weapon to make it ""fully automatic,"" but it produces a similar effect.

On the same day the NRA released its statement, this past Thursday, a number of Republican legislators, including some from party leadership in the House and Senate, told reporters they could ""take a look at"" bump stocks.

Two days later, President Trump also said the administration would ""take a look at"" bump stocks.

Whether this was a coordinated strategy or not, it struck many as a mild concession on the part of the NRA, which usually opposes new limitations. Indeed, it was denounced as such by the Gun Owners of America, a smaller guns-rights group that is often critical of what it calls the NRA's willingness to compromise and ""sell out.""

But it soon became clear that the NRA was not in favor of addressing the bump stock through any actual change in the law. LaPierre and others said it was within the purview of the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms to regulate bump stocks now. They said repeatedly that ATF should simply ""do its job.""

ATF officials, however, directly contradicted that statement, pointing to the language of the relevant laws on the books. They said those laws needed to change for them to ban bump stocks.

While that ""he-said, she-said"" debate goes forward, LaPierre added Sunday that he did not see a need for any gun bill that ""would become a Christmas tree"" loaded with anti-gun measures. He specifically mentioned the suggestions by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Democrat with whom he has clashed since she pushed the assault-weapons ban in 1994. (LaPierre was first made executive vice president in 1991.)

LaPierre's view is already being echoed by many members of Congress. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was seriously wounded when a gunman opened fire in June on a congressional baseball team practice, on Sunday suggested there might be other legislation moving in his chamber that enhanced gun owner rights rather than limiting them in any way.

Scalise, it must be noted, just returned to Congress after months of rehabilitation from his injuries. Scalise, whose NRA report card grade is an A+, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the right to guns is, in essence, without limits.

""Our Founding Fathers believed strongly in gun rights for citizens,"" Scalise said. ""Don't try to put new laws in place that don't fix these problems. They only make it harder for law-abiding citizens to own a gun.""

Asked if he thought gun rights were ""unlimited,"" Scalise said: ""It is. It is."""

This political primary season has seen an unprecedented use of guns to get votes. Republican hopefuls across the country are appearing in political ads firing guns and holding political events around firearms.

Texas state Sen. Donna Campbell won the Republican nomination in her party. In one of her ads, she's seen firing a gun at a target as a narrator lauds her for reducing ""the time it takes to obtain a concealed carry license, so more law-abiding Texans could exercise their constitutional rights to defend themselves.""

In another, candidate Matt Rosendale shoots a rifle at an imaginary government drone — though it did not help him snatch the nomination for a Montana congressional seat.

And in a now-classic ad, Will Brooke, a candidate for Alabama's 6th Congressional District, sets up a 1-foot-thick copy of the Affordable Care Act for target practice. Then he starts blasting away.

YouTube

""We're down here to have a little fun today and talk about two serious subjects — the Second Amendment and see how much damage we can do to this copy of Obamacare,"" he says.

Though Brooke did considerable damage to a publication from the Government Printing Office, he lost the Republican primary.

Guns are powerful political symbols this year because the gun rights crowd is on high alert. After mass shootings in the past two years in Newtown, Conn., and Aurora, Colo., they believe the Obama administration wants to come for their guns. Conservative candidates have piled on.

In Texas, GOP Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst — who ran for renomination and lost — had a poster with the phrase ""Come and take it"" superimposed on a rifle.

Even Wendy Davis, the liberal Democrat running for governor of Texas, had to come out and say she's for open carry of handguns.

""Candidates respond to public opinion, and when that's one of the questions they get asked a lot — 'Where do you stand on the Second Amendment?' — then they're gonna tend to get the point that not only are guns not a liability, but they actually can be a plus,"" says Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.

Candidates have raffled off weapons as a campaign gimmick in local, state and national races.

And the shooting range is becoming the new country club for some Republicans. Former New Mexico Republican Party chairman Allen Weh is running for the U.S. Senate. His press secretary, Paige McKenzie, said they held a fundraiser at a shooting range in Albuquerque to stress the difference between Weh and the incumbent, Democratic Sen. Tom Udall, on gun rights.

""Since Allen is a retired Marine colonel, we thought that this would be a fun and unique event for supporters to come out and shoot with the colonel,"" McKenzie says.

So what's going on here?

""Firearms are a very convenient shorthand in the Republican Party,"" says Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York in Cortland and author of five books on guns and politics in America.

It's not that every candidate who brandishes a firearm will become a crusader for gun rights if elected, Spitzer says. It's symbolic language.

""Having a gun in an advertisement is a way to summarize your opposition to the Democrats, to Barack Obama, your suspicion of big government, your valuing of individualism, and it also expresses a kind of sense of power that is very appealing to base voters in the Republican Party,"" Spitzer says.

Now that the political primary season is mostly over, it remains to be seen whether candidates will use hi-caliber firepower in the general election, where mainstream voters may not be as impressed by belligerent imagery."

Donald Trump addressed the National Rifle Association convention Friday. His past positions on guns have been far more liberal than the NRA.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

As the de facto Republican nominee, Donald Trump is working to shore up support from the party's base. This afternoon, he sought to reassure a group that has consistently turned out for Republican candidates, members of the National Rifle Association. But, as NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, Trump's position on gun rights hasn't always been in line with the NRA.

SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Donald Trump took the stage in Louisville, Ky., moments after receiving the NRA's official endorsement. He wasted no time in going after his likely Democratic rival on gun rights.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Just remember that. We're not talking about changing it. She wants to abolish the Second Amendment. So we're not going to let that happen.

MCCAMMON: Clinton has never called for abolishing the Second Amendment. She wants stricter background checks and to give families of victims the right to sue gunmakers. Trump, though, called Clinton unqualified and predicted that the former secretary of state would appoint justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who would erode their gun rights.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: You know, they keep chipping away. They talk about the magazines. They talk about the bullets. We're going to take care of it.

MCCAMMON: Trump hasn't always opposed stricter weapons laws. In his 2000 book, ""The America We Deserve,"" Trump wrote, quote, ""the Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions."" Trump wrote that he'd support an assault weapons ban and longer waiting periods to buy guns. While running for president, Trump abandoned those positions and fully embraced the NRA.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: When you look at Paris, you know, the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris, nobody had guns but the bad guys.

MCCAMMON: After the Paris terrorist attacks in November, Trump argued on CNN that more guns in the hands of the right people might have reduced the number of casualties. He's made similar arguments about mass shootings last year in San Bernardino, Calif., and at a community college in Oregon. Here he is on NBC's ""Meet The Press.""

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""MEET THE PRESS"")

TRUMP: You can make the case that it would've been a lot better had people had guns because they had something to fire back.

MCCAMMON: Advocates for stricter gun laws argue that would only lead to more deaths. In a conference call hosted by the Democratic National Committee, family members of gun violence victims denounced Trump. Tom Mauser's son, Daniel, was killed in the Columbine High School shooting in 1999.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TOM MAUSER: It seems to me that the GOP has told Trump that this is one issue, this is one place, where he cannot stray, that he has to worship at the altar of the NRA on these issues.

MCCAMMON: Speaking to the NRA, Trump doubled down.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Gun-free zones. We're getting rid of gun-free zones, OK?

MCCAMMON: But guns won't be allowed at this summer's Republican National Convention. Except for law enforcement, they're also not permitted at the White House or on Capitol Hill. Looking ahead, Trump told the crowd the Second Amendment is on the November ballot.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named Donald Trump, OK? I will tell you. I will never let you down. I will protect our Second Amendment.

MCCAMMON: Support from the NRA could help Trump solidify the GOP's conservative base behind him, but this isn't a primary anymore. If he wants to win the presidency, he'll likely need to appeal to more moderate voters. Sarah McCammon, NPR News.

The Supreme Court has weighed in on relatively few gun-related cases. We look at why.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

After the deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., many Americans are calling for action on guns. But Congress says it won't take up gun legislation in the near future. Enter the Supreme Court. The court could, by default, be the answer to setting national parameters on complex issues like who gets access to guns and how. But the court hasn't addressed that many gun-related cases in recent years. So where does it stand on gun control? We brought in NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about that.

NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Nice to see you.

MONTAGNE: Nice to see you. Now let's start with, when was the last time the court issued a major ruling on guns?

TOTENBERG: Well, you know, it's kind of interesting. For most of American history, the legal consensus was that the right to bear arms was not an individual right but a right for the militia, those called up for military service. In fact, I remember Chief Justice Burger, who was a conservative chief justice, saying that the idea that there was an individual right was really ridiculous. But that changed with some scholarly work and pressure and cases brought by gun rights advocates. And in 2008, in the Heller decision, the court said that there is an individual constitutional right to have a handgun in one's home for self-protection. And two years later, in a second case, the court made clear that its decision applied to the states as well as the federal government.

MONTAGNE: With all the talk of guns lately, Nina, you do have one side calling for more restrictions. You have another taking a hard line. But what is the court saying? Is there an absolute right to bear arms in this country or not?

TOTENBERG: No, there isn't. The court is saying that there's an individual right to bear arms, made clear that there are limitations on that right, just as there are limitations on other constitutional rights. You have a First Amendment right to free speech, but you can't yell fire in a crowded theater. You can't even parade loudly through a residential area at 2 in the morning. Similarly here, the court said in 2008 that the right to bear arms does not mean that the government can't ban firearms for felons, for the mentally ill. It doesn't mean you can't ban guns in sensitive places, like schools and government buildings. And it doesn't mean that there can't be conditions and qualifications for the commercial sale of firearms. And in addition, the court also seemed to say that particularly dangerous and unusual weapons could be prohibited, like military assault-style weapons.

MONTAGNE: Well, you know, is there a view, then, of the Second Amendment that might make the court more prone to leave this particular issue up to the states?

TOTENBERG: Not really, necessarily. I think we have to assume one of two things from this continued refusal to act - that the court believes it laid down guidelines in 2008 in the Heller decision and would just as soon stay out of this. Or more likely that neither side, those justices who support strict gun regulation laws or those who oppose them - neither side is sure that they have the votes to prevail if the court were to take up those issues. After all, Heller was 5 to 4 with Justice Kennedy casting the deciding vote. And it's possible also that there are some justices, especially in light of current circumstances, who have evolving views on all of this.

MONTAGNE: We are coming up on the first anniversary of Neil Gorsuch's term on the court, President Trump's appointee. What might his presence on the court mean on this issue?

TOTENBERG: Well, I think we've seen a few hints that he is certainly one of the staunch advocates for gun rights. And where he would draw the line is not entirely clear, but he did dissent with Justice Thomas in at least one of these cases that the court declined to hear. It takes only four votes to grant a case. It doesn't take a majority of the court to hear a case. And there haven't been four votes to do that.

MONTAGNE: NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, nice to have you.

TOTENBERG: Nice to be here.

Since the mass killing at a Parkland, Fla., high school earlier this month, many teachers have called on their state pension funds to sell their stakes in gun-makers. Private investment firms including BlackRock and Blackstone are reviewing their firearms investments in response to clients' demands.

But even those sympathetic to their position say divesting from those companies doesn't lead to industry change.

Many state pension funds that invest on behalf of public employees and teachers own shares in firearms manufacturers passively — they own their stakes primarily because they are included in broad market index funds that pensions invest in.

""I'm currently urging my colleagues to divest in retail and wholesale suppliers of weapons that are banned for possession or sale in the state of California,"" says State Treasurer John Chiang, who sits on the boards of his state's two largest pension funds — CalPERS for public employees and CalSTRS for teachers.

He is urging pensions across the country to sell off their investments in gun-makers and gun retailers.

""We can make a clear and powerful signal that the inaction by Congress is heartless, it's intolerable, and there are people who want to make sure that kids aren't losing their lives,"" Chiang says.

CalSTRS — the California State teachers retirement fund — sold off its stake in publicly traded gun manufacturers, including Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands (formerly Smith & Wesson) in 2013, following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

""After the Sandy Hook disaster, our board took a look at particularly firearms, and decided there are certain companies that made firearms that were already illegal in the state of California, and felt that that regulation may expand and hurt those companies. And so we divested of them,"" says Christopher Ailman, CalSTRS's chief investment officer.

But that was a purely financial decision, he says, not a moral one.

As managers of people's money, Ailman says pensions are bound by fiduciary obligations — that is, the goal of a pension is to preserve and grow assets.

Over the decades, CalSTRS has divested from other industries — including tobacco and coal. Ailman says the fund decided to divest because it anticipated stricter regulation, which would hurt those companies' sales. And in each of those cases, he says the fund's sell-off had zero impact on the companies' products or strategy.

""We had to write them a letter and tell them we no longer own their stock and wouldn't in the future, and I can tell you, they don't care,"" Ailman says.

Despite its public popularity, divesting is not a proxy for policy change, he says.

""I care about many of these issues personally, very deeply, and want to bring about social change, and I just am frustrated that activists are wasting their time focusing in on this as a mechanism when it's not effective,"" he says.

When it comes to economic pressure, social advocates say it's much more important for consumers to target the company's bottom line than for investors to divest.

Over the past week, the #BoycottNRA campaign has gained steam, leading airlines, hotels, banks and insurance companies to sever their discount programs with members of the National Rifle Association.

Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says she wants to see the campaign expanded to include a broad consumer boycott of retailers that have lax policies on gun sales.

""If Big 5 or Camping World or Dick's Sporting Goods won't adopt sensible practices related to selling guns, then people shouldn't buy their soccer cleats and footballs and other equipment at those stores, either,"" she says.

Denying those companies business affects their profitability, which in turn may affect store policies, whereas investors who sell off their shares simply lose their rights as shareholders, Gardiner says.

""One of those rights is to get information about the company. Another is to attend an annual meeting, and vote for the directors,"" she says. ""Shareholders can introduce shareholder resolutions; they can inspect the books and records of companies — so those are rights that investors might forgo, if they decided to divest out of gun companies.""

So far, few pensions are doing so, says Alex Brown, research manager for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

""Markets today are global, and generally for every seller, there's a willing buyer,"" he says."

The RAND Corporation has published an unflattering report about U.S. gun policy. It identified only 62 studies testing the effectiveness of policies such as background checks and buying restrictions.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

As we continue the conversation about guns in this country, we thought it would be useful to look at what, if anything, the research shows over the last two years. The nonprofit RAND Corporation has analyzed thousands of studies to try to evaluate the results of specific gun policies - whether, for example, certain policies led to a decrease in homicide or suicide.

NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher has looked into this, and she is with us now. Rebecca, thanks for joining us.

REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Of course. Thanks so much.

MARTIN: So what specifically was RAND looking for? Were there specific outcomes they were testing for?

HERSHER: Yeah. They were looking for two kinds of outcomes. So one is safety-based. So do these policies actually lead to fewer homicides, suicides, things like accidental injuries or deaths? And the other type is rights. So these are things like, do policies lead to less hunting? Did they lead to less recreational gun use, less defensive gun use by civilians, for example?

MARTIN: So is there a big takeaway from all this research that RAND analyzed?

HERSHER: Yeah. So the big takeaway is there is not a lot of data. They looked at some very popular gun policies - so things like permitting laws that require people to take gun safety classes to own a gun, age restrictions, mental health restrictions, gun-free zones around schools and public buildings. And they found basically very little rigorous research about whether these policies do or don't work. So this is how the study leader, Andrew Morral, put it.

ANDREW MORRAL: Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on we didn't find any evidence on.

HERSHER: So that's evidence that policies did anything good or bad. It's not that these policies don't work. It's that science can't tell us much about whether they work.

MARTIN: Now, there's been a lack of federal funding for research on gun violence because of interest group lobbying, frankly. I mean, this is something that was brought to light again after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So even as RAND analyzes these studies that do exist, is it really presenting a full picture of anything?

HERSHER: You're right. And it tells us more about what we don't know than what we do know. I think one interesting thing that they found is - they did this big survey in addition to analyzing studies. They asked people who consider themselves experts from all across the political spectrum what they think about the goals of gun policies, what those are. And this is what Andrew Morral found.

MORRAL: I think people on either side of gun policy debates often suspect that the other side has misplaced values or that it's a values problem in any case and that they prioritize things that should be of secondary importance. And that's not what we find. We find that the two sides appear to prioritize the same things in the same order.

HERSHER: So for example, whether you work for a gun rights group or a gun control group, left or right of center politically, the vast majority of experts say their primary objective or the primary objective of gun policies in general should be reducing suicides and homicides. So protecting privacy, making sure people can use guns to hunt or for recreation, even preventing mass shootings - most people agree those are not primary priorities.

MARTIN: So they found that there was actually a broad agreement on the goals of gun policies. That's interesting.

HERSHER: Yeah, and very few facts to figure out how to proceed to achieve those goals.

MARTIN: That's NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher. Becky, thank you.

HERSHER: Thanks.

Guns And The Trump Slump Guns And The Trump Slump Listen · 7:25 7:25

Sales of firearms have soared in America over the past twenty years. But fewer people are purchasing.

Today America's guns are concentrated in the hands of a comparatively small number of enthusiasts.

Their love of add-ons and special features has been a boon to gun manufacturers. Their periodic fear of anti-gun regulation has made sales spike in the past. But relying on a concentrated market of mega-buyers can come at a cost.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

A group of teenagers who say they are desperate for some action on gun control staged a silent ""lie-in"" outside the White House Monday, in the wake of the deadly Florida school shooting last week.

The event was organized over Facebook by a group called Teens for Gun Reform, which listed their intentions in a post: ""By doing this, we will make a statement on the atrocities which have been committed due to the lack of gun control, and send a powerful message to our government that they must take action now.""

Dozens of students assuming the pose of corpses lay on the sidewalk in view of the White House, with their arms crossed over the chests.

The somber protests lasted only a few minutes ""in order to symbolize how quickly someone, such as the Parkland [Florida] shooter, is able to purchase a gun in America,"" organizers wrote, alluding to Nikolas Cruz, who, according to court documents, confessed to firing on unarmed students and teachers with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle.

The Valentine's Day rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 dead and 15 wounded.

""We must stand together in solidarity as the younger generations, and show our legislators that we demand reform in order to feel safer in our classrooms,"" the group declared on Facebook.

The D.C. area group is part of a groundswell of students across the country challenging politicians they argue have failed to make schools a safe haven from gun violence. They are organizing rallies and a national walkouts demanding stronger gun laws.

Students from the Florida high school are planning a massive rally against school and gun violence called ""March for Our Lives"" in Washington D.C. on March 24.

Smaller rallies and protests are being organized in cities around the U.S.

""We're going to have, in every major city, somewhere that people all across the country can go to,"" Brendan Duff, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School told NPR.

He said students ""want to feel engaged, and they want to work they're doing something to help. And this is it.""

The Women's March youth branch, EMPOWER, is also organizing a national school walk out on March 14, the one month anniversary of the Florida shooting. CNN says the rallies are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in every time zone and last for 17 minutes — one for each victim who lost their life in the massacre.

Meanwhile, the White House says President Trump will host a listening session with high school students and teachers on Wednesday and meet with state local security officials on Thursday."

Rachel Martin talks to South Miami Mayor Phil Stoddard who wants to pass gun control measures in his city following last week's mass shooting, but Florida law prohibits local firearm regulations.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

All this week, we've heard the voices of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School - survivors of the mass shooting there - calling for tighter gun control, like student Cameron Kasky.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

CAMERON KASKY: As much as we love thoughts and prayers, we don't need them from our lawmakers. We need action, and we demand it. And we're going to get it.

MARTIN: Yet across the state of Florida, local leaders hoping to pass new gun control measures have found that their hands are tied. Like many states, Florida prohibits cities and counties from imposing their own gun control rules. If elected officials implement new restrictions, they can be fined and removed from office by the governor. Earlier this week, I spoke to Philip Stoddard. He is a Democrat and the mayor of South Miami. And I started by asking him what gun control measures he would like to see implemented.

PHILIP STODDARD: Mayors across Florida are calling for four different sets of changes. One is to raise the minimum age of gun purchases and possession - and same for ammunition - to the age of 21. We would like to see red-flag laws to allow protection orders. We want to eliminate the loopholes and private transfer of weapons. And we want background checks for all sales and transfers of firearms. We'd like to place restrictions on the sale and transfer of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And, of course, we're not too happy about the state's punitive regulations of lawmakers such as myself at the local level.

MARTIN: What would happen if you, as the mayor of South Miami, just went for it, just made those changes to affect your constituents?

STODDARD: Well, in the past, the city commission passed an ordinance that required trigger locks. And the NRA sued. And the Third District Court of Appeal voided the city's regulation. If I were to do that today, I would face fines and possible removal by the governor.

MARTIN: So Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz actually sponsored this prohibition rule back in 2011. And he said at the time that if each municipality was allowed to develop its own gun regulations - that - and I'm quoting here - ""someone crossing county lines could become a criminal.""

STODDARD: Well, I mean, the difficulties of enforcement is entirely a different issue. I mean, really, the question is, should people be allowed to bring assault weapons into Miami-Dade County, where I live? And I'd say the answer is no.

MARTIN: Did South Miami have to roll back any regulations when the law was first passed?

STODDARD: We'd had the one regulation on trigger locks. And that had already been voided by the Third District Court of Appeals. I will, however, add that a city commissioner, Jay Beckman, had a shotgun that he'd gotten for self-defense. He had disassembled it. His son found the parts, reassembled them and shot Jay to death in the shower one morning. If Jay'd had a trigger lock on that gun, Jay would still be alive.

MARTIN: That's a horrific story. Is there a chance that you would flout the state law and pass some of these gun control measures despite the risk?

STODDARD: I don't see any point in doing that. I think the real point at this point is to change the state law.

MARTIN: Philip Stoddard is the mayor of South Miami. Thank you so much for making the time to talk with us.

STODDARD: Thanks for having me on.

This week marked the official deadline for more than 370,000 handgun owners in the state of New York to register those guns with state police. New York is trying to use that information to build a comprehensive record of gun owners — something only one other state has done. The database that California started in 2007 has gotten mixed reviews.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has said he wants to make sure that people who can't legally own guns – those with criminal convictions, serious mental health issues, or active restraining orders — aren't somehow falling through the cracks and holding onto their firearms.

Anyone who took out a handgun license in New York before 2013 — the year the state passed a landmark gun control law — had to contact state police by Jan. 31 or risk criminal charges. That's caused a real backlash, particularly among rural gun owners, who don't entirely trust their state's intentions.

A commonsense plan?

The Albany Gun Show is a winter fixture in upstate New York. On the show's opening day in mid-January, Tom King, president of the NRA-affiliated New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, posted up beyond all the folding tables stacked with rifles and holsters.

King said he spent hours and hours answering a question that seemed to be on everyone's mind. ""People are saying, 'Do I have to register or don't I have to register?' So yeah,"" King said. ""There is a lot of confusion.""

The confusion, he said, is about why the state of New York wants information for its new handgun database. It's actually been on the books since 2013.

In the months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, several states adopted tougher gun control measures. New York passed a law known as the SAFE Act, which banned most assault weapons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he wanted to go even further.

YouTube

""We'll have for the first time a statewide handgun database that will allow the state, allow local officials to check periodically,"" Cuomo said. The plan lawmakers approved calls for detailed information on hundreds of thousands of legally licensed handgun owners and their weapons – down to make, model and serial numbers. Some of that information was already available on gun permit applications filed at county clerk's offices across the state, but it was often outdated or incomplete.

State police will build a database they can check against criminal records, alerts filed by mental health professionals, and restraining orders. Only law enforcement can see the information, not the public.

Cuomo described it as a system based on commonsense. ""You don't want criminals and people who are mentally ill to have guns,"" he said. Once the law passed, state police began collecting information from every person who applied for a new handgun permit.

""You can't make them criminals.""

The SAFE Act has been popular in urban areas, according to polling data. But some rural gun owners have resisted from the beginning. As the first big handgun registration deadline approached this winter, for people who got their guns prior to 2013, the pushback grew more intense.

Talk radio host Bill Robinson has lashed out at the state on ""The Second Amendment Radio Show,"" which he hosts for a small station near Rochester. ""The government shouldn't have master lists of us gun owners and the specific guns we have,"" Robinson said on a recent episode. ""They don't need it!""

National Does Increased Gun Ownership Help Decrease Crime? Does Increased Gun Ownership Help Decrease Crime? Listen · 4:33 4:33

A lot of gun owners are angry. While they can agree that so-called ""bad guys"" shouldn't have access to weapons, some fear that New York is trying to turn them into those bad guys. It goes back to the penalties associated with this registration process. The SAFE Act says failure to register handguns is a felony offense — and gun permits are automatically revoked.

""You just can't do that to people that live in your state, that are lawful gun owners,"" Tom King said. ""You can't make them, overnight, criminals.""

King is most worried about those who had handguns before the 2013 law went into effect, but all handgun owners will have to check back in every five years.

No response from 81,000 gun owners

As of the deadline, more than 81,000 people – or 20 percent of affected handgun owners in New York – haven't responded to the state's request. But New York State Police spokesman Beau Duffy argues that concern about this gun database has been overblown. He said felony charges are off the table for now. ""We're not going to take criminal enforcement action, particularly with those people who were unaware of this re-certification process,"" Duffy said.

The next big question is how this registry is going to be used and who's going to follow up with gun owners. Laura Cutilletta, legal director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, believes it could be a game-changer for police.

""This kind of tool seems like something law enforcement would really welcome and would make a priority if they can,"" Cutilletta said. ""Because to know who is determined to be dangerous already and has a gun — I mean, what better information could you give law enforcement than something like that?""

But Cutilletta doesn't think these systems will start popping up nationwide. They're too expensive, she said. New York set aside $28 million for its database, and California tucked away $24 million.

Instead, Cutilletta said, she and other gun control advocates are pushing for new kinds of restraining orders – called ""extreme risk protection orders."" They allow families and police to take their concerns to court and request permission from a judge to take guns away from people who could potentially do harm.

California, Washington and Oregon have already passed legislation allowing these protection orders. New York's lawmakers are considering a similar bill this year."

Last week's shooting in Parkland, Fla., echoed in the state's Capitol on Wednesday, as student survivors lobbied their legislature to pass stricter gun laws. Gun policy had already become a central issue in Florida's current legislative session after the shooting. But the effects of the shooting are reaching beyond the state's borders into legislatures across the country.

There are thousands of gun-related bills in statehouses — some would expand access to guns by easing permit restrictions and others aim to take guns out of the hands of people with domestic violence convictions, mental health issues or others who pose a threat.

The recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 has pushed some statehouses and state candidates deeper into the gun debate. Some are moving to bury bills that were already in the works, while others are gaining traction on measures that previously languished.

Here's a look at some of what's happening in statehouses across the country.

California claimed a victory on Tuesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court punted on a Second Amendment case once again. It declined to hear a challenge to that state's 10-day waiting period to buy guns, reaffirming that states have wide authority to set their own gun laws.

Kentucky legislators say they won't consider gun control proposals, but a bill allowing teachers and staff to be armed has gained traction, as Louisville Public Radio's Ryland Barton reported. The bill would allow schools to tap teachers and staff as school marshals, as long as they have a conceal-carry permit.

In Iowa, the Senate advanced a bill one day after the Parkland shooting requiring school districts to create active shooter safety plans, Iowa Public Radio reports. A Senate committee was also considering a bill that would have removed the permit requirement to obtain and carry weapons. The chairperson now says it's a bad time for that legislation.

""It makes me sick what happened down in Florida, but with that said, I did have the votes to move this thing forward and decided after the communication from the governor ... to pull it off the agenda,"" said Brad Zaun, a Republican from Des Moines suburb Urbandale.

An Illinois lawmaker has drafted a proposal in response to Florida's shooting to ban so-called ""ghost guns,"" which are assembled by individuals outside a factory or store. Rep. Martin Moylan, a Democrat, says he also plans to file a measure that would ban AR-15s, a popular semi-automatic rifle. As NPR Illinois reports, Moylan says he does not believe this proposal would be an intrusion on Second Amendment rights. ""Just like prohibiting people to drive 100 miles per hour in a car, there has to be rules and control.""

Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich has softened his stance on gun control in recent months and this week called on President Trump to pass ""common-sense gun laws."" He recounted a conversation with a friend who owns guns on CNN. ""If all of a sudden you couldn't buy an AR-15, what would you lose? Would you feel your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn't buy a goddarn AR-15? These are things that have to be looked at and action has to happen,"" he said.

It's unclear what that action will look like in his own state, though. As WOSU reports, there are 22 pieces of legislation related to guns pending in the Ohio legislature, including bills to ban bump stocks and strengthen background checks.

Kucinich plans to lobby the state legislature and called for city councils to ban assault-style weapons with high-capacity magazines, WOSU reports. That will be a tough sell, though. Ohio passed a law in 2006, which was upheld by the state Supreme Court, prohibiting cities from passing restrictive gun laws like an assault weapons ban or handgun registration requirements.

Kansas' statehouse was considering a bill that would have instituted gun violence restraining orders like California and Washington. The legislators say now is not the right time to talk about guns.

And as KCUR's Jim McLean reports, a Kansas congressional candidate Tyler Tannahill drew criticism online after he decided to go through with a giveaway of an AR-15 rifle, similar to the one used in the Florida shooting. Tannahill also touted a training program for arming teachers.

Nearly 50 gun-related bills have been introduced in Michigan since January 2017, the Detroit Free Press reports. The majority of those would expand access to guns and have stalled in committees. But Republican Rep. Jim Runestad tells the paper that a two bills dealing with removing guns from people with mental health issues could get a second look from his committee. ""What are we going to do to make sure people who are severely unbalanced are not given access to weapons?"" Runestad said.

In Idaho, bills to ease gun permitting are moving forward without hesitation. These include allowing anyone 21 or older to carry concealed weapons and allowing any Idaho resident to carry concealed weapons.

Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters, KCUR's Jim McLean, Michigan Radio's Rick Pluta, WCPN's Nick Castele, KBSX's Jimmy Dawson and NPR Illinois' Brian Mackey of NPR's statehouse collaborative contributed to this report."

Editor's note: This story was originally published in October and has been republished with updates following the shooting Wednesday in Florida.

It was the deadliest school shooting since a gunman took 26 lives at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newton, Conn. On Wednesday, a shooter killed at least 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

The Florida shooting is the latest reminder of the persistent gun violence in the United States. Rates of gun deaths in the U.S. are far greater than in much of the rest of the world.

Take countries with the top indicators of socioeconomic success — income per person and average education level, for instance. The United States ranks ninth in the world among them, bested only by the likes of Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Iceland, Andorra, Canada and Finland.

Those countries all also enjoy low rates of gun violence, but the U.S. has the 31st highest rate in the world: 3.85 deaths due to gun violence per 100,000 people in 2016. That was eight times as high as the rate in Canada, which had 0.48 deaths per 100,000 people — and 27 times higher than the one in Denmark, which had 0.14 deaths per 100,000.

The numbers comes from a massive database maintained by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which tracks lives lost in every country, in every year, by every possible cause of death. The 2016 figures, released last fall, paint a fairly rosy picture for much of the world, with deaths due to gun violence rare even in many countries that are extremely poor — such as Bangladesh and Laos, which saw 0.16 deaths and 0.13 deaths respectively per 100,000 people.

Prosperous Asian countries such as Singapore and Japan boast the absolute lowest rates, though the United Kingdom and Germany are in almost as good shape.

""It is a little surprising that a country like ours should have this level of gun violence,"" says Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health and epidemiology at the IHME. ""If you compare us to other well-off countries, we really stand out.""

Loading...

To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States — particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. Mokdad says a major driver is the large presence of gangs and drug trafficking. ""The gangs and drug traffickers fight amongst themselves to get more territory, and they fight the police,"" says Mokdad. And citizens who are not involved are often caught in the crossfire.

Loading...

Mokdad said drug trafficking may also be a driving factor in two Asian countries that have unusually large rates of violent gun deaths for their region, the Philippines and Thailand.

Loading...

With the casualties due to armed conflicts factored out, even in conflict-ridden regions such as the Middle East, the U.S. rate is worse than in all but one country: Iraq.

Loading...

The U.S. gun violence death rate is also higher than that in nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including many that are among the world's poorest.

Loading...

One more way to consider these data: The IHME also estimates what it would expect a country's rate of gun violence deaths to be based solely on its socioeconomic status. By that measure, the U.S. should be seeing only 0.79 deaths per 100,000 people. Instead, its actual rate of 3.85 deaths per 100,000 is almost five times as high."

There is a pistol-packing revolution going on in America. Nearly 13 million Americans have permits to carry concealed handguns — triple the number just nine years ago — and that figure is low because not every state reports.

It's puzzling that so many Americans are choosing to arm themselves at a time when the FBI tells us violent crime and property crime have been falling dramatically for two decades.

In search of handgun permit holders, I drove out to the Texas Firearms Festival, an outdoor gun extravaganza held near Austin where firearms fanciers get to shoot everything they see.

I'm not saying that being armed is gonna save your life, but at least you have an effective tool to mount some kind of defense.

""If you're in Paris and you see people coming with AKs into your rock concert, that sucks. But it sucks worse if you're unarmed,"" says festival producer Robert Farago. ""I'm not saying that being armed is gonna save your life, but at least you have an effective tool to mount some kind of defense.""

High school counselor Janna Delany, who carries a Ruger LC9, is more concerned about crime than mass shootings.

""It's more just for me personally to give myself a little bit of peace of mind, somebody trying to carjack me or hold me up at a gas station or stopped at a red light or something,"" Delany says.

Retired Houston homicide detective Brian Foster has a booth at the festival where he sells ""politically incorrect"" books.

""Police cannot take care of citizens,"" he says. ""They react after the fact. I spent many years dealing with cadavers.""

How Does Carrying A Gun Change You?

One thing is certain: Carrying around a loaded weapon and being prepared at a moment's notice to use deadly force changes how people perceive their environment. Of the 20 handgun carriers I interviewed over several months, most of them say they're more aware of how people look and how they act.

""I pay attention to different people, weird people, maybe stereotype people,"" says Sam Blackburn, a diesel mechanic from Georgetown, Texas, who attended the firearms fest in an NRA cap. He carries a 9 mm Smith & Wesson.

What is he looking for, specifically?

""Gangbanger-looking guys, maybe guys that look like they're up to no good or somebody that may think they're a Muslim extremist or something like that,"" Blackburn says.

Carrying a 2-pound steel appliance around like a cellphone doesn't only change the way a person thinks, it changes the way they move.

""It's exciting. I won't lie to you. There's some visceral response that you get from carrying a firearm,"" says Doug Miller. He owns a small IT company in Austin and teaches Israeli self-defense classes on the side. ""But after about 30 seconds, it becomes, 'Is this gonna be comfortable when I sit down? It's digging into my hip because my car has upholstered seats. That's really not that comfortable.' ""

What Do Women Think About Guns?

A Girl & A Gun is a women's shooting league that started in Central Texas and has now gone national.

Executive Director Robyn Sandoval says carrying a handgun has become an extension of motherhood, a way to protect her children.

""Family situational awareness is a big deal,"" she says. ""When we go to a restaurant, my 9-year-old [is thinking] who looks suspicious? What are people doing? What's an anomaly. Let's point out people in their cars. We make a game of it, of who can find somebody in their car just sitting there.""

The gun girls talk about their firearms differently than men do. Guys speak of them as tools; these women talk about them like pets.

""We name our guns,"" Sandoval says, ""I have Francesca, Dolly, Gracie. And we talk about 'em like, 'I'm takin' Gracie to the mall with us.'

""My small one is my Baby,"" says schoolteacher Bettylane Chambliss. ""And my dad will say, 'Do you have your gun with you?' And I went, 'Oh, yeah, I got Baby with me. I'm fine.' ""

When Can You Pull The Trigger?

Despite the pet names, there's nothing casual about getting a license to carry a pistol.

A gun in the home? The owner may have it primarily for hunting or target-shooting. A concealed gun out in public? It goes with the explicit understanding that the owner may kill someone they feel threatened by.

Michael Cargill, a popular handgun instructor in Austin, had this to say: ""You pull that gun out, your life is gonna change."" He's right.

Of the millions of Americans who get a concealed handgun permit, only a tiny fraction ever use them. Pro-gun folks compare it to a fire extinguisher in the home — you have it just in case.

But what happens when someone actually fires their weapon in self-defense? I met three concealed handgun permit (CPL) holders in Detroit who pulled the trigger.

Life-Changing And Traumatic: Darrell Standberry

""I was parked at the pump right in front of the gas station. I exited my vehicle and before I could even get to the door of the gas station, the young man was already sitting in the driver's seat of my vehicle,"" says Standberry, who just earned a degree in green energy technology. He'd left his Yukon XL running with the key in the ignition.

He says he told the young man to get out of his car. The young man told him to step back. That's when Standberry says he saw the carjacker reach toward his pocket.

Standberry unholstered his Sig Sauer .45, reached through the passenger-side window, and fired one shot. He hit the carjacker in the torso. Gravely wounded, the carjacker drove away, crashed into a tree and died. Police found a pistol in his pocket.

""It changed a lot in my life,"" he says. ""Matter of fact, in my English class, I just did a report on it. I named it, 'The incident that changed my life forever.' ""

Standberry went to counseling. He became fearful of gas stations. And he carried the burden of killing a 19-year-old.

""You know why? Because my son was 19 at the same time. It really bothered me that I had to take a 19-year-old's life. His life was just beginning. But he was into the wrong things. To this day, I still ask God for forgiveness,"" he says.

Caught In A Gunfight: Alaina Gonville

Gonville is a mother of three, a big woman who works as a bouncer at a Detroit bar.

Gonville was coming home from work late at night. She'd stopped at a store for a bottle of papaya juice. A scrawny guy walked up, pulled out a pistol and demanded her money. His accomplices were watching from a car behind him. As it happened, Alaina was carrying her pistol openly on her hip.

""I'm assuming they saw my gun. That's when they opened fire from their vehicle. I heard the gunshots coming at me. That's when I pulled my gun and returned fire,"" she says.

She doesn't know if she hit them or not. The robber bolted. His henchmen sped out of the parking lot, spraying Gonville and her car with military-grade bullets.

""I got shot with an AK-47, and it basically blew my arm off. It was dangling. I carried it into the hospital. After four surgeries and a lot of prayer it's healed about 70 percent,"" she says.

Did she think that having a handgun that night saved her life or endangered her more?

""That's a good question. I replayed the situation in my head over and over. I can't say, but I'm glad I had it,"" she says.

In Trouble For Thwarting Shoplifters: Tatiana Rodriguez

Born in Colombia, Rodriguez owns a small tree-trimming business in a Detroit suburb. Last October, she was outside a Home Depot loading some materials into her truck.

""A lady comes screaming through the door for help, and somebody [was] running,"" she says.

A man was running into the parking lot pushing a shopping cart full of merchandise. Rodriguez used to work at Home Depot, and she knows the company policy: Don't pursue shoplifters. But she says she thought this was more serious because a lady was screaming.

She saw the shoplifters getting away in an SUV. She had her Heckler and Koch 9 mm.

""So I take my gun out and I point at the car when he was coming towards us. I jump to the side and decide to shoot out the tires to stop them,"" she says.

In Michigan, it's illegal for a citizen to use deadly force to stop a property crime. Rodriguez got 18 months of probation for reckless discharge of a weapon and had her gun license revoked. She thinks the punishment would have been harsher, but the cops caught the shoplifters after she shot out their tires.

Her story got lots of news coverage. It turned into a case study of when not to use your pistol.

""It was not my intention to do anything wrong. I was just trying to help somebody who really needed it. And it backfired on me. So what do you learn? It's like you have to think a lot before you help somebody,"" she says.

For this story, I contacted firearms instructors and lawyers who reached out to dozens of handgun carriers who had pulled the trigger in self-defense. To my surprise, very few wanted to talk.

Some had been arrested by the police or sued afterward, and had spent thousands of dollars on legal fees. They didn't want to be dragged into the media spotlight again. Others were just traumatized by the whole experience.

Gonville urges people to think long and hard before they carry a gun.

""A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it's cool to have a gun,"" she says. ""It's not just about being cool. It's real life. Life and death is serious. Getting shot is serious. Shooting somebody is serious.""

Is It Safer To Carry A Gun?

An eye-opening Gallup poll released late last year revealed that 56 percent of respondents said they'd feel safer if more Americans could get permits to carry concealed handguns. Jennifer Carlson, a sociologist at the University of Toronto, wrote a book about handgun carriers in Michigan called Citizen-Protectors.

A lot of times I believe people are just playing around and they think it's cool to have a gun. It's not just about being cool. It's real life. Life and death is serious.

""This is what I think is really fascinating,"" she says. ""It's not just the idea of if I conceal carry then I'm safer. It's the idea that if I just imagine there's people out there who are conceal carrying then the world is safer.""

All the trigger pullers I talked to for this story said the range time required to get a handgun license is grossly inadequate in terms of being prepared to defend themselves from an active shooter. They believe they're alive today because they did extensive practice on their own.

Mark Cortis, a veteran firearms instructor in Detroit, urges all of his CPL students to get more training. But he says hardly any of them ever do.

Planet Money Gun Lovers And Critics Agree: They're Not Sold On Smart Guns Gun Lovers And Critics Agree: They're Not Sold On Smart Guns Listen · 3:38 3:38

""One of my concerns about the [Michigan] state requirements for getting a CPL is they don't really include the tactics and the strategy that one will need to win or prevail in an actual gun situation,"" Cortis says. ""A hostile attack by a violent criminal is a fight.""

Not only are most handgun carriers in America totally unprepared for a gunfight, but gun-control activists hasten to point out that more guns lead to more suicides and accidental shootings.

Three years ago, Detroit's new police chief, James Craig, made a startling public announcement. He encouraged law-abiding citizens to consider carrying concealed weapons as a deterrent to violent crime.

In an interview, I asked Chief Craig if he ever worries about the citizens that he has urged to arm themselves?

""What concerns me, more than anything else, is guns in the hands of criminals, guns in the hands of terror suspects. That's what keeps me up at night. Not armed citizens,"" Craig says.

Meanwhile, Cortis reports so many Detroiters are seeking concealed pistol permits, classes are booked for two months out."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Darren McCollester/Getty Images Darren McCollester/Getty Images

We want to cut through the spin with a new feature we're calling ""Break It Down.""

Break It Down is going to be a regular part of our campaign coverage. We're going to try some new things. It might read a little differently from time to time. But our goal is to zoom in on what the candidates are saying, and give you the factual breakdown you need to make a sound judgment.

Hillary Clinton seemed to be barely holding back tears at a town hall in New Hampshire on Monday. Speaking in the aftermath of another tragic mass shooting, this time at an Oregon community college, the Democratic presidential candidate pitched her gun control proposals.

In the middle of her remarks, she made a big claim: She said that gun-makers and sellers are ""the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior."" We decided to see what she was talking about — and whether she's right.

Let's Break It Down.

The Claim:

""So far as I know, the gun industry and gun sellers are the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior. Nobody else is given that immunity. And that just illustrates the extremism that has taken over this debate.""

The Big Question:

Is Clinton right that the gun industry enjoys legal protections that other industries don't?

The Long Answer:

Clinton is wrong that gun companies have zero liability for their goods, but they do have special legal protections against liability that very few other industries enjoy.

To see what she's getting at, you have to back up 10 years. Clinton is talking about a 2005 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA — a law she wants to repeal as part of her gun control proposals.

Lawmakers passed that law in response to a spate of lawsuits that cities filed against the gun industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Those lawsuits often claimed gun-makers or sellers were engaging in ""negligent marketing"" or creating a ""public nuisance.""

In 2000, for example, New York City joined 30 counties and cities in suing gun manufacturers, saying manufacturers should have been making their products safer and also better tracking where their products were sold. Manufacturers, one argument at the time went, should stop supplying stores that sell a lot of guns that end up being used in crimes.

In response to these lawsuits, the NRA pushed for the law, which passed in 2005 with support from both Republicans and Democrats. Then-Sen. Clinton voted against it; her current Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, voted for it.

The law, however, allows for specific cases in which dealers and manufacturers can be held responsible. So that makes Clinton's statement technically incorrect.

""[Clinton's statement] doesn't appear to be completely accurate,"" said Adam Winkler, professor of law at UCLA and author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in an email to NPR. ""The 2005 law does not prevent gun makers from being held liable for defects in their design. Like car makers, gun makers can be sued for selling a defective product. The problem is that gun violence victims often want to hold gun makers liable for the criminal misuse of a properly functioning product.""

In other words: If you aim and fire a gun at an attacker, it's doing what it was intended to do. If it explodes while you shoot and hurts you, though, then you can sue the manufacturer. Likewise, if you had told the gun-store owner you planned to commit a crime with that gun, your victim could potentially sue.

However, Clinton ""is not totally off base,"" said John Goldberg, a professor at Harvard Law School and specialist in tort law. He said Congress was particularly ""aggressive"" in granting the gun industry this legal shield.

""Congress has rarely acted to bar the adoption by courts of particular theories of liability against a particular class of potential defendants, especially when that form of liability has not yet been recognized by the courts,"" he said.

At the time that the law passed, the NRA argued that the industry needed the protection, because — unlike carmakers, for example — it did not have the ""deep pockets"" necessary to fight a slew of lawsuits, as the New York Times reported.

Gun-rights advocates have also argued that suing a gun company for crimes committed with its products is akin to suing a car company for drunken-driving fatalities.

But the issues at hand are more complex, say some legal scholars.

""It's more like — are you a bartender and do you keep on pouring drinks for someone?"" as Fordham University law professor Saul Cornell told NPR. That might be a better way to think about whether manufacturers shouldn't supply certain stores, he says.

For an example of how this plays out, look at Adames v. Beretta. In this case, a 13-year-old boy removed the clip from his father's Beretta handgun, believing that made the gun safe, and then accidentally shot his 13-year-old friend. The victim's family sued Beretta, saying the company could have made the pistol safer and provided more warnings, according to SCOTUSBlog. Citing the PLCAA, the Illinois Supreme Court dismissed Adames' claims, and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear the case.

Victims of gun crimes like the Adames family may or may not have good cases, but PLCAA opponents say plaintiffs should at least be heard in court.

The Broader Context:

Clinton wants to repeal PLCAA as part of her broader gun control agenda, which also includes proposals to close the ""gun-show loophole"" and prevent domestic abusers from obtaining guns.

The law is one of several recent NRA legislative victories that gun control advocates would like to roll back. Recent laws have also stopped Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research on firearms, and they've also stopped researchers from accessing gun trace information, as NPR's Carrie Johnson has reported. Gun-rights advocates say withholding that trace information is about maintaining gun owners' privacy.

At first glance, taking a stand one way or the other on gun control means alienating a big chunk of voters. Democrats have steadily, overwhelmingly, favored gun control over the years, while Republicans have grown increasingly in favor of gun rights in the past decade or so, according to the Pew Research Center.

But then again, getting specific on gun policy might be good for Clinton in two ways. One is that it could endear her to pro-gun-control Democrats (this is one of the few areas where she is to the left of Sanders, her closest Democratic competition), particularly as calls for tougher gun control have grown louder after a long string of mass shootings.

Two, research has also shown that while Americans tend to be in favor of ""gun rights"" broadly, they also tend to favor specific potential gun control regulations, like background checks or assault weapon bans.

The Short Answer:

Clinton is wrong that gun manufacturers have no liability for their products, but she's right that they have unique protections from lawsuits that most other businesses — and particularly consumer product-makers — do not.

North Dakota's Republican governor signed legislation Thursday night that allows people to carry concealed handguns without needing a permit.

This makes North Dakota the latest of about a dozen states to adopt what gun rights proponents often call ""constitutional carry,"" according to the National Rifle Association.

As Dave Thompson of Prairie Public Broadcasting reports, ""The measure allows people 18 and older to carry hidden firearms without having to undergo background checks or training — as long as they're law-abiding citizens."" Anyone who is eligible to possess a Class 2 firearm license and has had a valid driver's license or state ID card for at least a year may carry a concealed firearm.

In a statement, Gov. Doug Burgum said, ""Gun ownership is both a right and a responsibility, and that responsibility begins with individuals and families."" The statement also said the governor ""encouraged anyone considering carrying a concealed weapon to enroll in one of North Dakota's many certified gun safety courses.""

The number of concealed-carry permits in the state has more than doubled in the past five years, to 48,700, according to The Associated Press.

Critics of the legislation had argued that it was already easy to get a concealed-carry permit in North Dakota.

Democratic state Sen. Carolyn Nelson of Fargo said the measure was unnecessary. ""If you can read, you can pass the test,"" she was quoted as saying by the AP.

South Dakota's Republican governor, Dennis Daugaard, vetoed a similar measure in his state earlier this month. In an op-ed in the Rapid City Journal, Daugaard wrote that he could not support ""bad legislation which would lead to a whole host of unintended consequences. The laws we currently have in place are effective, appropriate and minimal.""

Idaho, Mississippi and West Virginia passed similar laws last year, and New Hampshire did so last month."

Mass shootings and police shootings have spurred calls for authorities to take action to reduce the violence. But policymakers may be stymied by the dearth of public health research into both gun violence and deaths that involve the police. One big obstacle: congressional restrictions on funding of such research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Right now, the CDC studies all kinds of violence. There's a program on child abuse and youth violence, and the public health agency collects data on suicides and sexual assaults.

But there are some glaring research gaps. The CDC doesn't systematically collect data on deaths at the hands of law enforcement, and there's actually a law that effectively stops it from doing research on gun violence.

The authorization doesn't explicitly forbid research; rather, it says that no funds may be used ""to advocate or promote gun control."" But scientists got the message that firearms-related research was politically fraught.

Some scientists are looking to change that. ""It's never a good idea to muzzle scientific investigations for political reasons,"" says Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Holt's a physicist who was also a Democratic member of Congress until earlier this year. AAAS last week called for an end to congressional restrictions on gun research at the CDC.

""All the debate for several decades now has been carried out on the basis of opinion and ideology and assertion and political stance, rather than the evidence,"" says Holt.

If the government could collect detailed data on gun violence, researchers might see patterns and come up with interventions that could reduce the number of deaths, researchers say.

Nancy Krieger, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wants to see the same type of data on deaths that involve law enforcement. ""We have an official mystery in the United States as to the number of people who are killed by the police,"" she says.

Police departments sometimes resist reporting the data to the Justice Department, so official information is spotty. ""Why are these only being treated as police data?"" Krieger asks. ""These are mortality records. We in public health count dead people. It's one of the things we do. And we count them in order to understand how to prevent preventable deaths.""

Krieger says that for now the best source of information on gun deaths is a website created by the British newspaper The Guardian. ""It's shocking that we in the U.S. have to turn to a U.K. newspaper's website to get timely reporting about who is being killed by the police. We have better a public health system than that.""

So in a paper published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine, Krieger and several colleagues call for the CDC to declare law-enforcement-related deaths a so-called notifiable condition. That means public health workers — not police — would be required to report such deaths to a state or local agency.

The current limit on CDC research into overall gun violence came about in 1997 after some agency officials suggested the goal was to reduce access to guns.

The National Rifle Association seized on the statements, lobbying Congress to cut funding.

NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide says the organization doesn't want the CDC to advocate for gun bans. ""The NRA is not and never has been opposed to research that promoted the safe and responsible use of firearms and [it works] to reduce gun-related deaths,"" he said.

Former Arkansas Rep. Jay Dickey, who sponsored the original bill restricting gun research, now says the restrictions have gone too far. He told NPR's Steve Inskeep in October:

""It wasn't necessary that all research stop. It just couldn't be the collection of data so that they can advocate gun control. That's all we were talking about. But for some reason, it just stopped altogether.""

Dickey now wants his former colleagues to repeal the limits on CDC research.

But that possibility looks remote. Earlier this year, an amendment to do just that was defeated in a House committee with almost no debate."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Humphrey/AP Mark Humphrey/AP

President Trump signed a measure into law Tuesday that rescinds an Obama-era rule aimed at blocking gun sales to certain mentally ill people.

The GOP-majority Senate passed the bill by a 57-43 margin earlier this month, following a House vote to overturn the rule.

The Obama administration policy ""would have required the Social Security Administration to report the records of some mentally ill beneficiaries to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System,"" as The Two-Way has reported. ""Those who have been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs — roughly 75,000 people — would have been affected by the rule.""

It was strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association, and as NPR's Jessica Taylor reported, ""Republicans argued it infringed upon Second Amendment rights by denying due process.""

As we have reported, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a leading supporter of the rule's repeal, has stated that ""if a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it.""

The rule was written in response to the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot dead 20 students and six teachers. As The Associated Press reported, it was ""crafted as part of Obama's efforts to strengthen the federal background check system"" in the wake of that tragedy.

""We know that people with serious mental illness in this country can go buy a very powerful weapon and do great damage with it,"" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, who represents Newtown, said in a speech to Senate Republicans earlier this month. He said of mentally ill people, ""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect you are going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm?"""

Enlarge this image Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images

By a 57-43 margin, the Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to repeal an Obama-era regulation designed to block certain mentally ill people from purchasing firearms. The vote, which approves a House resolution passed earlier this month, now sends the measure to the White House for President Trump's signature.

President Trump, who campaigned as a defender of gun rights and a friend of the National Rifle Association, is widely expected to sign the measure.

The rule on the verge of rollback would have required the Social Security Administration to report the records of some mentally ill beneficiaries to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Those who have been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs — roughly 75,000 people — would have been affected by the rule, according to NPR's Susan Davis.

It was implemented by former President Obama after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, which saw 20 students and six teachers killed at an elementary school by 20-year-old Adam Lanza. The Hill reports that the rule was set to take effect in December.

Yet GOP lawmakers have argued that the regulation was needlessly heavy-handed, painting people with mental illnesses with too broad a brush and infringing on their constitutional rights. The Associated Press reports that Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a leading Republican critic of the rule, said it is filled with ""vague characteristics that do not fit into the federal mentally defective standard"" prohibiting someone from buying or owning a gun.

""If a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it,"" Grassley said, according to the news service.

The NRA and the American Civil Liberties Union also opposed Obama's rule — the NRA for its restrictions on the Second Amendment, the ACLU for the possibility it would stereotype the mentally ill as violent.

So, seizing its long-awaited moment with a GOP president in the White House, Congress passed Wednesday's ""Resolution of Disapproval"" under the Congressional Review Act, a rarely used maneuver that gives lawmakers a means to overturn federal regulations put in place by the executive branch. The move allows the Senate to proceed with a simple majority, thus enabling GOP senators to avoid a filibuster by Democrats.

The House got that ball rolling two weeks ago; the Senate sent it the rest of the way to President Trump's desk.

Democrats, however, excoriated the legislation as irresponsible.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut where the Sandy Hook massacre occurred, delivered a fiery speech against the measure before Wednesday's vote, The Hill reports:

""The [Congressional Review Act] we have before us today will make it harder for the federal government to do what we have told them to do for decades, which is to put dangerous people and people who are seriously mentally ill on the list of people who are prohibited from buying a gun.""

The AP notes that Murphy added: ""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you're going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Brennan Linsley/AP Brennan Linsley/AP

Shoppers hunting for Black Friday deals seemed to include a record number of those in the market for firearms; the FBI says it fielded 203,086 background check requests for gun purchases on the day after Thanksgiving — the highest daily total ever, reports USA Today.

""Background checks are considered the best available proxy for gun purchases since overall sales numbers are not made public,"" reports NPR's Uri Berliner.

But the number of firearms actually sold on Friday was probably higher than 203,086 because a buyer would require just one check but could purchase multiple firearms in a single transaction.

It is a popular time of year to buy guns. The previous record of 185,713 background checks was set one year earlier on Black Friday.

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is designed to keep guns from falling ""into the wrong hands,"" according to the FBI, although the reality sometimes falls short of the goal.

Federal law bars convicted felons or anyone under a domestic violence protective order from owning a firearm, among other people. The FBI says out of the more than 230 million checks that have been conducted, more than a million denials have been issued. The agency also says the system ""ensures the timely transfer of firearms to eligible gun buyers.""

In the vast majority of cases, the background check takes just a couple of minutes, and if it comes out clean, the buyer walks away with the weapon, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing FBI data. But even if there is a holdup, the consumer may still be able to get the gun promptly. ""In about 8% of cases, the verdict is delayed, and the seller has to wait three days. If there is no verdict after three days, the sale can go through,"" reports the newspaper.

Another loophole: only federally-licensed firearm dealers require background checks. Consumers can get around the rule by making a legal purchase from unlicensed sellers.

Friday's surge in background check requests came two days after Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to do a comprehensive review of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

""The recent shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas revealed that relevant information may not be getting reported to the NICS – this is alarming and it is unacceptable,"" Sessions said in a statement.

The gunman who killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church earlier this month should never have been carrying a gun. He was legally barred from possessing a firearm after being convicted of assaulting his then-wife and baby stepson, while serving in the Air Force.

But the system apparently fell short of flagging him. Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told The Two-Way in an email, ""Initial information indicates that Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations.""

But the system has been struggling under the weight of an exponential increase in background checks in recent years. In 1998, NICS reported fewer than 1 million. By last year, it had conducted more than 27 million — a record.

USA Today reports:

""The mere record of arrest is not enough to prohibit a gun sale, so FBI analysts must race to fill such information gaps within the three-day time period allotted for each check. The search sometimes requires inquiries to police departments, courthouses and prisons across the country to match final dispositions to the incomplete records.""

Despite the rise in firearm sales in recent years, President Trump — who is backed by the National Rifle Association — seems to have actually been bad for gun business. Since his election, the number of background checks dipped down, following a surge in 2016 amid fears that a Hillary Clinton presidency might limit gun sales."

The U.S. and Russia have been taking lots of jabs at each other.

Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized President Obama's plan for a military strike in Syria, and the Russian leader then denounced American ""exceptionalism"" in a biting op-ed in The New York Times.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., fired back Thursday with his own op-ed in the Russian paper Pravda, entitled, ""Russia Deserves Better Than Putin.""

Even Monday's shooting at the Navy Yard in Washington, in which a gunmen killed 12 people, has become part of the feud.

Alexei Pushkov, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's parliament, used the shooting to mock the United States as it was happening.

""A new shootout at Navy headquarters in Washington — a lone gunman and seven corpses. Nobody's even surprised anymore. A clear confirmation of American exceptionalism,"" Puskoy tweeted.

But while Pushkov sneers at U.S. gun laws, how do the stats look in Russia?

According to Gunpolicy.org, Russians have far fewer guns than Americans — and far more homicides.

There are fewer than 13 million firearms in circulation in Russia, compared with an estimated 300 million in the United States. That works out to about 9 guns per 100 people in Russia and closed to 100 guns per 100 people in America.

The most recent homicide statistics for Russia show that there were 21,603 killings in 2009.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Karpov Sergei/ITAR-TASS /Landov Karpov Sergei/ITAR-TASS /Landov

According to the FBI, the United States had 13,636 homicides in 2009 with a population that is more than twice as large. More than 80 percent of those killings were gun-related.

It's difficult to make a direct comparison of gun homicides in the two countries because Russia doesn't break down its murder statistics.

Russian Gun Laws

Russia has tough gun laws on the books. It's illegal for Russian citizens to own automatic and semi-automatic guns. It's possible to apply for a handgun or shotgun license, though citizens are required to provide reasons such as hunting or target shooting.

Applicants face strict background checks, including criminal history, a full psychological evaluation and a medical exam. They must pass a test on firearm laws and safety.

Each weapon is then registered by the police during a home visit. Police take bullet patterns, test bullets and cartridges so bullets can be matched if the gun is used in a crime. A license lasts five years, after which applicants must go through the whole process again.

In spite of these laws, the country does have periodic mass shootings by people thought to be mentally ill.

Last November, after a five-day drinking binge, 30-year-old lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov posted a message online referring to humanity as ""compost.""

Shortly after, he walked into the Moscow pharmaceutical company where he worked and opened fire, killing six colleagues and critically injuring another. He was jailed for life last week.

Move To Ease Gun Laws

The Right to Bear Arms, a Moscow-based organization that has more than 5,000 members, is trying to make guns more easily available in Russia.

""Our citizens are deprived of normal tools of self-defense, and that plays an important role in public safety,"" Maria Butina, the group's 24-year-old founder, told The Moscow News.

But she has a long way to go in convincing the public. A poll by the Levada Center in 2011 showed that 80 percent of Russians are opposed to easing existing gun laws."

Leaders of the National Rifle Association plan to break their weeklong silence Friday and make their first public comments on the mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

They say they will be speaking for the NRA's 4 million members. But they will also be speaking for the gun industry, which has close financial ties to the association.

The NRA and the gun industry are reeling after last week's massacre. The primary weapon used — an AR-15-style rifle — is one of the most popular guns in America.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association of the firearms industry, says those who have AR-15s are among the most passionate gun owners.

Just recently, the foundation put out a video touting the AR-15 as ""probably one of the most customizable rifles there is today."" A gunsmith showed how to add a muzzle flash hider, various sights and other accessories — things the gun is designed to accept easily.

And that captures the strength — and possibly the weakness — of the industry and the NRA.

""What we're seeing is that the industry is trying to think of one new thing to sell to gun owners,"" says Josh Sugarmann, head of the Violence Policy Center, a group seeking tighter gun laws.

Studies show the American gun culture faces long-term problems: too many older white guys; dwindling land for hunting, as suburbs encroach; and kids who pick up video games rather than BB guns.

Sugarmann says industry leaders see the problem. ""They've recognized that the traditional market — traditional hunting rifles and shotguns — is saturated. So there's an ever-shrinking market that's buying more and more lethal weapons,"" he says.

Weapons like the AR-15 — a civilian version of the standard military rifle. The industry-preferred term is ""modern sporting rifle.""

A survey by the Shooting Sports Foundation found that nearly two-thirds of AR-15 owners own more than one.

The NRA and the foundation are trying to expand the market of gun enthusiasts — as with a foundation promo for a program called First Shots. ""If you've never fired a gun before, here's your chance. Your local shooting range wants to give you a shot,"" the promo says. ""You're invited to a free seminar developed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation.""

But those demographic woes are for the long term.

Nima Samadi, an industry analyst at IBISWorld, has a short-term picture. He says that compared with the military and law enforcement segments of the gun industry, ""the consumer segment has seen a pretty aggressive growth, particularly over the past five years.""

One reason: fear of crime. The crime rate has been steadily declining, but it still helps explain the strength in handgun sales.

The other reason — much more powerful — is the fear that if you don't buy that AR-15 now, the Obama administration won't let you buy it later.

""By far, that's the largest driver for the growth,"" Samadi says.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, appeared on Glenn Beck's TV station earlier this month, before Sandy Hook.

""I mean, the strongest defense of the Second Amendment is the marketplace,"" he said. ""And there's no clearer picture about how average American citizens feel about their Second Amendment rights than lines at gun stores all over the country right now because they fear the Obama administration's second term is coming after their freedom.""

All of this has the effect of bringing the quarter-billion-dollar-a-year NRA and the $12 billion-a-year gun industry closer together.

Sturm Ruger, known especially for its handguns, had a yearlong promotion in which it gave the NRA a dollar for each gun sold. The total exceeded $1.2 million.

Beretta USA gave $1 million to support Second Amendment lawsuits.

And the CEO of Cabela's, the big-box chain that sells sports and outdoors gear, gave the NRA $1 million cash. He was inducted into the association's Golden Ring of Freedom for top donors.

It's much too early to tell how the Connecticut massacre will affect things — either financially or legislatively. But right now, gun sales are spiking. Once again, it's the fear of new gun control laws that's moving weapons off the shelves."

There's a national debate going on about gun silencers. On one side is the gun industry and a manufacturer whose motto is guns don't have to be loud. They support a new bill to relax longstanding federal restrictions on silencers, which are also known as suppressors. On the other side are people who say guns should be noisy because it's important for public safety. NPR's Nathan Rott has the story. And just so you know, you will hear the sound of gunshots.

NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: There are about a million registered gun silencers owned by people in the U.S. right now. But unless you own one or know someone who does, Jason Schauble would argue that your perception of silencers is flawed.

JASON SCHAUBLE: Most people know what they see in movies, and they see, oh, it's always a spy.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""GOLDENEYE"")

SEAN BEAN: (As Alec Trevelyan) You're late, 007.

PIERCE BROSNAN: (As James Bond) After you, 006.

SCHAUBLE: You know, somebody who's involved in some sort of combat scenario and then also the sound that it makes.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

SCHAUBLE: It is very, very quiet compared to what really happens.

ROTT: Schauble is a former Marine and an executive at SilencerCo, a leading manufacturer of gun suppressors. And he believes that Hollywood representation of silencers is unfair. It's not about professional assassins using near-silent guns, he says, but the tens of millions of gun owners, recreational shooters and hunters in America who want less recoil or kick when they shoot and a little less ringing in their ears after.

SCHAUBLE: It's about, I don't have to wear hearing protection while I shoot; I don't have to damage my ears. So we think of it as a public health issue.

ROTT: Silencers are currently legal for private citizens to buy in 42 U.S. states, but they're as heavily regulated nationally as machine guns. That's because silencers are listed under something called the National Firearms Act, legislation that was passed by Congress in 1934 in response to mob violence and the rising criminal use of new or modified firearms like sawed-off shotguns. Under that law, someone looking to buy a silencer has to enter a federal registry, acquire special licensing and pay a $200 fee.

The process today takes about nine months on average. The legislation proposed by Republican lawmakers would make that process much shorter and waive the feet. The legislation is called the Hearing Protection Act.

DAVID CHIPMAN: That's offensive.

ROTT: David Chipman is with Americans for Responsible Solutions, and he's a retired 25-year veteran of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or the ATF. He thinks the legislation is not about protecting shooters' hearing as the name would imply but a gun industry looking for new profits. There are hundreds of millions of guns owned by people in the country and only about a million silencers currently owned. So with silencers going for anywhere from a few hundred dollars to well over a thousand, there is a lot of room to make money.

The bigger issue, though, Chipman says, is that he believes removing current restrictions on silencers would put the public and law enforcement at risk.

CHIPMAN: A good scenario to think about is when there was that ambush shooting of Dallas police officers.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Chaos erupting on the streets of Dallas at 9 p.m.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Somebody's really armed to the teeth.

ROTT: Five officers were killed by a gunman in the shooting during a peaceful protest last year. And Chipman says police were able to quickly find the shooter because they could tell where the shots were coming from.

CHIPMAN: If that person had been using a silencer, it would have been very difficult to locate that person's position.

ROTT: Not because it would have made the shots silent but because it would reduce the flash at the end of the muzzle and change the sound of a discharge. A suppressed gun sounds different, he says.

CHIPMAN: It doesn't sound like gunfire.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: Couldn't ask for a prettier day, man.

MATT PINNELL: Seriously.

ROTT: Matt Pinnell from SilencerCo let us test that at a shooting range near their headquarters in West Valley City, Utah.

PINNELL: We have our 9 millimeter.

ROTT: He brought a range of different guns to try - handguns, rifles, even a 12-gauge shotgun.

PINNELL: So that's our small arsenal we have today.

ROTT: And we're going to shoot all of them with a suppressor and without to hear the difference. Quick technical note - I'm going to record this about eight feet away from Pinnell with my microphone pointed away from the gun so it doesn't blow out the mike. That said, it also makes all of these shots sound a lot quieter than they actually are.

PINNELL: Ready?

ROTT: Yep, let's do it.

PINNELL: OK.

ROTT: First up - that 9 millimeter handgun, one of the most common guns on the market - no suppressor.

PINNELL: Firing.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

ROTT: Pinnell screws a silencer on the end and...

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

ROTT: Quite a bit quieter.

PINNELL: Yeah, it makes a difference for sure. I mean you don't get that crack. You don't that ringing in your ears after.

ROTT: The American Speech Language Hearing Association says that any noise over 140 decibels - think a jet engine - can cause immediate, permanent damage to a person's hearing. A 9 millimeter handgun shot like the first three we just heard without the suppressor, those were about 160 decibels. With the suppressor, Pinnell says, those last shots were about 125, which is somewhere between the average loudness of an ambulance siren and a jackhammer.

Next, let's hear a .308 bolt-action rifle, your standard hunting rifle, without a suppressor.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: And then with one...

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: For kicks, let's also go inside to an indoor shooting range to hear the difference enclosed. Here's an AR-15 or semiautomatic rifle, no silencer inside.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

ROTT: Much louder. And then with one...

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)

ROTT: The point Pinnell and SilencerCo want to get across is that the sound of a suppressed gunshot is still loud enough to hear, whether you're in a forest or a shopping mall. Point taken. But is that sound still recognizable enough to warn people of potential danger?

NPR reached out to a number of law enforcement groups and individuals to ask them, is there a danger in making suppressors easier to buy? The bigger associations said they wouldn't comment on pending legislation or that they were reviewing the matter. Steve Ijames, a retired Missouri police chief and a current SWAT trainer, had this to say.

STEVE IJAMES: I don't think there's any way to escape that reality that if any particular product that could be misused or abused is more readily available, it's just simply a increased statistical probability.

ROTT: But Ijames does not believe that there would be widespread abuse. He says there could be complications. Technology like ShotSpotter, which uses the sound of a gun to pinpoint the location of a shooter, that could be less effective. But personally he says, if he had a vote, he'd be in favor of easing restrictions. He sees the benefits of quieting guns for shooters. As for the Hearing Protection Act, silencer manufacturers said they don't expect it to be a high legislative priority in the immediate future. Further out, though, they are optimistic.

New York state has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. Compliance with those laws is another matter.

New York passed a broad package of gun regulations after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., despite the objections of hunters and gun rights advocates. Now it appears that many gun owners are refusing to comply with a key provision that requires the registration of so-called assault weapons.

""I think this law was so incredibly repressive that it drove people to the point now that they're basically saying we're not going to abide by any more laws,"" says Brian Olesen, the owner of American Trade and Goods and several other outdoor stores around Albany, N.Y., that stock a wide range of guns for hunting and self-defense. Olesen says his customers overwhelmingly oppose the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act — or SAFE Act, as the 2013 gun law is known.

[The SAFE Act] still may be law, but the people of New York state have repealed it on their own. They're just ignoring the law.

The law has some of the nation's toughest regulations on guns and ammunition, including a ban on the sale of so-called ""military style assault weapons,"" like the AR-15 style long rifle used in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It also requires New Yorkers to register the assault weapons they already own with police.

Critics of the law see registration as the first step toward confiscation. And some say they just won't do it.

""I just don't see there's any need to,"" says Joseph Fuller of Cohoes, N.Y. Fuller says he owns several guns, including at least one that he's required to register under the SAFE Act. But he hasn't.

""I don't pay attention, to be honest,"" says Fuller. ""I have friends out in the boondocks. They won't register their guns either. And they told me ... don't even bother. Don't worry about it.""

No one knows exactly how many so-called assault weapons there are in New York. But the number is likely far more than the 45,000 that have been registered so far. The New York State Police released that number recently, but only after being ordered to by a court.

""[The SAFE Act] still may be law, but the people of New York state have repealed it on their own,"" says Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association. ""They're just ignoring the law.""

Supporters of the SAFE Act disagree.

""I think 45,000 is a lot of assault weapons. I think it's evidence of how long overdue this law is,"" says Leah Barrett, executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. Barrett points out that multiple public opinion polls — including one commissioned by her group — show that 60 percent of New Yorkers support the SAFE Act.

""They support the background check requirement. They support the state's ban on military-style assault weapons. They even support the background checks on ammunition sales,"" says Barrett, ""because they know that these are entirely reasonable.""

Still, the law's opponents show no signs of backing down. They've been especially loud in upstate New York, where hunting is a big part of the culture. Among them are many elected county sheriffs.

""When I prioritize what I need to do as a sheriff, the SAFE Act comes in at the bottom of that list,"" says Christopher Moss, the sheriff in Chemung County, a rural area near the Pennsylvania border. ""I do look at it personally as an infringement on Second Amendment rights.""

That puts Moss and many other state sheriffs at odds with Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo touted the SAFE Act during his re-election campaign last year. His administration did not respond to requests for comment on the apparent lack of enforcement.

And this month, Cuomo agreed to postpone another controversial part of the law: a statewide database to track ammunition purchases.

""When the database is ready, it will be instituted,"" Cuomo told reporters this month. ""But if people are worried that we're gonna do that before it's ready, we're not gonna do that before it's ready.""

That did not appease upstate Republican lawmakers. Some are still trying to repeal the SAFE Act. And gun rights groups are challenging the law in court. A federal judge in Buffalo upheld most of the law in 2013. An appeals court is expected to rule on the case this year."

On a weekday morning in January, business is steady at Northwest Armory, a gun store on an Oregon state highway just south of Portland.

Customers lean over glass cases to look at handguns or run their fingers along the polished wood of hunting rifles that line the aisles, aimed at the ceiling. AR-15s hang on hooks and ammunition boxes are stacked up behind a sales clerk, who leans over to talk to an older couple.

Oregon has a lot of gun owners. There are hunters and target shooters, ranchers who carry guns to guard their livestock against predators, and collectors. And a lot of men and women in Oregon carry guns to protect themselves.

From time to time, they all find themselves in a place like the Northwest Armory. They might be more inclined to visit after announcements like President Obama's executive order earlier this week.

Are sales more brisk at Northwest Armory since Tuesday morning?

""Well, you got to remember, we had a snowstorm,"" Karl Durkheimer said with a laugh. He and his wife own the Northwest Armory.

Durkheimer says that December 2015 was one of his best months in 20 years — Christmas is a big gun-buying occasion across the country — and the trend is continuing in January, despite the unexpected snow and ice. Durkheimer says customers are reacting to recent terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris, as well as the Obama administration's approach to guns — and a general discomfort many have toward the president's politics.

""There's a segment of society — a vast segment of society — that looks at him and says 'if he says black, I'm going to say white, if he says up, I'm going to go down,' "" Durkheimer said, adding that while there's been a divide before, ""I believe it's worse than it's ever been.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption David Gilkey/NPR David Gilkey/NPR

The store owner didn't agree with the additional rules Obama announced this week. He said that background checks already keep guns away from convicted felons and some people suffering from mental illness, and that instead of tightening those rules, police should more aggressively enforce gun laws and regulations already in place.

Durkheimer said gang violence in cities like Chicago provides a good opportunity for that.

""If I was the governor of Illinois, I would declare a state of emergency. I would take the National Guard, or whatever it took, and you'd have them on every street corner where this violence is occurring, and then I would enforce existing laws so that there was a zero tolerance for this senseless violence,"" Durkheimer said.

He questioned whether Obama's executive order, and the timing of it, might be more about distracting the American public from other pressing problems, such as the emerging conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

It may be too soon to tell whether the executive order will have much effect on gun sales at shops like the Northwest Armory. Some customers have noticed that past gun control efforts have driven up prices and made some products harder to get, mostly because of increased customer demand.

Erin Stoffel stopped by the Northwest Armory to pick up a special-order purple handgun he ordered for his wife weeks ago. It still hadn't come in. Stoffel hadn't heard President Obama's announced executive order on guns, and had mixed feelings about what Obama proposed — and how he proposed it.

""I appreciate that a lot of people out there are concerned about violence and crime rates, and so I don't know that necessarily I begrudge, certainly, a president doing what he can to stall violence,"" Stoffel said. ""But as far as trying to circumvent Congress, that bothers me — that's concerning.""

Durkheimer and his customers generally were skeptical about the effect of the rules. Durkheimer sees additional regulations likely making it harder for law-abiding citizens to obtain guns, without doing much to crack down on criminal gun possession.

Durkheimer said that gun shop owners don't want to put guns in the wrong hands, and that he had turned away men who smelled of alcohol, and a tearful young woman who seemed to be having a breakdown. But he also recalled an elderly man having to wait months for a collectible — because a background check flagged a college prank from 60 years before.

Durkheimer hopes government leaders can find a ""middle path"" that helps gun sellers and law-abiding customers."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Allen G. Breed/AP Allen G. Breed/AP

The city of Columbia, S.C., has banned the use of bump stocks, the attachment that dramatically accelerates the rate-of-fire of semi-automatic rifles. Columbia is believed to be the first, or one of the first, U.S. cities to enact such a ban.

Bump stocks allow semi-automatic rifles to fire bullets nearly as rapidly as automatic weapons. The ban is meant to prevent the device's use, not its sale — a discrepancy that Columbia officials say is due to a state law that bars cities from regulating firearms or firearm components.

Bump stocks made headlines in October, when a man used weapons fitted with the attachment in an attack that killed 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. The weapons reportedly shot perhaps as fast as 90 shots in 10 seconds. After that massacre, Massachusetts enacted a ban on bump stocks.

Columbia's Mayor Steve Benjamin says his city acted out of both common sense and respect for the Second Amendment.

""We could not outright ban ownership of them outright"" Benjamin tells NPR's Rachel Martin on Morning Edition. ""We could prohibit their use in the city in their attachment to illegal firearm and that's what we did in this ordinance. It is now under state law. All we could do is issue a misdemeanor for someone who attaches one would be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine in 30 days in jail.""

Columbia's City Council approved the new ordinance Tuesday, banning both bump stocks and trigger cranks — small cranks that fit over the trigger and which can fire a weapon multiple times with one revolution.

The ban had its critics when it was introduced in early December — but this week, Benjamin says, ""The response has been overwhelmingly positive."" He cited emails from Republicans and Second Amendment advocates who said that despite their political beliefs, ""there's no reason that these things should be on our streets.""

Laying out the city council's logic, the mayor noted that after a heinous mass shooting, ""people always say that a good guy with a gun could have done something about this.""

""Well, the reality is that on our city council, there are whole lots of good guys who have guns,"" Benjamin said, ""and [we] just thought that other than the argument being so constantly polarized, that people who are strong supporters of the Second Amendment — but also strong supporters of downright good common sense — should step up and do something. And we thought Columbia, South Carolina, might be a great place to start."""

Saying that on this ""profoundly emotional day"" he hoped that his state would serve as an example to the rest of the nation, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy sat down Thursday at 12:20 p.m. ET to sign into law what's being described as the most sweeping gun control legislation in the nation since the Dec. 14 school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

Malloy praised lawmakers and those who helped craft the legislation for coming together ""as few places in our nation have demonstrated the ability to do.""

Before the governor put pen to paper, Deborah Davis of Hartford told those gathered that ""our children are crying out from the grave, telling us to stop this violence."" Her son Philip was shot to death in 2010.

Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was among the 20 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School last December, thanked the lawmakers. ""Our voices have been heard,"" she said. ""We want Newtown to be known, not for our tragedy, but for transformation.""

As we reported earlier, the legislation puts extensive restrictions on the sale of weapons, ammunition and ammunition magazines in the state.

Our original post, with much more about the new law, follows:

Legislators in Connecticut, where 20 children and six educators were killed four months ago in one of the worst mass shootings in the nation's history, approved legislation early Thursday that puts extensive restrictions on the sale of weapons, ammunition and ammunition magazines in the state.

Proponents, The Hartford Courant reports, call it the ""toughest-in-the-nation"" response to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

Ebong Udoma of NPR member station WSHU in Fairfield, Conn., tells our Newscast Desk that the bill ""includes an expansion of Connecticut's assault weapon ban, background checks for all gun and ammunition sales, a new registry of existing high capacity magazines and a ban on the sale of magazines holding more than 10 bullets, starting next year.""

The ""historic gun control"" bill, writes the New Haven Register, ""also addressed mental health reforms and money to make schools more secure.""

The state's Senate passed the legislation Wednesday afternoon by a vote of 26-10. The Courant says ""two of 22 Democrats and eight of 14 Republicans [were] opposed."" Then at 2:26 a.m. ET Thursday, the state's General Assembly gave the legislation its approval. The vote was 105 to 44. ""Of the 98 House Democrats present, 13 voted no; and 31 of the 51 Republicans in the hall voted no,"" the Courant says.

Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, is expected to sign the legislation into law around midday.

A copy of the bill is posted here.

The Courant notes that:

""The legislation would require universal background checks for purchasers of all firearms, and would immediately expand the state's existing ban on assault weapons. The list of banned weapons would include the Bushmaster AR-15 semiautomatic rifle used by [Newtown killer Adam] Lanza. ... ""In a compromise, owners of ... large-capacity magazines would not be required to turn them in, although their use would be restricted and they would have to be registered with the state by Jan. 1, 2014. Likewise, people who already own semiautomatic rifles defined as assault weapons could keep them if they submit to new registration procedures. ""Beginning Oct. 1, all purchases of ammunition and long guns would require an eligibility certificate. To obtain certification to buy ammunition, purchasers would have to pass a federal criminal background check.""

And according to the Register, the legislation includes:

""A dangerous weapons offender registry, training for school personnel to recognize mental health issues among children, threat assessment teams at colleges, new eligibility certificates to buy any rifle, shotgun or ammunition, stricter firearms storage rules and tougher penalties for weapons trafficking, among other things.""

The Register adds that passage of the bills:"

From 2009 to 2014, more than 73,000 guns that were seized in Mexico were traced to the U.S., according to a new update on the effort to fight weapons trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The figure, based on data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, represents about 70 percent of the 104,850 firearms seized by Mexican authorities that were also submitted to U.S. authorities for tracing.

The data was analyzed by the Government Accountability Office, which notes in its report that U.S. police agencies have acknowledged firearms smuggling is fueling violent crime in Mexico.

""Most of the firearms seized in Mexico that were traced and found to be of U.S. origin from 2009 to 2014 came from U.S. Southwest border states,"" the GAO report says. ""While guns seized in Mexico of U.S. origin were traced to all of the 50 states, most came from Texas, California, and Arizona.""

Many of those guns were bought legally in the U.S. and then smuggled over the border, according to the GAO.

""About half were long guns, such as the high-caliber AR-15, preferred by cartel gunmen,"" NPR's John Burnett reports for our Newscast unit. ""Mexican drug traffickers continue to rely on straw purchasers who legally buy the weapons in the U.S., then transfer them to criminal gangs.""

The GAO report paints a picture of the challenges officials face as they try to stop the flow of weapons from the U.S. into Mexico, where laws seek to strictly limit the availability of guns to the public.

The report identifies a new wrinkle in the illegal gun trade, citing officials on both sides of the border who say they're seeing instances of unfinished gun parts being transported into Mexico, where they're used to assemble finished weapons. None of those unfinished parts — barrels and receivers; pins and triggers; grips and stocks — are covered by the U.S. Gun Control Act; they're also not subject to rules that require serial numbers, the GAO says.

In another example, the report says the ATF has been able to trace the original purchasers of less than half of the 73,684 guns that were seized and submitted for tracing.

The GAO says the agency couldn't figure out who bought 53 percent of the guns at retail ""because of factors such as incomplete identifying data on trace request forms, altered serial numbers, no response from the federal firearm licensee to ATF's request for trace information, or incomplete or never received out-of-business licensee records.""

Citing data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the GAO says, ""the agency seized 5,951 firearms that were destined for Mexico in the last 6 years.""

The new GAO report is an update of a 2009 study in which it found that the ATF and ICE were duplicating efforts and running into jurisdictional problems as they tried to fight arms trafficking.

As it did in that report, the GAO also issued recommendations — including one that calls on Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to ensure there's a way to monitor and support their agencies' sharing of information. It also called on the Office of National Drug Control Policy to set up indicators to reflect progress made by the ATF and ICE."

In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, most Americans — regardless of party — favor tightening restrictions on firearms, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll.

But significant partisan divides remain — and perhaps relatedly, they exist alongside divides in knowledge about guns in America.

Eight-in-10 Americans told the pollsters they favor bans on assault weapons, high-capacity ammunition magazines and ""bump stocks,"" an accessory used by the Las Vegas shooter that allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire like an automatic weapon.

Eight-in-10 likewise said they favor a federal database to track all gun sales. On each of these questions, majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans all were in favor of the restrictions to some degree.

But the share who were in favor, as well as the intensity of their agreement, varied by party — sometimes widely. For example, 91 percent of Democrats, along with 76 percent of independents and 70 percent of Republicans, said they are for banning assault-style weapons.

However, 74 percent of Democrats ""strongly favor"" this kind of restriction, as opposed to ""somewhat favoring"" it, compared to only 48 percent of Republicans ""strongly"" in favor and 45 percent of independents who said so.

Similar divides existed on other restrictions — fully 88 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of Republicans, and 82 percent of independents favor banning bump stocks. But while three-quarters of Democrats ""strongly favor"" this kind of ban, only around half of Republicans and independents do.

This kind of discrepancy in intensity can be important to show the softness of support for a measure — and can be an indication of how the group less ""strongly"" in favor can be swayed as arguments become more hotly political on specific topics, like an assault-weapons or a high-capacity magazine ban.

This isn't the only indication post-Vegas that Americans have an appetite for more gun control. A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll likewise showed that a majority of Republicans, along with Democrats and independents, favoring several different types of gun-control laws, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as creating a national gun-sale database.

But the new interest may be short-lived, Ipsos Public Affairs President Cliff Young said.

""What we know actually is that gun violence like this typically has a short-term effect on public opinion where there's a crystallizing event"" that temporarily bumps support for gun control upward, he said. ""We expect there should be some sort of half-life to it.""

And importantly, while Republicans and Democrats alike support specific restrictions, the general idea of tighter gun control is much more firmly supported by Democrats than anyone else — 84 percent of Democrats said gun laws should be ""a lot"" or ""somewhat"" stricter than today, compared to 61 percent of independents and 55 percent of Republicans.

One-third of Republicans said gun laws right now are ""about right,"" compared to 23 percent of independents and just 9 percent of Democrats.

Partisan differences also showed up in exposure to guns — significantly more Republicans than Democrats have fired guns, own guns and have friends who own them, the survey shows.

And that dovetails with some particularly wide partisan gaps on attitudes toward guns. Two-thirds of Republicans agreed with the statement ""owning a gun would make me feel safer,"" compared to around just a third of Democrats.

Likewise, 72 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement, ""The benefits of gun ownership outweigh the risks."" Democrats were the near opposite of that, with 60 percent disagreeing.

Loading...

And those different attitudes play into partisan gaps in Americans' knowledge about gun facts, Young said. ""Democrats see the issue through the lens of the risks that gun ownership presents, and Republicans don't,"" he added.

Loading...

Young points to a true-false question in which 59 percent of Democrats responded correctly that it's true that households with guns are more likely to experience a fatality from crime, accident or suicide than households without them. By comparison, 37 percent of Republicans and 39 percent of independents also responded ""true.""

Republicans are more likely to own guns — and believe that the benefits of gun ownership outweigh the costs. The poll also showed that they tend to have more proximity to guns but less proximity to violence than Democrats. Altogether, that may contribute to Republicans perceiving guns as less harmful.

Loading...

There was also a partisan gap in Americans' knowledge of what Congress did (or didn't do) after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, which left 20 children and seven adults dead.

Just 42 percent of Americans responded correctly to the statement, ""After the Sandy Hook massacre, Congress put tough new background check laws in place.""

That's false. There was an effort to pass stricter background checks, but it never passed.

More Democrats (52 percent) knew that than Republicans (36 percent).

The NPR/Ipsos poll was conducted online, surveying 1,006 adults from October 10-11. For the full sample, there is a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. For Democrats in the sample, it's 6.1 percentage points; for Republicans-only, it's 5.8 percentage points and for independents, it's 8.2 percentage points."

On a recent Sunday night, Liz Paul was tired. She'd worked in the morning, spent a full day with her family and she did not feel like going out for her daily jog.

""I tweeted out, 'Well, it's 9 p.m. on Sunday and I didn't work out,' "" she says, ""I really shouldn't go run in the dark should I?""

The response was immediate. The network of people Paul is relying on to help in her battle to lose weight chimed in with advice. Some tweeted back, ""Yes, get out and run."" Others offered alternatives like a video workout. But everyone said, ""Do something!""

Paul, who is 35 years old and lives in Eagan, Minn., got up and went for a three-mile run. ""I wouldn't have done something if it was just me,"" she says, ""I would have given up. I would have said 'Oh well, I'll do it tomorrow.' ""

Several studies, albeit small ones, show that social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can help bolster weight loss. Researchers in London recently analyzed 12 studies involving nearly 1,900 people in the U.S., Europe, East Asia and Australia. They found those who used social networking sites lost modest but significant amounts of weight.

It's the social push that helps make people accountable, says Christopher Wharton, assistant professor in the nutrition program at Arizona State University. And accountability can be a powerful motivation to stay on track with a weight-loss plan. In-person support groups definitely help, he says, but most only meet once a week, while social media is ubiquitous.

""Even though you are virtually dispersed,"" he says, ""you can sign on to those platforms multiple times a day and talk about your progress, your perceived failures, and immediately receive support from friends and other acquaintances who are connected to you.""

Wharton says people can also take advantage of some easily downloaded phone apps to help them keep track of what they eat. In a recent study, he found a smartphone app was the best way to tally up the day's calories, which is key to weight loss. ""That might have something to do with how easy it is to pull a phone out of your pocket or purse and type in information and then be done with it,"" he says, ""rather than carrying around paper and pencil and manually writing things down.""

Liz Paul, who has lost more than 100 pounds since giving birth to her second child last November, is taking her digital weight loss efforts one step further. She now blogs about her struggle with weight in the blog Prior Fat Girl.

One recent post helped her figure out why she felt like eating, ""everything in sight."" As she wrote she realized she was overly anxious and stressed. She started blogging about the behavior and ended up discovering what the root cause was. Once she understood that, she says, she was able to get back on track."

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks with data scientist Cathy O'Neil about her new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, which describes the dangers of relying on big data analytics to solve problems.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

We are in a time of big data. In recent years, NPR's done stories about how data analytics are being used to help political campaigns, rally supporters, compare the cost of similar surgeries in different cities, track public buses in real time and even maybe identify police officers at risk of committing misconduct. But the question is are we putting too much faith in big data? That's the question we're asking in this week's All Tech Considered.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: In her new book, mathematician Cathy O'Neil says we are in a techno utopia. And she does not mean that in a good way. Her book is called ""Weapons Of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality And Threatens Democracy."" And she is with us now. Welcome to the show.

CATHY O'NEIL: Honored to be here, Kelly.

MCEVERS: So tell us what you mean by techno utopia.

O'NEIL: Well, techno utopia is this idea that the machine-learning tools, the algorithms, the things that help Google, like, have cars that drive themselves, that these tools are somehow making things objective and fair when, in fact, we really have no idea what's happening to most algorithms under the hood.

MCEVERS: So it sounds like when you're saying, you know, we have these algorithms, but we don't know exactly what they are under the hood, there's this sense that they're inherently unbiased. But what you're saying is that there's all kinds of room for biases.

O'NEIL: Yeah, for example, like, if you imagine, you know, an engineering firm that decided to build a new hiring process for engineers and they say, OK, it's based on historical data that we have on what engineers we've hired in the past and how they've done and whether they've been successful, then you might imagine that the algorithm would exclude women, for example. And the algorithm might do the right thing by excluding women if it's only told just to do what we have done historically. The problem is that when people trust things blindly and when they just apply them blindly, they don't think about cause and effect.

They don't say, oh, I wonder why this algorithm is excluding women, which would go back to the question of, I wonder why women haven't been successful at our firm before? So in some sense, it's really not the algorithm's fault at all. It's, in a large way, the way we apply algorithms and the way we trust them that is the problem.

MCEVERS: Your book has a lot of examples where big data has not lived up to its promise. I was wondering if you could give one example where this happened and, in fact, actually made things even worse?

O'NEIL: Yeah, well, so everybody knows about the sort of decades-long attempt to improve public education in the United States. It goes by various names like No Child Left Behind, you know, Race to the Top. But at the end of the day, what they've decided to do in a large part is to sort of remove these terrible teachers that we keep hearing about. And the way they try to find these terrible teachers is through something called the growth model. And the growth model, mathematically speaking, is pretty weak and has had, like, lots of unintended consequences.

When I say weak, I interviewed a teacher from New York City public schools named Tim Clifford. He's been teaching for 20 years, multiple awards, he's written quite a few books. He got a 6 out of 100 one year and then a 96 out of 100 the next year. And he says his techniques didn't change. So it's very inconsistent. It's not clear what this number is actually scoring in terms of teachers and the teaching ability. I interviewed a woman named Sarah Wysocki in the D.C. area who actually got fired because of her low growth model score.

MCEVERS: There must be other examples, though, where people, you know, good teachers got good scores.

O'NEIL: Yeah, I mean, there certainly are, but I would say it's relatively close to a random number generator. So the fact that some good teachers got good scores doesn't say enough. I guess the point is that you might have some statistical information when you hear a score, but it's not accurate enough to actually decide on whether a given teacher, an individual teacher is doing a good job. But it's treated as such because people just trust numbers, they trust scores.

MCEVERS: When you think about the kinds of problems that people are trying to solve with big data going forward, what are some of the areas where you think, yeah, just don't use data to do that one? That one's too complicated.

O'NEIL: It's such a massive field, like, you absolutely need to perform triage. So I really - I very, very carefully defined the kinds of algorithms that I worry about. And they have three characteristics. The first is that they're high-impact, they affect a lot of people. It's widespread and it's an important decision that the scoring pertains to, so like a job or going to jail, something that's important to people. So it's high-impact. The second one is that the things that worry me the most are opaque. Either that means that the people who get the scores don't understand how they're computed or sometimes that means that they don't even know they're getting scored.

Like if you're online, you don't even know you're scored but you are. And the third characteristic of things that I care about, which I call weapons of math destruction, the third characteristic is that they are actually destructive, that they actually can really screw up somebody's life. And most of the time, these algorithms are created with, like, good intentions in mind. But this destructiveness is typically undermines that good intention and actually creates a destructive feedback loop.

MCEVERS: Flagging you as a potential criminal to police or flagging you as some sort of person in a potential hiring position.

O'NEIL: Exactly. If you just imagine, like, something that is pretty well-known is that credit scores are being used to deny people jobs. And that actually creates worse credit scores. You know, an individual who doesn't get a job because they have a bad credit score goes on to having even worse credit scores. States are trying to prevent that from happening on a state-by-state basis. But what we have now in the age of big data is something called electronic credit scores, E-scores, that a lot of people don't even know they're being made of them.

They're not illegal, they're not regulated. And they could lead to the same kind of drastic and pernicious feedback loops.

MCEVERS: You know, we've talked a lot about the problems and the dangers of big data - want to know some of the things that you think it could be used for in a good way, some of the kinds of problems it can tackle. I mean, this is a powerful thing. Are there smart ways we can use it?

O'NEIL: So in the book, I talk a lot about predictive policing and recidivism risk scoring, which is two different kinds of algorithms that are currently being used to decide who to target, what kind of neighborhoods to target by the police and then, like, whether criminal defendants are high-risk and whether they should go to jail for longer. What I don't see happening, which I wish were happening with respect to the justice system, is a kind of audit of the actual entire process overall. We know a lot about how when people are held in solitary confinement, it's probably not good for them.

So why don't we use data to improve the entire system, including, like, knowing those kinds of attributes? How much time did this person spend in solitary confinement? What were the actual conditions? Was the GED offered as a - you know, what kind of facilities did they have? You know, I'd like to see the Amazon Workflow big data audit system be applied to the justice system. I think a lot could be learned and a lot could be improved.

MCEVERS: That's Cathy O'Neil. She's the author of ""Weapons Of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality And Threatens Democracy."" Thank you so much.

O'NEIL: Thank you so much.

Paris' Orly airport has been evacuated after security forces shot and killed a man who seized the weapon of a soldier on guard.

All flights are being redirected from the airport, and reporter Jake Cigainero in Paris tells NPR's Newscast that police ""have completely evacuated the airport and suspended all traffic.""

No one else was injured, according to the French interior ministry.

The BBC's Hugh Scofield says the incident happened around 8:30 a.m. local time. He continues:

""The man grabbed a gun from a soldier on patrol in the south terminal at Orly. He ran into one of the airport shops, and was shot dead there by the security forces.""

Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux told reporters the man was known to French intelligence.

The minister also said the man was linked with a carjacking earlier that morning in a suburb north of Paris.

The Associated Press reports:

""In that incident, the Paris police office said, a man fired birdshot at officers who stopped him during a traffic stop, wounding one in the face. He then fled and stole a woman's car after threatening her with a weapon. That car was found near Orly.""

French authorities did not find any explosives on the man's body or elsewhere in the airport after ""bomb experts and police dogs made a thorough sweep,"" Cigainero reports.

French prosecutors said an anti-terrorism unit was taking over their investigation.

This is a developing story."

The National Nuclear Security Administration says the rate at which nuclear weapons materials degrade is slower than they once believed. That means the the nation's nuclear arsenal may not need updating as soon as was thought. But the debate in Congress about the long-term reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile continues.

JOHN YDSTIE, host:

This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm John Ydstie.

RENÈE MONTAGNE, host:

And I'm Renèe Montagne. Good morning.

A new study suggests that plutonium, the critical component of nuclear weapons, may have a surprisingly long shelf life. Some U.S. weapons are close to 30 years old and scientists have worried the plutonium inside them may be slowly deteriorating. The new findings released yesterday suggest that's not the case, that plutonium could survive a very long time.

NPR's David Kestenbaum reports.

DAVID KESTENBAUM: The problem with plutonium is it's only been around since World War II, so it's hard to say how it ages over the long haul. Plutonium is radioactive. And when the atoms decay, they send bits and pieces plowing through the rest of material, potentially causing damage. The official estimate had been that plutonium should hold up for at least 45 years. The new findings indicate the weapon pits should be okay for almost twice that - 85 years at least.

The Department of Energy is planning to build a new facility to remanufacture plutonium cores for bombs. Stephen Schwartz says the new findings mean there is no rush to do that. He edits the journal called “The Nonproliferation Review.”

Mr. STEPHEN SCHWARTZ (Editor, The Nonproliferation Review): Plutonium aging, other warhead reliability problems, they've all been touted as reasons why we have to go back and start remanufacturing weapons. And if we're going to do that, they'll say well, we've got to build an entirely new weapon's complex. I think this calls into question whether or not that's a wise and necessary course of action.

KESTENBAUM: The aging research was conducted by Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The Department of Energy says the new findings do not change its plans. The DOE wants to redesign the warheads in the current weapons and build replacements. That would require a new facility capable of making 125 plutonium pits a year.

Thomas D'Agostino is deputy administrator for Defense programs at the DOE.

Mr. THOMAS D'AGOSTINO (Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, Department of Energy): The nation has a choice. We either, one, continue to refurbish and maintain large quantities of our Cold War nuclear weapons, or we can shift to the future, which is have a much smaller nuclear weapons stockpile, much safer and more secure stockpile that actually takes in, what I would say, higher technology features.

KESTENBAUM: Some members of Congress may have questions about that plan. David Hobson is a Republican representative from Ohio and chairs the spending panel that oversees the nuclear weapons complex. He says DOE has played up the plutonium-aging problem for years, now he says it doesn't look like a pressing problem.

Representative DAVID HOBSON (Republican, Ohio): We don't need to charge off here and waste a lot of money. I think this gives us a chance to step back and take a breath and decide what's the right thing to do.

KESTENBAUM: The government is planning to pick a design for the new warheads in the coming weeks.

Why would the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency — the people who helped bring the world stealth fighters and GPS — fund research into man-made proteins that could make it easier for some Americans to eat pizza?

That's what we wondered when we read that the Pentagon's gee-whiz research arm provided support for work on a drug to treat celiac disease, a condition that interferes with the digestion of gluten in wheat and other foods.

So we asked.

Mildred Donlon, a DARPA program manager, told Shots the agency has no interest in developing a treatment for celiac disease.

But in a strange twist of scientific fate, student researchers tried to crack the celiac puzzle with tools developed with DARPA funding.

How did it happen? Between 2005 and 2009, DARPA invested in computerized methods to find medical defenses for chemical and biological warfare threats like Sarin nerve gas and anthrax.

Now deadly anthrax spores and gluten are certainly threats on a very different scale, but researchers believe they both could be vulnerable to carefully designed enzymes. DARPA funded computerized techniques to develop better enyzmes faster.

Designing proteins, including enzymes, is the raison d'etre of David Baker's biochemistry lab at the University of Washington in Seattle. The lab used some DARPA money to fund its work, including development of a program called FoldIt, which enlists researchers (and citizen scientists) to figure out which among many possible protein structures is the best one to solve certain biomedical problems.

According to researchers who published a paper last month in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, a group of undergraduates at UW used FoldIt to come up with an enzyme that could break down gluten in the stomach.

The idea is to develop an enzyme pill that would eliminate gluten before it triggers a damaging immune response in people with celiac disease and to help people with the condition absorb nutrients better.

Nearly 1 in 133 Americans suffers from celiac disease, according to the University of Maryland Center for Celiac Research in Baltimore. But currently the only treatment is a gluten-free diet, which can be difficult for many people to stick with.

So there's likely a market for a pill they could take with meals the way people with lactose intolerance can take the enzyme lactase before consuming dairy products.

""The idea is you would pop your pill and then drink your beer, eat your pizza and cookies, and be quite happy,"" says Justin Siegel, an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular medicine at the University of California, Davis and an author of the paper.

According to Ingrid Swanson Pultz, a microbiologist at University of Washington and another author of the paper, the students found an enzyme that could withstand stomach acids. They then tweaked it to go after gluten.

It worked so well in the test tube that Siegel and Pultz have founded a company, Proteus Biologics, to try and bring it to market.

Siegel says they'll need to show in a clinical test that the protein can degrade enough gluten fast enough in the complex environment of the gut to be useful to people with celiac disease. They'll also have to prove that it doesn't have any toxic effects when eaten.

But don't expect an anti-gluten drug on the market anytime soon – even if Siegel and the other researchers decide to market it as a supplement (like a lactase pill), which would require far fewer trials than a drug. It could still take years to prove it's safe."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mohamed Al-Bakour /AFP/Getty Images Mohamed Al-Bakour /AFP/Getty Images

In a suspected chemical weapon attack like the one in Syria on Tuesday, children are the most vulnerable targets. They are more likely than adults to die from chemical agents and to suffer injures. If they survive, they also suffer from the physical and mental trauma of the attack for far more years than adults simply because they have more years left to live.

The effects of chemical weapons are more devastating for kids for a number of reasons. ""Because kids are smaller, there's a higher impact on a smaller body,"" said Dr. Steven Hinrichs, director of the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. A smaller dose of a chemical agent can do more damage to their organs. If the agent is sarin gas, as groups like Doctors Without Borders are reporting, a victim's lungs and airways can fill up with fluid, causing suffocation. Children would die faster than adults because a child has smaller airways and a smaller chest.

""Children have fewer defenses,"" says Dr. Sandro Galea, an emergency physician and epidemiologist at Boston University who has studied mass trauma and conflict globally. They can't run away as quickly from the site of a chemical attack. And once the chemicals enter their system, their immune systems are less mature and not as good at fighting them off. ""It makes them more vulnerable, immunologically and physically,"" Galea said.

Twenty children were among the 72 civilian casualties from an air raid accompanied by the apparent chemical attack on the rebel-held city Khan Shaykhun in Idlib province in Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Moreover, if children survive a chemical attack, they will live with the long-term effects far longer than, say, a 50-year-old. Survivors often have lifelong problems with fine motor skills like writing or cutting paper accurately with a pair of scissors. They often have gross motor disability as well, such as problems with their walking gait — trouble balancing or coordinating the movement of walking — and with the hand-eye coordination necessary to play sports or do many kinds of physical paid work.

The impact of chemical attacks can be mental as well as physical, although it's difficult to tease out the effects of nerve damage from post-traumatic stress disorder since symptoms sometimes overlap. Researchers believe that chemical attacks, like other violent attacks, can lead to PTSD and severe depression for survivors of all ages.

It's also difficult to separate the impact of a single attack, chemical or conventional, from the larger trauma of living through a war.

""Toxic stress affects brain development, learning and the social emotional ability to regulate one's own behavior,"" said Lindsay Stark of Columbia University, who studies childhood trauma in refugee and conflict settings.

But children are also incredibly resilient, Stark said. Child soldiers in war-ravaged African countries didn't turn out to be a lost generation as mental health professionals feared, she said. Many learned to cope with their traumatic pasts and went on to have productive lives.

She cautions against pessimistic outlooks for Syria's children. ""We have to be careful in terms of how we talk about this generation,"" she said. ""All hope is not lost.""

But, she cautioned, the longer children remain in conflict settings, the more challenging it can be to counteract the trauma they live through. Parents need to be able to buffer children from the chronic stress of war by creating a sense of normalcy with routines like going to school every day.

""It's the best thing parents can do,"" Stark said. But in war-torn countries like Syria, she added, ""it may be just not possible.""

By refusing to hear an appeals, the Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court ruling that left in place assault weapons bans in New York and Connecticut.

The high court declined to hear an appeal of a case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

After the shootings at Sandy Hook, both New York and Connecticut passed legislation that prohibited the possession of some semiautomatic ""assault weapons"" and large-capacity magazines.

That legislation was challenged in court by advocacy groups, businesses, and individual gun owners, especially because in 2008, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. In that case, the Supreme Court decided that the Second Amendment includes an individual right to bear arms. The court ruled that this was not an unlimited right, but that Americans had the right to possess any firearm that was ""in common use"" by citizens ""for lawful purposes like self-defense.""

The question before the Second Circuit, then, was whether assault weapons are commonly owned and whether the weapons are ""dangerous and unusual"" in hands of law-abiding citizens.

The Second Circuit answered yes to the first question but found that empirical evidence to answer that second question was ""elusive."" The Court decided that owning weapons like the AR-15 is, indeed, protected by the Second Amendment.

But, the Court argued, government can sometimes have a legitimate interest in impinging upon a Constitutional right. In this case, the Court ruled, banning assault weapons can save lives.

""At least since the enactment of the federal assault‐weapons ban, semiautomatic assault weapons have been understood to pose unusual risks,"" the Court wrote. ""When used, these weapons tend to result in more numerous wounds, more serious wounds, and more victims. These weapons are disproportionately used in crime, and particularly in criminal mass shootings like the attack in Newtown. They are also disproportionately used to kill law enforcement officers: one study shows that between 1998 and 2001, assault weapons were used to gun down at least twenty percent of officers killed in the line of duty.""

Upholding most of the provisions in the assault weapons ban, the Court argued that the government has a legitimate interest in stopping that kind of violence.

After the Supreme Court declined to take on the appeals, the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, which challenged the law, said it would continue its fight.

The Second Circuit, they argued, used wrong test to reach a decision and the death of Justice Antonin Scalia — who authored the Heller decision — may have influenced the Supreme Court from taking up a challenge.

""We fully intend to renew our challenge to Connecticut's blatantly unconstitutional ban as soon as there are five Justices sitting on the Supreme Court committed to the proper understanding of the Second Amendment,"" Scott Wilson, the president of the CCDL, said in a statement."

Autonomous weapons, capable of operating independent of human control, are being developed by several countries around the world. NPR's Kelly McEvers talks with Paul Scharre of the Center for a New American Security about this new military technology and the challenges of regulating it.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The United Nations recently held meetings in Geneva to debate an emerging and controversial technology - autonomous weapons. These are more than just drones. They're weapons that in theory could operate independently of human control. Opponents call them killer robots. Here to make sense of this new area of military technology is Paul Scharre of the Center for a New American Security. He helped create the U.S. military guidelines on these weapons when he worked at the Pentagon. Welcome.

PAUL SCHARRE: Thanks. Thanks for having me.

MCEVERS: OK, so who is building these weapons?

SCHARRE: Well, a number of countries around the world - China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and France - are all developing ever more sophisticated robotic weapons of a variety of fashions. Now, no one has come out and said clearly that they plan to cross the line to go to fully autonomous weapons, but the technology they're building is definitely going to come right up to that line. And none of these countries have also said that they wouldn't cross it either.

MCEVERS: I wonder if you could give us some examples of what kinds of autonomous weapons already exist. And then what are some things that are in development?

SCHARRE: Sure. There are a number of countries - at least 30 by our count - that actually have automated defensive systems that have a higher level of automation where a human turns them on. And then if there's an incoming threat, they can automatically fire to defend the ship or land base that they're defending.

MCEVERS: The Iron Dome, defense systems in South Korea - those are the few examples that come to mind of those kinds of things, yeah.

SCHARRE: That's right - systems like the U.S. Aegis Combat System, the U.S. Patriot.

MCEVERS: Those aren't fully autonomous, right? I mean, those would be semi-autonomous.

SCHARRE: Well, autonomous weapons that get authorized in supervised modes. So they're using very limited defensive settings. People are supervising their operation in real-time, and they can intervene to stop it. And they even have physical access, so if the machine started to simply go haywire, they could actually just physically unplug it.

MCEVERS: So give us an example of something that's, you know - could be developed in the future.

SCHARRE: So there are at least a half dozen countries building prototypes of combat drones that are designed to go into enemy territory. These would be things that would be stealth combat aircraft designed to penetrate into enemy territory where their communications might be jammed.

So that raises the question, well, what does it do when it's outside of human control? Is it allowed to strike pre-planned targets much like cruise missiles today? Or if it comes across a new target and a human hadn't programmed in guidance, does it strike it on its own according to some programming? And really, countries haven't made those decisions yet.

MCEVERS: As I said, the United Nations has been meeting about this. There's a group called The Future of Life Institute which opposes the development of these types of weapons. And they released a short video that was presented at one of these U.N. meetings. Let's just hear a quick clip of that.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Trained as a team, they can penetrate buildings, cars, trains, evade people, bullets - pretty much any countermeasure. They cannot be stopped.

(APPLAUSE)

MCEVERS: Sounds pretty scary what he's saying. Like, how far away are we from having what he is describing?

SCHARRE: So I think there's a couple different aspects of what he's describing that are really important to kind of separate out. A small drone that might be able to navigate up to a specific person, say, with facial recognition technology and then attack them - that technology all exist today. Now, cobbling that together with the autonomy to target people all on its own - no one's done that yet, but that exists.

Now, the next step, leaping to something that has no countermeasure that can't be stopped - that's science fiction. That just doesn't exist in the real world. All military technologies have some countermeasures. And defense analysts look at the balance between the offense and defense.

MCEVERS: There's a failsafe, yeah. We talked about these United Nations meetings. I mean, did the U.N. come to any meaningful decisions about regulating these things?

SCHARRE: No. They've been meeting for several years now, and they agreed to meet again. Diplomacy moves pretty slowly. And that is a real challenge on this topic, where the pace of technology is really outstripping the pace of diplomacy.

MCEVERS: Paul Scharre - his book ""Army Of None"" on autonomous weapons comes out this spring. Thank you very much.

SCHARRE: Thank you.

Updated at 4 a.m. ET Saturday

A government spokesman has increased the death toll from Thursday's bombing using the ""Mother of All Bombs"" in Afghanistan to 94, up from 36.

Ataullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province, said in a tweet Saturday that 94 ISIS members were killed in the attack on an ISIS underground complex, including four top commanders.

""Fortunately there is no report of civilians being killed in the attack,"" Khogyani told The Associated Press on Saturday.

On Friday, U.S. Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. called it ""the right weapon against the right target.""

It was the most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat.

The bomb was dropped in the Achin district of Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan. A video of the strike shows it hitting at the lower edge of a mountain, along a narrow valley, producing a huge shock wave and blast plume.

The nearly 22,000-pound bomb is believed to have destroyed ""large quantities"" of weapons when it struck a network of tunnels, bunkers and other fortifications used by the offshoot group ISIS-K (for Khorasan province), according to an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman.

The U.S. assessment is still in progress, a Pentagon official told NPR's Tom Bowman, adding that there's a chance the death toll might include results from two other smaller operations against ISIS-K that took place Thursday night.

Nicholson said the ""MOAB"" ordnance — for Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or less formally, the ""Mother of All Bombs"" — was ""designed to destroy caves and tunnels, which ISIS-K have been using, along with extensive belts of IEDs, to thicken their positions against our offensive.""

U.S. special forces and Afghan commandos are now inspecting the site, Nicholson said, adding, ""the weapon achieved its intended purpose.""

Nicholson, the commander of the NATO-led Resolute Support force, discussed the operation Friday in a news conference in Kabul.

When he was asked about the timing of the unprecedented strike, and whether it had been influenced by the White House, Nicholson said, ""In regard to timing, it's when we encountered this target on the battlefield.""

The general said that because the spring offensive against ISIS-K had been slowed by fighters using caves and tunnels, ""It was the right time to use it tactically, against the right target on the battlefield.""

Addressing the Afghan public, Nicholson said all precautions were taken to prevent civilian casualties.

""We had persistent surveillance over the area before, during and after the operation, and now we have Afghan and U.S. forces on the site, and see no evidence of civilian casualties,"" Nicholson said. ""Nor have there been any reports of civilian casualties.

After providing an update on the operation, Nicholson recounted a litany of offenses committed by ISIS-K, from beheadings and other public executions to suicide bombings.

The strike is part of a broader offensive, which Nicholson said is a sign of Afghanistan's commitment ""to defeat Daesh in Afghanistan this year.""

The official designation for the MOAB is the GBU-43/B; here's how NPR's Phil Ewing explains its origin:

""The GBU-43/B has been in the U.S. arsenal for more than 14 years, deployed to bases in the Middle East where it could be loaded aboard an American aircraft but never used until now. At more than 30 feet long, it's too big to fit inside the weapons bay of a standard Air Force bomber. Instead, troops load it into the cargo compartment of a specialized transport, the MC-130 Combat Talon, which releases it over the target by opening its ramp in the same way it might for paratroopers or air-dropped supplies. The bomb is guided by satellite to its target.

NPR's James Doubek contributed to this report."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images

No one in the history of the NBA has been a louder proponent of the underhanded free throw than Rick Barry. The unorthodox technique — sometimes known as the ""granny"" — earned the Hall of Famer the title of one of the best free throw shooters of all time.

Barry swears by its accuracy, but players hardly ever use it.

""I really truly can't comprehend the aversion people have to trying something that could be very effective for them,"" Rick says.

He holds a career free throw average of 90 percent.

Even within his own family, his wife — Lynn Barry, a former Assistant Executive Director of USA Women's Basketball — and his four sons prefer the overhead. His youngest son, Canyon, 23, is the only one to continue the tradition.

""Logically dictated, if you have one of the greatest free throw shooters of all time as your personal free throw coach, you should at least give it a try,"" Canyon says.

He just finished his fifth year with the University of Florida Gators. During his last two seasons, Canyon scored, on average, 86 percent of his free throw shots. To compare, the average in the NBA over the same period is 76 percent.

For the Barrys, performing the underhanded free throw requires gripping the sides of the ball, bending your knees and lifting both arms in simultaneous motion up to the release which then lands the ball over the rim.

The move is meant to be seamless and soft. The idea is that there are less moving parts involved like elbows and wrists to ruin the arc.

YouTube

The method has been honed and refined since Rick learned it from his father.

Rick took most of the wrist out of it and would go on to use the technique throughout his illustrious career in the NBA, ABA and NCAA — including leading the Golden State Warriors to the 1975 championship.

It's a large shadow that's followed Canyon throughout his own collegiate career.

Upon missing a free throw at one tournament, he recalls the audience slowly cheering, ""you're adopted"" from the sidelines. He took the jeers in stride.

Why no one uses it

For most players who've tried it, that ribbing is one reason they stopped. Basketball great Wilt Chamberlain is famously ranked as one of the worst free-throw shooters of all time. But when he briefly switched to the underhand during the 1961-1962 season, he made 61 percent of his free throws that season, the highest of his career.

But then he decided to stop, and his free-throw game never recovered. In his autobiography Chamberlain said using the ""granny"" shot made him ""look silly"" and ""like a sissy.""

The use of underhand is so rare that watching a player perform it almost guarantees weird looks and endless chatter.

The most recent case is Chinanu Onuaku of the Houston Rockets. A Reddit thread dedicated to Onuaku's underhand garnered comments, such as ""women will assume he lacks masculine rigor"" and ""The other players don't respect him now too.""

Rick had that initial reaction while in high school in the 1970s. He says his father, a semi-pro player and coach, kept bothering him about switching, saying it would make him better.

But Rick was self-conscious about the underhand shot because he says girls were known to shoot that way.

""So I said, 'I can't do that dad, everyone's going to make fun of me,' "" Rick says. ""I remember him saying, 'Son, they can't make fun of you if you're making them.' ""

A changing game

Canyon refined the technique for changing times. For example, he now holds the ball further away from his body.

""The ball would get caught on the inseam of the shorts,"" says Canyon about the longer, baggier basketball uniforms. His father prefers the short shorts of days past.

Besides the changing fashion, Rick says Canyon's generation also produced a new type of athlete.

""The players have gotten bigger and stronger, they look like Greek Gods — you know chiseled bodies,"" Rick says. ""Its just astonishing how they got themselves to be physically.""

For Canyon getting to that level means a strict regiment of two-ball drills, lifting weights and calibrating his nutrition.

These are all things Rick didn't have to worry about. This includes injuries on the court. Rick would even get his knee drained during games and keep playing.

Not so much for Canyon. An injury today can mean the end of a burgeoning career. His ultimate goal is to play in the NBA.

But if that doesn't work out, Canyon has a backup plan: finish his master's degree in nuclear engineering.

Either way, he's sticking with the underhand free throw."

A revised timeline of the Las Vegas shooting is raising questions about if and when the Mandalay Bay hotel alerted police that a security guard had been shot before the assailant opened fire on the concert crowd. A sheriff's department official said they are still studying the sequence of events, and offers other details of the investigation in interviews with NPR/KNPR.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Las Vegas police have revised their timeline of last week's mass shooting. Initially they had said that the gunman shot a security guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort after he had opened fire on concertgoers. Now they say that's wrong. They say the security guard was shot six minutes before the gunman started firing his guns out his hotel window.

NPR's Leila Fadel has been speaking with the Clark County Sheriff's Department and joins us now. And Leila, this sounds like a pretty significant revision. The security guard came under heavy gunfire, we're told - police say some 200 rounds before the mass shooting. Tell us more about this.

LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Well, here's what we know. Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos - he was responding to a door alarm on the 32nd floor. And it wasn't the shooter's door. He gets up there, and then he comes under fire. He takes gunfire to the leg and is wounded. Now initially, like you said, we were told this happened before the gunman opened fire, a barrage of gunfire outside the window of the Mandalay Bay onto the country music festival. Now we know the gunman was hurt well before - about six minutes before this all started. That wounded security guard notified security at the Mandalay Bay. But the big question is, when did the police find out about that initial shooting?

Now, yesterday at the press conference, I did ask the sheriff that question, and he said police found out about the guard when officers arrived in the hallway about 20 minutes later. And today I tried to clarify that with Undersheriff Kevin McMahill in an interview at KNPR in Las Vegas. I asked when law enforcement knew about the shooting of the security guard at the Mandalay Bay and if there was a major break in communication.

KEVIN MCMAHILL: When specifically did they know? That remains to be a very, very difficult thing for us to put forward, which is why the sheriff indicated that on Friday we'll provide that information to the public because everybody wants to know, including us, when did you know?

FADEL: Now, McMahill says they're going through monumental amounts of tape, from dispatch tape to security dispatch and maintenance tape from the hotel, police body camera video. And the timeline could even change again. Now, we looked at the police dispatch tape, and the first time an active shooter is mentioned is just after 10:06, which is just over a minute after the mass shooting has started into the crowd. And the first time the security guard is mentioned is about 19 minutes later. Now, McMahill really stressed they're not trying to hide anything. But as the investigation goes on, they're finding out new things.

SIEGEL: As I understand it, one thing they found out is that the gunman also targeted fuel tanks at the airport. Did McMahill give you any details about that? Was this part of a larger plan?

FADEL: Yes. McMahill said the gunman was purposely targeting jet fuel tanks from the adjoining room in that same suite. And he was apparently shooting from the two different rooms from different vantage points onto the crowd and the jet fuel tanks, which is why McMahill says that people might have thought there were two shooters. Now, here's McMahill again speaking about when the shots were fired on those tanks.

MCMAHILL: It could have been before. It could have been after. But we do know there are different calibers, different weapons that were used in each room. And certainly it could have been done ahead of time to create even more chaos, even more confusion.

SIEGEL: And as far as we know, law enforcement hasn't found any suicide note, no manifesto of any kind. They found a piece of paper in the shooter's hotel room, but that really doesn't give us any more clues about why he did this, does it?

FADEL: No. That wasn't a suicide note. It actually had numbers on it. And I asked McMahill what those numbers could have been.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MCMAHILL: Our speculation is that it was ranges to how far he was shooting towards the crowd, different parts of the crowd as well as the fuel tanks.

SIEGEL: Any word as to how he actually got all those weapons into the hotel room without being spotted?

FADEL: He carried them up in suitcases. This is a man that checked into the Mandalay Bay almost a week before the attack actually occurred on September 25. And that's another change in the timeline. Originally law enforcement believed he checked in on September 28, and actually, he didn't. He checked in days before. Now, McMahill says that he carried the bags up one or two at a time. They saw this on images that were captured, and they know this from the cameras. So it didn't really trigger suspicion that the shooter had 13 or 14 extremely heavy bags up in his room.

SIEGEL: That's NPR's Leila Fadel in Las Vegas. Thanks.

FADEL: Thank you.

The Olympic Athletes from Russia won 4-3 in a game against Germany where neither team had much to lose.

Germany had defeated hockey powerhouses Sweden and Canada in the semifinals, and the Olympic Athletes from Russia were highly stacked. Neither country had medaled in men's hockey since 2002, when Russia won bronze.

With 0.5 seconds remaining in the first period, Russian Vyacheslav Voynov scored the first point of the match after an ambitious shot that made it past German goaltender Danny aus den Birken.

Germany brought the score to a tie with 10 minutes left in the second period, after a shot by Felix Schütz bounced off of goalkeeper Vasily Koshechkin and deflected off the body of Russian defenseman Bogdan Kiselevich across the goal line.

A steady back and forth continued, until Russian Nikita Gusev scored a point with 6:39 left in the third period. But the Russians relaxed — and just 10 seconds later, German frontman Dominik Kahun tied the game right back up, the stakes just as high as before.

With three minutes left in the third period, Jonas Müller broke the tie 3-2 with the cleanest shot of the game after a winning a puck battle against the Russians. This lead didn't last for long; either: With less than 60 seconds to go, Gusev scored again, and the teams were back to a tie.

About 15 minutes into sudden-death overtime, Gusev scored yet another goal — and the Russians threw off their helmets in celebration of winning gold.

The match was guaranteed to be Germany's best showing in men's hockey no matter the outcome: The team had won bronze in 1932, and West Germany won bronze in 1976. Their silver medal is the strongest performance Germany has ever shown in men's hockey, while Russia won gold in 1992 as the Unified Team.

Canada walked away with the bronze medal by beating the Czech Republic 6-4 after being knocked out for silver and gold by Germany.

The Russian athletes competed in neutral Olympic gear rather than Russian colors. The International Olympic Committee suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in 2017, citing a widespread culture of doping in Russia and alleged state-sponsored system of cheating.

Russian athletes were allowed to compete in the 2018 Winter Games under a neutral Olympic flag and were required to pass rigorous doping tests. Going into Pyeongchang, the IOC said there was a chance Russia's athletes could march under their country's colors at the games' closing ceremony.

After two Russian athletes were disqualified over doping, the IOC voted to uphold the ban, meaning that athletes will once again leave their Russian colors at home in the closing ceremony."

When a woman drinks heavily during pregnancy, it can cause profound damage to her unborn child.

Nobody knows how much alcohol, if any, is safe, so the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise women to abstain from drinking throughout pregnancy to avoid physical and mental birth defects.

But here and elsewhere, even conscientious pregnant women have been known to have an occasional beer or glass of wine while carrying a child. How risky is that?

Research funded by the CDC and conducted in Denmark is shedding some light on the question, though there's no definitive answer just yet. Still, the results suggest that light drinking (one to four drinks a week) and even moderate imbibing (five to eight drinks) may be OK. Even occasional binge drinking (five or more drinks in a single session) didn't appear to be tied to developmental issues.

The researchers measured the IQs, attention spans and decision-making of more than 1,600 5-year-olds and compared them with the drinking habits of the moms in early pregnancy. The women were asked about their drinking and underwent a battery of psychological tests when their kids were 5, too.

In case you are wondering, women in Denmark didn't generally consider drinking a little during pregnancy to be a health concern at the time the data for the study were collected (2003 to 2008).

There was a wide range of drinking behavior, with a little less than half of women refraining from alcohol. The next biggest group had 1-4 drinks a week. About 175 women had 5 to 8 drinks a week. Only 20 of them drank 9 or more alcoholic beverages in a week.

So what's the bottom line? The researchers wrote:

""We found no significant association of low to moderate average weekly alcohol consumption, and any binge drinking, during early to mid pregnancy with the neurodevelopment of children at the age of 5 years.""

Now there are lots of caveats, as the researchers note in a collection of papers just published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology. It's possible, for instance, that the testing didn't detect subtle changes in the development of the kids. Or it might be that some alcohol-related changes might not become apparent until later in life.

While the findings are reassuring, they shouldn't be read as a free pass for drinking while pregnant. ""The danger of it is that people consider it definitive research and definitive reassurance that any alcohol use, including binge drinking, during pregnancy is innocuous,"" says Janet Williams, a pediatrician at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.

Alcohol, she tells Shots, is generally recognized as the No. 1 preventable cause of birth abnormalities, ranging from physical to cognitive problems. And these new papers prompt more questions than answers, she says. ""The safest conclusion is that no drinking causes no fetal alcohol effects,"" says Williams, the immediate past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on substance abuse.

The Danish researchers concur, writing that ""it remains the most conservative advice for women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy."" But, they also say, ""small quantities consumed occasionally in pregnancy do not appear to pose serious issues"" for the key areas of neurological development they investigated."

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said two police officers were shot and seriously wounded shortly after midnight outside the Ferguson, Mo., police department. The shooting occurred as a protest outside the police station had begun to wind down.

A St. Louis County police officer and an officer from nearby Webster Groves, Mo., were shot, according to Belmar. He did not identify them by name.

The Webster Groves officer was struck once in the face. He is 32 years old and a five-year veteran of the force, Belmar said. He said the St. Louis County officer is 41 years old and a 14-year veteran of the force. That officer was struck once in the shoulder.

We will be updating this story with the latest developments. For more coverage, please visit our friends at St. Louis Public Radio, who are live-blogging the events.

Update at 1:46 p.m. ET Officers Released From Hospital

Both officers have been released from hospital, reporter Tim Lloyd of St. Louis Public radio reports.

The family of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old black man shot dead in Ferguson by a white police officer last August, called the shooting ""senseless"" and said their ""thoughts and prayers remain with the officers injured during this morning's shooting and their families."" In a statement, they said:

""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot and will not be tolerated. ""We specifically denounce the actions of stand-alone agitators who unsuccessfully attempt to derail the otherwise peaceful and non-violent movement that has emerged throughout this nation to confront police brutality and to forward the cause of equality under the law for all.""

Attorney General Eric Holder called the shooting ""inexcusable and repugnant.""

Update at 10:10 a.m. ET: Injury Updates, And More Details

The two police officers who were shot had been standing in a line of more than a dozen officers, Belmar said at a news conference Thursday morning.

Belmar said the Webster Groves officer was shot just below his right eye, and that the bullet is now lodged in the back of his head. The St. Louis County officer was struck in the shoulder, and the bullet passed through and exited his back.

He said, based on the shell casings found on the scene, the weapon used is believed to be a handgun. The St. Louis County Police Department has posted evidence photographs on Facebook.

Despite the serious nature of the injuries, Belmar said, the officers aren't expected to have any ""remarkable long-term injuries."" He said he had spoken with both of the officers.

""I think it's a miracle that we haven't had any instances similar to this"" before now, Belmar said, noting other occurrences of gunfire at protests in Ferguson.

""When you look at the tenor of at least some of the people"" involved in protests, he said, it is difficult for officers to discern who might pose a threat.

The St. Louis County police chief added that when shots were fired last night, the officers saw muzzle flashes later estimated to be about 125 yards away. He said the officers drew their weapons but did not discharge them.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we were very close to what happened in New York,"" Belmar said, referring to the recent fatal shooting of two officers there.

""This is really an ambush, is what it is,"" he said later.

Belmar said he had been surprised by the amount of ""agitation"" at the protest.

At one point, he acknowledged that there was ""an unfortunate association"" between whoever fired the shots and the protesters who were there for what he called ""the right reasons.""

Belmar also said he hasn't confirmed reports that rocks or bottles had been thrown at the officers during Wednesday night's protest. He repeatedly said it is ""very difficult"" for officers to identify potential threats in such situations.

Our original post continues:

Belmar described both gunshot wounds as ""very serious injuries."" Their wounds are not believed to be life-threatening. Both officers are being treated in a local hospital and their families are with them, according to Belmar.

The protests followed the resignation of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson earlier Wednesday, a move that followed a scathing report of racial bias in the Ferguson police department by the U.S. Department of Justice. Many in the crowd were reportedly calling for the town's mayor to resign, as well.

""The shots came just after midnight as people were starting to leave,"" reports St. Louis Public Radio. ""Belmar said he believed the shooters were embedded in the group that remained, a point fiercely disputed by protesters on the scene.""

The member station notes that several protesters who witnessed the shooting say the shots had been fired from behind them."

Kimberly Richardson has never gotten a flu shot. Since she's healthy and considers the seasonal vaccines a ""best-guess concoction"" of the viruses expected to dominate, the northern California gym teacher and mother of two says she didn't want an ""injection of something that may or may not keep me healthy in the long run.""

She's not alone. In an analysis of 245,386 women who delivered babies at Utah and Idaho hospitals over nine flu seasons, 90 percent said they didn't get vaccinated for influenza while pregnant. Those who did reaped benefits — their babies were healthier. As a group, infants whose moms reported getting a flu shot during pregnancy had about one-third the risk of flulike illness during their first six months of life, compared to babies of unimmunized mothers.

Disease-fighting flu antibodies are a ""gift the mom gives her baby across the placenta,"" says Julie Shakib, a pediatrician at the University of Utah School of Medicine who led the study, published this week in the journal Pediatrics.

In 2006, researchers at Kaiser Permanente published a similar analysis of 41,129 babies born between 1995 and 2001. But that study found no correlation between rates of infant illness and flu vaccination in expectant mothers.

This new analysis included six times as many babies and eight times as many vaccinated moms, notes Eric France, a pediatrician and preventive medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente Colorado and leader of the 2006 study. ""This is the paper I wanted to write 10 years ago,"" he says. Larger studies tend to be more reliable because they're more statistically accurate.

Other prior studies have shown that babies do benefit from maternal immunization — including a 2008 trial in Bangladesh that randomized 340 pregnant women to receive a flu shot or a control vaccine. Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for clinical research. However, a study that assigns some participants a placebo flu vaccination would be considered unethical in the United States given the country's standard of care. Instead, most U.S. studies observe a particular group over time or survey a group retrospectively, as in the current study.

These analyses are challenging. First, it's hard to agree on what constitutes ""flu."" Do you count all babies that show up at the doctor's office with fever and cold symptoms? Do you restrict analysis to cases that were confirmed by lab testing or focus only on confirmed flu that required hospitalization? The new analysis looked at all three categories.

It also takes a long time to get enough cases for statistically sound results. In the new study, which tracked 249,387 babies under six months old who were born between December 2005 and March 2014, only 0.35 percent (866 babies) met criteria for the broadest classification—a diagnosis of ""flu-like illness."" A mere 0.26 percent (658 babies) had lab-confirmed flu, and among those cases less than a quarter (151 babies) were hospitalized because of their illness.

Furthermore, only 10 percent of expecting moms said they'd gotten a flu vaccine. Immunization rates were actually much lower during the first four years of the study—around 2 percent—but jumped to 21 percent over the five flu seasons after the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic. When H1N1 struck again in 2013-2014, about half of the pregnant women in the study reported getting vaccinated for flu.

""Over time we're actually encouraged by the improvement in providers' ability to deliver the flu vaccine and strongly recommend it,"" says Shakib. ""There's been a culture shift."" A recent study of postpartum women found that expecting moms were far more likely to get a flu shot if their prenatal care providers recommended it.

Still, given the low overall immunization rate across the current study, the researchers collected data more than eight years to get 866 babies with at least one flu-like illness. Among those, 96 percent (834 babies) were born to moms who didn't get a flu shot—which means 4 percent (32 babies) developed the flu despite their moms getting immunized while pregnant.

Now let's figure out how this translates to flu protection for babies.

If the flu vaccine had no impact on infant illness rates, you'd expect the percentage of flu-afflicted babies to equal the percentage of unimmunized moms. Under this assumption 10 percent (87 babies) should have been born to vaccinated mothers, since we know that 10 percent of mothers reported getting a flu shot. However, in reality there were only 32 infant flu cases among vaccinated mothers, which suggests that 55 babies—or 63 percent—were protected. Applying a similar analysis to lab-confirmed flu, the study found that maternal vaccinations led to a 70 percent reduction in infant illness.

So how does mom's flu shot protect her baby? After getting vaccinated, a pregnant woman makes specialized proteins called antibodies, which recognize flu viruses and boost the body's defenses against these pathogens. ""Those antibodies can cross the placenta and go into the fetal circulation,"" says Mitch Kronenberg of the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.

The protection babies receive is known as passive immunity. Unlike mom's defenses, which were ""educated"" to recognize viral proteins in the vaccine, the baby's immune system ""didn't get trained but took something from the mother and used it,"" Kronenberg says.

Placental antibodies stick around in the baby for up to six months. They're thought to be different from the protective antibodies found in breast milk, which may help shape the immune system's relationship with gut-dwelling bacteria, according to a mouse study published Thursday by UC Berkeley researchers.

Shakib and coworkers have an ongoing study to determine if the immune protection a baby gets from maternal flu antibodies is stronger if mom breastfeeds. The researchers are analyzing blood and breast milk samples from 40 mother-infant pairs at the University of Utah Hospital. They expect to publish the results within a year, Shakib told NPR.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Dilley Rebecca Dilley

In the winter of 2006, the unthinkable happened. There was a shortage of aquavit, the Scandinavian spirit that's flavored with caraway and other botanicals like dill and anise. For Scandinavian-Americans who relied on aquavit to accompany the traditional julbord, or holiday buffet, it was a tragedy.

""It threw me into a bit of a panic,"" says Christian Krogstad, Norwegian co-founder of Portland, Ore. distillery House Spirits. ""The most important part for me about the holidays is the food."" There's pickled herring, smoked meats, sometimes the traditional gelatinous whitefish preparation known as lutefisk and many other strong flavors that combine on the Scandinavian Christmas dinner table. ""They really require aquavit as an accompaniment,"" Krogstad says.

So he set out to make his own, initially only for personal consumption. When bartenders came to visit over the following months, Krogstad would pull out a bottle of aquavit and give them a taste. ""They were really captivated by it,"" he recalls. Their interest made him decide to bottle and sell what he'd always thought of as a niche spirit.

It's #ScandiWeek On The Salt! Scandinavia is a land of cold winters and heart-warming (literally) Christmas food and drink traditions. This year, The Salt is celebrating the stories behind those traditions. So God jul! Glædelig jul! Hyvää joulua!

House Spirits — then just two years old — was one of the first American distilleries to make aquavit. In the last few years the once-niche spirit has become a way for distilleries and bartenders to make a name for themselves in an increasingly saturated market.

When Devil's Head Distilling in Colorado opened in 2015, aquavit was one of the first spirits they made. Often new distilleries release a gin and vodka for their first spirits since neither require aging but co-founder Ryan White thought aquavit would be a more interesting addition. Devil's Head was the first to produce it in the state, and found that having one unique spirit opened doors for them. ""When we go out to distribute it, the aquavit is the thing that gets us the buyer's ear,"" White says.

Traditionally, Scandinavians drink aquavit neat — throwing back one shot after another throughout the meal. But the bartenders Krogstad connected with immediately realized its potential as a cocktail ingredient. It found its way into Bloody Marys, gimlets, and, once aged-aquavits started being released, Negronis.

""I'm constantly surprised by it,"" Krogstad says of aquavit's growth in popularity. ""It's become not just a Scandinavian or Scandinavian-American thing. It's now a cocktail thing, and that opens it up to a much larger audience.""

Kyle Van Strien, co-founder of Michigan's Long Road Distilling, also realized its potential. ""If we're going to survive in the market with a lot of great booze, we've gotta do things different,"" says. Though aquavit isn't Long Road's top seller, thanks to the spirit's success at beverage competitions as well as its uniqueness among the whiskeys, gins, and vodkas most distilleries are producing, it's become the spirit for which they are known.

In 2012, there were fewer than 10 American aquavits, says Jacob Grier, the founder of Aquavit Week which involves events and cocktail specials that feature the spirit in 11 states. Five years later, Grier says there are more than 50 American varieties, and they are not just limited to traditional Scandinavian-American communities.

Grier attributes some of the growth to an increasing interest in Nordic cuisine, the sudden boom in Americans traveling to Iceland, and restaurants like Noma.

Before Americans started making their own aquavit, options were limited. As Emily Vikre of Minnesota's Vikre Distilling recalls, ""There were two aquavits imported to the United States and they were rarely seen and probably only bought by Scandinavians celebrating one of our important holidays."" (As Van Strien describes it, ""It was a thing you drank twice a year and got blackout drunk with."") Now, the growth of American aquavit is prompting Scandinavian bartenders and distillers to give the spirit another, less-hangover prone, chance.

A year ago, Norwegian spirits supplier Arcus announced Lysholm No5, an aquavit specifically designed for use in cocktails. Krogstad says he's been in contact with several people in the Scandinavian beverage industry who are interested in what's happening with aquavit in the United States. ""I think we're going to see American aquavits exported to Scandinavia soon.""

At least in the United States, any ""caraway-flavored distilled spirits product"" can be called aquavit under regulatory guidelines. Aquavit gives you a lot of freedom as a distiller,"" says Grier. ""You can play with all kinds of botanicals and come up with a unique recipe.""

For some, this means making something new. For others, it means continuing traditions. The famous Norwegian Linie aquavit got its name when an early-1800s era sea captain tasted spirits that had been stored on barrels in his ship after it crossed the equator and came back. Two hundred years later, Linie's barrels of aquavit still travel to Australia and back by ship before being sold in bottles. The company believes that something about the sea air, the ship rolling over the waves, or perhaps the oceanic temperature imparts a flavor to the beverage that can't be obtained on land. Today's bottles give the name of the ship as well as the date the batch crossed the equator. It's a hard story to beat.

When Vikre of Vikre's Distilling was testing her first aquavit, she brought it to a Norwegian independence festival. ""When people were like, 'I want that and not the Linie,' I knew we'd gotten it right.""

Health officials are warning that the United States may have an unusually harsh flu season this year.

But they stress that flu seasons are notoriously difficult to predict, and it's far too early to know for sure what may happen.

The concern stems from several factors, including signs that the season started a few weeks earlier than usual. ""When you have an early start with regional outbreaks, that is generally not a good sign,"" says Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""Sometimes that's the forerunner of a serious season.""

An early start could mean a longer season, which could mean more people end up getting infected with the flu.

Another reason for concern is that Australia had a severe flu season this year.

""We generally follow in our season what happened in the Southern Hemisphere, such as in Australia,"" Fauci says. ""And Australia had a particularly bad influenza season for a number of reasons.""



A major reason for Australia's struggle is that the main strain of flu circulating there was one known as H3N2. That kind of flu virus tends to make people sicker than other strains, especially the elderly.

YouTube

To make things worse, the flu vaccine appears to have been only about 10 percent effective against that strain in Australia. Part of the reason for that is that flu strains are constantly changing and the H3N2 strain used to make the vaccine mutated during production of the vaccine. This weakened the shot's effectiveness.

""The mutation just happened to be in a very bad spot on the virus to make it essentially be a mismatch for the vaccine,"" Fauci says.

The United States is using the same vaccine, and an H3N2 strain appears to be dominating outbreaks in this country so far too.

""It looks like not only are we using the same vaccine, but the virus that was circulating in Australia appears to be the same virus that we're starting to see now in the outbreaks in the United States,"" Fauci says.

But it could also turn out that the vaccine could be far more effective in the United States than it was in Australia, according to Brendan Flannery, an epidemiologist at the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That's because a slightly different H3N2 strain could end up dominating in this country, for example. Another possibility is that other flu strains could become more common. The vaccine provides stronger protection against those.

""It could be that we're going to have a severe season — and we have to prepare for that,"" Flannery says. ""But it's early to make a prediction for this season.""

U.S. officials also think they have a better system than Australia for estimating vaccine effectiveness. Last year, the vaccine was 32 percent effective against the H3N2 flu strain in the United States.

Another factor in America's favor is that ""the U.S. population overall is more highly vaccinated than the Australian population,"" says Lynnette Brammer, another CDC epidemiologist. ""So you may get some indirect effects of more people being vaccinated here.""

Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, also noted that there's evidence that Australia didn't use antiviral drugs as aggressively as it could have when treating the flu.

Regardless of what happens this year in the United States, infectious disease experts say it remains crucial that as many people get vaccinated as possible.

""They need to get it not only to protect themselves but so that they don't spread it around to other people — their loved ones, folks at the gym, and at work and at religious services — who are more vulnerable,"" says William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. ""No one wants to be a dreaded spreader."""

A new study finds that counties with teams in the Super Bowl experienced significantly higher influenza deaths for people 65 and older compared to counties that didn't have a team that participated.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

We know the Super Bowl this Sunday will feature the Philadelphia Eagles appearing in the big game for the first time in 13 years - also the New England Patriots, who appear in the Super Bowl apparently every year. I exaggerate, but this is their third appearance in the last four years. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam has some strong personal views about the game. But he's here to talk about something else. He's here to talk about the effect the Super Bowl can have on our health. Shankar, welcome.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Thanks, Mary Louise.

KELLY: Do you need to get your strong personal views out of the way first, Shankar?

VEDANTAM: Well, happily, I - my head says the New England Patriots are going to win, but my heart which bleeds green says the Philadelphia Eagles are going to win.

KELLY: You're an Eagles fan obviously.

VEDANTAM: I am indeed.

KELLY: No pretense whatsoever of journalistic objectivity in terms of how the score line goes, but what's the connection between the Super Bowl and our health?

VEDANTAM: I was talking to Charles Stoecker of the Tulane University School of Public Health. He told me he got interested in how the Super Bowl might affect health when he was working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention some years ago. And he saw a newspaper headline when the Super Bowl was being hosted in Dallas.

CHARLES STOECKER: A club owner claimed that the city as a whole would need 10,000 extra exotic dancers to meet the demand that spiked during the Super Bowl.

KELLY: Ten-thousand exotic dancers...

(LAUGHTER)

KELLY: OK, wow, that's nuts.

VEDANTAM: Well, Stoecker thought that this might actually prompt an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, Mary Louise. But when he looked at the data, he didn't find a connection between STDs and the Super Bowl. But he did find a connection between the Super Bowl and the flu.

KELLY: The flu.

VEDANTAM: Yes, and that's because the Super Bowl produces events that occur all across the country, Super Bowl parties.

STOECKER: The Super Bowl changes people's mixing patterns. They might go to a Super Bowl party. They might go to a bar. And if they're at, say, a Super Bowl party and they're in close confines with somebody who has the flu, that flu has more opportunities to move from person to person.

KELLY: OK, Shankar, I'm trying to catch you up here with you. The hypothesis here is you go to a party. You come into contact with people. Is that right?

VEDANTAM: That's exactly right.

KELLY: How did he then go about trying to test this hypothesis?

VEDANTAM: Well, it's tricky, Mary Louise. The Super Bowl is played in a different city each year. The intensity of the flu varies from year to year. Different parts of the country are affected differently because the influenza virus spreads fastest in places that are cold and dry rather than places that are hot and wet.

What Stoecker and his colleagues Alan Barreca at UCLA and Nick Sanders at Cornell did was track deaths caused by the flu among cities that send teams to the Super Bowl. Unsurprisingly, these are the cities that have the highest levels of excitement about the Super Bowl. And they analyzed mortality data over 30 seasons of the Super Bowl.

STOECKER: And we find that cases of influenza mortality among those age 65 and older increase by 18 percent when your team is in the Super Bowl, which is a pretty big increase.

KELLY: OK, deaths related to the flu increase 18 percent. This is in the population age 65 and older. Translate that for me, Shankar. How many actual deaths are we talking?

VEDANTAM: Well, the researchers guess that in 2014 when the Super Bowl featured teams from Denver and Seattle, there may have been 146 additional deaths as a result of the Super Bowl. Now, the effect is strongest, they find, in years when the Super Bowl coincides with the peak of the flu season and in seasons when the flu is more virulent.

KELLY: So a lot of factors here, then - flu season coinciding with Super Bowl, certain cities being colder and more prone to the flu in the first place. Does it matter if your city is hosting the Super Bowl? Should Minneapolis be worried?

VEDANTAM: Interestingly it does not seem to affect the cities that are hosting the Super Bowl. It seems to be primarily affecting the cities that are sending teams to the Super Bowl...

KELLY: Because they're more excited.

VEDANTAM: ...Which makes sense from the point of view that those are the cities where the excitement is going to be the highest.

KELLY: So what's the takeaway here? We should just stay home and eat our nachos and wings by ourselves, or what?

VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, in some ways, the study is telling us something that makes intuitive sense, Mary Louise. It's just the first attempt to notice the phenomenon and quantify the data. The flu spreads when people pass it to each other. So if you increase the amount of person-to-person contact, you're going to increase the spread of the flu. So things you can do if you want to reduce the spread of the flu is, you know, get a flu shot. And if you're sick, stay home.

KELLY: Common sense advice for the Super Bowl - and always, thanks so much, Shankar.

VEDANTAM: Go Eagles.

KELLY: (Laughter) Indeed. That's NPR's Shankar Vedantam. He is NPR's social science correspondent and also the host of a podcast and a radio show that explore unseen patterns in human behavior. That's called Hidden Brain.

Enlarge this image toggle caption /Reuters /Landov /Reuters /Landov

Joseph Paul Franklin, the white supremacist who was convicted of eight murders, suspected in as many as 20 others and who shot Hustler publisher Larry Flynt in 1978, was put to death Wednesday in Missouri.

St. Louis Public Radio followed the news overnight as Franklin ran out of legal challenges.

Alan Greenblatt wrote for us last week about how Flynt, who was paralyzed after being shot, didn't want Franklin to be executed.

""A life spent in a 3-by-6-foot cell is far harsher than the quick release of a lethal injection,"" Flynt wrote last month in The Hollywood Reporter. ""I have had many years in this wheelchair to think about this very topic.""

Franklin, as The Associated Press has reported, ""targeted blacks and Jews in a cross-country killing spree from 1977 to 1980.""

During a jailhouse interview, the 63-year-old Franklin recently told CNN about why he shot Flynt:

"" 'I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,' he says. Franklin is referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler that featured several photos of a black man with a white woman. 'It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.' ""

Franklin also shot and seriously wounded civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in 1980."

For archaeologist Eva Jensen, a happenstance find in Nevada has turned into an in-depth quest. Since stumbling across a Winchester rifle manufactured in 1882, she and other researchers have been seeking to unravel the mysteries behind it.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Here's a lost and found story. What we assume was lost more than a hundred years ago was a rifle. Archaeologist Eva Jensen found it during a survey in Nevada's Great Basin National Park. She was looking for Native American artifacts.

EVA JENSEN: Truthfully that's kind of what I was hoping to see in that rocky outcrop, but I guess I'll take a Winchester rifle.

SIEGEL: It was made in 1882, but who left it there and when remains a mystery. It had been there so long, its black barrel looked like a part of the juniper tree it was leaning against. Jensen says spotting it was a stroke of luck.

JENSEN: It just was the right time, the right light. Sometimes that makes the difference.

SIEGEL: The rifle will spend some time with the curators of the Buffalo Bill Cody Museum in Wyoming so it can be preserved. Afterwards, it will return to the park where it will be on public display through the National Park Service Centennial in 2016.

American shooter Matt Emmons was on Time Magazine's list of chokers after suffering some mental lapses in the last Olympics. On Monday, he competed in the finals in his best discipline and took the bronze medal.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

In the past two Olympics, American shooter Matt Emmons has led his rifle event going into the final shot, and then things fall apart. Today in London, the shooting events concluded and Emmons got another opportunity at victory. NPR's Mike Pesca has this story on what happened as Emmons tried to conquer his sport and his nerves.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Attention, three, two, one, start.

MIKE PESCA, BYLINE: Matt Emmons stood staring at his target. This was the final shot of competition, possibly Emmons' final shot after three Olympic games, which had already netted him a gold and a silver medal in other rifle events. But, in the three position event, the final shot for Matt Emmons has been harrowing.

In Athens, Emmons fired at the wrong target and tumbled out of medal contention. In Beijing, he was leading going into the last shot and pulled the trigger at the wrong time, earning a horrific score, which killed his medal chances.

These experiences, Emmons admitted afterward, had not completely faded away.

MATT EMMONS: I did everything I knew how to do to try to calm my body down and, really, on the last shot, I was just shaking so much and I said, OK, Matt.

PESCA: OK, Matt. Breathe. OK, Matt. Visualize. OK, Matt. Go through all the exercises you and your psychologist have worked on these last four years. Even that frank admission of nerves is somewhat taboo in the culture of sports. In most sports, admitting to nervousness is seen as admitting weakness, but the shooting sports are different. Shooting is almost anti-kinetic. The spectator who took a swig from his Olympics-approved water bottle as Emmons stood ready to fire, the journalist who scribbled a sentence in his notepad - they both moved their bodies much more than Emmons would.

When Emmons was labeled a choker by Time magazine or mocked in the sports media, those words didn't come from other shooters, says Katerina Emmons, Matt's wife, and a two-time shooting medalist for the Czech Republic.

KATERINA EMMONS: None of the shooters - the shooters were great. All of them know how hard it is to overcome fears because we all have them, so all of them appreciated Matt for who he is and there was huge support for him.

PESCA: The other competitors know that controlling adrenaline is a key part of the game. An adrenaline-filled running back may feed off his emotions to bowl over a tackler. That's not how it works with shooting, says Matt.

EMMONS: I honestly wish - there are so many times I wish I was in another sport where I could use those nerves to your advantage, like, you know, when I've been in ski races, if I was nervous, I would always race really well because it brought out the best in me. It brought out that little extra bit of endurance or speed or whatever you might want to get you through that I never was able to do in training.

PESCA: Matt was participating in this sport in this moment. Gold was out of reach. Emmons' friend, the Italian, Nicola Campriani, was about to set an Olympics record, but another good shot and silver would belong to Matt. Afterwards, here's how Emmons describes his mindset.

EMMONS: It was a little bit more challenging today than I thought it was going to be. I guess, really, just the magnitude of the situation kind of hit me, which is fine. I still worked with it pretty well, but even in the final, though, you know, I was trying everything I could on the last couple shot to really just calm myself down and take the best shot that I could and it was tough.

PESCA: Emmons shot his lowest score of the round, by far. The BBC announcer intoned, Emmons has failed again, but he still takes bronze. Emmons hunched over to check his score in the target. He grimaced, but as soon as he straightened up, he smiled. He walked over to his friend, Campriani, and smiled. He smiled through the medal ceremony. He smiled as he kissed his wife and he smiled as he did his interviews.

His teammates said they were thrilled for Matt. Matt said he was thrilled on the podium and the winners said that no one outside the sport could realize what an inspiration Emmons was to all the other athletes and that's when Emmons began to cry.

GLYNN WASHINGTON, HOST:

Now then - it's all well and good to fight the chain of command when it's just yourself on the line, but what if - what if you have a bunch of people depending on every single decision you make? Our first story today on the ""Chain of Command"" episode occurs on the streets of Iraq.

Sensitive listeners should be aware all of these scenes occur during a war zone and as such, it does contain some violence.

ANNA SUSSMAN, BYLINE: For 13 months Matt Cook managed to stay alive as an infantry soldier in Iraq.

MATT COOK: My platoon was hit by - we kind of lost count, but - maybe 15 to 18 IEDs. It soured me on Iraqis and I think that's kind of an inevitable reaction to something like that, when, you know, you lose really good friends. So the last bullet I fired from my rifle - we were, I think, about a month from going home. I think we were all really, really cautious because we've just survived 12, 13 months. You know, you don't want to take too many risks this close to making it through. It was afternoon, just before it gets dark. We're in Humvees. We're all in our gear, our vests, our body armor. We'd stopped traffic in both ways. We had our chem-lights out, we had some cones out. Everything possibly that we could signal traffic to stop was out. And in the middle of it, one of my soldiers who's in a Humvee screams, there's a car coming.

I turned to look and I see this sedan and it's just flying at us. It picks up speed as it comes towards us. You know, you don't have but a few seconds to decide what to do. I've been in this situation, you know, many, many times with my platoon and I think, is this going to be another situation where we shoot a civilian? Or is this a situation where if I don't do anything is this a car bomb and it's going to get inside our circle and blow us all up?

I don't have time to really think this through 'cause things are happening so quickly. So I look to my weapon and I was watching him, you know, watching the car come at us through my Acog, which is the scope of my rifle. I flip my safety to fire and I've got my finger on the trigger. Pulled the trigger, shot several times. I see my rounds enter this guy and the Acog on our weapons magnify really well. So he was wearing a white man-dress and I could just see my rounds going into him and polka-dotting his white man-dress with blood. And then you know, he just stops - the car stops and he slumps over.

I turn my back to it, thinking it's going to blow up and kill us all, to be perfectly honest. And then after a second or two, nothing happens. And I slowly turn around and I see this old man leaning against his door, motionless. He was dead.

I circle around the car. The glass is all broken and there's several bullet holes in his vehicle - his car's smoking. And I pull him out onto the street and his eyes are wide open and I immediately notice that they're just gray and they're covered with cataracts and that he's probably damn-near blind, which is why he came at us.

And while I'm searching the car, you know, I look at his glove box and inside his glove box he has his wallet. And that's where I find a picture of him with a young man. He's got his arm around this young man and I'm only assuming that it was his son.

SUSSMAN: And at that moment Matt, what did you feel, if anything?

COOK: It's hard to describe something like that. I'm in the middle of a really complicated place where people are out to kill us. And so I think I've done what I had to do to protect myself and to protect my soldiers.

SUSSMAN: And is there any guilt in there?

COOK: Well, I think it's hard to feel guilty in a moment like that, when you've spent a year in a place where you genuinely felt like everyone is trying to kill you. And it does - if you feel too guilty then you began to hesitate. What if that old man had actually been driving a bomb-laden vehicle? I knew I had to bury it and then deal with it later.

SUSSMAN: And when you went home - did you think about that old man when you went home?

COOK: I would say I knew that I should feel guilty, but I didn't. You know, my morals and everything I was ever taught about humanity, you know, is questioned because I know what we - you know, what I did, but I did not feel overwhelmingly guilty about it. What really wrecked me I think was this sort of survivor's guilt that - you know, I had a few friends and a soldier who I'd lost and the lingering sort of sorrow I felt for their loss, it was something I had to deal with in a much more difficult way, then, say the old man, for instance.

When I got back from my first deployment I felt very unfulfilled. I felt like there was a lot of unfinished business in Iraq and in Afghanistan and I really had a real desire to return. I knew I wanted to a story and I wanted to write about it. And then I contacted my old battalion commander, chatted with him about the possibility of doing it. Maybe it's extreme, but I felt like going back and embedding with my old unit was what I was really looking for. It all happened very quickly a once I fully committed and kind of bought my ticket, a sort of peace came over me about it. And it turned - I went from nervous to being just very, very excited. It was almost like getting ready for another deployment.

When I got to the airport in Kabul this one was incredibly different. You know, you're on your own - completely on my own and I didn't have the support of 25, 26 well-armed men, you know, ready to jump on a grenade for me if I needed. I had no weapon, I just had my camera and my pack. I generally started second-guessing myself in that moment. I was thinking about - I mean, I would be lying if I said I didn't think about just getting a return ticket and going back home, but Sayid(ph), my driver, finally calls and tells me that he's outside. I just sort of took a deep breath and just stepped out and we took off. So I rolled down my window and I was just smelling the city, looking at everything. And I had my cell phone and I did type in a message to my wife, in case anything were to happen I was just going to hit send. I think the message that I had typed was, need help call embassy, or something like that.

We were on our way to Bagram. He's driven this road how many times? So he knows the road. And we're just - he's weaving in and out of traffic. Well, we're cruising down this road and we're going really fast and we kind of turn this bend and I see this Afghan police unit or army unit checkpoint and they're stopping traffic. And Sayid's just paying no attention whatsoever, he's just flying at this checkpoint. And then I look at the Afghan soldiers and I see them see us. And I see them really tense up and posture up. I mean, I had seen it so many times from the other end, I hit the imaginary break below me and you know, I screamed at Sayid to stop. That's when he kind of jolts and he finally sees this Afghan unit on the street. They immediately raise their rifles at us. The dishka on the truck turns and - I couldn't - you know, maybe half a second, a second away from shooting at us. He slams on the break and we slide onto the shoulder of the road. They run at the car and they've got their AKs at our heads and I was frozen. It was probably the scariest few moments of my life. We were really lucky to be alive 'cause if I had been them, I think I would've pulled the trigger and I probably would've done it much sooner. There's no way I would've risked myself or any of my soldiers for a moment of hesitation.

SUSSMAN: So why do you think they didn't shoot? Why were they so slow on that trigger where maybe you wouldn't have been?

COOK: That's a good question. I've thought about that, but the truth is you just can't compare them to the U.S. forces. They know the culture and they know the dangers more than we do. When you're a soldier in a foreign country, everybody seems dangerous, everybody seems out to kill you. There's a term called pseudo-speciation, which is when a soldier identifies the entire race of a country as an enemy because he is under attack. I was in a state of shock, to be honest with you. I hadn't had a rifle pointed at me in a long time. One of the first things I thought of was that old man that I'd killed in Iraq. I think for the first time, it really hit me. And this old man, I remember so specifically I think because when you're in combat a lot of times everybody's shooting their weapons so you don't really know if it's your round hitting someone. And with the old man, I could see my rounds hitting him through my Acog, he'd gotten so close to us.

The weight of those consequences really, really sunk in. And I think I - thinking about this old man really kind of turned me inside out, to be honest with you.

SUSSMAN: What do you mean?

COOK: I always knew that what happened was a horrible thing, but I never really felt. I felt it for the first time in a way that I had never felt before but kind of knew that I should have.

Does that make sense? It made me kind of realize how maddening the whole thing this.

Tucked away in a back street of Semarang, a city in Indonesia's Central Java province, is a tiny, four-table restaurant. In the cramped kitchen, Mahmudi Haryono whips up a plate of ribs — lunch for two customers.

He brings it out and serves it to two Indonesian soldiers in olive drab uniforms.

Haryono is smiling and cool as a cucumber. But he acknowledges that after getting out of jail a few years ago, serving men in uniform set butterflies aflutter in his stomach.

""Sometimes, I felt insecure,"" he says, sitting down at a table to talk as the soldiers eat. ""I thought that perhaps somebody wanted me to be rearrested. Or maybe somebody was setting me up.""

Haryono, a former terrorist, has traded his rifle for a chef's spatula. His broken dreams of global jihad help to explain a little bit why Indonesia — home to the world's largest Muslim population — has not become the hotbed of terrorism that many have feared.

After all, between 2002 and 2009, homegrown Indonesian terrorist groups staged deadly attacks almost every year, making them some of al-Qaida's most effective affiliates. The most prominent of these is the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah.

The Birth Of A Jihadist

After graduating from high school in 1995, Haryono visited an Islamic boarding school founded by Jemaah Islamiyah's spiritual mentor, Abu Bakar Bashir, and run by younger radicals. The turbaned men there were among the very few Indonesians with personal ties to Osama bin Laden. Some of them would go on to stage the notorious Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, including seven Americans. He also read the work of famous Islamists, such as Egyptian Sayyid Qutb, a leading member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and '60s.

They inspired him to wage jihad in Bosnia and Afghanistan. But Haryono had no money, and no way to get there.

""Yes, they implanted in me the values and the spirit of jihad,"" he says, ""but if you look at the actual capability to wage jihad, we just didn't have it.""

He felt that compared to their foreign counterparts, Indonesian jihadis were too wimpy. A proper jihadi, Haryono believed, should be tall and fierce-looking with a long beard. But he is, in fact, a short, skinny fellow with a smooth, boyish face, much younger looking than his 37 years.

He tried to get to Indonesia's Maluku Islands, to join Muslims who were fighting Christians, beginning in 1999. But his lack of military training kept him from joining.

Being shunted around by recruiters between Indonesia and Malaysia made him feel a bit like a victim of human trafficking, Haryono admits. He made it as far as the island of Mindanao in the Philippines in 2000. There, he learned guerrilla warfare and jungle survival skills. He eventually saw combat with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, Muslim separatists fighting the Philippine government.

But two years later, the group made peace with Manila. So Haryono returned to Java and at first opened a shoe store.

Developing Alternatives To Violence



He was back in Indonesia, but he hadn't entirely put his past behind him. In 2003, Haryono was sentenced to 10 years in prison for terrorism. He says he did not know that friends had stored explosives in his store. Those explosives killed 12 people and injured 150 in an attack on the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta.

In jail, Haryono decided to mend his ways. He felt the need to take responsibility for his family, and he yearned for the recognition of fellow Muslims and mainstream society. He was paroled five years later. That's when he met fellow reformed radical Noor Huda Ismail.

Huda is a social entrepreneur and former journalist. His stint studying in the United Kingdom gave him a look at how Northern Ireland dealt with former Catholic and Protestant combatants.

After returning to Indonesia, Ismail tried opening several businesses to help former jihadis. First, he tried a T-shirt shop, then a shrimp farm. Neither was successful, and some of his ex-terrorist ""clients"" ended up in trouble again.

Now, Huda runs three modest restaurants that employ about a dozen former terrorists and school dropouts, including Haryono. He says helping to rehabilitate ex-terrorists works better than just punishing them.

""In the last 11 years, what we have been witnessing is a black-and-white approach,"" he says. ""My kind of initiative can provide alternative approaches to violent jihadi networks, using social enterprise, using a civil society approach.""

Changing Nature Of Indonesian Terrorism



Sidney Jones, a counterterrorism expert with the International Crisis Group in Jakarta, says that since 2010, Indonesian authorities have killed 50 suspected terrorists and arrested hundreds more.

""What we call terrorism in Indonesia now has degenerated into a kind of low-intensity conflict between police and terrorist suspects,"" Jones says.

Terrorists are so bent on revenge against the police that they have largely given up attacking foreign interests in Indonesia.

Human rights groups are concerned that Indonesian authorities, including U.S.- and Australian-trained police special forces, are uninterested in capturing terrorist suspects alive, and are shooting to kill.

Of course, Indonesia's jails and mosques are minting new extremists. But Jones says the country has generally avoided becoming fertile ground for terrorist organizations.

""If you look at where terrorism takes place around the world,"" she says, ""it's usually where you've got a repressive government — not true in Indonesia; occupation — not true in Indonesia; a war going on where local Muslims are dying,"" which is also not true in Indonesia.

Indonesia's success in combating terrorism bolsters its narrative of a thriving democracy in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. But as the story of Haryono and Huda suggests, credit may go not just to law enforcement, but also to civil society.

A Chance To Rejoin Society

Back in his restaurant, Haryono chops vegetables for his next customer. He appears to be brimming with confidence and grateful for the chance to rejoin society.

""Now I enjoy life. I'm happy with a wife and children, family and friends,"" he says with a smile. ""Back then, life was full of fear. I only hung out with other jihadis.""

Haryono has mixed feelings about his experience. He says he feels no remorse about fighting in defense of his faith. It gave him a sense of accomplishment. But he says he does feel guilty about the double life he once led.

""What I regret is that in the past, I lied to my parents,"" he says. ""I ran away without saying goodbye to them. I made up stories to tell them, which they believed, but which I knew were a lie."""

Ginny Thrasher, a 19-year old from West Virginia University, took the first of the more than 300 gold medals that will be awarded at the Olympics in Brazil, winning the 10-meter air rifle on Saturday.

Thrasher, the youngest of the 15 members of the U.S. rifle team, bested a field of 50 competitors, comfortably winning the final duel with China's Du Li, who won gold medals at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.

In the air rifle competition, shooters use pellets with flat fronts that leave clean holes in the paper target that determines scoring.

Thrasher is from Springfield, Va., and first began shooting five years ago when she went deer hunting with her grandfather.

""It was just a big rush of adrenaline,"" Thrasher said of her first hunting trip in an interview with The Washington Post. ""Things were happening very fast and all of a sudden, my aim was good and it was an exciting feeling.""

As a freshman at West Virginia this past year, she won both NCAA air rifle titles as she led her school to a national title in the sport.

""I didn't really care much about the Olympics,"" Thrasher told The Post last month, after she qualified for the U.S. team. ""I knew shooting was an Olympic sport, but I never really thought, 'Oh, I want to go to the Olympics in shooting.' I was just shooting because I loved shooting.""

After a dazzling opening ceremony on Friday night, the first full day of competition at the Rio Games on Saturday also featured swimming, water polo, cycling and beach volleyball."

Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid insist that gun control legislation is not dead — they say they're strategizing on how to bring the issue back to the Senate floor.

Even if it does return, one proposal unlikely to survive is an assault weapons ban. Military-style assault rifles now form a nearly $1 billion industry supported by gun owners who spend thousands of dollars collecting these firearms.

And while the gun-rights lobby keeps invoking the right of ""self-defense"" to defend Americans' right to buy these guns, home protection is low on the list of reasons gun enthusiasts keep buying military-style weapons.

'They Picture You As Some Kind Of Militant Freak'

There's a lot of name-calling in the gun control debate. Gun control advocates are slammed as elitist, urban liberals who want to take everyone's guns away. Gun rights people are accused of being paranoid rednecks who think the government is out to get them. And then there are the special labels reserved for people who love their assault rifles.

""You know, they picture you as some kind of militant freak. And that's not me,"" says Mike Collins, who owns more than a dozen military-style rifles with his wife.

Collins wants you to understand something: He is a rational, intelligent, regular guy.

""I spent 27 years in the military,"" he says. ""I defended this country all over the world. I've been in multiple combat tours. I'm not a nut. I'm not a crazy guy. I'm just a normal person who enjoys shooting.""

And for Collins, target practicing with an AR-15 is a hobby.

Next to Collins at the shooting range at Clark Brothers Gun Shop in Warrenton, Va., is Jason Glascock, who says if more Americans knew what it was like to shoot these weapons, they would see these guns can actually be good, clean fun.

""The AR — it's America's gun. It's what our troops carry. It's been our military firearm,"" Glascock says. ""It's our, if you will, symbol around the world, this gun.""

The fully automatic version of this gun — the M-16 — was introduced by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. The AR-15 is semiautomatic, which means you need to squeeze the trigger for each bullet.

Glascock was 3 years old when he started shooting a .22 caliber with his grandfather. By 5 years old, he moved on to shotguns. He started collecting military-style guns when he turned 18, and he just built an AR-15 for his 19-year-old son last Christmas.

'The Mr. Potato Head Of Firearms'

When Glascock explains why he keeps collecting military-style guns, he doesn't bring up self-defense or hunting. His eyes light up when he talks about all the fun ways you can customize an AR-15: flashlights, scopes, night vision, even an attachable beer-bottle opener. You can get the gun in neon green or with zebra stripes if you want. The accessories can cost more than the weapon itself, which starts at around $800.

Collins says when he modifies his AR-15, it's like a guy souping up his car.

""This is the man's Barbie doll — you know, the Mr. Potato Head of firearms,"" Collins says, ""because you can interchange so many different things to make it customized to you, to be able to make it comfortable when you shoot.""

But this Mr. Potato Head is deadly. The AR-15 was the gun used by Adam Lanza when he opened fire in Newtown, Conn., last December. Twenty-six people were killed, including 20 first-graders. Everyone was shot more than once — as many as 11 times. And that's what the military wanted out of this gun — the ability to kill even without good aim, a weapon with high-capacity ammunition magazines that could spray bullets within close to medium range.

""Those design features in a civilian market have horrific consequences,"" says Tom Diaz, a gun control advocate who has long followed the commercialization of military firearms. ""So you can call it whatever you want — tactical rifle, black rifle, assault rifle, modern sporting rifle. It has the capability that the military wanted for warfare.""

Instruments Of Warfare In The Civilian Market

How did warfare enter the civilian market? AR-15 rifles were sold to the public as early as the 1960s, but Diaz says their popularity really took off in the 1980s, after Chinese manufacturers began exporting the AR's Russian counterpart — the AK-47 — to the U.S. And then pop culture helped the market along. Television shows like Miami Vice made military-style firearms look sexy.

Military-style rifles have now ballooned into a nearly billion-dollar business. The main gun industry group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, tells NPR these weapons represent almost 20 percent of the entire industry's revenue. Data that the NSSF provided to NPR show imports and production of these weapons almost quadrupled in the past 10 years. After semi-automatic pistols, military-style rifles represent the next hottest-selling category of guns.

""AR-style modern sporting rifles are a major contributor to the success of the American firearms industry, no question,"" says Mike Bazinet of the NSSF.

In advertisements for these guns, there's a common message: Get in touch with your inner GI Joe. For example, a Web commercial from Sig Sauer features soldiers in combat boots crouching with their assault rifles next to military Humvees.

Bazinet says, despite these ads, the gun industry is not driving the market for military-style weapons — instead, it's the consumers who are clamoring for them.

But gun control advocates aren't buying that. Diaz says the industry is filling a demand it was forced to create. Data from the General Social Survey, a public opinion survey conducted every two years, show the percentage of American households that own guns is declining. Diaz says kids these days would rather pick up a video game than a hunting rifle.

""It's just a fact that hunting has been in serious decline, so those kinds of guns just don't sell as well,"" he says. ""Well, you're in business, you got to sell something. These assault rifles — these military-style rifles — appeal to a broader range of people.""

So he says the industry pounced on these products to stay relevant. With fewer households to sell to, Diaz says gun makers have to keep coming up with newer, sleeker, more high-tech weapons for people who already own guns.

Now, more than 30 gun companies make AR-15s. Almost 8.5 million assault rifles have been either manufactured in the U.S. or imported here since the 1990s, according to the NSSF.

Gun dealers like Clark Brothers Gun Shop say someone comes in to buy one of these rifles almost every single day they're open.

""We've got guys that come here on their 18th birthday and buy an AR-15 — the first gun they ever bought,"" says Mitch May, who has been the general manager at Clark Brothers since 1962. ""Just because it's a gun that the military uses, and they want to have one just like it, but they don't want to join the Army to get it.""

After the shootings in Newtown, May says he couldn't keep the AR-15 in stock. Between December and February, he estimates he probably could have sold 40 AR-15s per week. Even if most people think a federal assault weapons ban has slim hopes of passing any time soon, the mere threat of a ban always brings in great business.

""We've always sold more guns when Democrats are in office than we ever sell when Republicans [are] in office,"" says May. ""And we all here ... and everywhere else in the gun business vote Republican every time."""
npr168,npr,['Jon Hamilton'],2017-04-05 00:00:00,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/05/522613294/do-u-s-troops-risk-brain-injury-when-they-fire-heavy-weapons,"Do U.S. Troops Risk Brain Injury When They Fire Heavy Weapons?

The U.S. military is trying to figure out whether certain heavy weapons are putting U.S. troops in danger.

The concern centers on the possibility of brain injuries from shoulder-fired weapons like the Carl Gustaf, a recoilless rifle that resembles a bazooka and is powerful enough to blow up a tank.

A single round for the Carl Gustaf can weigh nearly 10 pounds. The shell leaves the gun's barrel at more than 500 miles per hour. And as the weapon fires, it directs an explosive burst of hot gases out of the back of the barrel.

For safety reasons, troops are trained to take positions to the side of weapons like this. Even so, they get hit by powerful blast waves coming from both the muzzle and breech.

""It feels like you get punched in your whole body,"" is the way one Army gunner described the experience in a military video made in Afghanistan. ""The blast bounces off the ground and it overwhelms you.""

During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military recognized that the blast from a roadside bomb could injure a service member's brain without leaving a scratch. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops sustained this sort of mild traumatic brain injury, which has been linked to long-term problems ranging from memory lapses to post-traumatic stress disorder.

Also during those wars, the military began to consider the effects on the brain of repeated blasts from weapons like the Carl Gustaf. And some members of Congress became concerned.

Rep. Louise Slaughter, a congresswoman from upstate New York and a member of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, says she was once told of a soldier whose ears bled after using the Carl Gustaf.

""Obviously,"" Slaughter says, ""we have to know. What kind of damage is that doing to soldiers in training and on the battlefield?""

The military got some hints about the risks of firing heavy weapons from a program it launched in Afghanistan.

In 2011, the Army equipped thousands of troops with blast gauges — coin-sized sensors worn on the head and shoulders.

The gauges, made by a company in Slaughter's district, were designed to measure the intensity of a blast from a roadside bomb. But they also revealed worrisome levels of blast exposure in some troops who were merely firing certain heavy weapons.

Last year, the military quietly pulled the blast gauges from wide use, saying they hadn't been useful in detecting brain injuries. Slaughter thinks that was a mistake.

""I don't understand the Pentagon's circular argument,"" Slaughter says. ""They aren't using the gauges because they don't have the data to prove how effective they are. But it doesn't take a great brain to understand you will not get the data if you don't use the gauges.""

The military declined several requests for an interview about the blast gauge program and the risks from firing weapons.

But in an email, an Army spokesperson said that the Department of Defense is still using blast gauges in research, including some studies that look at ""cumulative low-level blast"" effects.

And a scientist who works for a private company hired by the military to study blast exposure confirms that ongoing research includes studies of exposures during weapons training.

""The reason that these studies are being done is that at some point someone has said, 'I don't feel quite right,' "" says Laila Zai, director of neuroscience research at Applied Research Associates.

But it's really tricky to turn these anecdotes into usable data. Even results from the Army's blast-gauge program in Afghanistan are hard to interpret because there were so many variables on the battlefield, Zai says.

For example, she says, buildings and other structures tend to reflect blast waves from a weapon — and that can result in much greater exposure than when the weapon is fired in an open field.

So Zai has been working with a researcher from the Navy. ""What he's doing is putting sensors on people undergoing shoulder-mounted weapons training,"" she says. ""And he's looking to see if the overpressure [the force of a blast] generated by various training scenarios ever overwhelms the threshold of safety.""

It's all part of a five-year, $30 million effort by the Office of Naval Research to help the military figure out how much blast exposure is too much.

Last year, a military study showed that firing heavy weapons could temporarily impair learning and memory. Now, Slaughter says, the military needs to find out whether these short-term effects can lead to long-term injuries among members of the service.

""If we can save them from a lifetime of brain damage,"" she says, ""for heaven's sake, it's our obligation to do it."""

U.S. rifle shooter Matthew Emmons has won a bronze medal in the 50-meter three positions rifle event. That may sound like a slight let-down for the man who had been poised to win silver — a horrible final shot of 7.6 dropped him into third place — but it's far better than Emmons' earlier Olympic experiences.

First there was Athens 2004, when he inadvertently fired upon the wrong target.

Then there was Beijing 2008, when he rushed his pacing on his final shot. Instead of winning a gold medal, he missed the bullseye, and the podium.

Emmons, 31, had qualified for the 50m three positions event with the second-best score. And Monday, he had nailed scores of 10.7, 10.6 and 10.5 before shooting a 7.6 on his final shot at London's Royal Artillery Barracks.

Emmons didn't receive a medal in this year's 10m air rifle event, in which he won a gold medal in Beijing. At the Athens Games, he won gold in the 50m prone rifle event."

After more than a century, the classic Winchester rifle — the ""Gun that Won the West"" — is set to ride off into the sunset. This month, the European company that owns the Winchester plant in New Haven, Conn., said the gun will no longer be made in the United States. The iconic weapon just isn't as popular as it used to be. John Dankosky of member station WNPR reports.

MELISSA BLOCK, Host:

This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News, I'm Melissa Block.

MICHELE NORRIS, Host:

And I'm Michele Norris. The Winchester rifle was called The Gun that Won the West. But for 140 years it has been made in the heart of yankee New England, New Haven, Connecticut. Much like its sidearm counterpart, the Colt .45, the Winchester became an icon and a symbol of a way of life. But this month the European company that owns the Winchester plant announced it would close. Some classic models would be discontinued, others would be produced overseas. As John Dankosky of member station WNPR reports that means the Winchester, like all those cowboys, could be headed into the sunset for good.

JOHN DANKOSKY: The Winchester name is the stuff of myth and legend including that famous tag line.

HERB HOUSE: Probably one of the greatest advertising slogans that was ever devised is that phrase, The Gun that Won the West. It's not terribly accurate but it was a good selling point.

DANKOSKY: Gun historian Herb House lives in Cody, Wyoming. He says the early Winchester repeater rifles were out of the price range of most pioneers but for those who could afford them, House says, they came in handy.

HOUSE: They were a very good weapon for defense in the early years of the westward expansion. When you have a rifle that can fire 16 times with one loading against a single shot musket or something like that, then they became one of the most popular sporting guns, hunting rifles.

DANKOSKY: Not surprising with one of Winchester leading proponents being president and big game hunter Theodore Roosevelt. House says the Winchester was accurate, reliable and one of the only American rifles widely available overseas. He says that market only grew with the help of another larger than life figure, John Wayne.

SOUNDBITE: JOHN WAYNE

HOUSE: The world sees America through our film industry and for years the biggest export were cowboy films.

DANKOSKY: Do you personally have a favorite movie that features a Winchester rifle?

HOUSE: Actually it's the Winchester 73 with James Stewart.

DANKOSKY: That 73 is in 1873.

SOUNDBITE: JAMES STEWART

DANKOSKY: Then in 1958 the TV show The Rifleman with Chuck Connors help put dreams of Winchesters in the heads of young boys across America. But in the following decades demand for the gun shrank along with Winchester's workforce. From a high of about 19,000 employees to fewer than 200. In the 1980's the Olen Corporation, which ran Winchester for decades, sold the plants to a company from Belgium. Paul Demanato the facility director at the New Haven plants says it was all part of a changing American culture.

PAUL DEMANATO: There aren't as many young people going into the shooting sports. It could be a sign of the times, also, where fathers don't have time to take sons out and do the things with them that for example my dad did.

DANKOSKY: Demanato has been working here off and on since he was 19. His father worked here before him. He'd like to see Winchester stay in New Haven but he knows it can't keep losing money. New Haven Mayor John DeStefano says he's working to find a buyer who will keep the plant open but admits it won't be easy.

JOHN DESTEFANO: With the Winchester rife you basically had a product whose technology in many respects is a hundred years old and whose market was slipping away.

DANKOSKY: Mayor DeStefano says it is now up to the Olen Corporation, which held on to the Winchester name when it sold the company years ago. An Olen spokesperson says they're disappointed in the decision to close the plant and hope to license the name to another company that can carry on the Winchester tradition. Meanwhile gun enthusiasts see the writing on the wall. They say collectable Winchesters made in New Haven that might sell for $800.00 today could double in price overnight if the plant closes. It's like what happens with a painting, they say, when a great artist dies. For NPR News I'm John Dankosky.

""Why did he even have a gun?"" — it's a common refrain in America, often after mass shootings by people who legally aren't supposed to have firearms.

One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns.

It happened again a week later, when a man in Rancho Tehama, Calif., killed four people and shot up the outside of a school. He, too, had been ordered to give up his guns, but verification of his compliance was left to the ""honor system.""

""The system is reactive,"" says Chris Anderson, a prosecutor in the City Attorney Office in Seattle, Wash. ""The court says you're prohibited from possessing firearms, and if you're later arrested with a firearm, then you're guilty ... but there's never been a mechanism in place to go get those firearms.""

For the last couple of years, Anderson has been part of a collaboration between the city and King County to curb gun violence. One of the first things the group did was measure the compliance rate for orders to surrender weapons. It turned out to be shockingly low. In 2016, 56 percent of the people who received the orders simply ignored them. And of those who did respond, a suspiciously small number actually surrendered any guns.

That's why Seattle police are now following up on those court orders — in person.

Officers Ellen Kernan and Sean Hamlin spend their days contacting people who've just been ordered to surrender their firearms. The orders are usually the result of a domestic violence incident. The officers often seek out accused abusers at their workplaces, where they're more likely to be cooperative.

""Do you have any guns?"" Officer Kernan asks a barista, after she's asked him to step outside the coffee shop where he works. The barista's girlfriend has filed for a temporary protection order, and told investigators he owns a handgun. But the barista tells Kernan he doesn't.

""I've never even handled a gun,"" he says.

Right now, the officers have no choice but to accept that.

""Who to believe? I don't know,"" says Officer Hamlin, on the way back to their car.

It's complicated work, figuring out whether someone owns a gun. Government records are little help — the state tracks purchase histories, but only for licensed gun stores, not gun shows and one-on-one sales. One police officer on this task force dismisses the tracking system as ""full of holes.""

This is one of the main explanations for why police so rarely follow up on gun removal orders in America: It takes a lot of time and effort.

In Seattle, there are now money and staffers dedicated to the effort. Prosecutors and law enforcement meet on a regular basis to review the surrender orders coming out of the courts, and target the most urgent cases.

When they suspect gun owners are holding out on them, they have the option of asking for a search warrant. Officer Hamlin says that usually depends on how detailed the victim's claims are.

""If she has specific allegations of, 'I saw this gun, he always has this gun on him,' or, 'He always hides it under his pillow when he sleeps at night,' more likely than not we would get that search warrant signed by the judge and go do it.""

The problem with search warrants is they can provoke a defensive reaction by the gun owner, escalating the danger for police. That's why searches require the participation of a SWAT team.

So in most cases, the gun removal task force chooses the route of persuasion. Anderson says that means a lot of time on the phone, talking to the gun owners' lawyers — and their family.

""We call people's moms, we call their aunt, we call their uncle,"" he says. ""And we explain to them, 'look, he's not just a risk to the victims, and he's a risk to himself. And it's just better if we have the guns.'""

The approach is working, according to preliminary numbers. As the inter-jurisdictional gun removal effort ramped up last year, the number of guns surrendered sky-rocketed. As many as 134 firearms were turned over in 15 weeks — that's compared to 124 guns surrendered in all of 2016, before the effort was launched.

So far, the jump in surrendered firearms has not alarmed gun rights groups.

""We've had no complaints from anybody in the public that King County has violated anybody's rights,"" says Alan Gottlieb, with the the Second Amendment Foundation. ""We also don't want guns in the hands of prohibited people.""

This emphasis on improving the enforcement of existing gun laws is also giving hope to gun control groups, many of whom see it as the only politically viable strategy for reducing gun violence, at least in the short term. A number of states — including some in pro-gun rights regions of the country — have been changing policies to make it easier for law enforcment to find out whether felons and other ""prohibited persons"" are in possession of firearms.

""When we do polls and look at the data... we find that with issues like domestic violence restrictions, actually there are areas where there's a high fairly high amount of agreement,"" says Shannon Frattaroli, with the Center for Gun Policy and Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

National Gun Theft On The Rise Across The Country Gun Theft On The Rise Across The Country Listen · 3:40 3:40

Frattaroli focuses on guns and domestic violence, and says the research shows the life-saving value of having police remove guns from a house soon after an incident.

""We know that that period of separation, when a woman is separating from a man, is a very dangerous time for her,"" she says.

With that insight in mind, the gun removal program in Seattle often tries to visit the home of a domestic violence victim while the alleged abuser is still in jail.

SPD Sgt. Dorothy Kim, who leads the police portion of the gun removal team, is doing just that — visiting the apartment of a woman whose boyfriend just spent the night in jail on domestic violence charges. Kim wants to collect his firearms before he posts bail.

""It gives you guys a chance to cool off and make sure everybody stays safe,"" Kim tells the girlfriend. ""That's the point of getting the weapons before he's released. It's better for law enforcement, it's better for you, it's better for him, really.""

The girlfriend readily agrees. This approach doesn't require a warrant, because the girlfriend also lives here and can consent to the search. Just in the past few weeks, searches with the permission of live-in girlfriends or partners have led Seattle Police to discover two large caches of weapons and ammunition — dozens of guns and tens of thousands of rounds.

In this apartment, there's only one gun, a semi-automatic rifle. Still, Sgt. Kim says it's a step in the right direction. As she takes the rifle to her car, she says there's a good chance the boyfriend will avoid a domestic violence conviction and eventually get the gun back.

""But I feel better just knowing that at least during this time when emotions are running high, we've gotten it out, at least for a little bit,"" she says."

Kansas is being held up as an example of how states can pass meaningful gun laws. NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Republican state Sen. Barbara Bollier about what's being done there.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

As some of the students you just heard pointed out, often after a terrible event like last week's shooting, gun control advocates in particular complain that nothing is being done to address gun violence. And that might be true on the federal level, but we wondered what the states are up to. In our reporting, one state stood out - Kansas. It has a Republican governor and a Republican controlled legislature. Conventional wisdom suggests that they would be friendly to the gun lobby, but gun safety groups point to Kansas as a state where progress is being made. So to talk about that, we called State Senator Barbara Bollier. She is a Republican lawmaker in Kansas. We reached her in her office at the state capitol, and I asked her what the focus of the gun safety conversation is there.

BARBARA BOLLIER: You know, it depends on the year, Michel. And last year, we focused on making sure that guns were not permitted in our mental health hospitals. And thankfully, the legislature was able to pass laws that would disallow that so the hospitals can control that themselves and say no. So I would tell you that here because we have essentially three parties - we have a Democrat Party, we have a moderate Republican Party, and we have a conservative Republican Party - we are kind of all over the map on what might be introduced as far as legislation. But what actually goes through, it takes usually moderate Republicans and Democrats working together to have a majority to pass meaningful anti-gun violence legislation.

MARTIN: Well, what are some of the things that are being discussed in this legislative session? I know that last year there was a whole conversation about teaching gun safety in the schools. The NRA has a curriculum aimed at children. And I understand that there was an effort made to mandate that the NRA curriculum be used for the lower grades.

BOLLIER: Yes. And that legislation is still around. We have changed the legal age that someone can carry on campus. It passed in the House to move it down to 18. But we did add in on the House side as well the requirement to actually have training. The bill hasn't come to the Senate yet. I will tell you that, personally, I have Senate Bill 390 that is an extreme risk protection order. It is a way to say if law enforcement finds and knows that there's someone that either - there's a domestic violence issue or a possible suicide, this would give instructions on how you could legally remove with judge's orders temporarily a gun so that you would get out of the extreme risk time and prevent a death and make it so that people have a chance to say, yes, you can keep your gun, but right now, you shouldn't have your gun.

MARTIN: Well, I mean, it sounds to me as though you're still on a one step forward, two steps back kind of mindset there. Do you have any advice for colleagues in other states who are trying to, you know, keep in this?

BOLLIER: Yeah. The advice absolutely is don't stop trying because we are supposed to be a government of the people. And the people are crying out to us as government leaders to do something that's reasonable. And as long as you have politicians who are backed with millions of dollars from the NRA directly and indirectly, we're going to have a problem. So you have to make that a primary issue of why you're determining that you're voting or not voting for someone, whatever it is your issue is. This is a critical one in this country, and we need to wake up about it.

MARTIN: That's State Senator Barbara Bollier. She is a Republican. She's serving in Kansas. And we reached her in her office in Topeka. Senator, thank you so much for speaking with us.

BOLLIER: Thank you for having me. And let's hope something can change.

In the seven days that have followed the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people, students from the Florida campus have moved from terror to grief to activism, inspiring a national youth-led protest against political inaction on gun reform.

On Wednesday, the Parkland students — still mourning and fueled by anger — made their way to the state capitol in Tallahassee to confront lawmakers to demand a ban on assault weapons.

But as NPR reported, while Florida House lawmakers opened the day's session with a prayer for the victims, they did not open debate on a bill that would ban assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines.

Still, the Parkland victims' protest has mobilized students all over the country who are fearful of yet another fatal school shootings. From coast to coast teens are staging walk outs of their own, urging national and local legislators to enact laws that might prevent future gun violence in schools.

Dozens of students in Bellingham, Wash., began preparing for the walk-out gathering to make signs late Tuesday night. They planned to leave their classrooms at 11:22 — the same time as the Parkland shooting.

In an television interview with KOMO News, one student who's not quite 18 years-old and withheld her name said, ""We can't vote, so this is our voice. We're just hoping to make a change by having our voices heard.""

High school students in Missoula, Mont., trudged through the snow to participate in the national movement. The yelled, ""This is what democracy looks like,"" as they took their protest to Sen. Steve Daines' (R- Mont.) office.

In Minneapolis Fox 9 has been broadcasting video footage of high school students from the school district in a procession down city streets toward City Hall.

The network reported that ""Minneapolis City Council members are working on language to vote on the city taking an official position favoring a statewide assault weapon ban.""

Teen protesters from the D.C. metro area converged on the U.S. Capitol and in front of the White House. WAMU public radio reporter Mikaela Lefrak followed along as organizers read the names of the Florida shooting victims.

Hundreds of students held up homemade signs as they marched across the National Mall. One read: ""We want education without fear of annihilation.""

The Hill reported hundreds of students from Maryland also made their way toward the U.S. Capitol to demand action on gun control.

New Jersey students from Southern Regional High School walked out of class and staged a rally on the campus lawn.

In addition to Wednesday's events Marjory Stoneman Douglas students are also planning a rally against school and gun violence called ""March for Our Lives"" in Washington D.C. on March 24.

For those who can't make it to D.C. they are encouraging organizers to lead local rallies and protests around the U.S. on the same day.

The Women's March youth branch, EMPOWER, is also organizing a national school walk out on March 14, the one month anniversary of the Florida shooting. CNN says the rallies are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in every time zone and last for 17 minutes — one for each victim who lost their life in the massacre."

The U.S. Supreme Court has, once again, declined to hear a Second Amendment case, turning away a constitutional challenge to a 10-day waiting period for the purchase of guns in California. The court's decision not to hear the case came over an angry dissent from conservative Justice Clarence Thomas.

The decision to stay out of the California case is the latest sign of the justices' reluctance to enter the national debate over gun control. While the decision has no legal importance, the practical effect is to leave in place California's waiting period, and others like it. Such laws are designed in part to prevent impulsive violence and suicides.

Gun rights activists had argued that the 10-day waiting period violates the second amendment guarantee of a right to keep and bear arms, especially for those who already legally own guns and have passed background checks.

From The Archives 2017: Supreme Court Won't Hear Challenge To Calif. Gun Carry Law Supreme Court Won't Hear Challenge To Calif. Gun Carry Law Listen · 3:57 3:57

But the court, as it has done consistently in recent years, decided not to take up the case. The last major set of gun cases came in 2008 and 2010, when the court ruled for the first time that individuals have a right to own a gun for self-defense in their homes.

Although those decisions left considerable room for gun regulation, it also left many questions unanswered, and since then the court has rejected the pleas of gun rights activists to hear their challenges to other laws that limit when and where states may limit guns.

Referring to this record of nonintervention, Justice Thomas accused his fellow justices of treating the right to bear arms as a ""disfavored"" constitutional right.

He contended that his fellow justices would have easily agreed to hear other cases if they involved the right to free speech, the right to abortion, or the right to be free from unreasonable searches. Noting that the court has not reviewed an important gun rights case in eight years, he castigated his colleagues for treating gun rights as ""a constitutional orphan."""

In trying to clarify his Wednesday comments about arming teachers and other school personnel, President Trump, a day later, aligned himself even more closely with the National Rifle Association on the issue of teachers with guns and beefing up school security.

So much so, they seemed, at times, to be reading from the same script.

Here's how the day started — with NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC (emphasis ours):

""Can we protect so much with armed security, while we drop our kids off at school, that are so-called gun-free zones, that are wide-open targets for any crazy madman bent on evil to come there first? There first? In every community, PTAs, teachers' unions, local law enforcement, moms and dads – they all must come together to implement the very best strategy to harden their schools, including effective trained, armed security that will absolutely protect every innocent child in this country. That has to happen now. Evil walks among us, and God help us if we do not harden our schools and protect our kids. ... ""I refuse to leave this stage until I say one more time that we must immediately harden our schools. Every day— every day, young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open, soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder. It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewelry store or some Hollywood gala. Schools must be the most hardened targets in this country.""

Hours later, Trump was at the White House talking about school safety after last week's mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school. Notice, Trump used some of the same talking points, key words and phrases as LaPierre (again, emphasis ours):

""We have to harden our schools, not soften them. A gun-free zone to a killer or somebody who wants to be a killer, that's like going in for the ice cream. That's like 'here I am, take me.' We have to get smart on gun-free zones. When they see 'this is a gun-free zone,' that means that nobody has a gun except them, nobody's going to be shooting bullets in the other direction. And they see that, it's such a beautiful target. They live for gun-free zones. ""Now what I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus, we give them a little bit of a bonus, because frankly they'd feel more comfortable having the gun anyway, you give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free you've now made the school into a hardened target. ... ""You want a hardened school, and I want a hardened school, too.""

So when it comes to ""hardening"" schools, not a phrase that was in wide use before Thursday, and speaking out against ""gun-free zones,"" it appears the president and the NRA are, well, on the same page.

Trump does appear, however, to differ with the gun lobby when it comes to his support of increasing the age to be able to buy an assault rifle, from 18 to 21. Trump said he wasn't concerned, though, about that.

""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Trump said. ""I really think the NRA wants to do what's right. I mean, they're very close to me; I'm very close to them; they're very, very great people. They love this country. They're patriots. The NRA wants to do the right thing.""

And then in his next sentence, he may have given away the reason he and the NRA seem to be using similar, and sometimes the exact same, language.

""I've spoken to them often in the last two days,"" Trump acknowledged, ""and they want to do the right thing.""

Trump also reiterated his calls for arming more teachers and other adults working in the nations' schools, something LaPierre also called for. But Trump has made several conflicting statements on the controversial issue over the course of less than 24 hours beginning Wednesday.

At White House listening sessions Wednesday with students and parents, including some from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman killed 17 people last week, Trump said, ""If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, it could very well end the attack very quickly.""

But Thursday morning, the president put out a barrage of tweets, defending himself and clarifying, ""I never said 'give teachers guns' like was stated on Fake News."" He added that he wanted to look at the possibility of giving ""concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience.""

In his subsequent White House meeting Thursday with state and local officials to discuss schoool safety, Trump expanded on that.

""I don't want teachers to have guns,"" he said. ""I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns. If they really have that aptitude, because not everybody has an aptitude for a gun. I think a concealed permit for teachers and letting people know there are people in the building with a gun, you won't have, in my opinion, you won't have these shootings.""

An armed guard was present at the Florida high school last week, but resigned Thursday after video footage showed that he never went inside the building to engage the shooter.

""He never went in,"" Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference Thursday. ""Devastated. Sick to my stomach"" is how Israel described how he felt when he learned the school resource officer didn't engage the shooter. ""There are no words. I mean, these families lost their children.""

The idea of arming teachers, while pushed by the NRA, is opposed by the nation's largest teachers union. In a statement, National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen Garcia said:

""Bringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms. Parents and educators overwhelmingly reject the idea of arming school staff. Educators need to be focused on teaching our students. We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that.""

Trump on Thursday also expressed doubts about active shooter drills in schools, calling them ""a very negative thing,"" ""crazy"" and ""very bad.""

""I'll be honest with you,"" Trump said. ""If I'm a child, I'm 10 years old, and they say, 'We're going to have an active shooter drill,' I say, 'What's that?' 'Well, people may come in and shoot you.' I think that's a very negative thing to be talking about, to be honest with you. I don't like it. I'd much rather have a hardened school.""

The president said unless a school has ""offensive capability, you're wasting your time, you're wasting your time.""

The president also shifted blame from guns to violent movies and video games. They are ""really shaping young people's thoughts,"" Trump contended, reminding of the national debate after Columbine in 1999. The shooters at Columbine listened to the music of rocker Marilyn Manson, popular with high-schoolers all over the country at the time.

""The Columbine era destroyed my entire career at the time,"" Manson told The Guardian this past September.

Trump claimed Thursday, ""You see these movies, and they're so violent and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn't involved.""

He then called for a ratings system, something that has long existed for movies and video games.

Two survivors of the Stoneman Douglas shooting disputed the president's logic.

""My friends and I have been playing video games our whole lives, and seen, of course, violent movies,"" Samuel Zeif told CNN, ""but never have we ever felt driven or provoked by those action in those games to do something as horrible as this.""

Chris Grady called the presidents' comments ""a pathetic excuse.""

""I grew up playing video games,"" Grady said, citing Call of Duty and other first-person shooter games. ""I would never, ever dream of taking the lives of any of my peers.

""So it's just pathetic."""

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Could the reaction to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., actually result in some changes to gun laws? President Trump has come out in favor of arming teachers, banning bump stocks, raising the age to be able to purchase guns and tougher background checks. But what's the status of existing gun regulations? What has changed since Mr. Trump has become president?

We're going to turn now to James Burnett. He's editorial director of The Trace, a nonprofit news organization that reports on guns in America. He joins us from member station WVTF in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Burnett, thanks for being with us.

JAMES BURNETT: Thanks for having me on, Scott.

SIMON: Let's begin with the idea to raise the age to be able to purchase an assault weapon. What's the law now?

BURNETT: The law now differs whether the gun being purchased is a handgun or what is broadly defined as a long gun. So the law is that if it's a handgun, you need to be 21. But long guns - rifles, shotguns and assault-style rifles included - that's 18. And after Parkland, where the perpetrator was 19 and legally purchased an assault-style rifle, there has been a call to raise that minimum age for assault-style rifles and all long guns.

SIMON: What about arming teachers? What changes to the law would be required?

BURNETT: That gets complex. We do have the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which was signed with the first President Bush. But it allows for some discretion at the state and local level. And some states allow individual districts to set their own policies. And so we at The Trace of reported on districts in Ohio that allow certain designated teachers and other school staff members to access guns. Texas is another state where that happens. So, in fact, there are some states where there are guns in schools accessible to some teachers and staff members.

SIMON: Have there been gun laws that have been rolled back by the Trump administration?

BURNETT: The big picture under Trump is that not much has changed, which is interesting because Trump had such strong backing from the National Rifle Association. And they have two big priorities. One is something called concealed carry reciprocity. And the upshot is that if you have a license to carry a concealed gun in your home state, every other state would have to honor that license and vice versa. That does pass the House in December - not taken up by the Senate.

And the other one is silencers or suppressors - a push to deregulate those devices. And that hasn't gone through. So the big ticket items that the NRA wants the NRA doesn't get. You mentioned at the top there this idea of strengthening background checks. I think it's important to be specific about what's under discussion there. There is bipartisan legislation. And what it would do would provide grants to the states to make sure that all of the records that show that a person is prohibited from owning a gun get into the databases that are scanned during a background check.

SIMON: Mr. Burnett, there's renewed interest on the sale of assault weapons. A ban went into effect in 1994. It expired 10 years later. Based on your reporting, what effect did that ban have?

BURNETT: There is some evidence - and we talk about assault - bans on assault-style weapons. What a lot of public safety experts say is the most meaningful piece of that is a restriction on how large the magazine - the ammunition magazine - that's basically how many rounds the gun can hold at one time, can be fired at one time before you have to reload.

SIMON: Is there, in your mind, compelling evidence that the ban on assault weapons actually succeeded in banning assault weapons or reduced the supply or use of assault weapons and criminal activity?

BURNETT: I think the evidence on that is mixed. There is some evidence that fewer assault-style rifles were used in rampage shootings during that 10-year period. So if your goal is to reduce the use of assault-style rifles in school shootings, mass shootings, other forms of rampage attacks, there's some data or evidence that says yes. But it's a pretty small sample. If you're talking about reducing all forms of gun death and injury, you'd have to look more seriously at handguns because in the sheer quantity, that's the gun used in most shootings.

SIMON: James Burnett, editorial director of The Trace, thanks so much for being with us.

BURNETT: Thank you.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl about the narrow point of intersection between the worlds of mental illness and gun violence. He says there's not much more the mental health field can do to prevent potential mass shooters, since the best predictive factors fall out of the scope of the medical field.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Lawmakers are trying to decide what they can do now to prevent future mass shootings from happening. And one phrase that keeps coming up again and again is mental health.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LINDSEY GRAHAM: What I want to look at is the mental health science.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PAUL RYAN: Do we have the kind of mental health laws that we need on the books?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN CORNYN: ...Whether mental health officials could have done more.

CHANG: That's all from this week, all from Republican lawmakers - Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John Cornyn of Texas. We're now going to turn to Jonathan Metzl. He is a psychiatrist and professor at Vanderbilt University. Welcome.

JONATHAN METZL: Thanks so much for having me.

CHANG: First of all, I know that you take issue with this call from politicians that mental health professionals like you need to step up and help prevent gun violence. Why do you think that's the wrong way to approach this?

METZL: Well, certainly we should all do everything we can to prevent gun violence, and I think that mental health expertise is an important part of the conversation. But the reason that I and other people in my position write against this is first of all because people with mental illness are not a particularly high-risk group for gun violence or for mass shootings.

There's no psychiatric diagnosis that's aligned with harming other people, let alone shooting people. And the diagnoses that get thrown around in the aftermath of these horrible crimes like schizophrenia or depression, other factors like that, themselves are not aligned with violent attacks toward other people. And in that regard, there also are no tools that psychiatrists can use to say this one person with mental illness is going to harm somebody else, and this other person is not.

And I guess the last reason is that, as we're seeing after the horrible mass shooting in Florida, many mass shooters don't meet the criteria for severe mental illness in any way that would cause them to be flagged on a background check system, let alone hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.

CHANG: How much interaction is there between mental health professionals like you and the background check system?

METZL: Well, the only way that someone can get their name on the federal background check system from the perspective of mental illness is either to be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital or if a court or government body declares a person mentally incompetent. And this is a very small sliver of patients who psychiatrists see.

First of all, the bar for admitting someone to a psychiatric hospital is quite high and particularly if that person is being admitted against their wishes. And even then, most people are released within a 72-hour period so don't meet the criteria for the background check system where a judge decides that they have to stay in for a longer period of time.

And even after that, if their name is entered into a background check system, people can buy guns at gun shows - there are many different loopholes - or just borrow guns from family members. And so in this sense, it's a very inexact science and unfortunately not a very effective one at this point.

CHANG: After a mass shooting happens, it's easy to conclude that the person who committed mass murder is a mentally troubled person. But there are all these social and environmental factors going on in that person's life. Not everything rises to the level of a diagnosable, treatable disease. So it places you in this precarious position where you have to be predictive when it's a mushy assessment.

METZL: It's a very mushy assessment. That's - I think that's really the key take-home point - is that psychiatric diagnosis is itself not a predictive science. In other words, there's nothing in psychiatric diagnosis that's going to tell you how somebody is going to act in one week or one year. And in that sense, putting psychiatrists in the position of having to predict something in the future is really at odds with their expertise.

CHANG: So if it is so difficult to be predictive, how do mental health professionals get involved in this conversation about curbing gun violence?

METZL: Psychiatrists are really good at looking at broader societal factors that look at prevention - in other words, what kinds of people or communities are at high risk across the board. For example, we know that if there is an interpersonal altercation and people are inebriated, there's alcohol present and there's a gun lying nearby, that that altercation is more likely to end in some kind of shooting. And so why is it that we have policies that allow people to carry loaded handguns into bars in many states?

We also know that gun violence happens within social networks. For instance, you're much more likely to be shot by your neighbor, your cousin, your boyfriend, your partner than you are by some random stranger. And so we should also track gun violence within social networks. These are all societal factors that are not linked directly to mental illness diagnosis.

CHANG: So what it sounds like is the legislative options about mental health are limited.

METZL: I think they don't pay attention to trends that we know happen in gun violence in the society. This is not to say that mental health expertise isn't an important part of the conversation, but it's just one piece of the broader conversation about what our society should do to, on one hand, respect people's rights and, on the other hand, create safer society.

CHANG: All right, that's Jonathan Metzl. He's a psychiatrist who directs the Vanderbilt University Center for Medicine, Health and Society. Thank you very much.

METZL: Thanks so much.

Congress returns this week for the first time since a shooter killed 17 people inside a Florida high school. Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA who has written extensively about gun regulations, joins NPR's Ailsa Chang to talk about various proposals to regulate access to guns — and what impact those policies could have on preventing mass shootings.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

What laws will come out of all the gun control activism on display by Marjory Stoneman Douglas students? That's a big question as Congress reconvenes for the first time since the deadly Florida school shooting. The students are organized, and they have demands.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We want assault rifles off the market.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We just need age restrictions and higher checks when people are trying to purchase these weapons.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: There is no place in our society for large-capacity magazines capable...

CHANG: But a major argument often heard on the other side is that most of the proposals gun control advocates push for would be ineffective in preventing mass shootings. To run through various proposals and assess their impact, we're going to turn to Adam Winkler. He's a law professor at UCLA who's written extensively on gun control. Welcome.

ADAM WINKLER: Thank you so much for having me.

CHANG: So we should first mention that in assessing the impact of various gun proposals, there isn't a lot of data out there.

WINKLER: That's right. The NRA and its allies have pushed laws that restrict the ability of federal agencies to finance gun violence prevention research. But it's also a difficult problem because there are so many guns, and figuring out exactly what causes crime has bedeviled researchers for ages. So it's very difficult to know whether one particular reform will have a huge impact on gun violence.

CHANG: That said, I want to look a little more closely at various proposals that have been offered up time and time again. I want to start with something President Trump has talked a lot about in recent days, and that is raising the minimum age to buy a rifle.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18.

CHANG: Do you think that this is actually an effective proposal?

WINKLER: Federal law has traditionally prohibited 18- to 21-year-olds from buying handguns but not rifles with the idea being that rifles are traditionally hunting weapons. In recent years, the rifles have changed. They're more likely to be military-style assault rifles. At the same time, we should remember that raising the gun age won't stop someone like an Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter, from getting a gun because he just stole it from his mother.

CHANG: A federal assault weapons ban was in place for a decade from 1994 to 2004. It had been pushed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. She tried to revive it again after Newtown.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DIANNE FEINSTEIN: The weapons I talk about can fire hundreds of rounds a minute with velocities and energy far exceeding the standard handguns. They don't belong on the streets.

CHANG: There have been some studies about whether that 10-year ban reduced gun violence. Were those studies at all conclusive?

WINKLER: It's very difficult to make conclusive studies on this. The only one study that really looked at the effect of the assault weapons ban found that these weapons were found less frequently at crime scenes. But the authors cautioned that it was likely that they just replaced those weapons with handguns or other kinds of rifles. About half or more of the mass shootings are committed with a handgun.

CHANG: Right.

WINKLER: It's not clear that you take an assault weapon out of a shooter's hands, that they're not going to commit this killing.

CHANG: A proposal that's often paired with a possible assault weapons ban is a proposal that would limit high-capacity magazines. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida made some news last week.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARCO RUBIO: Because I traditionally have not supported looking at magazine clip size. And after this and some of the details I've learned about it, I'm reconsidering that position, and I'll tell you why.

(APPLAUSE)

RUBIO: I'll tell you why - because while it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack.

CHANG: Is that a proposal where we might actually see some overlap between the gun control and gun rights sides of the debate? Or is Rubio kind of out on a limb there?

WINKLER: I'd be very surprised if gun control forces could get a federal law banning high-capacity magazines. These magazines are incredibly common. They're standard issue in most handguns that are purchased today, also very common in rifles. It is a reform that does target the lethality of the weapon, how many rounds of ammunition a particular weapon can carry before it has to be reloaded.

The difficult thing is that California, for instance, has banned the possession of high-capacity magazines. But initial reports from law enforcement were that virtually no one has turned theirs in even though there's probably somewhere between 7 and 10 million high-capacity magazines in California.

CHANG: A huge part of the discussion going forward in these weeks after Parkland is going to be about universal background checks. The main argument on the gun rights side about background checks is that it's the database that's the problem - has too many holes. There are people who have domestic violence records who don't show up. There are people with interactions with law enforcement who don't show up.

WINKLER: That's right. The federal background check system is riddled with holes. For instance, Dylann Roof, the Charleston church shooter, was able to buy a gun despite the fact that he had previously admitted to gun possession and should have been flagged in the background check system. So we need better reporting into the background check system. But we also need to expand the background check system to cover gun shows and Internet sales and classified ad sales.

CHANG: I'm curious. What percentage of gun sales happen that way?

WINKLER: Estimates range from 13 percent to 40 percent. But even if it was just 13 percent...

CHANG: Yeah.

WINKLER: ...That's about 3 million guns a year that are being sold in America without a background check.

CHANG: Finally, I want to talk about banning bump stocks. This idea gathered traction after the shootings in Las Vegas.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: To modify his weapons and fire so many bullets and cause so much carnage in such a short amount of time.

CHANG: Does this feel like a proposal that's just kind of low-hanging fruit for lawmakers right now?

WINKLER: Indeed, banning bump stocks does seem like low-hanging fruit. Even the NRA has come out in favor of at least ATF regulations that would ban bump stocks. And while most mass shootings do not involve bump stocks, if you can even stop one or two mass shootings from using them, you could have a big impact.

CHANG: You know, as we're talking here, I'm reminded of sort of the ultimate argument often heard on the gun rights side, and that is, someone who is intent on murdering a lot of people can easily circumvent the law no matter what laws are passed. You've studied this for a very long time. What's your take? Is it still worth it to try to come up with legislative solutions?

WINKLER: It is true that in a nation that has 350 million guns in civilian hands, it's going to be hard to stop that one person who's really determined to kill. At the same time, we can do more to bring down the daily death toll from gun violence. Since the 17 people died in the Parkland shooting, we've seen hundreds of Americans lose their lives to gun violence. The best thing we can do to reduce the daily death toll of gun violence is universal background checks. Make it harder for a criminal or someone who's mentally ill to get their hands on guns.

CHANG: All right, Adam Winkler is a law professor at UCLA. Thank you very much.

WINKLER: Thank you so much.
