WASHINGTON—The White House signaled Friday that President Donald Trump is backing away from a broad overhaul of U.S. gun policy and focusing on more modest changes, after his Thursday night meeting with the National Rifle Association.

BlackRock Inc. BLK -1.75% went public with the questions that it is asking gun makers and sellers in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., an unusual step by the world’s largest money manager by assets.

The notice, posted to BlackRock’s website Friday, is the latest sign that some money managers are ramping up pressure on companies that make and sell weapons. The questions range from litigation risks and gun safety to background checks and staff training.

“We cannot dictate what a company should do,” BlackRock said, but warned it generally has the ability to vote against individual directors or in favor of shareholder proposals.

Blackstone Group LP last weekend asked outside fund managers to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns. State Street Global Advisors, another big money manager, has said it also plans to reach out to gun makers with questions.

A number of U.S. companies have reassessed their relationships with the gun industry and the National Rifle Association following last month’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Major retailers, including Kroger Co. , Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., said this past week that they would stop selling guns to anyone under 21 years old.

BlackRock is the largest shareholder in gun makers Sturm Ruger & Co. and American Outdoor Brands , AOBC -0.81% formerly known as Smith & Wesson, as well as a large shareholder in firms such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods. BlackRock said in the notice that it doesn’t own any gun makers in its actively managed stock funds, and in its index-tracking funds, those companies account for 0.01% of assets under management.

The New York money manager has met with clients, including pension funds and other institutional investors, to discuss ways they can exclude gun stocks from their portfolios if they wish to and what BlackRock is asking of executives at companies that make or distribute guns, according to people familiar with those efforts.

It held one such conference call for large customers as recently as Friday morning, with executives focused on corporate stewardship and client relationships.

BlackRock and other large money managers that control funds tied to market indexes say they prefer not to use their heft to make immediate demands such as putting an individual on the board or divesting business units, in contrast to more aggressive dictates from activist directors. Instead, they say they like to work behind the scenes and question their portfolio companies routinely about their policies and plans.

But it is rare for BlackRock to make those questions public.

Last year, BlackRock stopped short of detailing the types of questions it asked company boards and executives in a paper that broadly laid out how it engaged with its portfolio companies on climate-change risk.

In the notice Friday, BlackRock called gun violence “an issue of tremendous urgency.”

The questions the firm said were being posed to gun makers and distributors include broad inquiries such as how they measure the “financial, reputational and litigation risk” of those respective businesses and what actions they take to support gun safety and education.

But BlackRock is also posing specific queries of gun makers, such as if they monitor whether the distributors of their weapons “have a high volume of their guns identified as having been used in crimes,” if they are spending money on research to improve gun safety, and if they require retailers to train their staff or certify that they conduct background checks.

For gun distributors, BlackRock asked what steps they take to make sure gun laws are followed such as “prohibiting felons or domestic abuse offenders from purchasing firearms; sales to minors of certain products; training provided to employees so they comply with applicable laws and regulations.”

BlackRock previously said that it planned to meet with weapons-related companies but stopped short of publicly articulating what type of information it planned to seek from them. It and other managers of index-tracking funds typically keep the contents of their engagements with portfolio companies private.

“We are fundamentally looking to understand whether the company has the appropriate policies and controls in place and is sufficiently managing the risks associated with these issues,” the new BlackRock notice said.

It’s the newest question facing CEOs: Should they thrust their businesses into polarizing political debates?

In the two weeks since a gunman killed 17 people at a Parkland, Fla., high school, many companies have taken a stand on gun control, prompted partly by a movement with the online rallying cry #NRABoycott.

But when companies take sides in a charged issue, they often have to grapple with a new set of risks to their reputation and business, not least the risk of offending a sizable portion of consumers on the other side.

On Wednesday, Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. DKS -1.78% —two of the biggest gun sellers in the U.S.—joined the growing list of companies taking action after the Florida massacre. Both companies said they would raise its minimum age for gun buyers at their stores to 21. Dick’s also said it would stop selling all assault-style weapons at its 35 Field and Stream stores and would no longer sell high-capacity magazines of ammunition.

“We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms,” Walmart said in a statement. The retailer, which sells rifles, shotguns and ammunition in thousands of its stores, had stopped sales of assault-style rifles in 2015.

“Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America—our kids,” Dick’s Chief Executive Edward Stack said in a letter posted on Facebook and the company’s website. Many consumers took to Twitter and Facebook to either condemn or praise the move.

Rival Academy Sports + Outdoors, in Katy, Texas, though, defended its gun sales. It said it is committed to the legal and safe transfer of firearms and favors strengthening the nation’s background-check system.

Business leaders are increasingly under pressure, largely from younger generations of socially conscious and digital-media savvy consumers and employees, to take a stand on everything from immigration to gay rights to climate change.

Nearly half of millennials, a generation largely born in the 1980s and 1990s, believe CEOs have a responsibility to speak up about issues important to society, according to a 2017 survey by Weber Shandwick. In contrast, only 28% of Generation Xers, now in their 40s and early 50s, and baby boomers agreed.

Michael Dowling, CEO of Northwell Health, the biggest hospital chain in New York state with 66,000 employees, said he feels more responsibility now to speak up on social issues than when he took the helm in 2002.

“We are, at the end of the day, community leaders,” Mr. Dowling said. “We are people that other people look up to.”

In some cases, companies’ responses have unleashed an online backlash as heated as the initial social-media firestorm—a reminder to companies that in placating one consumer group, it’s easy to alienate another.

A recent survey found companies that have ended discounts for National Rifle Association members in recent days lost more than they gained in reputation. For example, while MetLife Inc.’s 45% favorable rating didn’t change after respondents learned it ended its NRA discount, the proportion of respondents with an unfavorable view of MetLife doubled to 24%. The poll of 2,201 Americans was conducted by market-research firm Morning Consult. A spokesman for MetLife declined to comment.

Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. incurred the wrath of Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, after dropping its discount on flights to the NRA’s annual convention. He also threatened to kill a pending bill that would provide a jet fuel tax break at Atlanta’s airport, Delta’s main hub. Mr. Cagle called on Delta to fully restore its relationship with the NRA, which claims nearly five million members.

“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” he tweeted.

Delta didn’t respond to requests to comment. When the airline ended the discounts, it said it supported the Second Amendment right to bear arms but cut the program to reflect its “neutral status” in the national gun debate.

The NRA lashed out at companies that canceled loyalty programs for its members, calling the moves “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.” “These companies seem to have forgotten that using their businesses as political platforms…isn’t a particularly bright business strategy,” said Brad Lena, an NRA member and retired marketing consultant in Pittsburgh. “If companies are going to start punishing certain segments of their consumers, then consumers are going to realize they can also punish those companies.”

Wary of such vitriol, some companies tried to walk a fine line. Walking a fine line, FedEx Corp. said Monday it supports restricting assault rifles and large-capacity ammunition magazines to military use only, but would continue to offer discount shipping for NRA members.

“FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues,” the company said.

That didn’t sit well with DJ Hanson, co-owner of BlueprintNYC LLC, an event-planning company with offices in New York and San Mateo, Calif. BlueprintNYC suspended preliminary talks to have FedEx as a client, he said.

“We feel strongly about working with companies that share our values and beliefs,” Mr. Hanson said, citing the shipper’s decision to continue discounts to NRA members.

A FedEx spokesman didn’t respond to requests to comment.

Companies often beat legislators in pushing social change. The corporate world began offering same-sex couples health-care benefits long before politicians on either side of the ideological spectrum began endorsing same-sex marriage en masse.

Bill Penzey, the CEO of Wauwatosa, Wis.-based spice seller Penzeys Ltd., has written long online posts about the president, the NRA and Russia. He found taking on President Trump has, at times, jump-started orders. A July post on the company’s Facebook page promoting Mexican vanilla extract and accusing the president of racism resulted in the 32-year-old company’s best day of sales ever.

Penzeys has lost some longtime customers but gained new ones. Society no longer seems to find it strange that he’s selling politics alongside peppercorns, Mr. Penzey said. “I think we’re even getting to the point where those things are inseparable—business and social issues are inseparable.”

“If you’re an investor or asset manager and you see these rock-bottom evaluations of Equifax, it had to have given you pause,” said Jon Hale, head of sustainability research at Morningstar Inc. “This is an instance where ESG analysis was really ahead of the curve.”

Asset management firms including BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. , Oppenheimer Funds and Nuveen have been pushing ESG as a feel-good flavor of index investing that offers a chance to beat plain-vanilla peers. More than 20 new exchange-traded funds have been launched since the start of 2016.

It is an outgrowth of ethical investing, but instead of boycotting heavy polluters or human-rights violators, these loosely defined strategies preserve broad market exposure. Instead of investing based on a company’s market value, like most traditional indexes, the ESG approach weights investments based on how companies score on issues like carbon emissions, workplace safety or executive pay.

The concept is popular in Europe and Asia, particularly among big institutional investors. In July, insurance giant Swiss Re pegged its $130 billion portfolio to MSCI ESG indexes, and the Government Pension Investment Fund for Japan, the world’s largest pension fund, did the same with a slice of its assets.

“We believe it makes economic sense,” said Guido Fürer, group chief investment officer for Swiss Re, in an email. “Data suggest that taking a long-term view on responsible investing is at least as much about limiting downside risks as benefiting from upside potential.”

While this approach may make investors feel good, critics say many ESG funds often deliver similar returns to their traditional competition but at a higher cost. For example, the ESG version of an iShares ETF that buys emerging markets returned 22.5% in the past year, compared with 21.2% for the plain-vanilla version. The cheapest iShares emerging markets ETF returned 19.8%.

“If the main virtue of ESG, from an investment perspective, is that it keeps you out of trouble, and trouble makes you lose money, then you should lose less money over time,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research for FactSet. “But that’s not what we see.”

To come up with the rankings, analysts comb through news stories, financial records, regulatory filings and company reports looking for risks that traditional financial analysis might miss. Each firm is then scored on the key risks facing its industry, and those results feed into the overall rating for the firm.

For example, MSCI downgraded Wells Fargo & Co. in November 2015 noting a high level of customer service complaints, months before the company was fined for “widespread illegal” sales practices.

Linda-Eling Lee, MSCI’s global head of ESG research, said the scores aren’t meant to predict share prices or financial results, but to measure key risks that may have a long-term impact on a company’s long-term returns.

“We’re not in the business of trying to predict scandals or fraud. We’re trying to give a gauge of vulnerabilities,” Ms. Lee said.

MSCI deemed privacy and data security a key risk for 740 firms of the 2,500 companies in its popular all-word index. Equifax was one of only 25 to score zero. By comparison, competitor TransUnion Corp. scored 4.9 on a 10 point scale, and Experian PLC earned a 6.9.

When MSCI issued its report on Aug. 2, 2016, Equifax was trading around $131 a share, about $18 higher than it is now.

“The reason Equifax stood out was that it was one of the few companies that had already experienced data breaches,” Ms. Lee said. She declined to name other firms that scored zero on privacy and data security, citing a firm policy not to single out particular companies.

Sustainalytics, an MSCI competitor in ESG scoring, also flagged data security issues at Equifax months before the Sept. 7 announcement of a “cybersecurity incident” in which criminals gained access to Equifax customers’ names, social security numbers, birth dates and addresses.

An Equifax official said in an email that the firm has taken steps to prevent future intrusions: “We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security of the information in our possession.”

There are only a handful of retail funds using the MSCI ESG index that expelled Equifax, but at least a couple of mutual funds sold their Equifax stock last November when the index rebalanced. A Northern Trust mutual fund sold 1,870 Equifax shares, and the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund sold 36,000 shares.

Equifax shares closed at $114.45 on Nov. 30, just 1.3% higher than Thursday’s close.

To start, Pennsylvania Rep. Michael Doyle, who manages the Democratic team, invited the Republican team to the Democratic club tonight for dinner. Republican manager Joe Barton of Texas accepted, joking he’ll be bringing his “food tester.”

It be Mr. Barton’s second time at the club in his more than 31 years in Congress – and the two coaches spent most of their joint press conference talking about how times have become more partisan in Washington, and attributing it to a climate that may have led to the shooting on Wednesday morning.

“Members are not looked at as people anymore, we’re kind of looked at, I won’t say targets, but people think they can come to our town hall meetings and just say the most obnoxious things and think we won’t feel it,” Mr. Barton said, referencing the rowdy constituent meetings that members have faced as they’ve gone home this year.

Mr. Doyle pointed to the pressure on members to get home right after votes on Thursday or Friday said to not assimilate to Congress, saying it limits time to socialize.

“We’re not allowed to stay here because then we’ve gone Washington,” he said.

The two hope that the game brings a sense of camaraderie and raises money for charity – though they both adamantly refused the idea that the teams should not be drawn across party lines, an idea floating around on Twitter as a sign of bipartisanship. Both said they were plotting ideas to honor Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and hoped he could watch it on CSPAN from the hospital."

Several companies have cut ties to the National Rifle Association after consumers took to social media to voice outrage against the gun lobby, days after a Florida high-school shooting left 17 people dead.

Insurance giants Chubb Ltd. CB -0.53% and MetLife , MET -0.72% cybersecurity company Symantec Corp. SYMC -3.29% , and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Enterprise, Alamo and National rental-car chains, were among those that said they would end partnerships with the NRA.

Saturday, both Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL -1.01% and United Airlines, a unit of United Continental Holdings Inc., UAL -1.16% ended their discount travel programs with the organization. The airlines also asked the NRA to remove their information from its website.

Companies are reacting partly in response to a social-media movement to pressure or boycott entities with NRA ties, energized by the emotional calls for gun-control action from survivors of the shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and students around the country. On Friday, the hashtag “#BoycottNRA” was among the top trends on Twitter nationally.

One of the first companies to sever ties was First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately owned bank in the U.S. The bank said Thursday it wouldn’t renew its contract with the NRA for a co-branded credit card, which was promoted as the “official credit card of the NRA.” The NRA Visa card offered a $40 cash-back bonus, enough to pay for the gun lobby’s $40 annual membership fee.

“Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA,” the bank said in a Twitter post, following which it decided not to renew its contract.

An NRA spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the companies’ decisions to cease such partnerships. But in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, NRA head Wayne LaPierre railed against “the elites” for renewing calls on gun-ownership limits. “As usual, the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,” Mr. LaPierre said.

In recent years, companies and their leaders have become vocal on issues such as transgenderism, immigration policy and gay rights. Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN -2.21% Jeff Bezos last month granted $33 million in college scholarships for illegal immigrant high-school graduates in the U.S. In the aftermath of North Carolina’s now-repealed “bathroom bill,” which required transgender people to use public bathrooms based on their birth sex, companies including PayPal Holdings Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Adidas AG scuttled or froze plans to add jobs in the state.

However, the business community has been more reticent about wading into the gun-control debate. Many companies worry about the threat of boycotts from the NRA, which claims some 5 million members, said Larry Hutcher, a co-founder and managing partner at New York law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, who has advised companies on public-relations crises.

That corporate reluctance may be changing as public support for some gun-control measures appears to be building, Mr. Hutcher said. A Quinnipiac University National Poll conducted earlier this week found that two-thirds of American voters support stricter gun control, the highest level of support measured by the survey ever.

“Companies are looking at the same numbers as we do,” Mr. Hutcher said. “That’s why they feel confident enough to terminate these relationships.”

Enterprise Holdings, which had a partnership with the NRA to provide discounts to the association’s members, said Thursday that its three rental-car brands would end the discount program on March 26. Hertz Global Holdings HTZ -1.67% and Avis Budget Group followed with similar announcements on Friday.

Symantec said it would stop a discount program for its LifeLock identity-theft and Norton anti-malware software for NRA members. Chubb said it planned to stop underwriting NRA-branded insurance policies for gun owners, though it said it had made the decision several months ago.

The NRA, like many member associations, has had discount partnerships with numerous companies listed on its website for products ranging from wine to hotel reservations to FedEx shipping expenses. Lists of many of those companies have circulated on social media with calls to pressure them to end their relationships with the gun lobby.

FedEx didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other companies targeted in the boycott campaign include Amazon. Under the hashtag #StopNRAmazon, consumers on Twitter have demanded that the company ban NRATV, the gun lobby’s news outlet, from being streamed on Amazon platforms.

Amazon representatives weren’t immediately available for comment.

“I’m someone who will buy napkins from @Amazon rather than go to the store but if @Amazon, @Amazonhelp, and @JeffBezos don’t stop streaming the violent rhetoric of NRAtv, I may have to leave the house again,” tweeted one user.

Lisa Murkowski, shown in June in Washington, is a strong gun-rights supporter who hails from a state that has legalized marijuana use. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty images

Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s husband and sons ordered her a new Benelli 12-gauge shotgun as a gift, but when the Alaska Republican—and enthusiastic duck hunter—went to pick it up, she was puzzled by a question on the federal background form she had to fill out.

The form asked if she used marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes, both of which are legal in Alaska. If she answered yes, she would be unable to get the gun, because federal law prohibits anyone who uses illegal drugs from buying a firearm.

The senator doesn’t use pot, but she was taken aback by the notion that an activity that is legal in her state could block gun ownership. “I don’t like marijuana—I voted against legalization—but we passed it,” she said in an interview. “Now, you’ve got this conflict.”

The scope of that conflict just grew, as voters in eight states last week approved marijuana-related ballot initiatives. Now, 29 states and Washington, D.C., allow marijuana use in some form, including eight that allow recreational use. Yet federal law still holds that anyone who uses marijuana, even medicinally, is doing so illegally and can’t buy a gun.

That is upsetting advocates for both gun owners and pot smokers, groups that don’t always find themselves on the same side of the cultural divide.

“This idea that you somehow waive your Second Amendment rights if you smoke marijuana” is wrong, said Keith Stroup, founder of NORML, which advocates marijuana legalization. “In particular, if you are using marijuana as a medicine, the idea that you have to choose between your health and the Second Amendment is offensive.”

“The Gun Control Act prohibitions are governed by the Controlled Substances Act, and marijuana remains an illegal, controlled substance under federal law,” said Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr.

Justice oversees the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which regulates licensed gun dealers; as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which runs background checks; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which classifies drugs.

The marijuana-gun issue is one of the stranger outcomes of an unusual conflict between state laws, which increasingly allow marijuana use, and federal law, which continues to view pot-smoking as a crime.

At issue are the applications that would-be gun buyers must fill out when they visit licensed firearms dealers. Question 11(e) on ATF Form 4473 asks whether the purchaser is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana.

Related Video The legal, recreational use of marijuana passed in four states on Tuesday with another three states passing it for medicinal use. Lance Rogers, manager of the cannabis law practice for law firm Greenspoon Marder, explains how that could influence efforts to legalize pot in other states. Photo: Getty

Under ATF guidance distributed to gun dealers, anyone who answers affirmatively can’t buy a firearm. If a dealer has reason to believe the would-be gun purchaser is a marijuana user, the ATF says it is the dealer’s responsibility to halt the sale of a firearm or ammunition.

“There are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana purportedly used for medicinal purposes, even if such use is sanctioned by State law,” the guidance says.

The issue can be tricky, especially for those who oppose drug use but support gun rights. Perhaps for that reason, gun-rights groups have been relatively quiet on the issue. The National Rifle Association, for example, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Officials at Gun Owners of America highlight the medicinal-marijuana issue. “GOA finds it very troubling that the Obama administration would use medical issues to ban law-abiding Americans from owning firearms,” said the group’s executive director, Erich Pratt.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled recently that banning gun sales to medical marijuana users doesn’t violate their Second Amendment rights. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law, the court noted, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use in treatment.” The DEA reaffirmed that status just last August.

The Fine Print on Marijuana Laws States with medical marijuana before Nov 8.

26 states and D.C.: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Washington, D.C. States with full legalization before Nov. 8: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Washington, D.C. States that passed and/or expanded medical marijuana proposals Nov. 8: Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota States that passed full legalization proposals Nov. 8: California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada

Ms. Murkowski wrote Attorney General Loretta Lynch in March urging her to reconsider the policy. “In my judgment, the disqualification of an entire class of marijuana users acting consistent with state law from possessing any firearm merits a review of federal legal policy,” Ms. Murkowski wrote.

Mr. Carr said the Justice Department responded to the senator’s letter in October. “It is not the department’s general practice to release publicly private communications with members of Congress.”

Ms. Murkowski said she understands the concerns about gun owners using marijuana, but said similar dangers could arise regarding alcohol. The conflict will likely intensify, she added, as more states approve marijuana use.

Marijuana advocates say legal users of the drug are discriminated against in other ways as well, from child custody and banking to student loans and public housing.

“Even if you’re a progressive who doesn’t like guns or a libertarian who doesn’t like public housing, you should still be outraged by the discrimination that people who use marijuana face,” said Tom Angell, founder of Marijuana Majority, which supports legalization.

BEIRUT—Gunmen early Saturday stormed an office of a Syrian paramedic group that is active in opposition-controlled areas, killing seven of its members and stealing two vehicles and other equipment, the group and opposition activists said.

The Syrian Civil Defense group, more popularly known as the White Helmets, said in a statement that the attack happened in the early hours in the town of Sarmin, in the northwest of the country.

The first responders have been known to risk their lives to save people from the civil war, now in its sixth year. The group was also nominated for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the rare attack but it came amid tension in the area. Sarmin is in Idlib province, which witnessed clashes recently between al Qaeda-linked fighters and members of the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham group that ended with al Qaeda fighters capturing much of the region.

The al Qaeda-linked Hay’at Tahrir al Sham said over the past weeks that its members had discovered Islamic State sleeper cells. The Al Qaeda affiliate that used by to be known as Nusra Front fought deadly battles with Islamic State over the past years.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the seven were killed after being shot in the head, adding that the killings were discovered when volunteers arrived to start a shift and found the bodies of their colleagues.

“Until now it is mostly likely a crime. It might also be an attack aimed to harm the image of Nusra Front and to show that Idlib is not safe,” said Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the observatory.

An opposition activist based in Idlib said the attackers used pistols equipped with silencers, adding that people living nearby didn’t notice anything unusual.

The activist, who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals, said Islamic State sleepers have been discovered in Sarmin. The activist said the HTS-linked Judicial Committee is investigating the case."

Dick's is ahead of the government on this particular issue is and Dick's asking the government to enact the same higher minimum age on gun purchases along with other stricter measures ... right so this the company is not only changing the rules internally but is also publicly advocating for the rules be changed by state and national loss I believe politicians they've been requested to enact a lot of the policies proposed not just the assault style rifle banner the minimum age did you know they also wanted and ... I guess high capacity gun magazines which takes is done as well I think Ray exactly so the company said there also can be banning ... high capacity magazines Comercial getting more D tells on what exactly count as an assault style weapons because ... there isn't really a ... unified standard for what that means you some people who are advocating for more gun rates have said that its Morse The cosmetic in that these companies are ... kind of band guns for what they look like it not what they actually deal ... and so it's can it be a debate that continues ... aam it is true though that these ... that just the type of weapon ... called Inaer fifteen style has been used in many of the most prominent ... mass shootings in recent years ... and the National rifle Association is against these proposed changes ... yes they'd have not ... responded to the latest changes today ... but in the past I've recently that ye they've said that they do not want to re stage ... the basis of who is the the the one to protect the rights ... of a gun rates for for young mothers Tina for twenty year old mother ... the thing to me it's a moment that should be able to have ...

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s calls for changes to gun laws in the wake of last week’s Florida school shooting push Congress toward a new politically fraught debate just months before the midterm elections.

For more than a decade, and after multiple attacks on students, lawmakers have shied from making any significant changes to gun legislation in part because of the influence of the National Rifle Association. The NRA not only donates large amounts of campaign cash, mostly to Republicans, but its scorecards on politicians’ pro-gun-rights positions are often the sole driver of the votes of many of its members.

Mr. Trump said “hardened” school security would be central to stopping future shootings, which echoes the NRA position, while he also floated proposals to keep weapons out of the hands of young people and the mentally ill.

Speaking Thursday with state and local officials at a White House meeting about school safety, Mr. Trump said students should be protected the way banks are. He repeated his call for arming teachers to help protect students, both as a deterrent and to provide a quicker response, but he said that only highly trained people would carry weapons in school.

“I think a concealed permit for teachers, and letting people know there are people in the building with a gun, you won’t have…these shootings,” said Mr. Trump.

The comments came eight days after a 19-year-old shooter at a Parkland, Fla., high school killed 17 people, the latest in a series of school shootings in recent years.

Any debate on gun measures will add complexity to a legislative agenda that already includes proposals to overhaul immigration, which also carry political risks for members of both parties just as the midterm primary season is about to begin in March.

Most of Mr. Trump’s ideas for deterring gun violence don’t have a direct path to becoming law. The prospect of any gun-control bill making it through Capitol Hill is likely tied to how much he keeps the issue in the spotlight, putting pressure on Republicans, congressional aides said.

Mr. Trump ran on a gun-rights platform, but a few of his proposals mark a modest step toward gun-control advocates. On Thursday, he reiterated his proposals to improve gun-purchaser background checks, limit access to firearms by people with mental illnesses and ban devices that allow certain firearms to mimic automatic weapons. He also called for raising the minimum age for some gun purchases to 21.

The NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, has in the past opposed restrictions on gun purchases for people under 21, as well as proposals to expand background checks. A representative didn’t return a request for comment.

Opponents of arming certain teachers in schools say the move would distract from the educational mission and increase the risk of accidental shootings. The heads of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers both dismissed the idea. “Anyone who pushes arming teachers doesn’t understand teachers and doesn’t understand our schools,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten on Thursday.

At a conservative conference on Thursday in Oxon Hill, Md., NRA Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre emphasized security, also saying policy makers needed to “harden” schools. He proposed the hiring of armed guards to protect students, but made no mention of arming teachers.

The NRA chief and Mr. Trump also sounded similar notes decrying what they termed gun-free zones at schools. At the White House, Mr. Trump said that a “gun-free zone to a killer…that’s like going in for the ice cream.” Ten miles away, in his conference speech, Mr. LaPierre said that “gun-free zones” are “wide open-targets for any crazy madman.”

In his comments Thursday, Mr. Trump praised the NRA and said he had spoken with top NRA officials “often” in the past two days as he developed proposals to address school shootings. He played down potential policy differences with the group, which spent more than $30 million helping him win the 2016 election.

Mr. Trump also said he had called many lawmakers in recent days. “They’re into doing background checks that maybe they wouldn’t be thinking about” a few weeks ago, he said.

Mr. Trump spoke late last week with Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) about his bipartisan gun bill, backed by Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), that would encourage states and federal agencies to submit records to the national background-check network. Their bill would provide incentives for states to upload criminal-conviction records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Those records already are required to be uploaded, but can slip through the cracks.

The Cornyn bill, known as the “Fix NICS,” has passed the House, but only coupled with legislation that would enable gun owners who legally carry concealed firearms in one state to carry them in the other 49 states—a major expansion of gun rights. Conservatives are reluctant to pass the Fix NICS bill without the concealed-carry reciprocity legislation, aides said Thursday.

Most Democrats oppose the concealed-carry bill, but largely support the Cornyn bill, though they call it an insufficient response to the recent gun violence.

“The Fix NICS bill won’t come close to making a significant dent in the problem, and must be only the beginning of a legislative remedy that at a minimum fully strengthens and funds background checks, closes loopholes and keeps guns away from those who shouldn’t have them,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in a statement this week.

Mr. Trump’s support for “comprehensive” background checks also renewed attention on a bill from Sens. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) that would expand background checks to all online sales and sales at gun shows, with the goal of flagging people with criminal or mental-health histories that disqualify them from gun ownership. Currently, the checks are needed only for sales by federally licensed dealers.

Chinese state-backed hackers have recently targeted South Korean entities involved in deploying a U.S. missile-defense system, says an American cybersecurity firm, despite Beijing’s denial of retaliation against Seoul over the issue.

In recent weeks, two cyberespionage groups that the firm linked to Beijing’s military and intelligence agencies have launched a variety of attacks against South Korea’s government, military, defense companies and a big conglomerate, John Hultquist, director of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye Inc., said in an interview.

The California-based firm, which counts South Korean agencies as clients, including one that oversees internet security, wouldn’t name the targets.

While FireEye and other cybersecurity experts say Chinese hackers have long targeted South Korea, they note a rise in the number and intensity of attacks in the weeks since South Korea said it would deploy Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, a sophisticated missile-defense system aimed at defending South Korea from a North Korean missile threat.

China opposes Thaad, saying its radar system can reach deep into its own territory and compromise its security. South Korea and the U.S. say Thaad is purely defensive. The first components of the system arrived in South Korea last month and have been a key issue in the current presidential campaign there.

One of the two hacker groups, which FireEye dubbed Tonto Team, is tied to China’s military and based out of the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, where North Korean hackers are also known to be active, said Mr. Hultquist, a former senior U.S. intelligence analyst. FireEye believes the other, known as APT10, may be linked to other Chinese military or intelligence units.

China’s Ministry of Defense said this week Beijing has consistently opposed hacking, and that the People’s Liberation Army “has never supported any hacking activity.” China has said it is itself a major hacking victim but has declined to offer specifics.

Mr. Hultquist said the two hacking groups gained access to their targets’ systems by using web-based intrusions, and by inducing people to click on weaponized email attachments or compromised websites. He declined to offer more specific details.

Hack Attacks Recent cyberattacks attributed to Chinese state-backed groups. Since February Spear-phishing* and watering hole** attacks were conducted against South Korean government, military and commercial targets connected to a U.S. missile defense system.

Sources: FireEye, Trend Micro, Fidelis, PricewaterhouseCoopers and BAE Systems, WSJ reporting

Mr. Hultquist added that an error in one of the group’s operational security provided FireEye’s analysts with new information about the group’s origins.

South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last month that its website was targeted in a denial-of-service attack—one in which a flood of hacker-directed computers cripple a website—that originated in China.

A spokesman said that “prompt defensive measures” ensured that the attacks weren’t effective, adding that it was maintaining an “emergency service system” to repel Chinese hackers.

The ministry this week declined to comment further, or to say which cybersecurity firm it had employed or whether he thought the attacks were related to Thaad.

Another cybersecurity company, Russia’s Kaspersky Lab ZAO, said it observed a new wave of attacks on South Korean targets using malicious software that appeared to have been developed by Chinese speakers starting in February.

The attackers used so-called spear-phishing emails armed with malware hidden in documents related to national security, aerospace and other topics of strategic interest, said Park Seong-su, a senior global researcher for Kaspersky. The company typically declines to attribute cyberattacks and said it couldn’t say if the recent ones were related to Thaad.

The two hacking groups with alleged ties to Beijing have been joined by other so-called hacktivists—patriotic Chinese hackers acting independently of the government and using names like the “Panda Intelligence Bureau” and the “Denounce Lotte Group,” Mr. Hultquist said.

South Korea’s Lotte Group has become a particular focus of Chinese ire after the conglomerate approved a land swap this year that allowed the government to deploy a Thaad battery on a company golf course.

Last month, just after the land swap was approved, a Lotte duty-free shopping website was crippled by a denial-of-service attack, said a company spokeswoman, who added that its Chinese website had been disrupted with a virus in February. She declined to comment on its source.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t respond to questions about the website attacks. The ministry has previously addressed Lotte’s recent troubles in China by saying that the country welcomes foreign companies as long as they abide by Chinese law.

The U.S. has also accused Chinese state-backed hacking groups of breaking into government and commercial networks, though cybersecurity firms say such activity has dropped since the two nations struck a cybersecurity deal in 2015.

The two Chinese hacking groups named by FireEye are suspected of previous cyberattacks.

FireEye linked Tonto Team to an earlier state-backed Chinese hacking campaign, identified by Tokyo-based cybersecurity firm Trend Micro Inc. in 2012, which focused on South Korea’s government, media and military. Trend Micro declined to comment.

Two cybersecurity reports this month accused APT10 of launching a spate of recent attacks around the globe, including on a prominent U.S. trade lobbying group. One of those reports, jointly published by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and British weapons maker BAE Systems, said the Chinese hacker collective has recently grown more sophisticated, using custom-designed malware and accessing its targets’ systems by first hacking into trusted third-party IT service providers.

Because of the new scrutiny from that report, FireEye said in a recent blog post that APT10 was likely to lay low, though in the longer run, it added, “we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.”

Corrections & Amplifications

FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, believes that a Chinese hacking group known as APT10 may be linked to Chinese military or intelligence units. A previous version of this article incorrectly said that FireEye had linked APT10 to China’s Ministry of State Security. (April 21, 2017)

AL-DAHLA, Iraq—Islamic State fighters under siege by Iraqi forces have increasingly sent explosive-packed cars and trucks barreling toward the front lines. The Iraqi military’s answer to armored vehicle bombs is a Russian-made antitank missile mounted atop an American-made Humvee.

The successful use of the Kornet missiles—price tag $250,000 apiece—helped clear the way for the Iraqi army’s advance on Mosul, the extremist group’s last major stronghold in Iraq.

Many weapons can disable vehicle bombs, but only the Kornet, which can penetrate 3 feet of metal, can stop an armored vehicle bomb, Iraqi military commanders said.

The laser-guided missiles, introduced by Russia in 1994 as an antitank weapon, can be launched from more than 3 miles away.

The Kornets have been in the Iraqi military arsenal for more than a decade and were used against American troops during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, disabling Abrams tanks and other armored vehicles.

The Kornet scope has 10 times the resolution of the human eye and has also been used for surveillance. The operator can lock onto a target and fire one missile a minute. Iraqi forces use them mostly against bomb-rigged vehicle bombs, but also fire them at buildings where enemy fighters are gathered.

The weapon is so prized that Kornet specialist Pvt. Nasr Taha is greeted with handshakes and smiles by ranking Iraqi commanders. Some slip him cash bonuses.

The 25-year-old was assigned to the army’s anti-armor battalion and selected as a Kornet specialist because he was literate, he said.

With missiles so costly, Kornet specialists are stingy with their launches. Pvt. Taha said he doesn’t keep a count of successful hits. He does, however, keep a tally how many armored car bombs he has taken out in his two years with the army: already 20, as his unit neared Mosul in late October.

The fact that most electronic devices these days need memory hasn’t always been enough for Micron . MU -2.13%

Few companies reflect the boom-and-bust cycle of tech as well as the memory chip maker. The last decade has seen several instances of sales gains quickly fading and profits swinging to losses. Micron’s stock price has followed a similar roller coaster, most recently illustrated by a huge two-year bull run in 2013-14 followed closely by a crash that wiped nearly three-quarters of the company’s market value in half the time.

That is why investors who have done particularly well with Micron of late could be forgiven some trepidation. The company’s share price has jumped nearly 133% over the past 12 months, making it one of the best-performing chip stocks in that period. Micron has benefited from strong memory price gains, yet it is fair to wonder when the inevitable turn will take place.

That doesn’t appear to be in the cards anytime soon. Memory prices have risen sharply in the past year but aren’t near their peak yet. Spot prices for the mostly commonly tracked version of 4 gigabyte DRAM memory hit $3.09 last month compared with the five-year high of $4.37 from mid-2014, according to DRAMeXchange. Tim Arcuri of Cowen & Co. estimates that Micron’s DRAM average selling price will show a 19% sequential jump when the company reports its fiscal second quarter results later this month.

It helps that DRAM is no longer so closely correlated with the sluggish personal computer market. Because anything with a CPU chip also requires memory, DRAM usage has been helped by demand from cloud-service operators building their own servers. And while smartphone sales have slowed considerably, manufacturers are putting more DRAM into their devices to boost performance. Apple Inc.’s latest iPhone 7 Plus contains 3 gigabytes of DRAM compared with 2 gigabytes for its predecessor, and the next iPhone could add even more if Apple wishes to keep up with rivals like Samsung and Huawei.

Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal’s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.

Still, Micron is highly sensitive to shifts in chip supply. A big jump in DRAM production by Samsung in 2015 pushed prices, and thus, Micron’s revenue, down.

The potential of more memory production coming online later this year bears watching. Spending on capital equipment by DRAM producers fell in 2016 from the previous year, but it is expected to pick up about 8% this year, estimates Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest.

But it helps that—despite its recent gains, Micron’s shares aren’t terribly expensive at just 7 times forward earnings. That is a 45% discount to its three-year average, so not such a stretch even for those whose near-term memories of this stock remain painful.

WSJ's Peter Loftus and Dr. Paul Offit explain on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty

Health officials are warning that a popular nasal-spray vaccine isn’t sufficiently effective to prevent the flu, and pediatricians worry many parents won’t get their children vaccinated this year.

The result could be that more people fall sick this flu season, which can begin as early as October. A flu shot is the only recommended option to get vaccinated, but some parents may skip the painful procedure for their children.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently adopted a committee’s recommendation that people shouldn’t get the nasal-spray vaccine, called FluMist, for the 2016-2017 influenza season. A CDC review found the spray vaccine provided insufficient protection against the flu in recent years.

Bite the Bullet Getting vaccinated is the best way to reduce chances of getting the flu. U.S. health officials recommend routine influenza vaccination for all people 6 months and older who don’t have certain contraindications such as a history of allergic reactions to flu vaccines.

and between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

FluMist, available in the U.S. since 2003, had been an appealing alternative for those who don’t like needles, especially children. It accounted for one-third of all flu vaccines given to children in recent years, and, before the CDC warning, it was projected to comprise about 8% of all vaccine doses for the coming season. The CDC recommends most people 6 months and older get vaccinated against seasonal flu.

“I am concerned that families will opt not to get any influenza vaccine this year,” says Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician and professor at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine in Long Island, N.Y. “It puts those specific children at risk, as well as their family members and the community at large,” says Dr. Bernstein, who helped write guidelines published in September by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommending against use of FluMist.

Laura Campion, of Glenside, Pa., says her son, Jack, 9 years old, is terrified of needles. When the boy was 5, he became so upset about getting an injected flu vaccine that two nurses had to hold him down to administer it, Ms. Campion says. After that, she switched to FluMist. Jack became upset when he recently learned the only vaccination option was a shot, she says.

Laura Campion, of Glenside, Pa., says she isn’t sure how she will get a flu vaccination for her son, Jack, 9, who is afraid of needles. She says she and her daughter, Shea, 5, will both get flu shots. Photo: John Campion

“I’m at a crossroads and I just don’t know what to do,” Ms. Campion says. “I want him to get vaccinated” but she says she delayed scheduling an injection at the doctor’s office while she comes up with a plan. Ms. Campion says she and her 5-year-old daughter, Shea, will both get flu shots.

Paul Offit, an infectious-disease doctor and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, expects fewer children will get vaccinated for flu this year because of the recommendation against FluMist.

“Although it does hurt and it’s no fun getting a shot, it’s really important to get an influenza vaccine,” Dr. Offit says. Flu causes an estimated 200,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. each year and anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths—a wide range, partly because flu often isn’t listed as a cause on death certificates, the CDC says.

Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, says he expects fewer children will get vaccinated for flu this year after health officials recommended people not rely on FluMist. Photo: Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia

According to CDC estimates, FluMist reduced incidence of the flu by just 3% compared with unvaccinated people in the 2015-16 flu season—meaning it offered virtually no protection. Injected vaccines reduced the risk by 63%. FluMist’s effectiveness began declining in the 2013-14 flu season, the agency says.

Wanda Filer, a family physician in York, Pa., worries the FluMist setback will fuel skepticism about the usefulness of flu vaccines in general. Many people mistakenly think flu shots can cause flu, or that they’ll be fine without a vaccine, she says.

“You don’t want to see anything that takes us backward,” says Dr. Filer, who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. “We need to move forward in improving our immunization rates around flu.” She recommends that doctors try to help patients overcome their fear of needles, or even use “distraction techniques” such as talking to a patient while the shot is quickly administered.

Some 47% of Americans got a seasonal flu vaccination, including 59% of children and 44% of adults, for the 2014-2015 season, the most recent for which data are available, the CDC says.

FluMist’s manufacturer, AstraZeneca PLC, says only a limited supply of the nasal spray will be available for U.S. customers who want it despite the recommendations. The CDC expects manufacturers of the injected vaccines will fill the supply void. Sanofi SA, one of the biggest manufacturers, says it has increased production of its Fluzone shot in response to the CDC recommendations.

Health officials and AstraZeneca don’t fully understand why FluMist hasn’t worked as well as in the past. The company says FluMist has had a particular low effectiveness against the H1N1 viral strain, one of four strains in the vaccine. AstraZeneca is working to develop a more effective H1N1 strain, possibly in time to get FluMist recommended again next flu season, says Chris Ambrose, vice president of the company’s U.S. medical affairs for infectious diseases.

Dr. Offit, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, speculates the problem may have started when AstraZeneca added a fourth flu strain to FluMist in 2013. He says this may have undermined the H1N1 strain’s replication needed to trigger proper immunity in recipients.

Another mystery is that FluMist was as effective as an injected flu vaccine in a Canadian study involving children in a close-knit religious community, published in August in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Some experts say the difference might be because the study included years when the older three-strain version of FluMist was used. But that theory hasn’t been proved, says Mark Loeb, a professor of pathology and molecular medicine at McMaster University’s medical school in Hamilton, Ontario, who led the Canadian study. “For people in Canada, based on the availability of data that I’ve seen, I’d still recommend it,” Dr. Loeb says about FluMist.

FluMist continues to be available and recommended for use in several countries, including Canada, the U.K. and Finland, AstraZeneca’s Dr. Ambrose says.

Families of some of those killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting asked the Connecticut Supreme Court on Tuesday to hear an appeal on a ruling that dismissed claims against the companies involved in the making and selling of the gun used in the attack.

A gunman in 2012 killed 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Conn., with a Bushmaster XM15-E2S semiautomatic rifle.

Attorneys for the families argued in their 2014 lawsuit that civilians shouldn’t be allowed to own the rifle.

But Connecticut Superior Judge Barbara Bellis in October ruled that the families failed to show that the companies could have foreseen any misuse of the weapon.

“We feel strongly that the critical issues raised in this case belong before our state’s Supreme Court, and we hope the Court agrees,” said Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the families.

The defendants have said they are immune under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act from lawsuits seeking to hold them liable for crimes committed with their products.

“Remington expects the Connecticut appellate court to come to the same conclusion as the trial court,” said James Vogts, an attorney for Remington Arms Co. LLC, the maker of the rifle.

The other defendants are Camfour Inc., a firearms distributor, and Riverview Sales Inc., the East Windsor, Conn., gun shop that sold the rifle.

An attorney for Riverview didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“The court concluded that the plaintiffs claims were not viable under Connecticut law and also barred by” the federal law, said Christopher Renzulli, an attorney for Camfour.

The attorneys for the family have pursued a claim under an exception of the federal law known as a negligent-entrustment claim. Under such a claim, a seller can be held liable for supplying a product to a person it reasonably could have known posed a risk to himself or others.

The families are asking the Connecticut Supreme Court to examine the scope of the common law of negligent entrustment in the state and how it could apply to the circumstances and technology of today.

The families also have alleged violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, a consumer-protection law. Judge Bellis ruled that the families lacked the commercial or consumer relationship with the gun companies needed to pursue such a claim.

The language of the consumer-protection law, however, doesn’t explicitly state that as a requirement, attorneys for the family say. They have asked the state Supreme Court to clarify the meaning of the statute.

Photo: Associated Press

Major U.S. sporting goods retailer Academy Sports & Outdoors has instructed its store employees to remove modern sporting rifles from displays and advertising in the wake of this week’s deadly shooting in Orlando.

Employees have been asked by Academy’s corporate office to remove rifles based on the AR-15 platform from displays, according to a sales representative at an Academy store.

The retailer will continue to sell the firearms, this person said, but is removing them from displays out of sensitivity for victims of the shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub early Sunday that left 49 dead and 53 injured.

Academy didn’t respond to requests for comment. The retailer is owned by private-equity firm KKR KKR -1.68% & Co. and has more than 200 U.S. store locations, mostly in the South and Midwest, according to its website.

A spokeswoman for KKR, which acquired the Katy, Texas, retailer in 2011, declined to comment.

The debate about gun control has escalated in the wake of the Orlando shooting. Following a nearly 15-hour filibuster on Wednesday, Senate Democrats fought for the passage of legislation to tighten access to firearms.

AR-15s and similar rifles are described by opponents as assault weapons because they can resemble military versions. Gun makers coined the modern sporting rifles, or MSR, branding for the semiautomatic weapons, which alongside small handguns have been the biggest sellers during the surge in domestic sales over the past several years.

News of Academy’s change was earlier reported by TheFirearmBlog.com, which also included a photo of a memo from the retailer’s corporate office.

Academy’s sales of hunting and fishing equipment have given the retailer leverage in an otherwise contracting sporting goods market, industry analysts say. Rival Sports Authority Inc. cited its decision to abandon that market in new and remodeled stores as among factors leading to its bankruptcy, the retailer said in a filing this spring.

Sporting goods retailers have previously taken measures to alter their merchandising in the wake of mass-casualty shootings. Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., the nation’s largest chain, suspended sales of modern sporting rifles after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Chief Executive Edward Stack said at the time.

Last year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stopped selling modern sporting rifles, including firearms based on the AR-15 platform. The company said the change was because of changing shopper demands, and that it would carry more shotguns and other hunting weapons.

High-school students who survived Florida’s deadly school shooting last week descended on the state capital Wednesday to plead for stricter gun-control measures, raising pressure on lawmakers in the normally firearm-friendly state to pass legislation.

At a boisterous rally with hundreds of demonstrators outside the State Capitol, students took the microphone to decry elected officials’ inaction in the face of bloodshed.

“Ninety-percent of my fellow Americans support background checks, yet you lawmakers have failed to act,” said Florence Yared, a 17-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last Wednesday. “Some of you said it was too soon to talk about gun control. No, it is not too soon.”

The eruption of student activism, including other rallies and walkouts across the state, has brought a new energy to the gun-rights debate in Florida and nationally, prodding GOP politicians who usually are staunch defenders of Second Amendment rights to consider legislative changes.

Yet political analysts question whether the passionate response will coalesce into a movement that can exert enduring pressure on officials.

“After past shootings, a lot of people speculated that Congress would act,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Washington. “That has yet to happen.”

In Tallahassee, state elected officials have expressed openness to new gun restrictions, moderated their rhetoric and called for the tabling of a bill that would expand gun access. But the path to tighter gun rules has already faced obstacles. The Florida House voted Tuesday against debating a measure to ban outright semiautomatic weapons—something student activists are pushing.

Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims.

Among the GOP lawmakers who voted against debating the House bill was Rep. Chris Latvala. He said in an interview that he opposes barring guns for law-abiding citizens but supports other measures to curb gun access, such as banning bump stocks, devices that enable semiautomatic firearms to mimic fully automatic weapons. Mr. Latvala holds a “D” rating from the National Rifle Association, the lowest in his caucus—“and that’s something I’m proud of,” he said.

In the aftermath of the shooting, President Donald Trump and members of his administration have demonstrated an openness to new gun restrictions. Mr. Trump, in a directive Tuesday, asked the Justice Department to draft a federal regulation effectively banning bump stocks. While that accessory wasn’t used in last week’s Florida shooting, it was used in the Las Vegas gun massacre in October that stands as the deadliest in U.S. history.

Mr. Trump held a meeting Wednesday with parents of victims and survivors of the Parkland shooting to host a discussion about how to prevent another school shooting.

Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed at the school, said the country needs to improve school safety. “How many schools, how many children need to get shot? I am not going to sleep until it is fixed,” he said.

Ideas discussed ranged from arming teachers, to better funding mental health service, to tightening gun laws, to requiring regular lockdown drills.

“Let’s never let this happen again,” said Samuel Zeif, a Parkland student who was in the building where the gunman opened fire. “Please, please, please.”

States also are looking at the issue anew. In North Carolina, a new legislative committee is studying whether to arm teachers in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. At least 10 other states, including Florida, are weighing similar measures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

In Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who received an A+ rating from the NRA and is a potential 2018 candidate for U.S. Senate, said on Tuesday that “everything for me is on the table” in weighing policy responses to the school shooting. His office has said he plans to unveil a package of proposals later this week.

Some candidates vying to replace Mr. Scott, who is barred from running for a third term, have expressed support for more gun control.

Former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, launched a television ad calling for a ban on AR-15-style rifles like the one used by the Florida gunman. On the GOP side, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam asked state lawmakers to delay a vote on a measure that would allow his agency to issue concealed-weapon licenses without a full background check.

A political committee founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in 2011, is running a TV ad attacking Mr. Scott for signing into law a measure that year that prevents doctors from discussing gun possession with patients.

With little more than two weeks left in the Florida legislative session, lawmakers are responding to pressure to pass new gun restrictions. Republican Sen. Bill Galvano is putting together a package that could include increasing the minimum age to purchase AR-15-style rifles to 21 from 18, and adding a three-day waiting period to buy them.

In a televised town hall on CNN Wednesday night, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who has publicly wavered over the past week on the question of backing tighter gun restrictions, said he was reconsidering his position on the size of gun magazines and came out in favor of the proposal to raise the minimum purchasing age. “If you are 18 years of age, you should not be able to buy a rifle,” he said.

Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas spent hours Wednesday meeting with lawmakers and state officials in Tallahassee, the state capital. Many emerged angry and disheartened, but fired up.

“I’ve maybe only spoken to three representatives, two of which already agreed with me,” said Ryan Deitsch, an 18-year-old student, at a press conference organized by Democratic Sen. Lauren Book.

“I want to see those people who shot down that bill,” Mr. Deitsch said, referring to the semiautomatic-rifle ban. “I just want to see your face and know why.”

Alfonso Calderon, a 16-year-old student, said elected officials should heed their call, or face a potential backlash. “What we need is action, and we need it now,” he said. “People are losing their lives, and it is still not being taken seriously.”
