WASHINGTON—The White House signaled Friday that President Donald Trump is backing away from a broad overhaul of U.S. gun policy and focusing on more modest changes, after his Thursday night meeting with the National Rifle Association.

At a televised meeting earlier in the week with lawmakers, Mr. Trump had endorsed a Senate proposal to significantly expand background checks on gun sales and said he wanted to see sales of some firearms restricted to people who were 21 or older. He also suggested some guns be taken away from people without due process. All of these stances run counter to the positions of the NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights organization.

Since then, lawmakers have been looking for more guidance from Mr. Trump on his gun priorities, and whether he would continue to press lawmakers to embrace expanded gun laws. The new discussions about guns and school safety follow February’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Friday morning Mr. Trump now considers a federal increase in the minimum age as likely unrealistic.

“Conceptually, he still supports raising the age to 21,” Ms. Sanders said. “But he also knows there’s not a lot of broad support for that. But that’s something he would support.”

She added: “I think he thinks it would probably have more potential in the states than it would at the federal level.”

Florida’s political leaders last week said they backed raising the minimum age for the purchase of all firearms to 21. Several major retailers have said in recent days they will stop selling guns to buyers under age 21. Separately, lawmakers in at least 24 states are pushing bills that would allow courts to temporarily take guns from people deemed dangerous.

On background checks, Ms. Sanders dialed back the president’s stance. He is seeking “not necessarily universal background checks, but certainly improving the background-check system. He wants to see what that legislation, the final piece of it looks like,” she said. “He certainly wants to focus and improve on the background-check system. In terms of what legislation, as of right now he supports the Cornyn legislation.”

A bill sponsored by Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, dubbed “Fix NICS,” encourages states and federal agencies to submit criminal-conviction records to the national background-check system.

Mr. Trump called Mr. Cornyn on Thursday night to reiterate his support for Fix NICS, a person familiar with the discussion said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Cornyn to combine it with the much broader proposal from Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) that would expand background checks to all sales at gun shows and online, with some carve-outs, such as exempting gun sales or transfers between family members.

The Manchin-Toomey bill narrowly failed in the Senate in 2013. Currently, federal law requires background checks only for sales by federally licensed dealers, though some states have added their own requirements. If the bill were to pass the Senate, it is seen as having a very difficult time clearing the House, GOP aides said this week.

Mr. Trump’s shifts on the issue come after a meeting late Thursday with Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. Mr. Cox tweeted Thursday night it was a “great meeting” with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

“We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people,” said Mr. Cox, adding that Messrs. Trump and Pence “support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control.”

Mr. Trump followed with his own tweet, saying it was a “good (Great) meeting” with the NRA.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday also dashed conservative hopes that he would support a “reciprocity” rule, which would allow gun owners who legally carry concealed firearms in one state to carry them in the other 49 states, a goal of the NRA. More generally, he paid closer attention on Wednesday to Democratic suggestions to restrict guns than to Republican proposals to focus on school-violence prevention. It wasn’t immediately clear Friday if his position had shifted on that issue.

The president’s involvement is considered key in getting any gun legislation passed in Congress. Laws restricting gun usage would garner support from many Democrats, but would also need to win over more conservative Democrats in red states as well as some Republicans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) criticized the president for appearing to shift his position.

“President Trump should go with his instincts, not the clarion and destructive call of the NRA,” he said in a statement. “If he continues to bow to his right wing ringmasters, we will get nothing done on guns and his presidency will continue to fail.”

But Democrats said they had entered the gun meeting with expectations that Mr. Trump’s position could rapidly shift, as they believed it had after a similar televised meeting on immigration in January. He had expressed support for broad changes to immigration law to help undocumented immigrants, but then rejected a proposal a day later and blamed Democrats for the failure.

BlackRock Inc. BLK -1.91% went public with the questions that it is asking gun makers and sellers in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., an unusual step by the world’s largest money manager by assets.

The notice, posted to BlackRock’s website Friday, is the latest sign that some money managers are ramping up pressure on companies that make and sell weapons. The questions range from litigation risks and gun safety to background checks and staff training.

“We cannot dictate what a company should do,” BlackRock said, but warned it generally has the ability to vote against individual directors or in favor of shareholder proposals.

Blackstone Group LP last weekend asked outside fund managers to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns. State Street Global Advisors, another big money manager, has said it also plans to reach out to gun makers with questions.

A number of U.S. companies have reassessed their relationships with the gun industry and the National Rifle Association following last month’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Major retailers, including Kroger Co. , Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., said this past week that they would stop selling guns to anyone under 21 years old.

BlackRock is the largest shareholder in gun makers Sturm Ruger & Co. and American Outdoor Brands , AOBC -0.73% formerly known as Smith & Wesson, as well as a large shareholder in firms such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods. BlackRock said in the notice that it doesn’t own any gun makers in its actively managed stock funds, and in its index-tracking funds, those companies account for 0.01% of assets under management.

The New York money manager has met with clients, including pension funds and other institutional investors, to discuss ways they can exclude gun stocks from their portfolios if they wish to and what BlackRock is asking of executives at companies that make or distribute guns, according to people familiar with those efforts.

It held one such conference call for large customers as recently as Friday morning, with executives focused on corporate stewardship and client relationships.

BlackRock and other large money managers that control funds tied to market indexes say they prefer not to use their heft to make immediate demands such as putting an individual on the board or divesting business units, in contrast to more aggressive dictates from activist directors. Instead, they say they like to work behind the scenes and question their portfolio companies routinely about their policies and plans.

But it is rare for BlackRock to make those questions public.

Last year, BlackRock stopped short of detailing the types of questions it asked company boards and executives in a paper that broadly laid out how it engaged with its portfolio companies on climate-change risk.

In the notice Friday, BlackRock called gun violence “an issue of tremendous urgency.”

The questions the firm said were being posed to gun makers and distributors include broad inquiries such as how they measure the “financial, reputational and litigation risk” of those respective businesses and what actions they take to support gun safety and education.

But BlackRock is also posing specific queries of gun makers, such as if they monitor whether the distributors of their weapons “have a high volume of their guns identified as having been used in crimes,” if they are spending money on research to improve gun safety, and if they require retailers to train their staff or certify that they conduct background checks.

For gun distributors, BlackRock asked what steps they take to make sure gun laws are followed such as “prohibiting felons or domestic abuse offenders from purchasing firearms; sales to minors of certain products; training provided to employees so they comply with applicable laws and regulations.”

BlackRock previously said that it planned to meet with weapons-related companies but stopped short of publicly articulating what type of information it planned to seek from them. It and other managers of index-tracking funds typically keep the contents of their engagements with portfolio companies private.

“We are fundamentally looking to understand whether the company has the appropriate policies and controls in place and is sufficiently managing the risks associated with these issues,” the new BlackRock notice said.

To start, Pennsylvania Rep. Michael Doyle, who manages the Democratic team, invited the Republican team to the Democratic club tonight for dinner. Republican manager Joe Barton of Texas accepted, joking he’ll be bringing his “food tester.”

It be Mr. Barton’s second time at the club in his more than 31 years in Congress – and the two coaches spent most of their joint press conference talking about how times have become more partisan in Washington, and attributing it to a climate that may have led to the shooting on Wednesday morning.

“Members are not looked at as people anymore, we’re kind of looked at, I won’t say targets, but people think they can come to our town hall meetings and just say the most obnoxious things and think we won’t feel it,” Mr. Barton said, referencing the rowdy constituent meetings that members have faced as they’ve gone home this year.

Mr. Doyle pointed to the pressure on members to get home right after votes on Thursday or Friday said to not assimilate to Congress, saying it limits time to socialize.

“We’re not allowed to stay here because then we’ve gone Washington,” he said.

The two hope that the game brings a sense of camaraderie and raises money for charity – though they both adamantly refused the idea that the teams should not be drawn across party lines, an idea floating around on Twitter as a sign of bipartisanship. Both said they were plotting ideas to honor Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and hoped he could watch it on CSPAN from the hospital."

And many types of the weapon still can't be bought in the alleged shooter's home state of California.

But Mr. Holmes was able to obtain a weapon gun enthusiasts praise for its ease of use and rock-solid reliability and, according to authorities, put it to use in his attack early Friday at a Aurora, Colo., movie theater.

A Bush Master AR-15 assault rifle is displayed at Firing-Line July 22 in Aurora, Colo. Getty Images

Authorities said last week that Mr. Holmes had a AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, along with a shotgun and at least one handgun.

A Bass Pro Shops retailer in Denver sold Mr. Holmes a handgun and shotgun, according to the company, but the seller of the assault rifle has not come forward publicly. Gander Mountain, another gun retailer with two stores in the Denver area, said in a statement last week that the company was ""fully cooperating with this on-going investigation"" but declined to say whether it had sold Holmes any firearms.

A federal ban on assault weapons went into effect in 1994, under President Bill Clinton, including a restriction on sales of the AR-15. But in 2004, the ban expired and it was not re-enacted.

The federal ban targeted weapons with specific features, including a device that hides the flash from a gun shooting in the dark. It is unclear whether Mr. Holmes' rifle had those features which would have then qualified the weapon for the federal ban. Indeed, stripped-down versions of the AR-15 were sold legally during the federal ban, experts say.

In the Aurora shooting, ""this shooter was planning a military style assault and he chose a rifle that was designed for just such an attack,"" said Dennis Henigan, vice president of the Brady Campaign to Reduce Gun Violence. He added that the impact of the violence was widened by the rifle's large stock of ammunition—a 100-round drum magazine, said Colorado authorities—which would have been restricted to only 10 rounds per weapon under the previous federal law.

But organizations representing the gun industry say gun control advocates misrepresent the uses for the AR-15 rifle, which is known for its light recoil, unlike some other semi-automatic weapons that kick back hard after firing. The AR-15 rifle is ""cheap to shoot, accurate, easy to take care of and take down,"" said Joe M. Cornell, a federally license gun dealer in Denver who also appraises firearms for his business A Accredited Appraisal Services.

One legitimate use of the AR-15 is marksmanship competitions in the United States, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for the firearms industry. ""And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer,"" the foundation's fact sheet reads.

The AR-15 was created by ArmaLite—hence the initials AR—and licensed to Colt's Manufacturing Company LLC in 1959. Its related weapon is the military grade M16 fully automatic weapon first used by U.S. military personnel in Vietnam and lauded for its high velocity and lighter-weight plastic parts, according to the companies and gun experts.

Today, several gun manufacturers make AR-15-style rifles.

""It was our counterpart to the Russian AK-47,"" said Joe Vince, the former chief of the crime guns analysis bureau at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives.

Colt's semiautomatic rifles are ""the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine,"" the company said on its web site. Attempts to reach a company representative over the weekend were unsuccessful.

On the day of the Aurora shooting, Mr. Cornell said, a friend called him inquiring about an AR-15 to buy his teenage son. The weapon is not appropriate to hunt big game because of its low-caliber ammunition, but can be used to kill varmints, including coyotes, according to Mr. Cornell.

""If I had 100 AR-15s, in seven to 10 days, I could sell them all. They're that popular,"" he said.

It's difficult to determine how many of these rifles are made in the U.S. each year. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reports how many rifles are manufactured each year—2,293,247 in 2011 according to interim figures, up 70% since 1998—but does not break down the rifles by make and model or how many qualified as so-called assault weapons.

A few states, including California, New York and Massachusetts, have bans on assault weapons. The one in place in Massachusetts was made permanent under the watch of then-Gov. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican president candidate who now opposes any new gun laws.

There were renewed calls for a federal assault weapons ban in 2009, after Michael McLendon killed 10 people in southeastern Alabama. He used two assault rifles in the attack—an SKS and a Bushmaster. Now, Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, is predicting yet another ""effort to resuscitate the assault weapon ban.""

Still, he said, ""The political odds are stacked against it"" actually happening as the federal government has been reluctant to act on gun control issues. ""For the most part, merely passing new laws, which for the most part go unenforced, won't do any good,"" Mr. Kleck said.

The congressman from Aurora, Colo., on Sunday called on Congress to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons. ""We've got to do something,"" said Democratic Rep. Ed. Perlmutter, speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

But only a smattering of politicians, mainly Democrats, joined him in demanding a legislative response to the massacre. While expressing remorse for the victims and outrage at the violence, neither President Barack Obama nor his Republican challenger, Mr. Romney, has asserted that easy access to firearms and ammunition had contributed to the massacre.

To the contrary, many Democrats avoided any suggestion that gun laws should be tightened, while at least one Republican speculated that more lives could have been saved had some audience members drawn weapons themselves and returned fire within the theater.

""If it wasn't one weapon, it would have been another. I mean, he was diabolical,"" Colorado's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""If there were no assault weapons available, and no this or no that, this guy is going to find something, right? He's going to know how to create a bomb.""

With her hands akimbo, Sgt. Stokley's French-tipped acrylic nails resembled cats' claws against her camouflage uniform.

She was addressing her female recruits during training in October 2010. Although they receive the same instruction, males and females have trained separately there since the first women Marines graduated from boot camp in 1949. Sgt. Stokley, whose eyes were shaded by a fringe of false lashes, found her next victim: ""Take them shoes off yer teeth and quit runnin' yer mouth!""

REGULATION BUN Marines at Camp Delaram in Afghanistan in November 2010. TKtk

Sgt. Stokley and the other female drill instructors (DIs) in the 4th Recruit Training Battalion—which trains all of the nation's female Marine recruits—were in their 20s and indisputably gorgeous. These women, with black belts in martial arts, liked to wear full makeup and kept their long hair slicked back into buns that did not exceed the Marine Corps' 3-inch bun limit.

Most of the DIs had served in combat, and Sgt. Stokley had earned the combat action ribbon in Iraq. Yet despite their actions on the battlefield and their dedication in pulling 140-hour weeks ""making Marines"" at boot camp, the drill instructors knew some males didn't view them as ""real"" Marines.

A female Marine and members of the Navy Hospital Corpsman walked at Forward Operating Base Jackson in Sangin, Helmand province, Afghanistan, on June 7, 2012. AFP/Getty Images

With Thursday's announcement that the ban on women in combat would be lifted, the role of women in the armed forces is on the brink of change. But that doesn't mean military women are set to become female clones of male troops. The female drill instructors I met at Parris Island didn't hide their femininity. ""Remember who you are,"" Sgt. Stokley would remind her recruits, many of whom were just out of high school. The idea she wanted to get across was: ""Yes, we are Marines, and, yes, we are drill instructors, but first we are women—not men.""

In many cases, the female DIs are the first role models the recruits have had. They try to teach the impressionable young recruits that being a strong woman is not a masculine trait—especially in the Marines, which prides itself on its warrior ethos and is often regarded as the most masculine of the service branches.

To make their point, the drill instructors accentuated their tiny waists with belts cinched so tight they had to remove them when sitting in the drill instructor hut so they could breathe. In their bathroom, tubes of hair gel, hair spray bottles, flatirons, blow-dryers, brushes and makeup compacts battled for counter space, with bobby pin casualties scattered on the floor.

The DIs wore their hair long and pinned up in ""sock buns,"" a Marine Corps specialty that required snipping off the toe line of a sock, rolling the fabric into a doughnut shape, and wrapping and winding a ponytail's worth of hair around it. The result was a perfect, plump bun.

In contrast to the DIs, the recruits weren't allowed to wear makeup. Those with short hair all sported the same shaggy style. Those who wore glasses (no contacts allowed) had their last names typed on white paper and taped to the left arm of their glasses. Some had tape along the bridge holding broken glasses together.

Later that October morning, the recruits were at the rifle range—the first place that the males and females were near one another during training. Despite the warnings of many male drill instructors, some of the male recruits couldn't help but sneak peeks at the female DIs. ""We've never seen one of those before,"" was the usual reaction.

Sgt. Stokley was checking target scores. But she was ready to pounce when she walked by male recruits who didn't issue the proper greeting.

""Did you get a good enough look? Are you done?"" she asked two male recruits who were several inches taller than she was. ""Keep your eyes ahead and to the front. You're representing your platoon, and you're embarrassing your senior DI.""

""Aye, sir!""

""Oh, do I look like a man to you? Do I sound like one, too?"" Sgt. Stokley asked, with her face tilted upward. ""I guess it's 'cause I'm female, you don't show the proper respect?""

""No, sir!"" It was a hard habit to break and an unfortunate mistake for the recruit.

""Really? How 'bout you say something! Get out of my face!""

""Aye…ma'am.""

""Scream! Scream, 'Aye, ma'am!' ""

""Aye, ma'am!""

""Get back!""

Getting yelled at by a female DI was embarrassing. In time, that may change.

A freshman said she wanted to ask the NRA: “Was the blood of my classmates and my teachers worth your blood money?” Meanwhile, Sheriff Scott Israel pointed fingers at everyone but himself—this of course before America learned that as many as four of his deputies opted to stay safely outside the school rather than go inside to engage the killer.

In short, the public debate about how Congress ought to respond to this latest mass shooting is guided by two broad principles. Dubious on their own, they are even more witless when combined. The first is the idea that the most important thing is to “do something.” The second is that we ought to look to high-schoolers for the answer.

As goes CNN so goes the nation. The high-schoolers who survived Mr. Cruz’s Valentine’s Day massacre are taking to Twitter , TV and Tallahassee statehouse rallies to pressure politicians to “do something.” In response, some on the right, entirely missing the point, have accused them of being “actors” or “scripted” by the news media.

These teens do not need to be scripted. Their youth and earnestness makes it all but impossible for any adult to advance a counterargument without looking indifferent to the horror these kids have been through. If you don’t agree with what they want, they seem to suggest, you’re OK with mass shootings—as Mr. Rubio and Ms. Loesch found out the hard way.

Quick show of hands for those with children: How many of you look to your teens for political wisdom, whether it’s the daughter obsessing over her Snapchat streaks or the son who would spend his day eating Doritos and binge-gaming “Grand Theft Auto” if you let him?

This in no way diminishes the barbarity of what happened to the Parkland students. It is, however, to insist on the obvious: As terrible as their experiences were, the attack gives them no special insight into the complex array of public policies that might have prevented the slaughter.

Ditto for the “do nothing” accusation. Is it really so unreasonable to insist that those pushing specific legislation or regulations provide evidence that the something they want done will in fact produce the results they claim?

Even keeping the focus solely on school shootings, the challenge here is daunting: how to pick out potential school shooters from the thousands of young men who post ugly things on social media, have no fathers, or have an unhealthy fascination with guns—especially if they have no criminal records and haven’t been diagnosed as mentally ill. Are we confident government has the Solomonic wisdom to sort through the 8.4 million boys in high school and identify the ones who would shoot up a school?

Surely the facts invite skepticism. The FBI call center didn’t forward a January warning to its local Miami office. Sheriff Israel’s deputies answered nearly two dozen calls regarding Mr. Cruz before his rampage, and then hid outside the school when he went active. Some callers said they thought this kid would be a school shooter. Will a new law fix this?

It’s not just conservatives who have doubts. In an October 2016 article in GQ, the Guardian’s full-time gun-politics reporter conceded she was “shocked by how little evidence there was behind some of the most prominent gun control policies.” The year before, right after the San Bernardino killings, the Washington Post fact checker backed Mr. Rubio’s claim that gun laws would not have prevented any of the major shootings the nation had seen in recent years.

Maybe there are “common sense” gun restrictions that could do some good. But that would first require an honest debate. Instead, ours holds up teenagers on national TV who tell us they can’t distinguish between Marco Rubio and Nikolas Cruz.

Lisa Murkowski, shown in June in Washington, is a strong gun-rights supporter who hails from a state that has legalized marijuana use. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty images

Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s husband and sons ordered her a new Benelli 12-gauge shotgun as a gift, but when the Alaska Republican—and enthusiastic duck hunter—went to pick it up, she was puzzled by a question on the federal background form she had to fill out.

The form asked if she used marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes, both of which are legal in Alaska. If she answered yes, she would be unable to get the gun, because federal law prohibits anyone who uses illegal drugs from buying a firearm.

The senator doesn’t use pot, but she was taken aback by the notion that an activity that is legal in her state could block gun ownership. “I don’t like marijuana—I voted against legalization—but we passed it,” she said in an interview. “Now, you’ve got this conflict.”

The scope of that conflict just grew, as voters in eight states last week approved marijuana-related ballot initiatives. Now, 29 states and Washington, D.C., allow marijuana use in some form, including eight that allow recreational use. Yet federal law still holds that anyone who uses marijuana, even medicinally, is doing so illegally and can’t buy a gun.

That is upsetting advocates for both gun owners and pot smokers, groups that don’t always find themselves on the same side of the cultural divide.

“This idea that you somehow waive your Second Amendment rights if you smoke marijuana” is wrong, said Keith Stroup, founder of NORML, which advocates marijuana legalization. “In particular, if you are using marijuana as a medicine, the idea that you have to choose between your health and the Second Amendment is offensive.”

“The Gun Control Act prohibitions are governed by the Controlled Substances Act, and marijuana remains an illegal, controlled substance under federal law,” said Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr.

Justice oversees the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which regulates licensed gun dealers; as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which runs background checks; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which classifies drugs.

The marijuana-gun issue is one of the stranger outcomes of an unusual conflict between state laws, which increasingly allow marijuana use, and federal law, which continues to view pot-smoking as a crime.

At issue are the applications that would-be gun buyers must fill out when they visit licensed firearms dealers. Question 11(e) on ATF Form 4473 asks whether the purchaser is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana.

Related Video The legal, recreational use of marijuana passed in four states on Tuesday with another three states passing it for medicinal use. Lance Rogers, manager of the cannabis law practice for law firm Greenspoon Marder, explains how that could influence efforts to legalize pot in other states. Photo: Getty

Under ATF guidance distributed to gun dealers, anyone who answers affirmatively can’t buy a firearm. If a dealer has reason to believe the would-be gun purchaser is a marijuana user, the ATF says it is the dealer’s responsibility to halt the sale of a firearm or ammunition.

“There are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana purportedly used for medicinal purposes, even if such use is sanctioned by State law,” the guidance says.

The issue can be tricky, especially for those who oppose drug use but support gun rights. Perhaps for that reason, gun-rights groups have been relatively quiet on the issue. The National Rifle Association, for example, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Officials at Gun Owners of America highlight the medicinal-marijuana issue. “GOA finds it very troubling that the Obama administration would use medical issues to ban law-abiding Americans from owning firearms,” said the group’s executive director, Erich Pratt.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled recently that banning gun sales to medical marijuana users doesn’t violate their Second Amendment rights. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law, the court noted, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use in treatment.” The DEA reaffirmed that status just last August.

26 states and D.C.: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Washington, D.C.

States that passed and/or expanded medical marijuana proposals Nov. 8: Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota States that passed full legalization proposals Nov. 8: California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada

Ms. Murkowski wrote Attorney General Loretta Lynch in March urging her to reconsider the policy. “In my judgment, the disqualification of an entire class of marijuana users acting consistent with state law from possessing any firearm merits a review of federal legal policy,” Ms. Murkowski wrote.

Mr. Carr said the Justice Department responded to the senator’s letter in October. “It is not the department’s general practice to release publicly private communications with members of Congress.”

Ms. Murkowski said she understands the concerns about gun owners using marijuana, but said similar dangers could arise regarding alcohol. The conflict will likely intensify, she added, as more states approve marijuana use.

Marijuana advocates say legal users of the drug are discriminated against in other ways as well, from child custody and banking to student loans and public housing.

“Even if you’re a progressive who doesn’t like guns or a libertarian who doesn’t like public housing, you should still be outraged by the discrimination that people who use marijuana face,” said Tom Angell, founder of Marijuana Majority, which supports legalization.

Mike Goski stared into the steel casket at his twin brother’s body, dressed for eternity in a deep-blue Marine Corps jacket with red piping and brass buttons. It was like looking into a cruel mirror, Chris’s face, so like his own, distorted by a wound the mortician couldn’t conceal. Alone together for the last time, Mike slipped a knife into his brother’s hand, a weapon for Valhalla, the mythical refuge for fallen warriors. Chris was a born fighter from Red Oak, Texas, a Marine commando with six tours of duty. In combat, he could orchestrate from the chaos a lethal strike by jet fighters, helicopters, mortar and artillery, raining hot metal on enemies a few hundred yards away. At the cemetery, as “Taps” played, comrades of the Goski twins stood at attention, Marines in white hats and Special Forces in green berets. Mike, an Army Special Forces patch on his own shoulder, asked that none cry. After 9/11, twin brothers Mike and Chris Goski answered the call and enlisted in the U.S. military. Their long journey home is a story of love and loss. WARNING: STRONG LANGUAGE. Video: Gabe Johnson/WSJ. Photo: Laura Buckman for The Wall Street Journal. “Chris had only one fear that I’m aware of, and it was not death,” Mike said as he stood beside the coffin that held his twin. “He feared providing anything less than absolutely perfect close air support for his brothers. He feared failing them when they needed him the most.” The twins were small-town boys, part of a generation who came of age at the time of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Since 2001, volunteers from such places—many of them out-of-the-way counties struggling with lagging economies, drug addiction and limited options—have shouldered the greatest burden for America’s defense. They enlisted, fought and died in greater proportions than those from relatively more prosperous urban areas, an analysis of government military data by The Wall Street Journal found. Using Pentagon data on the hometowns of 6,800 military casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2016, the Journal found that 23% came from small towns and rural areas, even though those places made up just 17% of the U.S. population. By contrast, 23% of those killed came from core counties of U.S. metropolitan areas of more than one million people, where 29% of Americans live.

Growing up, Chris threw the first punch, and Mike leapt to his defense. Chris quit high school; Mike did the same. Chris enlisted in the military the day after 9/11; Mike wasn’t far behind.

“The thing Mike loved most in the world was Chris,” their father said, “and the thing Chris loved most in the world was Mike.”

After burying his brother in 2012, Mike was left to find a new path.

This account of his journey is based on military, police and medical records, as well as journals, emails, texts, videos and photographs; and interviews with relatives and friends, and comrades and officials from Army Special Forces, U.S. Special Operations Command, Marine Special Operations Command, the 10th Mountain Division and the 2nd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Co.

“The thing Mike loved most in the world was Chris, and the thing Chris loved most in the world was Mike.” Tim Goski

‘The thing Mike loved most in the world was Chris, and the thing Chris loved most in the world was Mike.’ —Tim Goski ‘Little destructors’ Chris and Mike Goski were born May 1, 1981. They grew up in Red Oak, at the time a town of 4,300 people and countless crepe myrtles, 20 miles south of Dallas. The family lived on a street of single-story brick houses. The boys were fraternal twins with good looks so similar it was hard to distinguish one from the other. Swapping places was a favorite classroom prank. Their father, Tim Goski, worked in trucking after falling short of a career as a basketball player, keeping the ropy, muscled arms of an athlete. Their mother, Kathy, was a nurse who spoke with the gravelly voice of a smoker. They seemed destined for each other: Kathy’s father was captured by the Germans after the D-Day invasion; Tim’s father was in a raiding party that tried to liberate his prisoner-of-war camp. The Goskis tried to raise the twins—obedient, as young boys—with a firm yet loving hand. Chris and Mike developed a charming, rambunctious energy that attracted friends. They turned a nearby storm drain into a clubhouse, squeezing in pals to lounge on a scrap of green carpet. Chris had a dirt bike that he used to ferry friends to the park, like a bus driver on his route. The boys once skipped a midday school assembly to host dozens of friends at their house while Tim and Kathy were at work. When the authorities arrived, Chris opened the door in a bathrobe, feigning illness even as his pals could be seen making a ruckus on the roof. The mischief eventually veered into delinquency. Their father, Tim, had quit drinking around the time Chris and Mike were 14 years old, yet the lure of substance-fueled escape seemed to pass from one generation to the next.

The boys sometimes drove from Red Oak, a dry town, into the city where they would slip a homeless man a few dollars to buy them Schlitz Malt Liquor. They hid in culverts or half-built houses to smoke pot. They grew bolder, buying and selling drugs in tough South Dallas neighborhoods. In Red Oak, the Goski brothers became the usual suspects. Local police knew them by name and routinely chased the boys into cornfields and creek beds. One night, an officer knocked on the door of their house and said, “Mrs. Goski, do you know your son is out front smoking marijuana?” A judge later hearing the matter ordered Chris to clean police cruisers as punishment. The teenager took the opportunity to sabotage the lights and sirens on the cars. Chris was the impulsive leader; Mike, the thoughtful follower. “Shut the f— up, Mike, and come on,” Chris would say. In fights, he would mouth off and throw the first punch, and Mike would step in to back up his brother. After one such bout, Mike told his mother: “I was just standing there thinking, ‘Chris, don’t do it, don’t say it.’” Chris also liked to steal. Once he came out of Best Buy with a car-alarm system under his jacket. Another time he pocketed a perfume bottle, just because it was in reach. “They just really were crazy,” said Jenny Jones, who met the twins in 8th grade and dated Mike. “They were willing-to-do-anything type kids, little destructors.” Tim cajoled, yelled and, at times, he swung a belt or brandished a Bible. Kathy tried a softer approach, and the boys were more likely to confide in her. She worried her husband’s ire pushed the twins to sins Tim hoped they would resist. When the boys were 16, Tim and Kathy moved the family, which included a younger son J.P., to Irving, Texas, a larger city, hoping to spare the twins from a future in prison or the morgue. “They were rebels in a little Texas town,” their father said, a label that was tough to shake. Chris Goski, left, and Mike Goski with their grandmother Evelyn Goski. Chris was good at math, and Mike loved military history, but they couldn’t abide by school rules. The twins repeated 9th grade three times, and Chris finally gave up. Soon, so did Mike. They earned GEDs when they were 17. Mike had reached 6 foot, an inch taller than Chris. The move to Irving led to more trouble. Chris ripped off a drug dealer, and his parents, worried for his safety, sent him to live with his grandmother in New Jersey in 1999. With his brother gone, Mike slipped deep into drugs. In early 2001, during a four-day bender of pot and speed, he tried to leap from his father’s car as they drove a Texas highway. Tim and Kathy checked him into a hospital treatment program, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. A doctor prescribed an antipsychotic medicine that slowed Mike’s thinking and bloated him to 275 pounds. Chris returned from New Jersey that spring. By the end of summer, the brothers hit bottom, aiming pistols at each other while high on PCP. Tim and Kathy put Chris into a drug-rehabilitation program, where he watched the 9/11 terrorist attacks on TV with another patient, a former Marine who immediately declared he would return to the service. Chris called his father and said, “Come get me the hell out of here.” The following day, Chris went to the Marine Corps recruiter’s office in an Irving strip mall and enlisted in the Reserve. Mike also tried to enlist, but Marine and Army recruiters rejected him for being overweight. Months later, when Chris returned from boot camp, he urged Mike to stop taking the antipsychotic pills. Mike complied, and he dropped 70 pounds on a diet of fish and vegetables—and by wrapping himself in trash bags as he worked unloading trucks at a warehouse. Mike’s mission In late 2002, the Army enlisted the newly trim Mike Goski. He served first with the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan and, following the invasion of Iraq, did a tour of Sadr City, a hostile Baghdad neighborhood. The brothers visited each other whenever possible. Mike once showed up in civilian clothes at Camp Lejeune, N.C., Chris’s home base. An officer there, thinking it was Chris, yelled, “Goski! What are you doing out of uniform?” Mike performed a lazy stretch and said, “I didn’t feel like putting it on today.” The twins found each other in Iraq, when Chris talked his way onto a helicopter to visit Mike in Baghdad. Mike embraced Army life and, after his second combat tour, was eager to advance beyond his infantry unit. “I’m better than this,” he told friends.

Mike Goski began his military career with the Army’s 10th Mountain Division, then joined the Special Forces, became an explosives expert, and fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2006, Mike was invited to audition for 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force. The elite unit is assigned difficult counterterrorism missions. Mike held his own among the hardened soldiers. But the Army evaluator recommended he first serve on a standard Special Forces team, which conducts raids and trains allied forces. “Needs more experience,” Mike’s evaluator wrote on Oct. 10, 2006. Mike won a spot in the Special Forces selection course. A third of the class gave up after standing in formation for hours in a cold North Carolina rain. He trained as an explosives expert, graduating in 2008 to become a Green Beret. The same year, Mike learned he was going to be a father. His girlfriend, Alexis Elliott, a former truck driver with the 82nd Airborne Division, was pregnant. When the sonogram showed two heartbeats, Mike burst into laughter and raced out to call his brother. Mike Goski, left, and Chris Goski with Mike's twins, also named Mike and Chris. Alexis had a rough pregnancy and spent weeks in a hospital bed. Chris and Mike cooked a Thanksgiving turkey dinner and brought it to the hospital. When the twins were born, the couple named them Mike and Chris. Mike and Alexis married and bought a house in Clarksville, Tenn., adjacent to Fort Campbell, Ky., where Mike had joined the 5th Special Forces Group. As Mike bounced between war and domestic life, the couple drifted apart. Alexis cared for the twins, while Mike sought refuge in his man cave, where he kept a sofa, computer and his guns. Death’s door Chris started unraveling in 2006, during his second tour of Iraq. At an outpost in Ramadi, a fellow Marine was shot in the head while trying to spot an enemy sniper, and Chris helped retrieve the mortally wounded man. Chris had a reputation as untroubled by death, whether witnessing it or delivering it. After this shooting, though, other Marines saw that he would spend hours at night alone, smoking unfiltered Camels. When he returned to Texas, the panic attacks started. One night he called Tim from a Bennigan’s restaurant in Dallas. “I think I’m having a heart attack,” he said. Chris’s mother, a nurse, recognized it as anxiety. Mike, left, and Chris Goski in Iraq in 2006. Chris returned to Iraq in 2007. One night, in a freak accident, static electricity from a helicopter’s blades detonated the explosives carried by a soldier. The blast blew up the man, and his remains drew feral dogs. The commander, worried about land mines, forbade anyone from retrieving the body until dawn. Chris asked permission to shoot the dogs, but the officer didn’t want to alert insurgents of the Marines’ position. Chris and two other men watched as the dogs ate their fill. In the morning, he and the others collected what was left. A couple of months after Chris returned home, he learned the woman he was dating was pregnant. He told friends he wasn’t serious about the relationship, and he worried he couldn’t afford child support. Their daughter was born in early 2009, shortly before Chris returned to Iraq for a fifth tour. Like his brother, Chris moved to an elite force. In August 2009, he earned a spot in the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, the Marine Corps equivalent of the Green Berets. Mike gave him a .45-caliber Springfield 1911 pistol to mark the promotion. The commandos wanted Chris for his skill coordinating air and artillery attacks. In Iraq, Chris excelled at his job with an uncanny ability to picture airspace in three dimensions during combat. But back home at the base in North Carolina, friends watched him grow disheveled and edgy.

Chris Goski served in Iraq, coordinating air, artillery and mortar attacks on the front lines, before a tour of Afghanistan as a Marine commando. His decline accelerated during an eight-month tour of Afghanistan that began in 2010. The pace of operations wore at Chris. The team would return from a mission at 4 a.m., high on adrenaline. The men would sleep a few hours, then get up early to plan the next operation. Chris turned to drugs to help him sleep and to wake him up. His close friend, intelligence specialist Doug Webb, could hear Chris rattling his pill bottles in the adjoining room. On April 24, 2011, the Marines found five insurgent bombs on the road. Dave Day, the team’s explosives expert, defused four of them. He was lying on his stomach to work on the last one when 80 pounds of homemade explosives blew up beneath him. Chris retrieved Dave’s helmet and jaw, then waved off the medevac helicopter. There was nothing more of Dave to collect. On their last mission, in June 2011, the Marines landed in an eight-hour fire fight. Chris directed bombers and helicopters overhead. At one point, several Marines were pinned down by a Taliban machine-gunner. Chris called for an airstrike, but the help came too late. One Marine, Bill Woitowicz, was killed. Chris blamed himself. He described the loss in an email to Mike, who would soon return to Afghanistan. “This is my teams 4th casualty, 2nd KIA,” Chris wrote. “He was our young dude. not as sad as the last one though.” To his cousin Becky Goski Fantuzzo, Chris wrote, “The war is still raging here in Afghanistan and at home people really have no idea.” Returning to the U.S. was difficult for Chris. “All of us were supposed to die out there,” his Marine comrade Doug Webb said. “So to come back to normal life—it just doesn’t feel right.” When Chris got back to Camp Lejeune, he bought a VW Jetta and tried to blend into stateside life, slapping a ”COEXIST” sticker on his bumper as a joke. Chris Goski. Chris lived in a two-bedroom apartment, the carpet pocked with cigarette burns. Two M4 rifles usually rested on the sofa. He kept a shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol, and he wore a .38-caliber revolver in a holster. All the weapons were loaded, he told friends, in case any authorities came for him. In the summer of 2011, Chris visited his uncle, Paul “Bingo” Goski, in New Jersey. Uncle Bingo had served in the Marines in the 1980s. One of the nights, Chris chugged nine beers and then sobbed. He begged his uncle to help him buy heroin. “I just want to get some to feel normal,” he said. At 2:30 a.m. that night, the police called Uncle Bingo: Chris, in a blackout from pills and alcohol, had crashed his Jetta. A judge later went easy on Chris after hearing his military record. Around Christmas that year, Chris flew home to Texas. While switching planes in Atlanta, he experienced heart palpitations that an airport medical team diagnosed as a panic attack. He finally arrived in Dallas, intoxicated on alcohol and Xanax, a prescription antianxiety drug. At the kitchen table, Chris showed his father footage of himself calling in planes to hit enemy fighters. Then Chris broke down. “I’m not doing too good, Dad,” he told his father. “I need a rest.” His commanders ordered a mental-health evaluation on April 20, 2012. The examiner diagnosed him with anxiety disorder but concluded Chris was no threat to himself or others. Chris started counseling sessions a week later. The counselor noted that Chris denied considering suicide because “he would never do that to his brother.” He was prescribed antidepressants and antianxiety drugs. On May 8, military clinicians said that “his anxiety was such that he needed consistent care/treatment,” and ordered him on limited duty, preventing him from returning overseas. They warned Chris not to mix his prescription drugs with alcohol, which would worsen his symptoms. Chris’s former girlfriend had petitioned a court for higher child-support payments, which nearly tripled to $1,232 a month. He fell behind on rent, lost his apartment and moved in with a fellow Marine and his buddy’s girlfriend in Holly Ridge, N.C. On June 7, he and Doug Webb attended a suicide-prevention lecture led by a general and his wife. The couple had lost a son in war and another to suicide. During the talk, Chris told Doug, “We’ve all had the gun in our mouth at one point.” The thought of Mike kept him from pulling the trigger, he said. On June 8, Chris reclined on the guest bed at his friend’s house. On his laptop, he entered a search for post-traumatic stress disorder. He watched a video of battle scenes from Afghanistan as Johnny Cash sang “Hurt.” I hurt myself today to see if I still feel. I focus on the pain, the only thing that’s real. Then Chris raised the .45-caliber pistol his brother had given him, put it to his right ear and pulled the trigger. He was 31 years old. Onslow County sheriff’s deputies found his body surrounded by 24 empty Bud Light cans. Doug Webb and other Marines cleaned Chris’s room before Mike arrived from Fort Campbell. They doused his blood-soaked mattress in gasoline out back and set it on fire. Then they shot it. Mike alone Mike and his parents waited on the tarmac in Dallas to meet Chris’s casket, which arrived draped in stars and stripes. A Marine friend stepped off the plane and told Tim and Kathy, “I brought Chris home to you.” Mike rode with Chris’s body to the funeral home. He looked into the casket and saw that there would be no viewing. “It doesn’t even look like him,” he told his father. Chris’s funeral was held on June 18, 2012. During the eulogy, Mike said, “Not all combat wounds are physical nor do they end the casualty’s life immediately. Chris’s wounds ended his on that night last weekend.” ‘You are all like cartoon characters to us. You’re not even in the real world.’ —Mike Goski The Goski family buried Chris at Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery. Afterward, family and friends went to Pappas Bar-B-Q for dinner, and the owners tore up the bill. That night, Mike told his aunt he was under surveillance by men in a white van parked across the street. “You better get a gun and protect yourself,” he said. Mike returned to Fort Campbell to a glowing evaluation and a bronze star. Sgt. First Class Goski “is a leader of character who places the mission, his Soldiers and his teammates before himself,” his commander from Afghanistan wrote. Yet Mike had struggled at home in the months before his brother’s death. Bills went unpaid. Dirty clothes and loose pills littered the floor. Routine problems of civilian life set him off. Arriving home after a frustrating visit to the department of motor vehicles for an expired car registration, he pulled out a gun. “I just want to f—ing kill people,” he told two visiting aunts. Mike Goski and Doug Webb during the week of Chris's funeral. “You are all like cartoon characters to us,” Mike told civilian friends. “You’re not even in the real world. You have no idea.” His wife had moved away with the twins, and Mike had a hard time talking about anything but war. He was quick-tempered and fumed over Chris’s death. He believed the Marines had killed his brother through negligence. “He was showing the red flags,” Mike said, “…they elected to not help him.” In December, Chris’s commander, Col. Jeffrey Fultz, and a sergeant major visited Mike’s house in Clarksville, Tenn., to hand-deliver the findings of a Marine Corps investigation. The report said Chris had mixed alcohol and antianxiety drugs despite repeated warnings and determined that the Marine Corps wasn’t responsible for his death. “No one who had association with him—from his friends, health-care providers, or chain of command—could have predicted nor fully understood the risk that Staff Sergeant Goski was taking by mixing the two,” Col. Fultz wrote in a Nov. 27, 2012, memo on the case. “This is unacceptable,” Mike told them. “He was your responsibility.” Then Mike took a menacing step toward the senior Marines. “Get the f— out of my house,” he said. Mike’s commander ordered him to undergo a mental-health evaluation in January 2013, citing a menu of issues: “Dealing with grief; Danger to self & others; Anger management; Ability to perform; coping skills.” For months, Mike was treated by a military physician assistant, who noted Mike’s history of knee and back pain; traumatic brain injury from exposure to explosions; and “adjustment disorder with anxiety.” Mike Goski with his twin sons, Mike and Chris, in 2010. Friends and family thought Mike intentionally hid symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder during medical appointments. He checked boxes on questionnaires that indicated he wasn’t depressed, and a military psychologist rated his suicide risk as low. In October 2013, Mike left active duty. He lost his house to foreclosure, and returned to Texas to live with his parents. Over the next 2½ years, he rarely left his room. He stacked body armor against his headboard, fearing gunshots through his bedroom wall. He thought people spied on his emails. He put duct tape over the cameras on computers. He had a loaded rifle within reach and a chair jammed under the doorknob. He obsessed over combat footage on the internet and bought into conspiracy theories—the U.S. government funded Islamic State and was behind the 9/11 attacks. He listened to recordings of the World War I poetry of Wilfred Owen and Robert Graves. When Mike did venture outside, he carried a snub-nosed revolver in his belt, hidden by a shirt. “If anybody knew what I wanted to do,” Mike told his father, “they’d lock me up.” Mike sought escape through a mind-addling use of Dust-Off, cans of compressed air used to clear debris from computer keyboards. He inhaled blasts of the chemical vapors, which gave him hallucinations. At times, he would run from his room yelling, “Get the medic. I got guys down.” High on the fumes, Mike would imagine Chris beckoning to him and saying, “I lost you. I’ve been looking for you.” Mike enlisted in the Texas National Guard Special Forces unit, but officers were troubled by his behavior. In March 2015, his commanding officer ordered a mental-health evaluation. By the end of the year, Mike had transferred to the North Carolina National Guard.

Mike “is a leader of character who places the mission, his Soldiers and his teammates before himself.” Mike’s commander from Afghanistan

In early 2016, Mike loaded his truck with weapons and began a meandering trip to North Carolina for drills. He stopped in New Jersey to see Uncle Bingo. One night he grabbed a can of his uncle’s computer-keyboard spray and inhaled. He drooled and seemed to stop breathing. His uncle shook him until he snapped out of it. “We used to do this over in Afghanistan all the time,” Mike said. He inhaled more and lay so still his uncle thought he was dead. “You can’t do that here,” he told Mike when his nephew revived. Then Bingo hid the can. On May 31, 2016, Kathy received notice of a certified letter waiting for her at the post office. It was about Chris. She read it before leaving the parking lot, sitting in the 14-year-old Chevy TrailBlazer he had given her. “I’d like to take this moment to express my deepest sympathies for the loss of your son,” wrote Gen. Raymond A. Thomas III. “I know that words could never ease the pain of your loss, which is why I have made suicide prevention my priority as the commander of the United States Special Operations Command.” Kathy Goski, mother of Chris and Mike Goski, on the front porch of her condo in Irving, Texas, on Monday, July 10, 2017. Kathy Goski holds a photo of Mike. Gen. Thomas asked Kathy and Tim to participate in a study of suicides among military special operators. He included the phone number of Donald Neff, a social worker in his command. Kathy called Dr. Neff at once. “You really want to help?” she demanded. “How about you help my son that’s still alive?” Dr. Neff promised he would. He contacted Larry Rivera, a care coordinator assigned to special-operations troops. The next day, Mr. Rivera called Tim and Kathy. Then he spoke with Mike for 90 minutes. They discussed treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla., which specializes in helping commandos. Tim saw a rare smile on Kathy’s face. Mike returned to Tennessee hopeful but wary. “I’ll believe it when I see it,” he told his mother. Best man On June 17, one of Mike’s closest Army friends—another Green Beret—invited him for a day at the rifle range on Fort Campbell. Mike had agreed to be the best man at the friend’s wedding the following month. Mike, the friend, and the friend’s teenage nephew loaded an SUV with AR-15 rifles, pistols, ear plugs and paper targets shaped like head-and-torso silhouettes. They stopped at a Wal-Mart for drinks and snacks. Mike came to the register with a six-pack of Dust-Off. Back in the car, the friend got angry over Mike’s purchase. They drove to a gas station, where the friend filled the tank. When he returned, he found Mike in the front seat sucking on a can of compressed air. “That’s what’s going to kill you, Mike,” the friend said, frustrated to tears. He was so upset he drove off with the gas-pump nozzle still in the tank. As they approached Fort Campbell, Mike motioned toward his pistol and hinted that he might provoke a violent confrontation with the gate guards. The friend pleaded with him. “Do you care about me?” the friend asked. “I keep you going, and you keep me going. Don’t do this to me.” They swerved onto a side street while Mike regained his composure. Kathy Goski holds the military identification tags that belonged to her twin sons. On July 2, Mike went to Nashville for the friend’s wedding. The ceremony included only the couple, a maid of honor and Mike, who seemed to have found his footing. He felt safe enough to leave his gun in the hotel room when the wedding party went out to celebrate. The next day, Mike drove back to his apartment in Clarksville, Tenn. He stripped to his undershorts and T-shirt and settled onto a camouflaged poncho liner on the bare mattress. He put a Glock pistol next to his pillow. Then Mike put the nozzle of a Dust-Off can in his mouth. Police found his body five days later. When Mike’s casket arrived in Dallas, Tim and Kathy followed the same journey as they had with Chris—from the airport to the funeral home to the National Cemetery. They learned Mike had arranged permission to share his twin brother’s gravesite. On July 18, 2016, the Goskis buried Mike’s casket atop of Chris’s, one brother’s name chiseled into the front of the grave marker, the other’s name chiseled into the back. “That’s how they came into the world,” Tim said. “And that’s how they left.”

In the case of two women accused of using nerve agent VX to murder Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea’s dictator, one question has puzzled authorities: How could the alleged attackers unleash a chemical weapon in a crowded airport without harming themselves or passersby?

Chemists reviewing evidence presented at the trial this week say it appears the plot worked by using a method of combining mildly toxic, relatively unstable elements of VX that don’t require heat to synthesize into the deadly nerve agent.

One of the identified substances, an alkyl chloride that Malaysia’s chemical weapons analysis center said was found on the clothing of Mr. Kim and one of his attackers, acts as a precursor that can be combined with another to form VX.

The presence of that precursor, along with the full VX nerve agent detected on Mr. Kim’s body, suggests there was a second precursor that went undetected in laboratory tests, said the chemical experts, who aren’t involved in the case. That compound likely would have been a sulfur-containing organophosphate, from a group of compounds commonly used in insecticides. Applied together to Mr. Kim’s face, they would have formed VX and entered his bloodstream in minutes.

Experts in medicinal chemistry and forensics said failure to detect the sulfur-containing organophosphate wouldn’t be unusual since it can degrade quickly, especially in humid environments, leaving only the rotten-eggs smell of sulfur gas and an acid. That acid, also a breakdown product of VX itself, was detected on Mr. Kim and on the other attacker.

The alkyl chloride and organophosphate precursors are toxic, but not nearly to the degree of VX, which was developed in the 1950s for chemical warfare and is the most potent of all nerve agents. Chemical experts theorize that Mr. Kim’s attackers exposed him to VX in such a binary form, allowing them to handle less-potent chemicals and survive.

Mr. Kim died shortly after being assaulted by two women at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13. Malaysian officials have said Mr. Kim died of VX poisoning. On Thursday, the lead chemist in Mr. Kim’s postmortem report, Raja Subramaniam, of Malaysia’s Department of Chemistry, testified he had found an array of VX precursors, VX-related breakdown products or VX itself on the victim and assailants.

Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam and Siti Aisyah of Indonesia are charged with murdering Mr. Kim. They have pleaded not guilty and face death if convicted. Malaysian officials have said the women acted under the instructions of North Koreans, some of whom flew from Malaysia moments after the attack. North Korea has denied involvement, and defense lawyers say the women believed they were performing a television prank.

Some aspects of the attack emerged in the ensuing days, but more detail become apparent in this week’s hearings.

On Thursday, Dr. Subramaniam revealed the alkyl chloride precursor was found on Ms. Huong’s clothing and fingernails. Security footage shows Ms. Huong was the second of the two women to approach Mr. Kim, coming from behind him and reaching around to touch his face. Testing showed her white, long-sleeve shirt emblazoned with the letters “LOL” was contaminated with VX.

Laboratory tests showed the first alleged attacker, Ms. Aisyah, had only one VX-related chemical on her: the acid that could either be the breakdown product of the second precursor or of VX itself. Defense lawyers are seeking to challenge those results. In the first week of the trial, prosecutors submitted samples taken from Mr. Kim and the alleged attackers, displaying them in transparent bags.

A binary application of VX was developed in the 1970s by U.S. weapons experts looking for safer ways to handle the nerve agent. Researchers aimed to place two precursors in separate compartments of missile warheads, leaving them to mix in flight. That method required heat for a reaction to occur, and wouldn’t be practical in an assassination attempt, chemical experts said.

The precursor identified during the trial indicates a different chemical pathway to VX: mixing it with the organophosphate in a reaction that doesn’t require heat.

Martin Boland, senior lecturer in medicinal chemistry at Charles Darwin University in Australia, said the method is an application of reasonably well-known organic chemistry. “It is probably avoided in binary weapons manufacture because the precursors are less stable and more toxic” than the method developed in the 1970s, he said. “But it is a viable method for production of unitary VX in a lab.”

VX has no known use apart from chemical warfare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Like all mass-produced nerve agents, it works by blocking the biological action of the enzyme cholinesterase, leading to loss of control of muscles and glands as the body’s electrical impulses rage unchecked. Muscles contract, creating convulsions. Eyes blur and speech slurs. Overstimulated glands cause profuse sweating, tears and salivation. A common cause of death is asphyxiation.

Many of the symptoms match those of Mr. Kim, doctors and witnesses said in court.

The alleged assailants appear to have been unharmed. Neither woman tested positive for VX in the bloodstream. But even if one was exposed to VX, she could have washed it off quickly enough to avoid harm, or been wearing a cream barrier to prevent VX from absorbing into the skin, experts said.

Warner, N.H.—The proposal for an indoor gun range and firearms shop didn’t cause a big stir at first in this small, rural town in New Hampshire, a state with some of the least restrictive gun laws in the nation.

But three mornings after the mass shooting Nov. 5 at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Warner resident Julie Orlando-Gibson emailed the local zoning board and urged them to reject the plan.

Ms. Orlando-Gibson, 48 years old, a mother of three who works in pharmaceutical sales, wrote that she is “pro-Second Amendment” and shares a home with a gun owner. But she said that such a business belonged “in a city-based warehouse facility where more police officers exist to manage issues.”

“I think it’s foolish for us not to realize mass shootings are a part of our world now,” she wrote.

Her letter is one of hundreds of comments pouring into the brick town hall in Warner, a no-stoplight community of 2,800 in the foothills of Mount Kearsarge. The flow of comments accelerated after recent mass shootings, and they reflected a divide in the community over whether a range would make it more, or less, safe. Stephen Paddock, the shooter in the Las Vegas massacre Oct. 1 that killed 58 and injured 500, had practiced at a nearby shooting range.

​​Some, like Ms. Orlando-Gibson, said they were particularly worried about the gun store after the Texas gunman’s history of violence didn’t prevent him from purchasing weapons.

With an official state motto of “Live Free or Die,” New Hampshire in February became one of 12 states that don’t require legal gun owners to have a permit to carry a concealed handgun. The state has a prominent gun-manufacturing sector, with the second most firearm-industry jobs per capita after Idaho, according to a 2017 report by WalletHub.

“New Hampshire is very much a pro Second Amendment state,” Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said in an interview. He didn’t take a stand on the Warner debate, saying New Hampshire also cherishes local control

Warner town officials could vote on the issue by mid-December.

“It really has polarized people,” said Kimberley Edelmann, a member of the Warner Board of Selectmen who discussed the issue as she tended to her horses at her farm up the hill from Main Street. “I don’t want to see it be a Hatfields and McCoy situation for the rest of eternity.”

Ms. Edelmann, 59, supports the proposal, believing the indoor range will draw the target shooters she hears firing bullets in the oak and maple forests near her property.

“It won’t have an impact on the lunatics who do the mass shootings but it will give the people who want to shoot in a safe environment to practice their skills,” she said.

At issue is a plan by Eric Miller, 52, a Sutton, N.H. businessman, who wants to build a roughly 9-500-square-feet indoor gun range and a retail shop just off Interstate 89.

“This is an ideal location for a range,” Mr. Miller said.

Multiple gun ranges sit within 40 miles of Warner but many are private clubs or outdoors. Mr. Miller, who previously managed insurance companies, envisions drawing customers who want to polish their skills or sample new firearms in all weather.

Customers could bring their own firearms or rent them, and Mr. Miller said his rentals may include several machine guns. “That’s sort of to satisfy people’s curiosity about them,” he said. He said the automatic weapons would be used only under close supervision and wouldn’t be sold to the public at the gun store.

Mr. Miller owns the commercial parcel but needs a special exception to zoning laws to build an indoor recreational facility in that spot. There are no particular zoning restrictions on building a gun range.

The town granted him one earlier this year, but the owner of an abutting business sued, arguing there hadn’t been ample public notice or due consideration of whether the range would affect the area. A judge sided with him in July, and the proposal went back to the town, which started deliberations anew.

Norm Carlson, the owner of that neighboring company, MadgeTech Inc., a major Warner employer with 70 workers, said he may move his firm out of town if a gun range opens next door.

Opponents to the proposed gun range include, from left to right, Laurie Morrissey, Sarah Kenney and David Elliott. Photo: Jennifer Levitz/The Wall Street Journal

MadgeTech employees, who design and manufacture electronics that measure factors like humidity for places ranging from the Louvre Museum to the International Space Station, are concerned about working next to a range, Mr. Carlson said.

While Mr. Miller said his safety procedures would keep loaded guns indoors, Mr. Carlson feels no plan is foolproof.

The divide is just as hardened along the brick sidewalks of Main Street.

“If our board thinks that no harm is going to come from that gun shop, that’s foolish,” said David Elliott, 70, a best-selling author who lives in Warner. He noted the rash of mass shootings this year.

Finishing breakfast at a restaurant across the street, Wally Morse, 74, said the fears were an overblown reaction to national events.

“I think it’s a whole lot of nothing,” said Mr. Morse, an Army veteran. “If it wasn’t for all these wannabe gun-control activists,” he said, “it wouldn’t even be an issue.”

Hobbs', 'Leslie Brody', 'Tawnell.Hobbs Wsj.Com', 'Leslie.Brody Wsj.Com']",,https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-teachers-already-have-guns-1519347813,"As President Donald Trump calls for teachers to carry guns to protect children, some districts already have gun-toting teachers in schools, though the identity of those carrying weapons is kept a secret.

Last week’s shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school that left 17 dead has kicked off an intense discussion about arming teachers, escalated by Mr. Trump, who is calling for having “weapons talented teachers” armed in the schools to deter would-be shooters.

School districts with armed teachers said it is an extra security measure that can provide an immediate response when a shooter is on campus.

“The faster we can respond, the more of our babies that are saved,” said Christopher Burrows, superintendent in Georgetown Exempted Village Schools, a 1,060-student district in Georgetown, Ohio, where some school employees carry guns. “Those folks that are armed are part of our safety team.”

Many teachers unions and educators have come out strongly against the president’s proposal, saying it would make schools more dangerous. Teachers aren’t trained law-enforcement officers and have enough to do educating students, they said.

“That’s a recipe for disaster,” said Shanna Peeples, a former Texas English teacher who was named the 2015 National Teacher of the Year. “I can’t imagine having to add weapons training on top of what I already do.”

At least eight states already allow teachers in some capacity to carry guns on K-12 school grounds, including Kansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, according to the Education Commission of the States, which tracks legislation.

So far in 2018, at least six states—Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Maryland, and Oklahoma—have introduced legislation that would make it easier to have school personnel carry firearms on school property, according to the commission.

It is unknown how many teachers are carrying guns in schools because there is no official national tally. While some school districts have publicly announced their armed-employee programs, they won’t say who is carrying them and typically won’t divulge the number of armed staff members. The armed programs usually require educators to own their own weapons; the school districts provide training.

Several school districts in Ohio and Texas with armed staff said Thursday they haven’t had any incidents involving guns accidentally going off or being shot unnecessarily, a concern by some who don’t want teachers armed.

Still, accidents have happened. A sixth-grade teacher was injured in 2014 when she discharged her gun by mistake while using the toilet in a faculty rest room in Taylorsville, Utah. She had the concealed gun legally. A spokesman for the Granite School District said state law requires permit holders to keep their guns with them.

“Police determined she had the weapon on her lap and it slipped and she reached to grab it and pulled the trigger,” said a district spokesman. “The front of the toilet blew off and it blew a porcelain fragment in to the back of her leg.”

Kevin Dyes, superintendent in the Holliday Independent School District in the small community of Holliday, Texas, said arming employees was needed for safety because the schools had a large number of access points. Employees receive training and their weapons—typically high-quality semiautomatic handguns—are approved by the local police chief, he said.

“We’re not carrying a Saturday night special,” Dr. Dyes said. “We also have training requirements where they have to shoot every so often.”

David Thweatt, superintendent in the Harrold Independent School District in Harrold, Texas, said his district began allowing armed teachers in 2007, paying them an undisclosed stipend. The district’s decision to use armed educators was based on the closest sheriff being about 30 minutes from the school—too long to wait during a shooter situation.

“We cannot hope for the best. You cannot hide in a closet for 30 minutes,” Mr. Thweatt said.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, participated in a telephone town hall meeting with 60,000 educators this week. “The response was universal, even from educators who are gun owners: Teachers don’t want to be armed, we want to teach.”

Mr. Trump also wants to stop designating schools “gun free” zones so that properly trained educators can carry concealed weapons and fire back at a school shooter.

Many school districts have tight budgets, and police and security personnel are often shared between campuses.

Some schools that incorporate firearms into their safety plans have received funding for training through Faster Saves Lives, a program sponsored by the Buckeye Firearms Foundation in Ohio. About 1,300 school staff in 12 states has received training through the program in the past five years, said program director Joe Eaton.

“The faster we stop the killing, and the faster we start medical aid, that’s how we save lives,” Mr. Eaton said.

Jamaal Bowman, principal of the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action Middle School in the Bronx, called arming teachers “an insane idea.” He said it would be much more effective to invest in more mental-health counselors, social workers and arts programs that help children heal.

“School is not just a refuge from guns, it’s a refuge from violence,” Mr. Bowman said.

Kenneth Trump, a consultant who is president of National School Safety and Security Services, said in states that allow teachers to carry guns, very few districts use the option. “Most school boards, superintendents and teachers say thanks but no thanks,” he said.

Mr. Trump, who is no relation to the president, said there could be a host of responsibilities with arming teachers, including weapon inspections, certification and storing guns. Armed teachers also could present confusion during a live shooter incident, he said.

“You arrive at the scene and you have seven people coming out with firearms in their hands,” he said. The idea of arming teachers “sounds good, it feels good, but the devil is in the details of implementation.”

Stephen Voisine of Wytopitlock, Maine was arrested after authorities got a tip that he had shot a bald eagle, a federal misdemeanor punishable by up to a year’s jail time.

Because he had a previous state conviction for domestic violence, Mr. Voisine also was convicted of violating federal law prohibiting people with such records from possessing a firearm, which carried a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

He was sentenced to serve one year and a day, exceeding the maximum allowed for killing the eagle by one day.

The court, in a brief written order, said it would consider whether Mr. Voisine was improperly sentenced to extra prison time for the weapons possession, along with a second case involving another Maine man, William Armstrong III, who was sentenced to three years’ probation for possessing a firearm after a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.

Both men argued their prior domestic violence convictions were too minor to merit punishment for possessing firearms. The cases were consolidated on appeal.

Mr. Voisine argued his 2004 domestic violence conviction, for which he pleaded guilty to a state misdemeanor and paid a $200 fine for “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly” causing “bodily injury or offensive physical contact,” wasn’t sufficient to trigger the federal gun-possession charge. The federal statute applies to those convicted of state misdemeanors involving “the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.”

The brief court record doesn’t specify what precisely Mr. Voisine did in the domestic dispute.

Legal papers also provided few details regarding the shooting of the bald eagle, which isn't at issue before the Supreme Court. But according to a 2012 report in the Bangor Daily News, authorities said Mr. Voisine may have been the first person to kill a bald eagle in Maine since President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act in 1940.

“It is bad enough to shoot our national bird out of the sky, but even if he mistook it for a hawk, it is illegal to shoot a hawk in Maine,” said U.S. District Judge John Woodcock in Bangor, Maine, who sentenced Mr. Voisine, the News reported.

wsj133,wsj,['Shira Ovide'],,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123413872329061621,"As the ad recession takes the oomph out of the publishing industry, Sports Illustrated is betting it can turn its iconic swimsuit edition into a souped-up marketing machine.

The magazine, which plans to unveil the 46th edition of the franchise Monday on the ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" always tries to create a lot of buzz for the issue, which typically comes out in February and features some of the world's top models.

This year, however, Sports Illustrated, which is owned by Time Warner , TWX -0.93% has turned its promotional efforts themselves into moneymakers, generating about $3 million in revenue, say people familiar with the matter.

Among the deals struck by the magazine, PepsiCo 's PEP -0.66% SoBe drink brand is sponsoring YouTube videos of the women featured in the issue frolicking on the Canary Islands and in Naples, Italy.

In addition, a Southwest Airlines LUV -0.23% jet emblazoned with an image of swimsuit model Bar Refaeli will whisk VIPs to a launch party in Las Vegas this week. And, as part of a days-long Vegas celebration, stunt drivers sponsored by Nissan Motor will race cars on a lot adjacent to the Luxor hotel, with swimsuit models as their passengers.

Sports Illustrated's grab for such nontraditional marketing dollars has helped diversify its annual haul from the swimsuit edition. This year, about 40% of revenue generated by the issue -- which accounts for about a tenth of the magazine's total annual revenue -- will come from digital and event-marketing efforts. Four years ago, just 4% of the issue's revenue came from sources other than print advertising, executives say.

To develop its strategy for the issue, Sports Illustrated worked with Team Velocity, a sports-marketing and events firm based in Norwalk, Conn. ""It's really about taking this content we've created in the magazine and leveraging it through new channels,"" says Mark Ford, the magazine's president.

The promotions have helped Sports Illustrated offset a drop in print-advertising revenue. This year's swimsuit issue has 70 pages of ads, a third fewer than last year's.

The special issue was inaugurated in 1964 by Sports Illustrated editor André Laguerre to serve as a winter escape from what had been a dead zone for sports fans -- the interval between the end of football season and the start of baseball season. Its newsstand sales total about 1.1 million copies each year, though sales have declined from around 1.5 million copies earlier this decade. That compares with the magazine's normal weekly newsstand sales of about 85,000 copies.

Sports Illustrated may have a challenge keeping sales up this year. Amid a fee dispute with magazine distributors, publisher Time Inc. recently started working with new middlemen to truck copies to retail outlets like Wal-Mart Stores . WMT -1.72% Time Inc. has acknowledged there may be some bare magazine racks for a few weeks, which could jeopardize swimsuit-issue sales. But Sports Illustrated says it has taken steps to work around any distribution problem.

Sports Illustrated is just one media property attempting to extend its marketing beyond the traditional ad page or 30-second TV spot. ""Experiential marketing,"" a broad term for efforts to give consumers hands-on experience with products or services, is a growth industry as marketers seek out more ways to draw the attention of the increasingly distracted consumer.

""Brands these days have really got to be creative about how they're getting their messaging out in the marketplace,"" says Linda Rutherford, vice president for communications and strategic outreach at Southwest Airlines.

To piggyback on the unveiling of this year's swimsuit issue, the Southwest plane with the image of Ms. Refaeli will be unveiled this week at New York's LaGuardia Airport and will ferry about 100 people, including two dozen models, to Las Vegas. After that, the airline plans to use the Boeing 737, dubbed SI One, on regular routes for the next two months.

Las Vegas is spending more than $1 million with Sports Illustrated to feature swimsuit models in events this week, culminating Friday in a 1,000-person launch party and concert by R&B star John Legend at the LAX nightclub. Attendees can line up to have their photos taken against a fake backdrop of the Las Vegas skyline with one of the two dozen swimsuit models in attendance.

""We are the city of great special events. It's just a place where things can happen, and this fits right in,"" says Rob Dondero, executive vice president of R&R Partners, which is working with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Online, Sports Illustrated plans to post more than 1,500 pictures from its swimsuit photo shoots, an effort that generated more than half a billion page views for last year's swimsuit edition. SoBe's lizard mascot will be featured in YouTube video ads starting Tuesday morning, in a video showing him inspecting candidates for this year's swimsuit cover page.

Even in a bad economy and with sexy images ubiquitous online, the readership of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue has demonstrated staying power. The edition has about 66 million readers, including 4 in 10 adult men in the U.S., according to Sports Illustrated research.

In language reminiscent of the Cold War, Mr. Putin used his annual state-of-the-union address to boast about Russia’s military prowess and put on a display of new armaments, including intercontinental ballistic missiles and underwater drones.

“Efforts to contain Russia have failed,” Mr. Putin said to Russia’s political elite gathered in Manezh Hall adjacent to Red Square, speaking before large screens displaying images of the weapons.

Amid applause from the audience, a video showed a digital animation of a cruise missile fired from northern Russia flying across the Atlantic Ocean, evading missile defenses, then circling around the southern tip of South America before heading north toward the U.S.

Most of the weapons Mr. Putin highlighted are already well known to the U.S., whose missile defenses are designed to counter the actions of rogue states rather than of Moscow. He did surprise some U.S. analysts by announcing that Russia would field a new nuclear-powered, air-launched cruise missile.

Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual state of the union address to show off a series of new armaments, including nuclear weapons he claims are capable of penetrating U.S. air-defense systems.

Mr. Putin’s demonstration of might is further evidence of a general ratcheting up of sophisticated arms development among the world’s largest military powers. A Pentagon review last month made it known that the U.S. would undertake a major upgrading of its air-, land- and sea-based strategic nuclear forces, at a cost the Congressional Budget Office has estimated at $1.2 trillion.

China is also upgrading its arsenal, though its nuclear force is much smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia.

Moscow and Washington have both announced they are meeting their obligations under the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits each side to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. Hopes have vanished that the accord would be followed by one mandating deeper cuts.

Instead, the two sides are concentrating on updating systems allowed under that treaty and deploying weapons that fall outside its scope.

Among those, the Pentagon is planning to develop two new sea-based nuclear weapons—a new “low-yield” submarine-launched ballistic missile and a sea-launched cruise missile—it says are needed to deter Russia from contemplating the limited use of nuclear weapons during a military crisis.

Mr. Putin’s speech, in part, appeared designed to send a message that Russia would spare no effort to maintain its own nuclear capability.

“What worries me most is the resurgence of a dynamic to outmatch the other side with new nuclear weapons,” said Hans M. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists, which is critical of the American and Russian nuclear modernization plans.

Franklin Miller, a former Defense Department official who advised the Pentagon on its nuclear-modernization plans, said the new U.S. systems are needed to maintain the American nuclear deterrent, however much Russia might not like them.

“I think Putin understands that U.S. has awakened from its somnolence on nuclear issues,” Mr. Miller said. “If he understands that Russian should not carry out the first use of a nuclear weapon, all is well.”

Most of new systems touted by Mr. Putin on Thursday appear to be designed mainly to evade or penetrate limited U.S. antimissile defenses.

Among the weapons displayed on screens behind Mr. Putin was a new Sarmat heavy intercontinental missile that he said was capable of reaching any point on the globe. The Pentagon has long anticipated that system would be deployed next year. Last month’s nuclear review also indicated that the Pentagon was aware of the nuclear-armed torpedo Mr. Putin touted, which could be used to attack U.S. ports and submarine bases.

There was a new twist in Mr. Putin’s highlighting of a Russian program to develop nuclear-powered cruise missiles, which he said had undergone a successful test launch at the end of last year and would have an unlimited range.

The Russian president seemed to be sending a message that if the U.S. expands its defenses against ballistic missiles, Russia can circumvent them, U.S. analysts suggested. The U.S. has long maintained that the main purpose of its antimissile defenses is to block an attack by a rogue state like North Korea, and that they aren’t nearly capable of undermining Russia’s nuclear deterrent.

“The Russians seem to have more confidence in the U.S. ballistic missile defense than even the staunchest U.S. advocates do,” Mr. Kristensen said.

Mr. Putin’s approval rating at home shot up to over 80% after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 and has remained around that level. State-television news and talk shows regularly blame the U.S. for many of the world’s problems and present Mr. Putin as standing up to Washington. Domestic critics, meanwhile, accuse him of warmongering to distract from Russia’s stagnant economy.

Mr. Putin, who is almost certain to be elected to another six-year term in a presidential ballot on March 18, started his speech Thursday by talking up plans to better the economy, saying Russia needed to improve average life expectancy and raise people out of poverty.

The U.S., he said, had exploited Russia’s economic, political and military weakness after the collapse of the Soviet Union to ignore Moscow’s views, including by moving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization closer to Russia’s borders.

“No one listened to us. Listen to us now,” he said.

Mr. Putin said Russia’s Syria campaign had allowed the military to show off the results of a modernization program he launched in 2011. “The whole world knows the names of our newest airplanes, submarines, air-defense systems,” he said.

Ivan Konovalov, an independent defense analyst in Moscow, said the speech demonstrated how quickly Russia’s arms industry is progressing.

“It is developing some of the best weapons in the world, and the United States, if they want to maintain parity, has to answer the challenge quickly,” he said.

The Pentagon had little to say publicly about Mr. Putin’s speech, stressing that U.S. missile defenses were aimed at “rogue” nations, not Moscow.

“We are not surprised by his statement,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said Thursday during a press briefing, adding the American people should be assured the U.S. military is “full prepared” to defend the country.

Photo: Bloomberg News

After a year when Chinese companies bought record numbers of American firms, a U.S. company is getting a rare shot at a big takeover in China.

Allentown, Pa.-based Air Products & Chemicals Inc., APD -0.90% a maker of industrial gases, is looking for a bigger foothold in the Chinese market. In December, it got an unexpected opening, after a boardroom battle at China’s biggest industrial-gas maker, Yingde Gases Group Co. , effectively put the company on the block.

Air Products is offering up to $1.5 billion for Hong Kong-listed Yingde, a price that would make the deal the largest takeover of a Chinese firm by a U.S. buyer. People familiar with Air Products’ bid say it could raise that offer to fend off a rival bid formalized Tuesday by a Hong Kong-based private-equity firm PAG Asia Capital.

An important twist would come Wednesday, when shareholders vote on which of the warring board factions get to run the company, and thus handle the sale. The leadership is being contested between Yingde’s chairman—under whom Yingde has been slow to open its books, according to Air Products—and a pair of ousted former executives who say they want to hasten a sale.

A spokesman for Yingde said the company is “focused on the auction process,” but declined to comment further. It has said in the past that it is working to provide prospective bidders with access to financial data.

Air Products has said it is open to working with either party to strike a deal. “We believe that the combination of Yingde and Air Products makes significant strategic and financial sense,” the company said Tuesday in a statement, adding that it continues to participate in the sale process.

The fight over Yingde, which accounts for about 14% of China’s industrial-gas market by revenue, presents an unusual opportunity for a U.S. buyer to purchase a big Chinese company. Chinese regulators restrict foreign investment in many sensitive industries, and have nixed high-profile bids for local companies in the past, including Coca-Cola Co.’s $2.4 billion attempted takeover of China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. in 2009 on antitrust grounds. That has discouraged other U.S. firms from pursing splashy acquisitions.

The biggest U.S. acquisition of a Chinese company was Joy Global Inc.’s $1.4 billion purchase of International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. in 2011, according to Dealogic data.

Some U.S. politicians, including President Donald Trump, have lambasted China for not giving U.S. firms equal access to Chinese markets, even as Chinese investors cut a record $69 billion worth of deals last year for U.S. firms.

Lawyers in China say regulators there may allow a takeover of Yingde because it trades publicly and already has many foreign investors.

There are many foreign participants in the industrial-gas business, where companies create mixtures of gases such as oxygen and nitrogen, which are used in manufacturing products including steel and semiconductors.

An Air Products deal would require approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce.

Air Products’ pursuit of Yingde followed a split in the company’s management team in November, when Yingde Chairman Zhao Xiangti called a hasty board meeting to remove then-Chief Executive Sun Zhongguo and his chief operating officer, as well as the issue of a big chunk of shares to a Beijing investor picked by Mr. Zhao.

Mr. Sun protested the share sale and asked for the entire company be put up for sale. Yingde subsequently nixed the deal with the Beijing investor after its share price rose significantly.

The U.S. company, which has a market value of about $30 billion, made its initial offer in December.

In February, Yingde hired Morgan Stanley to shop the company to potential buyers.

Air Products’ chief executive, Seifi Ghasemi, has taken a deep personal interest in the deal, leading calls and peppering executives and advisers with questions, according to participants.

Mr. Ghasemi flew to Shanghai to pitch Yingde executives on its offer in February, and is scheduled to go again later this week to learn more about the company’s operations, according to people familiar with the situation.

There are still plenty of obstacles to an Air Products takeover.

Last week, Yingde’s feuding board members separately cut deals with PAG to sell their combined 42% stakes for HK$6 a share—the same price Air Products offered, but without requiring the due diligence that the U.S. company has said it needs.

PAG is planning to make the same HK$6 offer to the rest of Yingde’s shareholders, and the deal would become effective if it is accepted by more than half.

PAG, which declined to elaborate beyond its Tuesday official offer statement, says its offer isn’t conditioned on Ministry of Commerce approval.

Mr. Sun said in an interview he believes the PAG deal “puts a floor” on the price bidders must pay to buy the company, and that he welcomes higher competing offers from Air Products and others.

Yingde suspended trading in its shares Monday, but they closed at HK$6.22 Friday after news of PAG deal, meaning investors are betting the takeover battle will heat up and produce a higher offer.

“We want a fair deal for all shareholders,” said Seth Fischer, who runs hedge fund Oasis Management Co., which owns a 4.5% stake in Yingde. “Now is the time for buyers to finish sharpening their pencils and put in their best offer.”

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and chief executive of the NRA, used language similar to that employed by President Donald Trump on protecting students, while also taking shots at some of the president’s favorite political targets, including the national media, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prominent Democratic lawmakers.

Mr. LaPierre said local officials and parents need to take steps to “harden” schools, “including effective, trained armed security that will absolutely protect every innocent child in this country.” Mr. Trump also called Thursday for “hardened” security, proposing that some teachers be armed.

Mr. LaPierre told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference that liberal lawmakers, egged on by the media national, are cynically using the latest school tragedy to roll back Second Amendment gun protections. Current laws, if more vigorously enforced and observed, are sufficient to curb mass shootings, he said.

“What they want are more restrictions on the law-abiding,” Mr. LaPierre said. “Think about that. Their solution is to make you—all of you—less free.”

The NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, faces renewed scrutiny following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Critics say the NRA’s campaign donations and political influence give it outsize influence in Congress, where the group works to stave off stricter gun controls and loosen existing ones.

The group endorsed Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential race and spent $30 million in ads supporting him and attacking his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Mr. Trump mentioned the group’s support of him during the White House meeting with local officials.

“They’re very close to me. I’m close to them,” Mr. Trump said, adding he had spoken “often” with the NRA in the past few days as he worked to develop a response to the Parkland shooting. He also played down potential conflict with the group over some of his proposals, such as placing new age restrictions on gun purchases, which the NRA has opposed.

“It’s not a battle,” he said. “I think the NRA wants to do the right thing.”

The NRA has long been a potent political force. The group says it has five million dues-paying members, and it “grades” politicians on their gun stances, sending those report cards to members across the country. In a measure of its cash clout, the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics calculated that five Republican senators have received more than $27 million in election aid from the group over their careers.

In his CPAC speech, Mr. LaPierre took political positions that align with Mr. Trump, accusing Democratic lawmakers of politicizing the shooting rather than coming up with what he billed as practical solutions.

“They want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of school security, the failure of family, the failure of America’s mental health system and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI.”

The FBI acknowledged after the attack that agents failed to act on a tip in January about the alleged shooter in Florida.

In another nod to Mr. Trump, Mr. LaPierre also attacked the FBI more broadly, and said rank-and-file members should call “BS on its rogue leadership.” He didn’t specify what he meant when describing FBI “corruption, and its own unethical agents.”

Mr. Trump fired James Comey as the head of the FBI in 2017 and has regularly criticized officials over their handling of separate probes into Russia meddling in the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Mr. LaPierre had harsh words for prominent Democratic lawmakers, saying the party has shifted left over the past few decades and is now controlled by “European-style socialists.” He mentioned some potential Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential race, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California.

“They hide behind labels like Democrat, left-wing and progressive to make their socialist agenda more palatable, and that is terrifying,” he said.

Sen. Harris responded to Mr. LaPierre in a tweet: “I am not going to be silenced by attacks from the NRA or anyone else — and neither will my Senate colleagues or the students from Stoneman Douglas. It’s time to stand up to the gun lobby and keep our communities safe.”

The office of Sen. Warren didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

On the media, Mr. LaPierre said: “You know, the whole discussion of the Second Amendment and the gun issue in this country has become so dishonest in the national media.”

In separate comments at CPAC, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said media outlets have their own motives. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” she said. “You guys love it. I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but I am saying you love the ratings.”
