The corporate statement was sent in response to the teen-aged gun control activists after the Parkland high school shooting.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims and their loved ones. But thoughts and prayers are not enough,” the statement read.

The popular sporting goods retailer said they will no longer sell firearms to anyone under 21 years of age, and will no longer sell “assault-style” weapons in their stores and their Field & Stream stores. They also banned the sales of “high capacity magazines.”

They admitted in their statement to selling a shotgun to the Flordia shooter in Parkland.

“It was not the gun, nor type of gun, he used in the shooting,” the statement read. “But it could have been.”

The corporate statement also urged elected officials to follow their lead for “common sense gun reform” arguing that if “even one life is saved, it will have been worth it.”"

CNN quoted Trump saying, “Half of you are so afraid of the NRA. And you know what? There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

A senior administration official confirmed that the big sticking point between Trump and the NRA is Trump’s plan to raise the minimum age for rifle purchases from 18-years old 21-years old. But the White House did caveat that intention by suggesting the increased age may only be on “certain firearms.”

Either way, the NRA opposes it, and NRA leadership made this clear during meetings with Trump over the weekend.

But Trump remains determined. In addition to raising the minimum age for long gun purchases Trump is also rallying behind new gun laws for our background check system. These new laws were put forth by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and John Cornyn (R-TX), in legislation called “Fix NICS.” The legislation was introduced after the Air Force failed to report the Texas church shooter’s criminal conviction to the background check system, thus allowing him to legally acquire a gun.

Ironically, while Trump’s support Cornyn’s action on background checks, Cornyn is not excited about Trump’s effort to raise the minimum age for long gun purchases. Cornyn doubts whether raising the minimum age for long gun purchases would save lives.

breitbart2,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/28/president-trump-2/,"President Donald Trump embraced Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) gun control bill but rejected Rep. Steve Scalise’s (R-LA) push for national reciprocity during a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers Wednesday afternoon.

After listening to Sen Chris Murphy (D-CT), Trump looked at toward the end of the table and asked Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) to detail their gun control bill.

The Manchin/Toomey gun control bill is the same universal background check legislation supported by Barack Obama in the wake of the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. It the very bill that was defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate on April 17, 2013.

Toomey described it for Trump, saying the bill “strengthens the reporting of information into the background check system” and “requires background checks on all commercial sales.” This is code-talk for requiring background checks on private gun sales, which Toomey described as sales at gun shows and online (even though online sales already require a background check).

Manchin then spoke and suggested that West Virginians will support the Manchin/Toomey gun control bill if Trump will support it. He did not mention that the Manchin/Toomey bill would not have prevented the Florida attack — just as it would not have prevented the Sandy Hook attack that spawned it.

Trump spoke of the using the Manchin/Toomey bill “as a base” to which other gun bills can be added, and then continued taking comments from various senators and representatives in attendance.

When it was Rep. Scalise’s time to speak, he highlighted the crime-fighting value of concealed carriers and the need to pass national reciprocity legislation. National reciprocity was introduced in the House on January 3, 2017, and passed in the House on December 6, 2017. It was introduced in the Senate on March 1, 2017, and it has yet to come up for a vote nor has Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a word in support of it.

Trump shut down Scalise’s reciprocity push, suggesting the gun control package being pieced together would never pass if national reciprocity were added to it.

Trump looked at Scalise and said, “You know I’m your biggest fan in the whole world. I think that maybe that bill will someday pass, but it should pass as a separate bill. … You’ll never get this passed. If you add concealed carry to this, you’ll never get it passed. Let it be a separate bill.”

Trump added, “We want to get something done.”

After Vice President Mike Pence referenced gun violence restraining orders, Trump stated, “Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court. Because that’s another system. Because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early. Like, in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida, he had a lot of firearms — they saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So, you could do exactly what you’re saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.”

For those too young to remember, the “rope-a-dope” was a tactic invented and used by Muhammad Ali. It was a way he made his opponents believe he had no fight left in him so that they, in return, would punch wildly and wear themselves out.

Ali would back up against the ropes, put up his guard, and let his opponent land blow after blow after blow. The opponent, in return, would grow confident of victory and risk recklessness. The unacquainted sports fan would watch in disbelief as the great Ali appeared close to going down while the seasoned Ali fan eagerly awaited the moment when Ali would drop the charade and beat his opponent into submission.

The moment would come at the height of the opponent’s confidence, which happened to coincide with the point where the opponent had spent his energy punching an Ali who really was not that tired after all. Ali would then grin, start punching again, and win the match.

A better analogy for what President Trump may be doing to Democrats right now is hard to imagine.

After all, he campaigned against expanding background checks, yet he showed interest in Sen Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) background check gun controls and asked Manchin to put them forward.

Trump also campaigned against an “assault weapons” ban, yet he asked Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to add her “assault weapons” ban to Manchin’s gun control bill.

Furthermore, Trump spoke in favor of national reciprocity on the campaign trail, stressing his conviction that “concealed carry [is] a right, not a privilege,” yet he rejected Rep. Steve Scalise’s (R-LA) attempt to add national reciprocity to the other gun bills being discussed in the wake of the Florida school shooting.

The totality of it all makes Trump look like he is on the ropes and nearly finished fighting for the Second Amendment.

But we must ask ourselves: is Trump really done fighting, or is he just sucking in the Democrats, letting them grow overconfident of victory before unleashing a flurry that stops their gun-grabbing plan in its tracks?

Gun control “rope-a-dope.”

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) partnered with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) Wednesday to push more gun control for “assault weapon” sales in America.

The two senators are sponsoring a bill that would make 21 the minimum age to purchase an AR-15, AK-47, or related rifle.

Flake explained the proposed gun control:

If the law says someone under the age of 21 is too young to purchase a handgun, than it ought to say they’re too young to purchase an assault weapon. This bipartisan fix is long overdue, and would’ve made as much sense before the tragedy in Parkland as it does after. I hope we can work together to get this passed and signed into law without delay.

Feinstein echoed him:

Under current law, licensed gun dealers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21, but they are allowed to sell assault rifles like the AR-15 to anyone over 18. This policy is dangerous and makes absolutely no sense. If you can’t buy a beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy a weapon of war. While we need to do much more to reform our gun laws, ensuring teenagers can’t legally buy weapons of war is a commonsense step forward.

Flake and Feinstein’s bill is in response to the fact that the Florida school shooter legally purchased his rifle at age 18, the same age at which our country outfits young men with fully automatic weapons and sends them off to war.

This gun control push is addition to Feinstein’s other legislative push for an all-out ban “assault weapons,” Sen Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) push for new regulations on gun shows and private gun sales, Rep. Ted Deutch’s (D-FL) push to ban bump stocks, Rep. Brian Mast’s (R-FL) push for Trump to issue an immediate, temporary ban on the sale of AR-15s, and Rep. Carolyn Maloney’s (D-NY) call to ban “massacre machine gun magazines.”

DICK’S Sporting Goods announced Wednesday that it, too, would no longer sell guns to persons younger than 21 and would no longer sell “high capacity” magazines or “assault rifles.” This announcement marked the second time DICK’S had quit selling “assault rifles.”

Walmart released a statement on its policy shift. USA Today published an excerpt from it, which said, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales. Going forward, we are raising the age restriction for purchase of firearms and ammunition to 21 years of age.”

The New York Times reports that Walmart will also end sales of Airsoft guns that resemble an “assault rifle” and they are also ridding shelves of toy rifles that resembles AR-15s or AK-47s.

Walmart quit selling “assault rifles” in 2015. The retailer does sell handguns, expect in Alaska, and it does not sell “high capacity” magazines.

breitbart7,breitbart,['Joel B. Pollak'],2018-02-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/28/trump-guns-nra-white-house-meeting-gun-policy/,"President Donald Trump took on the National Rifle Association (NRA) — and politicians who support it — in a free-wheeling, bipartisan, televised discussion on gun laws with members of Congress at the White House Wednesday.

Trump has held several such meetings since the beginning of the year, beginning with a meeting on immigration in January. The events are virtually unprecedented in showing Americans a civil and open exchange of views on contentious issues among leaders — and, occasionally, ordinary citizens — on both sides of the political divide.

This meeting was different, however, in that the president was not just listening, but driving policy in a particular direction.

And that direction — perhaps to the dismay of some of Trump’s core supporters — is toward gun control.

At one point, Trump dismissed a suggestion by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) — who was wounded last summer in a mass shooting targeting Republicans — to allow national reciprocity for concealed carry permits.

Trump told Scalise bluntly: “I think that maybe that bill will someday pass but it should pass as a separate bill… You’ll never get this passed. If you add concealed carry to this you’ll never get it passed. Let it be a separate bill.”

Trump defended the idea of raising the minimum age to purchase a rifle — at least, the AR-15 used in the Parkland, Florida shooting earlier this month — to 21, pointing out that handguns already had such an age requirement, but that the shooter had still been able to buy the rifle he used.

Trump acknowledged that the NRA was opposed to the proposal. “I’m a fan of the NRA. There’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA … These are great people, these are great patriots,” he said. “They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.”

Then, in an exchange that captured the attention of the mainstream media, Trump told Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) that they were “afraid of the NRA” after they told him that their bipartisan bill to expand background checks had not included a provision to raise the minimum age to purchase a rifle.

Toomey responded by defending the view that adults over 18 should be able to own rifles: “My reservation about it, frankly, is that the vast majority of 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds in Pennsylvania who have a rifle or a shotgun — they’re not a threat to anyone. They’re law-abiding citizens. They have that because they want to use it for hunting or target shooting. And to deny them their Second Amendment right is not going to make anyone safer.”

The president acknowledged that argument, but went on to argue that Republicans should add Democrat ideas into one compromise bill. His emphasis was on expanding and improving background checks, but he was clearly open to more ambitious proposals — or at least wanted to be seen open to other ideas. He dismissed the idea of “gun-free zones,” describing them as dangerous — but he also wanted to push gun control legislation forward.

How much of Trump’s performance was theatre is anyone’s guess. When asked by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) whether he would actually sign a bill to raise the minimum age for purchasing a rifle, Trump dodged carefully: “I’ll tell you what: I’m going to give it a lot of consideration, and I’m the one bringing it up, and a lot of people don’t even want to bring it up, because they’re afraid to bring it up.”

It is possible that Trump simply wanted to be seen as fighting the NRA, while at the same time bringing out the NRA’s arguments — such as Toomey’s response — in the mouths of other people. That way, Trump could cast himself as a leader on the issue, without committing to legal changes that would alienate a core part of his base.

But conservatives will, no doubt, worry about his apparent concessions to Democrats — and how far they could go.

Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) urged her colleagues to ban “massacre machine gun magazines” Tuesday in the wake of the February 14 Florida school shooting.

The immediate problem with her position is that Nikolas Cruz did not use a machine gun to attack the school, he simply used a common semiautomatic rifle.

Business Insider‘s Joe Perticone tweeted:

Rep. Carolyn Maloney just said we need to ban “machine gun magazines.” — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) February 27, 2018

The Media Research Center published Maloney’s full quote, saying, “We really need to act in a number of ways. We need to pass an assault weapons ban. We need to ban the massacre machine gun magazines, and we need comprehensive background checks.”

When Democrats push for “comprehensive background checks,” they are talking about universal background checks. Such checks outlaw private gun sales by requiring every sale–public or private–to be conducted via an FBI background check. The problem with this push is that the Florida gunman passed a background check to acquire the rifle he used in the attack.

The grocery chain sells guns and ammunition at its Fred Meyer stores in the western U.S. Those sales will continue but persons under the age of 21 will be prohibited from purchase.

CNN Money reports that Kroger released a statement, saying, “In response to the tragic events in Parkland and elsewhere, we’ve taken a hard look at our policies and procedures for firearm sales. Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers.”

Kroger doe not sell AR-15s or similar weapons, but has allowed such weapons to be special ordered at Alaska store locations. They are ending the special order option for such guns as well.

On Wednesday Dick’s Sporting Goods ended “assault rifle” sales for the second time since the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. They also announced they will no longer sell “high capacity” magazines and they raised their minimum long gun purchase age to 21.

Also on Wednesday, Walmart made clear it will no longer carry toy guns that resemble AR-15s and announced it will not sell guns to anyone under the age of 21.

CNN intimated that the GOP wants to get rid of the “lengthy background check” associated with suppressors as well.

In fact, the tax is $200 dollars–not $200,000–and the background check is one of the only current requirements that the GOP plans to keep in place for suppressors. What they want to get rid of is the bureaucracy of the purchase, whereby law-abiding citizens are required to be photographed, fingerprinted, and then to register their suppressor with the government. And yes, the GOP also wants to get rid of the $200 tax.

CNN referenced the tax correctly later in the segment, but the mention of a “$200,000 tax” was how they launched it.

Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) introduced legislation on January 9 that will accomplish all these things. Their bill is the Hearing Protection Act and it is focused on the hearing benefits shooters and outdoorsmen receive from suppressed firearms.

CNN’s Victor Blackwell addressed the Hearing Protection Act and said opponents of suppressors see any hearing benefits claims as a “facade.” He then showed movie clips from Casino Royale and No Country for Old Men and a narrator said, “A gun silencer, shooting enthusiasts call it a suppressor. It’s an assassin’s must have in movies.” The narrator says that opponents of the Hearing Protection Act say the real goal is “about militarizing weapons, not about hearing,” and that suppressor ownership “will allow mass shooters to kill stealthily.”

In reporting this way, CNN shows the Democrats’ hand–as far as opposition to suppressors is concerned. They plan to fight against them the same way they fight against thumb-hole stocks, flash hiders, and collapsible stocks via “assault weapons” bans. And they will try to shame pro-suppressor lawmakers into inaction by suggesting that suppressors make it possible to attack innocents without detection. Americans who are paying attention will quickly realize that the people making these arguments need to quit forming their opinions on suppressors from Hollywood films.

When the final stage arrived in 1997, and virtually all handguns were banned via the Firearms Act, the promise was a reduction in crime and greater safety for the British people. But the result was the emergence of Britain as the “most violent country in Europe.”

Britain began placing restrictions on gun ownership after World War I with the Firearms Act of 1920. The passage of this act was emotionally driven, based in part on the public’s war-weariness and in part on the fear that an increased number of guns–guns from the battle field–would increase crime.

The Firearms Act of 1920 did not ban guns. Rather, it required that citizens who wanted a gun had to first obtain a certificate from the government. We see this same stage taking place in various places in the United States now, where a person who wants a firearm has to get a Fire Owner Identification Card (Illinois) or has to be vetted by police (Massachusetts) or both.

Thirteen years after the passage of the Firearms Act, British Parliament passed the Firearms and Imitation Firearms Bill, making the possession of a replica gun or a real one equally punishable unless the owner of either could show the lawful purpose for which he had it. (Sounds like California?) This was followed by the Firearms Act of 1937, which author Frank Miniter says “extended restrictions to shotguns and granted chief constables the power to add conditions to individual private firearm certificates.”

In the U.S., police departments in Massachusetts play the role Britain’s chief constables played and have final say on who can or can’t own a firearm. On July 25, Breitbart News reported that that Massachusetts police were pressing for “sole discretion” on who could own a long gun; they already had such discretion over who could own a handgun. On August 1, they received the power they sought.

Britain continued to issue firearm certificates as World War II set in. But by the time the war was over, the gun control mindset had permeated society to a point where self-defense was no longer a valid reason to secure a certificate for gun ownership.

Guns were simply for sport or for hunting.

In 1987, Michael Ryan shot and killed sixteen people in Hungerford, including his mother. He wounded fourteen others, then killed himself. According to the Library of Congress, Ryan used “lawfully owned” rifles to carry out the attack. Nevertheless, his attack prompted the passage of more laws in the form of the Firearms Act of 1988. This act “banned the possession of high-powered self loading rifles” and “burst-firing weapons,” and imposed “stricter standards for ownership” to secure a government certificate to own a shotgun.

In 1996, Thomas Hamilton walked into an elementary school in Dunblane, Scotland, and shot and killed “sixteen small children…and their teacher in the gym before killing himself.” He brought two rifles and four handguns to carry out the attack. All six guns were legally owned: Hamilton had fully complied with gun control statutes.

The Firearm Act of 1997 was passed while emotions ran high. Gun control proponents push for an all-out ban on private gun ownership, in the much the same way that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) reacted to the heinous crime at Sandy Hook Elementary by trying to ban approximately 150 different guns.

Yet the Firearm Act did not ban all guns, “but served to essentially prohibit the ownership of handguns in Britain” and to make the acquisition of certificate to possess a long gun an onerous and time-consuming one. Much the same as the onerous and time-consuming process now burdening law-abiding DC residents seeking a gun in the home for self-defense.

And what has been the outcome of passing more laws in Britain to remedy the fact that other laws were ignored or broken? It has not been good.

In 2009, twelve years after the Firearms Act of 1997 was passed, Daily Mail Online reported that Britain was “the most violent country in Europe.” They also reported that Britain’s home figures showed “the UK [had] a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and South Africa.”

With that said, it is worth noting that “about 91 percent” of Chicago homicides in 2016 were committed with a firearm, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Think about it–Chicago has played host to decades of gun control experiments, including an all-out handgun ban from 1982-2010. Yet 2016 witnessed 779 homicides in the city, and over 9 out of 10 of those were firearm-related. And even after the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down Illinois’ ban on concealed carry in December 2012, city leaders fought to make implementation of concealed carry as difficult as possible. For example, on September 15, 2013, American Thinker reported that Mayor Rahm Emanuel was fighting to block off sections of the city where concealed carry permit holders would be barred from carrying guns for self-defense.

These and other gun controls ultimately do one thing–they make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to acquire and carry the guns they need for self-defense, while doing nothing to curtail the behavior of criminals, who will always acquire and carry the guns they use in crime.

Fast-forward to 2016 and Chicago’s gun-control legacy–779 homicides, more than 9 out of 10 of which were committed with a firearm.

On January 2, 2017, the Chicago Tribune pointed to a recent study from the University of Chicago Crime Lab which shows “that of the five largest U.S. cities by population, including New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Houston, Chicago has seen the largest single-year homicide increase of the last 25 years.” Moreover, whereas “Los Angeles’ homicides committed with guns averaged 72 percent from 2011 to 2015, and 60 percent in New York City,” the rate is Chicago is now “about 91 percent.”

University of Chicago social service administration professor Jens Ludwig stressed that the growing use of guns for homicide in Chicago does not necessarily mean there are more guns in Chicago now than in the past. Rather, the situation may simply be that criminals feel less compunction about using guns to take lives in cold blood; therefore, more firearm-related homicides are showing up.

It is interesting to note that the rate of firearm usage in homicides was “about 76 percent” in 1998. That climbed to “88 percent” on Obama’s watch during 2015, and now sits at “about 91 percent.” This is the legacy of gun control.

The legislation–Senate Bill S3444–then bans the sale of any “child operated firearm.”

According to the official New York State Senate website, S3444 “Proscribes persons, firms or corporations engaged in retail business of selling firearms from selling, delivering or transferring child operated firearms.”

The summary of S3444 says:

Prohibits persons, firms or corporations engaged in the retail business of selling firearms from selling, delivering or transferring child operated firearms; defines “child operated firearm” to mean a pistol or revolver manufactured 1 year after the effective date of these provisions which does not contain a childproofing device or mechanism incorporated into the design of such pistol or revolver.

The test for whether a pistol or revolver is child-proofed is whether the gun has a “childproofing device or mechanism incorporated into [it]” which is sufficient to prevent “an average five-year-old” from operating the firearm.

The devices and mechanisms to make traditional guns acceptable are to include “the capacity to adjust the trigger resistance to at least a 10 pound pull, the capacity to alter the firing mechanism so that an average five-year-old’s hands are too small to operate the pistol or revolver, or the capacity to require a series of multiple motions in order to fire the pistol or revolver.”

S3444 does not stipulate how law-abiding citizens in life and death situations are supposed to compensate for the additional time needed go through “a series of multiple motions” before firing a gun in self-defense.

breitbart14,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-01 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2018/02/01/lawmaker-pushing-bill-enabling-californians-bar-gun-ownership/,"Assemblyman Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) is pushing a new gun control bill designed to enable Californians to bar themselves from purchasing firearms.

The bill, AB1927, is presented as a way that people with suicidal thoughts can take away the option of acquiring a firearm with which to carry out their intentions.

The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Bonta’s bill comes despite the fact that California has a 10-day waiting period for firearm sales. That waiting period was ubiquitously put in place to prevent people from acquiring firearms with which to impulsively harm themselves or others. But Bonta pointed to a study which indicated Californians who take their own lives are simply doing so in the first week after the gun purchase is finalized.

Under Bonta’s bill, Californians who bar themselves from gun purchases would be able to recover their Second Amendment rights by demonstrating “they were no longer a danger to themselves or others.” He did not say what such a demonstration would entail.

Gabby Giffords’ gun control group cheered Bonta’s bill, saying, “We support legislation that would empower people struggling with suicidal urges to promote their own health and safety in moments of calm and clarity by voluntarily adding their names to confidential gun background-check databases for a temporary period.”

In addition to a 10-day waiting period for gun purchases California has an “assault weapons” ban, universal background checks, gun registration requirements, gun confiscation laws, Gun Violence Protection Orders, a “good cause” requirement for concealed carry permit issuance, ammunition controls, and a soon-to-be requirement that all ammunition buyers pass a point-of-sale background check for a box of bullets. Despite these and numerous other controls, Bonta believes California needs another gun law.

The advocate — Kirsten Powers — spoke to the Elmhurst city council, seeking assurances that those taking the course would not be bringing firearms with them.

NRATV’s Cam Edwards tweeted:

According to the Chicago Tribune, Powers said people who previously attended the concealed carry class said they were “required to bring a firearm” and were “required to shoot on the last day of class.” But Elmhurst police chief Michael Ruth made clear that the truth was otherwise — the classes in Elmhurst will be gun-free and the shooting portion, which is required, will be conducted “at a firing range outside the city.”

The classes are held Saturday and Sunday in the Knights of Columbus Hall at 537 S. York Street in Elmhurst. Following the Sunday class, attendees can drive to the range and satisfy the shooting requirements. Ruth said those attending the shooting portion must have a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card, and their weapons must be “broken down and not easily accessible from within the vehicle” during transport.

The Deerfield Patch reports that Illinois “[requires] 16 hours of training” for a concealed carry permit. And Illinois does not recognize concealed carry licenses from any other states.

Breitbart News previously reported on a 2012 Congressional Research Service study showing gun ownership jumped from 192 million privately owned guns in 1994 to 309 million in 2009. At the same time, the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” of 6.6 per 100,000 Americans in 1993 fell to 3.6 per 100,000 in 2000 and as far as 3.2 per 100,000 in 2011.

Now, newly released Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) numbers show the firearm-related murder rate maintained this low rate through 2014 — the most recent year in which the CDC has numbers to report. CNS.news quoted CDC numbers showing the “firearm homicide rate” at 3.43 per 100,000 in 2014. At the same time, gun sales continued at a record-setting pace.

For example, Breitbart News reported that 2013 gun sales broke the previous annual gun sales record by a large margin. There were 21,093,723 background checks for gun buyers in 2013 alone. Gun sales continued apace in the following year, with Black Friday gun sales booming. CNN reported “almost three background checks per second” on Black Friday 2014.

In summary, the 192 million privately owned guns in 1994 swelled to 309 million privately owned guns in 2009 and continued to grow by leaps and bounds thereafter. An estimate of 330 to 340 million privately owned guns by the end of 2014 is no stretch. And while the theories of the left would suggest such a massive jump in gun ownership must result in more bloodshed, empirical evidence shows that more guns actually correlated with a sharp decline in the firearm-related homicide rate between 1993 and 2014.

The information was released as part of the response to a Southern California Public Radio (KPCC) reporter’s Freedom of Information Act request. The reporter was seeking information on state Firearms Safety Certifications.

Fox News reports that information on “3,424 firearms instructors” was inadvertently released. That information contained “dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and California identification numbers.” On December 28, 2016 — over two months after the release of information was discovered — “the California Department of Justice sent out a letter to all of the Golden State’s instructors letting them know their personal information had been compromised.”

California Attorney General Kamala Harris also used the letter to “[recommend that] firearm instructors place a fraud alert on their credit. Since driver’s license numbers are appealing to identity thieves, a fraud alert could prevent criminals from misusing someone’s personal data.”

The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) is asking why it took the state two months to alert the firearms instructors about the leak.

NRA-ILA’s Jennifer Baker said:

This privacy breach is just another example of the California Department of Justice’s disregard for the rights of gun owners. There’s no reason why the private information of firearms instructors should have been released – the DOJ redacts information all the time.

breitbart18,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-11-14 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/14/deregulation-suppressors-reality-president-trump/,"With pro-gun President-elect Donald Trump heading to the White House, substantial deregulation regarding firearm suppressors could be a reality.

The use of suppressors is legal in 42 states and certainly provide protections to the environment and the human ear. But the path to acquiring a suppressor is circuitous because the items are regulated under the auspices of the National Firearm Act (1934).

This means acquisition of a suppressor requires finger prints, photographs of the purchaser, a background check, a $200 federal tax, and registration. Such regulations not only raises the price of suppressors but also increases the time it takes to purchase one.

A waiting period of 4 to 6 months is not uncommon.

Under President Trump this can change. Donald Trump Jr. made this clear during a September 26 interview with SilencerCo, in which he said:

I’ve had the privilege of being able to hunt in Europe, where some of the strictest gun laws in the world exist. And guess what, virtually every hunting gun there is suppressed. It’s about safety. If you have that kind of noise levels in any of industry, like you do shooting sports, OSHA would be going crazy. It’s about safety.

Don Jr. went on to describe the regulation surrounding suppressors as “just another rule the government wants to put in place for no reason.” He added, “If Europe can do it, America better well be able to do it.”

SilencerCo’s CEO Joshua Waldron stated that “it’s crazy to be behind the curve” on suppressors, when contrasted with Europe. And Don Jr. concurred, saying it is the result of “arbitrary policies [made] by people who don’t know what they’re talking about.”

Waldron then brought up Representative Matt Salmon’s (R-AZ-5) Hearing Protection Act; a legislative push that would remove suppressors from National Firearms Act oversight so Americans could more easily acquire them for hearing protection while target shooting or hunting. He asked if President-elect Trump would support such changes once in office, and Don Jr. said, “We want to go through Congress, want to do it the right way, but if you line up those votes he is obviously going to be for it.”

The incident occurred around 4:15 a.m.

According to KSAL, 51-year-old Mark Kind got up to investigate sounds of someone allegedly trying to break in. When he made it to the front of the house he reportedly found 38-year-old Jason Allen Wooderson in his truck. He called police and held Wooderson at gunpoint until officers were on the scene.

Police discovered Wooderson was allegedly in possession of “marijuana, methamphetamine and other paraphernalia.”

He faces numerous drug-related charges and one charge of “criminal trespass.”

On August 10, Breitbart News reported that a concealed carry permit holder intervened and held a robbery suspect at gunpoint in a neighbor’s drive in Broadman, Ohio. On August 11, Breitbart News reported on 24 different incidents where armed citizens used guns to save lives over a six-week period.

But on January 12, 2017, the New York Times editorial board claimed, “The grim truth is that concealed-carry permit holders are rarely involved in stopping crime.”

His response came in response to an audience member who was asking how Democrats can justify pushing gun control when it was clearly the presence of a gun in the hands of Willeford that ended the attack.

On November 6 Texas officials credited Willeford with ending the attack.

Willeford, who is a former NRA instructor and current NRA member, ran out of his house barefoot with an AR-15 in hand, took cover behind a vehicle and shot killer Devin Kelley when he walked out of the church. Kelley then fled the scene, only to crash and die roughly 15 minutes later. Breitbart News reported that Senate Democrats responded by introducing a ban on the type of gun Willeford used to end the attack.

On Today, audience member Brianna asked, “How do you justify the Democrat view on gun control when the shooter was stopped by a man who was legally licensed to carry a gun?”

Biden replied, “Well, first of all, the kind of gun being carried he shouldn’t be carrying.” He then specifically mentioned “assault weapons” and said, “I wrote the last serious gun control law that was written, it was law for 10 years. And it outlawed assault weapons and it outlawed weapons with magazines that had a whole lot of bullets, as you can kill a whole lot of people more quickly.”

He added, “Number two, it’s just rational to say certain people shouldn’t have guns. Now the fact that some people with guns are legally able to acquire a gun and they turn out to be crazy after the fact, that’s life. There’s nothing you can do about that.”

Again, Brianna was asking how Democrats can justify pushing more gun control in light of the fact that an armed citizen used a gun, an AR-15 in this case, to stop the Texas church attack.

Loesch said, “As far as an AR-15, it’s a semi-automatic this thing originated in the civilian market before it was adapted by the military.This is really a discussion about banning all semi-automatic firearms. And I wish that we could be genuine in our discussion about that. That’s the position on AR-15s. And AR-15s are going to be in that school protecting students and teachers when they return back to class. As far as banning of semi-automatic firearms, think people need to come out and say that is what they are talking about.”

Breitbart News reported that the Broken Arrow homeowner’s 23-year-old son shot and killed three suspected home intruders with an AR-15. According to Tulsa World, Wagoner County Sheriff’s deputy Nick Mahoney said the three suspects “were wearing all-black clothing, masks, and gloves” and allegedly “forced their way into the home through a glass door in the back.” The homeowner’s son was asleep at the time and awoke to “loud bangs” as the suspects made entrance. The son grabbed the AR-15 and opened fire when the intruders walked into the hallway.

Deputy Mahoney said “investigators found a knife on one of the deceased in the kitchen and brass knuckles on the other.”

ABC 8 reports that Leroy Schumacher, grandfather of deceased 17-year-old suspect Jacob Redfearn, says what the boys “did was stupid” but they did not deserve to die.” He added, “Brass knuckles against an AR-15, come on, who was afraid for their life.”

He said the use of the AR-15 meant “his grandson didn’t have a chance.”

Investigators believe the homeowner’s son acted in self-defense, but Schumacher does not believe the son’s actions should be legal. He said, “There’s got to be a limit to that law, I mean he shot all three of them; there was no need for that.”

John Kasich (R) removed pro-gun content from his website Sunday and asked if Americans would really lose anything if the government took away their AR-15s.

The pro-gun content consisted of descriptions of pro-Second Amendment bills he signed as Gov., as well as “photos illustrating how he opposed former President Barack Obama’s gun control efforts.”

According to Cleveland.com, adviser John Weaver explained that Kasich emerged from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting with “new views” on guns.

Weaver tweeted:

.@JohnKasich is a supporter of the 2nd Amendment, but like many Americans – if not most – his views have evolved with the dramatic increase in school shootings & mass killings. We want our leaders to be unafraid to observe, listen & learn. We urge the ""president"" to follow suit. — John Weaver (@JWGOP) February 18, 2018

In addition to erasing pro-gun content from his website, Kasich suggested gun owners’ rights would not be harmed if the government took away their AR-15s.

Cleveland.com quoted Kasich from a CNN appearance, in which he said, “What would you lose?” Kasich said on television. “Would you feel as though your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn’t buy a God darn AR-15? These are the things that have to be looked at, and action has to happen.”

Kasich added, “If you’re a strong Second Amendment person you need to slow down and take a look at reasonable things that can be done to answer these young people.”

The alleged invasion occurred around 12:30 pm on Clearwater Drive.

According to the Tulsa World, Wagoner County Sheriff’s deputy Nick Mahoney said the three home invasion suspects “were wearing all-black clothing, masks and gloves” and allegedly “forced their way into the home through a glass door in the back.” The homeowner’s 23-year-old son was asleep at the time, but awoke to “loud bangs” as the suspects made entrance. The son grabbed the AR-15, took position, and opened fire when the intruders walked into the hallway.

Two of the suspects collapsed and died in the kitchen, a third suspect managed to get out of the house but collapsed and died in the yard.

Two of the deceased individuals were “16 0r 17” years old. One of the suspects was “18 or 19.” Deputy Mahoney said “investigators found a knife on one of the deceased in the kitchen and brass knuckles on the other.”

Later on Monday, 21-year-old “Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez of Oologah” went to the Broken Arrow Police Department and turned herself in. She confessed to being the getaway driver for the dead trio and was arrested. She was charged with “three complaints each of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary.”

An unidentified neighbor who heard the homeowner’s son open fire said, “The shots were so loud — loud enough that I ran to the window to see what had happened. Something in me knew it was gunshots, but I didn’t know what had happened until I went to leave my house and saw all the police officers.”

Pat Roberts (R-KS) supports banning that “bump magazine” and raising the minimum purchase age for an AR-15 to 25.

By “bump magazine” Roberts is referring to a bump stock, which numerous lawmakers supported banning on October 2, 2017, although they did not even know the accessories existed on September 30, 2017.

CJOnline.com reports that Roberts received hundreds of thousands of dollars and a “consistent ‘A’ [rating]” from the NRA in the past.

He said, “I don’t think there’s any reason we can’t get rid of that bump magazine. Then there’s the talk about the AR-15, or the AK-47 if you really want to go back a ways, limiting that to the range. If people want that, then they’re going to have to be older. Obviously, they’re going to have to have training. Hunters don’t use that, or if they do, they shouldn’t.”

When asked specifically about a minimum age for purchasing AR-15s, Roberts said, “I’d raise that to 21. Hell, I’d raise that to 25.”

The NRA is opposed to raising minimum ages for firearm purchases. CNN quoted the NRA’s Jennifer Baker:

Federal Law prohibits adults under the age of 21 from purchasing a handgun from a licensed firearm dealer. Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection.

Sen. Roberts responded, saying, “I think the NRA’s going to be a little flexible on this. I think it would be in their best interest.”

The ruling came in Kolbe v. Hogan.

The NRA-ILA reported that the 4th Circuit described “assault weapons” as “exceptionally lethal weapons of war.” The court ruled that the differences between the wildly popular AR-15 and actual battlefield guns like an M-16 are only “slight.” Of course, one of those “slight” differences is that the M-16 is a fully automatic firearm, which means it shoots continuously when the trigger is pulled. An AR-15 is a semiautomatic rifle that only fires one bullet each time the trigger is pulled.

According to Reuters:

The 4th Circuit… [ruled] the military-style guns used in a disproportionate share of the mass killings in the U.S. are outside the aegis of the Second Amendment because they are most suited for military use.

This is problematic inasmuch as AR-15s are not used in an disproportionate number of mass public attacks in the U.S. Consider the following:

Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (January 6, 2017) – Handgun

Burlington Mall attacker (September 23, 2016) – .22 Rifle

NY bombing susptect (September 16, 2016) – Glock Handgun

the Orlando attacker (June 12, 2016) – AR-15-style rifle

the UCLA gunman (June 1, 2016) – Handgun

the San Bernardino attackers (December 2, 2015) – Handguns, AR-15-style rifles

the Umpqua Community College attacker (October 1, 2015) – three Handguns and an AR-15-style rifle (ABC News)

Alison Parker’s attacker (August 26, 2015) – Glock Handgun

the Lafayette movie theater attacker (July 23, 2015) – Handgun

the Chattanooga attacker (July 16, 2015) – Shotgun, AK-47-style rifle, Handgun (NBC News)

the alleged Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker (Jun 17, 2015) – Glock Handgun

the Las Vegas cop killers (June 9, 2015) – Four Handguns and a shotgun (New York Daily News)

the Santa Barbara attacker (May 23, 2014) – Handgun

the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014) – Handgun

the Arapahoe High School attacker (December 13, 2013) – Shotgun

the D.C. Navy Yard attacker (September 16, 2013) – Shotgun

the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012) – AR-15-style rifle

Gabby Giffords’s attacker (January 8, 2011) – Glock handgun

the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009) – Handgun

the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) – Glock Handgun

Out of those 20 high-profile public attacks, AR-15-style rifles were used five times. You could stretch that figure to six by including the AK-47-style rifle used in the Chattanooga attack, but there is still no way to make the argument that AR-15-style rifles were “used in a disproportionate share of the mass killings.” That designation clearly goes to handguns, which are much more concealable and therefore much easier to carry into crowded locations for an attack.

It is interesting to note that the 4th Circuit’s ruling comes in the wake of a “white paper” in which ATF Associate Deputy Director Ronald Turk argued against ongoing importation bans on “assault weapons.” Turk argued on the grounds that such weapons are increasingly popular for sport shooting and are actually “standard for hunting activities.” The Washington Post published the paper in which Turk said continued opposition to the weapons is based on an “almost 20-year-old study.”

But the 4th Circuit described the sporting and hunting rifles as “exceptionally lethal weapons of war.”

Bill Nelson (D-FL) indicated that the he wants to ban over 200 different rifles in response to last week’s Florida school shooting.

The Florida school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, used an AR-15, so Nelson wants to ban semiautomatic Kalashnikov’s too.

Nelson stood during the town hall and said:

The bill that I have co-sponsored defines very specifically “assault rifle.” It lists 200 different “assault rifles.” It lists, for example, the Kalashnikov AK-47 that, did you know, is manufactured in [Florida]. Did you know that the state of Florida, the Governor’s office, gave financial incentives for them to come into the state and manufacture?

He continued:

I’ll tell you another [gun] that is listed in that list of over 200 rifles. It is the Sig Sauer MCX. That is the one that Omar Mateen, despite the fact that he had been on the terrorist watch list and was off, went into a gun shop and purchased that high powered “assault rifle.” And on that list it also includes the AR-15. And did you know, that the state of Florida, the Governor’s office, gave financial incentives for the Colt company to come to [Florida] to manufacture AR-15s.

Notice Nelson’s quiet admission that Omar Mateen was not on a terrorist watch list when he bought his rifle at a gun shop. In other words, Mateen legally purchased his rifle, but Nelson is trying to build momentum for terror watch list gun control instead of admitting that background checks are impotent to stop determined attackers.

Breitbart News reported that Sen. Nelson took time on February 15 and 16 to claim the AR-15 is “not for hunting” but for killing. Because of this, he intimated that AR-15 does not enjoy Second Amendment protections.

But ATF Associate Deputy Director Ronald Turk says the AR-15 is “now the standard for hunting activities.” In fact, Turk says the use of AR-15s for hunting is so widespread that the ATF should revisit previous studies on the gun and amend them.

On January 20, 2017, the Washington Post published a “White Paper” wherein Turk wrote:

The use of AR-15s, AK-style, and similar rifles now commonly referred to as “modern sporting rifles” has increased exponentially in sport shooting. These firearm types are now standard for hunting activities. ATF could re-examine its 20-year-old study to bring it up to date with the sport shooting landscape of today, which is vastly different than it was years ago.

Nelson seeks to ban over 200 rifles due to the criminal misuse of one rifle, an AR-15, on February 14. Along the way he makes claims about the AR-15 that are demonstrably false.

breitbart28,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-06-12 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/12/ar-15-users-guide-ignorant-media-pundits/,"Every time someone who passed a background check uses an AR-15 to open fire in a gun-free zone, ignorant media pundits and their ready surrogates in Hollywood and D.C. talk about the need to ban automatic weapons.

But the AR-15 is not an automatic weapon — it is a semi-automatic weapon. In other words, it does not shoot multiple rounds each time the trigger is pulled. Rather, it fires one. That’s right — one round per trigger pull. But this seems to be lost on a growing number of outlets, celebrities, and politicians. So, Breitbart News thought it best to present this handy AR-15 users guide for those who simply don’t get it.

The AR-15 is a rifle that shoots .223 and/or 5.56 rounds. Americans love it because it is reliable, accurate, and numerous accessories are available for it. Those accessories range from lights to special grips, stocks, optics, sight packages, and beyond. Because of this, the AR-15 has become the Colt 1911 of rifles. Like the 1911, you can always buy the part you need to make it better or repair it in the event that something breaks.

The gun is great for women as well as men — for petite-framed people as well as large — because the stock absorbs the recoil. So even though the rifle shoots a .223 or 5.56, it does so with less recoil than a .410 shotgun and just slightly more than a .22 rifle.

The gun shoots one round every time the trigger is pulled — period. Yet following the terror attack on Pulse nightclub in Orlando, UK’s The Telegraph described the rifle as “controversial” and claimed that it “[allows] a rogue gunmen [sic] to kill dozens of people in a matter of seconds.” What The Telegraph is alluding to is the spray-and-pray tactic of shooting whereby a gunman simply squeezes the trigger repeatedly, rattling off as many rounds as he can, hoping some of them find their target. Although such an approach to shooting appears to be wildly popular with gun control advocates — many of whom may have never shot a gun — it is not an accurate or efficient way to shoot an AR-15. It is not reality.

Knowing the rifle — the same way a concealed carry permit holder knows his or her handgun — is crucial, and this is because shot placement is crucial. Perhaps this would not be so if shooting an AR-15 were the kind of thing leftists depict in their movies, where “assault weapons” often fire fully automatic, and the ammunition magazine appears to be limitless. But in the real world, every shot has to count.

Regardless of these things, some of the early reports on the Pulse Orlando nightclub shooting included references to an automatic weapon. Many of those references disappeared as the day went on, but they were there nonetheless.

Additionally, celebrities like Seth McFarlene tweeted things like: “These shootings are a regular occurrence. You don’t get to be “shocked” anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons.”

These shootings are a regular occurrence. You don't get to be ""shocked"" anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons. — Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016

And during the June 12 airing of Meet the Press, Bernie Sanders said, “We should not be selling automatic weapons.”

Sanders’s statement is nothing new for Democratic office holders. Breitbart News previously reported Hillary Clinton’s penchant for referring to AR-15s as “automatic weapons.”

So far, Clinton, Sanders, McFarlene, The Telegraph, and so many other outlets that don’t know any better, let’s say it together — an AR-15 is not an automatic weapon. It is a semi-automatic rifle that Americans own for target shooting, hunting, and self-defense.

The AR-15 was donated by Black Rain Ordinance Inc., and tickets cost $5 apiece.

The Kansas City Star reports that team coach Levi Patterson has received numerous harsh and negative messages since launching the raffle, but noticed that ticket purchases increased with the vitriol. Negative posts on Facebook convinced people as far away as Colorado to buy tickets in order to fund the Missouri team.

One of the negative messages was posted to Patterson’s Facebook page by someone going by the name Dan Weaver after the Florida school shooting. Weaver wrote, “Are you all tone deaf? AR-15 kills seventeen so you raffle a gun for child sports? Lord, people wake the hell up. Justify all you want but you are wrong, period.”

Others complained that children were being forced to sell raffle tickets for a “killing machine.”

Patterson responded to the naysayers, writing, “We appreciate your ‘concern’ but please understand, we are not, have not, and will not force one of our boys to sell raffle tickets for the Black Rain AR15 Spec 15, if they are uncomfortable doing so.”

The raffle was planned before the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last week, and normal background check procedures will still apply for the prize winner.

The winner of the rifle will be announced March 17.

The California DOJ was forced to turn over documentation related to the changes because of public records request that the Firearms Policy Coalition and the California Rifle and Pistol Association made.

Guns.com obtained and then published the regulatory changes, which include a revamped online registration system to allow Californians to register their “assault weapons” prior to January 1, 2018, when California’s latest “assault weapons” ban takes effect. The Firearms Policy Coalition reports this ban requires registration of all “assault weapons” outfitted with “bullet buttons” for magazine release.

The catch is that the online “assault weapons” registration site notifies people in bold blue letters:

The ability to register an Assault Weapon pursuant to Assembly Bill (AB) 1135 and Senate Bill (SB) 880, is not yet available. Pursuant to AB 1135 and SB 880, Assault Weapon registration regulations must be effective before any registrations can take place. At this time, the regulations are still pending, however they should be effective in the very near future.

But once the online system is working, residents registering their weapons online will have “to upload four clear digital photos of the firearm including of the magazine release, of each side of the receiver and of the barrel.” People registering homemade firearms “will have to send in photos of the now-mandated DOJ-supplied serial number after it has been permanently applied to the gun.” In both cases, the fee for registration will be $15.

This confusing and ever-changing maze of gun control regulations is a testimony to the train wreck that results when gun control is passed for the sake of gun control, when an honest pursuit of safety is exchanged for an equally honest war on the Second Amendment.

The 60 pages of regulatory changes can be viewed here.

A similar approach, Operation Choke Point, was used by the Department of Justice during Barack Obama’s second term in office and has been targeted for closure under the Trump administration.

On August 17, 2017, Politico quoted House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlette describing Operation Choke Point as “a misguided initiative.” Goodlette observed, “Law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor.”

But NYT says banks and credit card companies could continue such policies by simply banding together against certain aspects of the firearms industry.

NYT reports: “PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.”

They floated this possibility:

Visa, which published a 71-page paper in 2016 espousing its “corporate responsibility,” could easily change its terms of service to say that it won’t do business with retailers that sell assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, which make semiautomatic rifles fire faster. (Even the National Rifle Association has said it would support tighter restrictions on bump stocks.)

They continued, “If Mastercard were to do the same, assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system.”

The message is clear–if Senators and House Members stand for the Second Amendment instead of gun control, then circumvent those Senators and House Members via a monolithic approach to banking that omits any financial opportunity related to “assault weapons.”

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and about two dozen other Democrats could mean prison time for anyone who loans an AR-15 rifle to a friend.

She introduced her ban on November 8, just three days after the heinous attack in Texas, marking the umpteenth time she has introduced such a ban since the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School.

As is typical for gun control introduced by Feinstein, her “assault weapons” ban does much more than ban assault weapons. It also bans “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and creates a punitive system whereby AR-15 owners could face prison time for loaning their rifle to a friend. According to the NRA-ILA, owners of “grandfathered” AR-15s would have to seek out a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL) and have their friend undergo a background check in order to legally loan the gun. Data of the transaction would be recorded on the backside of that transaction, thereby contributing to the compilation of a gun owner’s database.

This is the second time in roughly five weeks that Feinstein has pushed an “assault weapons” ban. And she admits that she is introducing it over and over again in the event that a shift in the make-up of the Senate makes it feasible to secure a vote. Until such a shift occurs, she wants her liberal constituents to see her pushing gun control.

The Hill quoted her saying, “We’re introducing an updated Assault Weapons Ban for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.”

It should be noted that the Texas church attacker did not acquire his guns by borrowing them from a friend but by passing background checks.

Think about it–a terrorist ran over eight people, killing them, and wounded another 15, yet Kristof’s response is that it could have been worse were it not for gun control.

Kristof tweeted:

The NYC terrorist had a pellet gun and a paintball gun. Good thing that in NYC he couldn't buy assault rifles, or the toll would be higher. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) October 31, 2017

Keep in mind that Kristof works for the same New York Times that responded to the June 14 Alexandria attack by trying to temper Americans’ desire to be armed to stave off mass public attacks. The NYT editorial board admitted that “all people in that situation, unarmed and under fire, would long to be able to protect themselves and their friends.” But after admitting the desire to be armed for self-defense, they criticized the idea of a society where people are actually armed to protect themselves:

Yet consider the society Americans would have to live in–the choices they would have to make–to enable that kind of defense. Every member of Congress, and every other American of whatever age, would have to go to baseball practice, or to school, or to work, or to the post office, or to the health clinic–or to any other place mass shootings now take place–with a gun on their hip.

These things only demonstrate how out of touch the NYT editorial board and Kristof are. The board fails to understand that millions upon millions of Americans carry a gun for self-defense every day in places where their Second Amendment rights have not been curtailed by Democrat politicians. On the other side of this coin, Kristof fails to note that an Islamist with a paint ball gun can more easily terrify law-abiding citizens in Democrat-run cities where Second Amendment rights are suppressed – cities where citizens cannot shoot back.

Far from making the case for gun control, the threat of Islamic terrorists attacking with vehicles and paintball guns actually makes the case for being armed with a real gun for self-defense.

It is a characteristic of the left to live in the theoretical, rejecting the actual in order to embrace the world as they wish it could be. This knee-jerk reaction leads them to talk about “assault weapons” after a vehicular terror attack. It leads them to criticize people who want to exercise their Second Amendment right to self-defense after being unarmed and vulnerable.

This is the same mindset that drove the Brady Campaign to campaign against campus carry the day after Ohio State students were terrorized by a Somali terrorist who drove into pedestrians, then chased unarmed students with a knife.

As a Pittsburgh Steeler, Harrison expressed his enthusiasm for guns by posing for Men’s Journal with a revolver in one hand and a pistol in the other.

Now, his photographs have moved to more politically-charged weapons. The “assault weapon” photo he posted to Instagram is an AK-47 emblazoned with his jersey number, 92.

Harrison received thousands of likes on the photo, but some Instragram followers took exception. One asked, “This is the musket the founders in mind right? SMH.” Another wrote, “How do I unfollow?”

Photographs of firearms (or hunting expeditions) always draw a number of haters.

On February 24 Axios published a statement from Bank of America:

We are joining other companies in our industry to examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings, and an immediate step we’re taking is to engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.

This statement follows a February 19 New York Times’ column which explained how banks and credit card companies could team up to limit finances for companies manufacturing and/or selling “assault rifles.”

For example, NYT reported that “PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.”

(Even the National Rifle Association has said it would support tighter restrictions on bump stocks.)

The pressure being placed on financial institutions is subsequent to a PR campaign designed force other companies to cut ties with NRA. On February 24 Breitbart News reported that over a dozen companies have severed relations with the NRA, discontinuing discounts for the NRA’s 5 million members.

SeattlePI reports that Ferguson is also seeking a 10-day waiting period for permitted “assault weapon” purchasers and enhanced background checks to acquire the rifles.

Gun control proponents seek to justify their gun control campaigns by pointing to high-profile crimes in which AR-15s or AK-47s were used. Yet ironically, a close examination of one of the most heinous attacks–that one on Orlando Pulse–reveals that the gunman complied with the very gun controls being pushed in Washington state.

Omar Mateen went through an enhanced background check, inasmuch as he was vetted and acquired a Florida state license to carry a gun as a “security officer.” Moreover, he passed a regular background check when acquiring his rifle and a 3-day waiting period for his handgun. He then opened fire on unarmed civilians in the nightclub.

Why should law-abiding citizens be punished for the crimes committed by Mateen?

And why should we be expected to overlook the danger those civilians faced by being trapped, unarmed, in a gun-free zone to begin with? After all, it was the gun-free zone that gave Adam Lanza over nine minutes without armed resistance as he plied his heinous trade on December 14, 2012.

Nevertheless, the Daily Herald reports that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) supports Ferguson’s gun control desires, which also include “stricter storage rules” that could result in punishment if someone obtains a gun owner’s weapons and “[causes] injury or death.”

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to add her “assault weapons” ban to the overarching school safety bill during a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday.

Feinstein’s bill, which is an enhanced reintroduction of a bill she has put forward again and again, bans over 200 different firearms.

During Wednesday’s White House meeting, Trump showed support for the gun control pushed by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). The Manchin/Toomey bill is a gun control bill that the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected on April 17, 2013. But Trump chalked that failure up to Barack Obama’s lack of leadership, and talked of using the Manchin/Toomey bill as a base to which other bills could be added.

The goal was to create a body of gun legislation, ubiquitously for the purposes of school safety.

Sen. Feinstein talked about her bill and described the AR-15 as one of “the latest and newest weapons” to hit our streets. However, Eugene Stoner designed the AR-15 in the 1950s and Armalite began producing the gun during the 1960s. Are weapons from 60 years ago now considered “latest and newest”?

Nonetheless, Trump listened to Feinstein, heard from a few more gun control proponents—including Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL)—then looked back at Feinstein and told her she should add her bill to the Manchin/Toomey bill for consideration.

His criticism came during a visit to a company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to tout the benefits of his tax cut plan.

He noted that while he cited the lowest unemployment numbers for black and Hispanic Americans in history, Democrats refused to react positively.

“Dead silence. There was not a smile,” he said. “That means they would rather see Trump do badly than our country do well. That’s what it means. It’s very selfish.”

Trump said that during his address, he stopped watching the Democrats because it was “bad energy” for his speech.

“They were like death – and un-American,” Trump said.

He also said someone called their behavior “treasonous.”

As the crowd applauded, Trump continued. “Can we call that treason? Why not?” he asked. “I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.”

The president also ridiculed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for calling his tax cut “crumbs.”

“Well, she’s a rich woman who lives in a big beautiful house in California, who wants to give all your money away,” Trump said.

Trump compared Pelosi’s comment to Hillary Clinton’s description of his supporters as “deplorable.”

“She’s our secret weapon. I just hope they don’t change her!” Trump said. “There are a lot of people that want to run her out. She’s really out there.”"

Harris suggested public safety is her motivation, which is strange when one considers that “assault weapons” are used so infrequently by criminals that the FBI reports nearly three times more people are stabbed to death than are killed with rifles (of any kind) and shotguns combined.

The FBI’s 2015 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) showed the number of people killed with rifles (of any kind) and shotguns in 2015 totaled approximately 548. Nearly three times that many, approximately 1,573, were stabbed or hacked to death.

And do not miss the fact that the number of “assault weapon”-related deaths would have been but a fraction of the 548 total deaths from rifles (of any kind) shotguns combined. Yet Sen. Harris is pushing an “assault weapons” ban for the benefit of public safety.

She tweeted:

It’s long past time we renew the assault weapons ban in this country. It is in the best interest of keeping all of us safe. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 10, 2017

The United States had a federal “assault weapons” ban from 1994 to 2004 without any noticeable impact on crime. Moreover, it is evident that most Democrats who call for the reimplementation of such a ban do not realize that the ban did not even ban “assault weapons.” Rather, it banned “assault weapons” with certain cosmetic features–i.e., it was all a ruse; another example of the Democrats claiming they did that which they did not do.

Even the New York Times detected this and ran a column explaining that the very term “assault weapons” is a myth the Democrats created in the 1990s.

According to the NYT, the United States was “suffering from a spike in gun crime…in the early 1990s” so “Democrats created and banned [an entire] category of guns.” The ban lasted from 1994 to 2004 and although crime fell during that time, a “detailed study found no proof” the decline was due to the ban.

Despite wearing protective gear, the shots struck the officer. He was rushed to Central Texas Medical Center where he died from his wounds.

A statement from the San Marcos police department reports that the as yet unidentified suspect has also been shot. Police have not yet disclosed the condition of the suspect.

The suspect is said to be in an Austin-area hospital. It is not known at this time if the suspect’s wounds are self-inflicted or if other officers shot him while returning fire.

A Hays County SWAT team assisted the San Marcos Police Department during the standoff with the suspect, officials stated.

Katie Hall, an Austin American-Statesman reporter tweeted a message reporting that Officer Copeland was supposed to be off work today but was called in to serve the warrant.

The City of San Marcos shared the following message on its Facebook page:

Governor Greg Abbott responded to the death of the officer through the following statement:

Today we grieve for the family of the fallen San Marcos police officer, and we vow swift justice for the killer. The men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line every day to protect and to serve our communities, and we will never forget their sacrifices. Cecilia and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the officer’s family and to the entire San Marcos Police Department.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also released a statement:

Along with everyone learning of a San Marcos police officer’s murder today, I am deeply troubled and saddened. Officers around our state courageously serve and deserve our utmost honor and respect, especially during this time. Please join Angela and me as we pray for the officer’s family, the people of San Marcos, and for our law enforcement officers around the state.

Officer Copeland reportedly leaves behind a grieving widow and four children. He is also a former Coast Guard veteran, according to the San Marcos city manager who spoke at a press conference on Monday evening.

This is a developing story and will be updated with further information as it becomes available.

Officer Copeland is the first San Marcos police officer to be killed in the line of duty. He is the 119th law enforcement official to be killed in the line of duty this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page."

KSAT’s Erica Hernandez said she arrived at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs to see “emergency personnel” surrounding the church. She arrived before law enforcement had the opportunity to put up crime scene tape.

Hernandez said she went across the street where neighbors were gathered and they told her the gunman shot outside the church then went inside and opened fire as well. She said, “First, [he] started shooting from outside the church, and then went inside the church. They said he may have dropped anywhere from three to eight clips as he was firing. He had a lot of ammo on him, he had a mask and he was in full gear.”

Hernandez said church neighbors “were running for cover” because the gunman was firing at people who were watching him. She said an unidentified church neighbor “returned fire” and that is when “[the gunman] got back into his vehicle and left the scene.”

Hernandez works for KSAT and said she happened to be in Sutherland Springs when the attack happened because she had come “to visit family for breakfast.”

breitbart42,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-08-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/21/gun-controlled-chicago-least-63-shot-eight-killed-weekend/,"At least 63 individuals were shot and eight were killed over the weekend in gun-controlled Chicago.

According to the Chicago Tribune, over half the shootings occurred within “13 hours from Saturday to early Sunday.” This was followed by the shooting of 16 people during the day on Sunday, and three of the victims were shot on the same street—South Austin.

The weekend violence brings gun-controlled Chicago’s homicides to 451 for the year, which is only 16 homicides short of where Chicago was this time last year. Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 800 homicides and roughly 4,400 total shooting victims.

The weekend violence also makes August 18-20 second only to the Fourth of July weekend for bloodshed and mayhem this year. Breitbart News reported more than 100 people were shot over the Fourth of July weekend and the Chicago Sun-Times reported that 36 of those victims “[were] shot across the city in an 8-hour span of violence between 8 p.m. Tuesday and 4 a.m. Wednesday.” Six of the victims shot during that eight-hour span lost their lives.

To date, Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s (D) response to the violence and death has been to push for more gun control and to fight concealed carry for law-abiding citizens. On April 25, 2017, the Washington Times reported that Emanuel was pushing more regulations for Federal Firearm License holders (FFLs). These FFLs are gun store owners or operators who go through a lengthy background check process to acquire a license from the federal government allowing them to sell guns. In turn, they are required to conduct a background check on every gun they sell. By targeting them, Emanuel makes it appear that criminals are walking into brick and mortar gun stores to buy their weapons.

Amid Chicago’s gun crime epidemic, Emanuel is also fighting against national reciprocity for concealed carry. Although national reciprocity would allow law-abiding citizens to be armed for self-defense in more places, Emanuel opposes it because he worries it would erode local gun controls.

But as of January 4, a total of 54 people had already been shot in Chicago during the new year.

Moreover, on January 3 — just three days into the new year — 12 people were shot in 13 hours in gun-controlled Chicago.

According to the Chicago Tribune, there were 54 shooting victims between January 1, 2017, through January 4, 2017. Of those, seven were shot fatally.

Two of those fatalities occurred around noon Tuesday when the Tribune reports that 16-year-old Malik McNeese and a 17-year-old Stevie Jefferson were shot and killed. Both boys were on a sidewalk “in the 3400 block of West Fulton Boulevard” when a “black SUV” rolled up and someone in the vehicle opened fire. A 65-year-old woman was also struck by the gunfire too, but she is expected to survive.

Twenty-three-year-old Simmison McGruder was also shot to death on Tuesday. He was “in the 3200 block of West Lexington Street, just down the street from the Harrison District police station” when he was killed shortly after 11 pm.

During the January 3 airing of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence’s (CSGV) Joshua Horowitz refused to admit that the carnage and bloodshed in Chicago prove the failure of gun control. Instead, he said of CSGV, “We really believe the evidence is showing that, in fact, a group of gun violence prevention laws, in fact, do lower the homicide rate.”

Police arrested Brandy Lerma, 31, of Boynton Beach, Saturday on charges of child neglect and driving under the influence, WPLG reported.

Authorities stopped Lerma around 4:15 p.m. as she was driving south on Haverhill Road, according to a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s report.

Another driver placed a 911 call to report Lerma and followed her until deputies could intervene.

Deputies discovered Lerma in the driver’s seat with a toddler standing up without a seat belt on in the backseat.

The arresting deputy noted in his arrest report that Lerma’s breath smelled of alcohol, her hair “was a mess,” her “right bra strap was hanging out from under her sleeve,” and she appeared to be “disheveled and dirty.”

“The driver was unable to walk or stand without assistance,” the report said. “The driver fell to the ground twice during the roadside tasks.”

Lerna told officers that she mixed two shots of Fireball whisky with Percocet and Xanax.

Police described Lerna’s attitude during the arrest as “vulgar, defiant, combative, and uncooperative.”

She was released from jail the following day on $3,000 bail.

Other alleged drunk drivers have had some interesting mug shots, as well.

A Connecticut man accused of drunk driving wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “Hold My Beer and Watch This” in his mug shot in April. A Pennsylvania man suspected of DUI wore a shirt that read “Drunk Lives Matter” in his mug shot in March."

Steve Scalise (R-LA) has been shot, according to multiple reports. Follow Breitbart News for live updates on the developing situation.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS:

• A man shot at several dozen Republican members of Congress during a baseball practice Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia

• Rep. Steve Scalise (R-AL) was shot in the hip but is now stable and undergoing surgery for his wound

• Because Scalise is House Majority Whip, Capitol Hill Police officers were already present and engaged the gunman for several minutes

• The suspect — James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois — was taken into custody and has died from his wounds

• Five individuals total were shot by the assailant: Scalise, two police officers, a lobbyist and a congressional staffer

• Wounded staffer works for Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX). An early report incorrectly said that Williams himself was shot

• Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) told a reporter the shooter “was there to kill as many Republican members as possible.”

• Hodgkinson’s apparent social media pages reveal intense hatred for President Trump and Republicans

breitbart46,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-27 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/27/police-carjacker-shot-killed-concealed-carry-permit-holder/,"The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) reports that a concealed carry permit holder shot and killed an armed alleged carjacker around 5:50 a.m. Monday morning.

The incident occurred near the Milwaukee Machine Tool Corporation

According to Fox 6, police indicated the suspect, “identified as 21-year-old Carlos Martin, was shot and killed when he attempted to rob a man, 24.”

MPD Captain Andra Williams noted that carjackings and automobile thefts are “out of hand,” and he hopes Martin’s death might lead others to rethink their behavior.

Williams said, “This is the worst thing that could possibly happen to someone. This should be a wake-up call to everyone in the community that this is not a game. This is very serious.”

Alderman Cavalier Johnson represents the neighborhood in which the failed carjacking occurred. Fox News quoted Johnson saying, “That young man didn’t have to die today. He didn’t have to lose his life, but he made a bad decision and he did.”

He added, “This isn’t a game. This isn’t live-action ‘Grand Theft Auto.’ You don’t respawn after you’re dead.”

On January 12, 2017, the New York Times editorial board wrote against expanding the opportunities for citizens to be armed for self-defense. The paper claimed, “The grim truth is that concealed-carry permit holders are rarely involved in stopping crime.”

The Chicago Tribune reports that the deadly Saturday shooting occurred just “half a block north of Mount Sinai Hospital.” The victim was shot in the head and back. A 19-year-old was also shot and wounded in the incident.

In the shootings that followed, gunmen opened fire on individuals and groups alike. A single gunman opened fire on a pedestrian while driving down the road while families gathered on 31st Street Beach were targeted by others.

Throughout the violent 18 hours, witnesses reported hearing rapid fire gun shots in different areas. Some of the victims were as young at 14 years of age.

This latest run of gun violence comes just months after Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 4,400 shooting victims and nearly 800 homicides. And the first two months of 2017 saw increases in the number of shootings and fatalities over the same time period in 2016. In fact, the Tribune reported that 513 people were shot January 1 through February 27 alone, which was an increase of 37 victims over the 466 who were shot during the same time period in 2016.

The number of homicides January 1 through February 27 was 103, an increase of two victims over the 101 who were murdered during the same time period in 2016.

On January 28 Breitbart News reported an Independent Police Review Authority video that captured the sounds of gun-controlled Chicago during a shootout with a suspected murderer. The sounds are those of a war zone.

Concealed Nation reports that the patrons were all off-duty police who were in the store shopping.

Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) from LiveLeak shows four individuals in plain clothes standing in line to check out when a door opens and the would-be robber enters the business with his gun drawn.

The robber is shot immediately by one of the off-duty officers who is off-camera at first, then comes into the picture when the robber goes down. The other men all draw their guns as well, some pointing at the robber and others walking toward the door to be sure accomplices are not on their way in:

The condition of the would-be robber is unknown, but he did not appear to move after falling to the ground.

The failed robbery was caught by a CCTV camera in another location inside the store. This second angle lets the viewer see the officer who fired the initial rounds at the suspect:

Police shot one of two suspects. The second is in custody.

UPDATE 7:05 p.m.: Police Chief William McManus told reporters Thursday evening that one of his wounded officers is in grave condition not expected to survive, FOX29 reported. The other officer sustained handgun wound to the chin as he stepped out of his car to talk to a pedestrian. He is expected to recover from his wound but is still listed in critical condition. All San Antonio outlets are now reporting the suspect died from his wounds after he was shot by police officers.

McManus said the officer who sustained the wound to his face is in “grave, grave, condition,” and is not expected to survive. He told reporters, “He’s being sustained by the doctors and nurses right now,” the San Antonio Express reported.

UPDATE 5:47 p.m.: Some outlets in San Antonio initially reported that one of the suspects had been killed by police. They have now updated that information to report the wounded suspect is in grave condition at University Hospital, KSAT reports. Medical officials list the two officers as: one in grave condition, the other in critical condition.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott Tweeted, “Our prayers are with these 2 San Antonio police officers in critical condition after shooting.”

Our thoughts and prayers are with the two SAPD officers who were shot today in downtown San Antonio. https://t.co/ThyDKosPpt #txlege — Dan Patrick (@DanPatrick) June 29, 2017

UPDATE 5:18 p.m.: A witness filmed the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The video shows one officer who has just dragged his partner out of the line of fire. The image of the officer is blurred. Fox29 San Antonio posted the video on their website.

A Tweet from Fox4 reporter/anchor Randy Beamer reveals an image of the surviving suspect in custody.

ORIGINAL STORY CONTINUES:

“It happened so fast, one was down, one was in custody immediately. There was no further danger,” Chief William McManus told reporters. “It’s not a good feeling to know two officers were shot during active patrol.”

The two officers attempted to make contact with two people on the street near San Antonio College, the San Antonio Express-News reported. As the officers stepped out of their vehicle, one of the suspects pulled a weapon and began firing. He struck one officer in the face. The other officer received a shot in the stomach area, the chief reported. That officer pulled the other wounded officer to a safe area.

McManus report that both officers are in “very critical” condition at a local hospital. He said the officers were working “directed patrol” in the area to help reduce crime.

Police shot one of the suspects. The second person is in custody. No motive for the shooting is known at this time.

McManus said both officers are seven-year veterans, KSAT reported.

Both suspects are reported to be in their late 20s to early 30s, the chief described. He said he had no other information on the suspects or their motives at this time.

San Antonio College is reported to be on lockdown at this time as a precautionary measure.

One witness told the San Antonio newspaper he witnessed one officer attempting to resuscitate another officer.

The chief told reporters the incident “is over.” He said one suspect is dead and the other is in custody at the department’s homicide division offices.

In November 2016, a San Antonio police detective was shot and killed while he was working uniformed patrol duty. Breitbart Texas reported. The following day, police arrested Otis Tyrone McKane and charged him with murdering Detective Benjamin Marconi. When asked by reporters why he shot the detective, McKane responded, “I was upset.”

This is a developing story. More information will be added as soon as it is available.

breitbart50,breitbart,['Charlie Nash'],2018-02-27 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/02/27/google-appears-to-remove-all-shopping-search-results-for-guns-even-water-guns-guns-and-roses-burgundy/,"Update: As of late Tuesday afternoon, Google has restored many of the Google Shopping search results discussed in this article, such as water guns. Certain search terms like “AR-15” and “revolver” still display no results. The original article follows.

Google has removed search results for any product that contains the word “gun” in it, including water guns, toy guns, the band “Guns and Roses,” and even “burgundy” from its shopping section.

Google has removed results in its shopping tool for a wide range of terms related to firearms, unwittingly censoring completely unrelated items such as music groups and movies whose titles matched filtered terms.

Google Shopping allows users to search for products from a wide range of online shopping sites to compare prices and offerings. The Internet giant has removed search results for a wide variety of terms, which was discovered by social media users this week.

Searches for “gun,” “guns,” “pistol,” “pistols,” “AR-15,” “rifle,” and “revolver,” in the shopping section of Google’s search engine will now fail to return any results, while other searches which have nothing to do with firearms but include the keywords similarly provide no results, including “toy guns,” “water guns,” “glue gun,” “Guns and Roses,” “Gundam,” “Top Gun,” “Naked Gun,” the Man With the Golden Gun,” “Shogun,” “Sex Pistols,” and even “burgundy.”

The fact that words including “gun” as part of the title have led many to suspect Google is running a filter specifically to remove any search result including those letters, as opposed to filtering by product category or vendor.

Google shopping now blocks all search queries with the English word ""gun"" in it, which can be something of an issue as you can imagine. pic.twitter.com/NL4V00y079 — Best Mom Eva (@mombot) February 27, 2018

Example 3:

If you're a music lover and wanted to buy merchandise related to the musical band ""Guns and Roses,"" too bad. Google's shopping tab will tell you nothing is available. pic.twitter.com/pPelmGUbFQ — Nick Monroe (@nickmon1112) February 27, 2018

How long has Google been censoring shopping results for the search term, “gun?” https://t.co/WZflX3wmmh — Mark Kern (@Grummz) February 27, 2018

Searches for “flamethrower,” “knives,” “machete,” “arsenic,” “bombs,” “ammo,” and various gun parts are still returned, however.

So yeah. Google is fine with all sorts of things that'll likely get you on a federal watch list, but video games with the word ""gun"" in them are a no-no. pic.twitter.com/qP2rSUK62l — Nick Monroe (@nickmon1112) February 27, 2018

Search engine Bing has also removed search results for “pistol” and “rifle,” but does not censor other products with the word “gun” in them.

Google Shopping was the focus of an EU antitrust case against Google that resulted in a record $2.7 billion fine against the company.

Breitbart Tech reached out to Google for comment, but has not received a response.

Update — After this story published, Google replied to Breitbart Tech this this statement:

We are experiencing an error in our Shopping results and we are working to address this issue. We have not changed our policy on the promotion of guns, gun parts or gun components.

The spokesperson also provided a link to the policy, which can be read here."

And, frankly, not to have due process would be wrong.”

Esty said that the “real proof” of President Trump’s commitment to gun legislation will be “does he line up, does he lean in, and push to make this happen?” She added that she supports the president trying to ban bump stocks, but thinks the move will have to go through Congress.

After hearing a clip of President Trump’s statement in favor of taking guns from dangerous people and then going through due process, Esty stated, “Well the fact is, you do need to have due process. I’m one of the co-authors of a bill we’ve just introduced that would have one of these gun violence restraining orders, GVROs, that, in extreme cases, like in Florida, would empower local officials to actually remove weapons before anybody hurts somebody. Well, that’s really important. They don’t have that law in Florida. Every state should have that law. But you’ve got to have due process. And, frankly, not to have due process would be wrong. And you’re certainly going to run into a buzzsaw of all kinds of people if you don’t do that.”

breitbart52,breitbart,['Jerome Hudson'],2018-03-01 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/03/01/will-these-pro-gun-control-celebrities-make-another-film/,"Last week, actress and star of NBC’s The Black List Megan Boone tweeted that her character on the popular crime drama would “never carry an assault rifle again.” The tweet — which was in response to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that saw Nikolas Cruz kill 17 people with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle — posed a glaring question.

Will other pro-gun control Hollywood actors and directors who’ve used firearms in films for years pledge to lay down their guns in future films?

It’s a question that could be asked of the likes of legendary director Steven Spielberg, whose has written, directed, or produced dozens of movies and TV series that have featured the use of guns.

George Clooney pledged to give $500,000 to a gun control march but his career is littered with film roles (at lease a dozen) in which his characters wielded a gun. Will he now pledged to leave guns out of his future projects?

The same question can be asked of actors Jim Carrey, Mark Ruffalo, and Matt Damon, who have all portrayed gun-wielding characters in popular movies but have also advocated for the enactment of more gun laws — reforms that will invariably make it harder for law-abiding citizens to purchase or sell firearms.

Below is a list of Hollywood stars and preeminent filmmakers who used guns on screen while calling for more gun control.

Jim Carrey

Jim Carrey has spent years making films with characters using guns. But in 2013, Carrey called defenders of the Second Amendment “heartless motherfuckers.” Recently, he has pushed for gun control by sharing original artwork with his 17 million Twitter followers.

George Clooney

George Clooney has starred in at least 10 films, from The Peacemaker to Ocean’s Eleven to Monuments Men, that saw his character use a gun. But the veteran star is now a vocal advocate for gun control, donating $500,000 to the upcoming student march for gun control, March for Our Lives.

Jennifer Lawrence

Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence has starred in several films featuring her character using firearms — including Winter’s Bone, X-Men: Days of Future Past, and Joy — but has praised the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student pushing for gun control and said gun violence in America has nothing to do with the entertainment industry.

Samuel L. Jackson

Samuel L. Jackson has spent 30 years wielding guns onscreen in more than 35 films. While the Avengers star has long-advocated for the Second Amendment, he called President Donald Trump a “muthefucka” and mocked his proposal to arm teachers; a proposal that nearly half the country believes is a good idea.

Emma Stone

Emma Stone was among the many celebrities urging Americans to “reject the NRA” in the wake of the Las Vegas mass shooting last October.

Steven Spielberg

Director Steven Spielberg has written, directed, or produced more than 60 movies and TV series that have featured the use of guns. But Spielberg, following George Clooney’s lead, is now among the many stars to donate $500,000 to the upcoming student march for gun control, March for Our Lives.

Matt Damon

Matt Damon may be best known around the world for his iconic role as gun-wielding CIA agent Jason Bourne but the star has spent years railing against Americans’ right to own guns. Damon praised Australia’s gun ban in 2016 for how it was implemented in “one fell swoop” and said, “I wish that could happen in my country, but it’s such a personal issue for people that we cannot talk about it sensibly.”

Jessica Chastain

Actress Jessica Chastain’s 2016 gun control film Miss Sloane bombed at the box office but that didn’t stop her from tweeting last October in a now-deleted tweet, “Welcome to America where you’ll wait 6 months for an X-Ray but hey, you can buy an AR-15 in 5 minutes flat.”

Elizabeth Banks

Actress Elizabeth Banks called for gun control in December 2015 after the deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The Pitch Perfect star tweeted after last year’s Las Vegas mass shooting: “It would be wise to ban assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and silencers. None of which is excessive.”

Alec Baldwin

Actor Alec Baldwin called for a national registry of all gun owners in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting. “You are more likely to use a car or emergency vehicle in saving a life. We license/register those cars and their drivers. More likely to need a prescription. We license those who distribute such drugs. We license doctors. Electricians. Lawyers. It’s time to register all guns,” Baldwin wrote on Twitter.

Lady Gaga

Pop superstar Lady Gaga said after last year’s deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas Lady Gaga that “blood is on the hands of” Congress and President Donald Trump if they don’t unite and enact gun control legislation. She pushed gun control again after the Parkland, Florida, shooting.

Amy Schumer

Amy Schumer urged her 6.5 million Instagram followers to vote NRA-funded Congressman out of office, after the Parkland, Florida, shooting. She also asked her fans to donate to the Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety in lieu of wedding gifts.

Alyssa Milano

Allyssa Milano is one of Hollywood’s most pro-gun control advocates. The Charmed star called for “Sensible gun control NOW” after last year’s Vegas mass shooting and currently pushing an effort for to force Amazon to drop the National Rifle Association’s online video channel from its streaming service.

Michael Keaton

Michael Keaton has been pushing for gun control for years. The Batman actor signed a letter in 2016 intended to urge Congress to vote on former President Barack Obama’s gun control proposal. Earlier this month, Keaton called Republicans and National Rifle Association members “weak, disgusting cowards.”

Julianne Moore

Julianne Moore said in 2016 that gun control “is not a Second Amendment issue! It does not deserve to be hotly debated as such! It is a safety issue!” In October, Moore said she believes there should be “limitations on the amount of firearms you can own” and urged her fans to joined the upcoming march for gun control.

Don Cheadle

Don Cheadle is a gun owner and has starred in films wielding guns since the 80s but has spent years pushing for more gun control laws. The Avengers star was among the litany of celebrities to join gun control group Everytown’s 2015 push for more gun laws.

Sharon Stone

Actress Sharon Stone called Parkland, Florida, student activist for gun control Emma Gonzalez a “hero” and called for #GunReformNow.

Mark Ruffalo

Mark Ruffalo joined celebrities calling for gun control by mocking those praying for the victims after the deadly Parkland, Florida, shooting tweeting, “Prayers without accordant action are silent lies told to oneself, heard by no God, amounting to nothing. Action is the language of truth, the prayers of the Saints.”

Jeffrey Wright

Actor Jeffrey Wright has been a very vocal supporter of gun control, tweeting last week: “Start to talk abolishing the 2nd amendment entirely, then maybe the gun fetishizers will want to compromise.” He called for more gun control mere hours after the Parkland, Florida shooting.

Ron Perlman

Actor Ron Perlman is both vocal and vile in his support for gun control. The Sons of Anarchy star tweeted and mocked those praying for the victims of last year’s Vegas mass shooting, , “We are rushing to our own funerals. We are eager to blow ourselves up. We are doing all this to ourselves. Think and pray on that!” While Perlman is calling for more gun control almost daily in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting, he’s used guns on screen for years.

Debra Messing

An outspoken supporter of gun control, Debra Messing has joined celebrities calling for a March 1 boycott of the NRA, writing on Twitter: “Since Parkland, 20 corporations have severed their ties to the NRA. @Amazon, @Apple, and @FedEx have not. This Thursday, join us in a nationwide, 24 hour #March1NRABoycott of all three. Don’t shop, don’t stream, don’t ship.”

Kevin Bacon

Veteran actor Kevin Bacon has taken to social media and urged his hundreds of thousands of followers to vote out any congressional lawmaker “beholden to the gun lobby.”

Sally Field

Iconic actress Sally Field took to Twitter and said, “The NRA and the GOP is complicit in every one of these horrifying shootings. They are holding this nation hostage.”

Actor and activist John Leguizamo has taken to social media of late applauding companies like Bravo for boycotting the NRA and calling for #SensibleGunReformNOW.

Martin Sheen

The veteran actor called the NRA a “Bullying organization” in and said the Kennedy administration would “have confronted those bastards and they would have made it real clear that this is not gonna go down.”

Tom Arnold

Always vocal about politics, actor Tom Arnold has-longed urged gun control and has ramped up his push after the Parkland shooting. After the suicide of his nephew in 2016, Arnold wrote that “there are people in this country who consider guns to be living, breathing things. They represent liberty to some people, and the Constitution itself. Some even equate guns to religion. A gift to Americans directly from God himself. That sounds crazy to me. It should be on the gun test: If you truly believe your metal tool/explosive device is a gift from above, then you should be deemed insane and unfit to legally own a gun.”

Jerry Brown (D) signed a bill removing mandatory enhanced sentencing for criminals who use guns in the commission of their crimes.

He did this at the same time that he signed other legislation making it illegal for teachers to be armed on K-12 campuses for self-defense.

Liberal logic–teachers are not allowed to shoot back if under attack and criminals face no mandatory sentence enhancement for using a gun in carrying out an attack.

Assembly Bill 424 made it illegal for teachers to be armed for self-defense and Senate Bill 620 removed the mandatory enhancement for using a gun for crime. SB 620 removed the mandatory enhancement from the Penal Code and placed it at the discretion of the judge presiding over the case.

The ChicoER observed, “So on one hand Brown and the Legislature make it more difficult for a teacher to protect children against gun-wielding criminals, while on the other they reduce potential penalties for gun-wielding criminals.”

Bills like AB 424 and SB 620 were the result of lawmakers scrambling to find any remaining areas where gun bills could be passed. After all, California Democrats passed so many laws in 2016, via Gunpocalypse, that the bills they passed this year served to either extend extant controls or repeal mandatory gun penalties for criminals, as in the case of sentencing guidelines.

Yet as with older gun controls, these new controls only impact law-abiding citizens. We saw proof of this in “the wave of legal purchases” that preceded the implementation of the laws contained in Gunpocalypse. Law-abiding citizens were getting out and buying everything they could while doing so was still legal.

The ChicoER noted such purchases “tell us that new gun laws have their greatest effect on law-abiding shooters, not those bent on criminal or violent misuse. Gang members and other gun criminals, by their nature, don’t make legal purchases. Rather, they acquire weapons and ammo surreptitiously, in ways that don’t leave paper trails of ownership.”

The poll shows that Republicans may be better off focusing on immigration and border security in the midterms to energize the party’s base, as immigration/border security was the top issue for Republican voters (17% compared to 9% for Democrats) while gun control/Second Amendment was the top issue for Democrats (17% compared to 9% for Republicans). The third issue that was most important to voters was taxes. Though House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has derided the tax cuts as “crumbs,” many Americans have been seeing the benefits of the tax cuts in their paychecks.

Not even 1% (.5%) of those surveyed said Russia/election meddling was the top issue even though the media keep hyping it while majorities even believed that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, will continue to do so, and President Donald Trump has not been forceful enough addressing the issue.

Impeaching Trump polls poorly as well, with just 1.4% of those surveyed saying “Oppose/ged rid of/impeach Trump” was their top issue.

The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from February 20-24, and its margin of error is +/- three percentage points.

The poll also found that a huge majority (75%) disapproves of Congress. Forty-eight percent do not view the Democrats favorably while 60% have an unfavorable view of the GOP. In addition, the poll also found that “when it comes to electing House members, 47 percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote for a Democrat, while 32 percent said they would choose a Republican.”"

Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she is a supporter of the Second Amendment because guns helped her father and neighbors protect their families in the South during segregation.

Rice said, “Let me tell you why I’m a defender of the second Amendment. I grew up in Alabama in the late ’50s, early ’60s. There was no way that Bull Connor and the Birmingham police were going to protect you. When knight riders would come through our neighborhood, my father and friends would take their guns and fire in the air if anybody came through. I don’t think they actually hit anybody. But they protected the neighborhood.”

She added, “I’m sure if Bull Connor had known where they were he would have rounded them up. I don’t favor some things like gun registration.”

The year was 1993. I was young, had money burning in my pocket, and my buddy needed cash. And so, for a couple hundred bucks I owned a 9MM handgun, which immediately went under the bed, mostly forgotten, a totem to my spendthrift ways.

Another 15 years would pass before that investment paid off.

When we moved to Los Angeles in 2003, the gun came with me, and I again slipped it under the bed because that is where it had always been. Five more years passed.

I don’t want to say that our Los Angeles neighborhood changed, because I don’t know that for a fact. Maybe our luck changed. All I know is that things went to hell pretty quickly.

I worked out of the house. My wife commuted. It was February, so it was dark when she got home. One night, before she had even taken off her coat, we heard gunshots followed by a car crash. Trust me, only in movies do people confuse a car backfiring with gunshots.

I’ll never forget the conversation with 9-1-1.

“Did you actually see the gunshots or just hear them,” the operator asked?

I told her I had only heard the gunshots.

She hung up on me.

We were on our own.

Suddenly my forgotten handgun became the most important thing in the house.

When the police did show up, we learned that this had happened. Not 20 feet from where my wife had been just a minute earlier, one of our neighbors — who lived just two houses down — was pulling in to park when she was ambushed by her estranged husband. After being shot in the head more than once, she died instantly and her car coasted into another.

My closest neighbor, believing there had been an accident, ran out to help only to have a gun pointed at him. Thankfully, the murderer ran off. But now he was on the loose, and the best guess was that he was desperate, armed, and somewhere close hiding out in the thousands of places available in the jumble of homes on our block.

All night long helicopters patrolled overhead with their spotlights. The most L.A. moment of our 10 years in L.A. happened that night — watching a live helicopter shot of our own house on the local news.

It was an awful night, but one that would have been even more agonizing without an effective way to defend myself and my wife. Three weeks later the police finally captured the guy.

It was sometime after this that my next door neighbor, an LAPD officer who worked in the gang squad, was targeted for retaliation at his home. This hung over us for months.

Then came the full-blown gunfight just up the street that resulted in two cop-shooters on the loose and a shelter-in-place order.

On Easter Sunday, no less, we spent hours sitting on the floor waiting for the all clear — hours that would have been unimaginable without a loaded pistol within reach.

Earlier that same afternoon, my wife and I walked home from church in the very same spot where the gunfight took place and two bystanders were hit.

The last straw came in the form of an armed robbery. My wife was just about to leave when two masked gunmen stormed into her doctor’s office demanding money. They herded my wife and three others into the small copy machine room and made them lie on the floor. My wife felt a gun barrel at the back of her head. Sure she was about to die, she prayed out loud to the Virgin Mary until the gunman told her not to worry.

She found out later that the police had arrived right away but refused to go inside fearing a gang was setting them up for an ambush.

Before another year passed, we returned to our mountain home in North Carolina. The gun is still under the bed, only now it is cleaned regularly, I have practiced with it at the range, and joined the NRA.

What is the moral of this story? Well, there are two. To begin with, over 25 years, I have only needed that gun twice, but at the time I would have given away everything in exchange for one.

Second, the police only show up after someone’s dead.

You must be able to defend yourself and your loved ones.

My reasons for buying a gun might have been irresponsible, but not owning one would have been even more irresponsible.

Finally, my awakening towards the necessity of owning a gun and the vital importance of the Second Amendment and the NRA — things I had given almost no thought to beforehand — had nothing to do with culture, tradition, or politics.

All it took was one harrowing night of having a gun when I needed a gun.

Cicilline (D-RI) and numerous Democrat colleagues in the House are pushing an “assault weapons” ban that would prohibit “high capacity” magazines and 205 different firearms.

The Providence Journal reports that Cicilline’s bill, HR 5087, “would prohibit the sale, transfer, production, and importation of semi-automatic rifles and pistols that have a magazine or can accept a magazine that can hold more than 10 bullets, and any ammunition-feeding device that can hold more than 10 bullets.”

Cicilline’s bill describes an “semiautomatic assault weapon” as a firearm with a “detachable magazine” and a “pistol grip,” “forward grip,” “folding stock,” “rocket launcher,” or “threaded barrel.” The list includes pistols made by CZ, Daniel Defense, America Spirit, Heckler and Koch, Centurion, and DPMS, among others. It includes rifles made by Kel-Tec, Springfield Armory, Heckler and Koch, Barrett, Beretta, Stag Arms, Remington, Rock River, Mossberg, Diamond Back, Daniel Defense, Colt, Bushmaster, Armalite, and Norinco, among others.

Cicilline’s bill bans “all AK types” even though the Florida gunman used an AR-15.

HR 5087 describes “high capacity” magazines as a “large capacity ammunition feeding device,” making it “unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a large capacity ammunition feeding device.”

Ironically, a Virginia Tech Review Panel that examined the April 16, 2007, firearm-based attack on the gun-free Virginia Tech campus found that a ban on “high capacity” magazines would not have mitigated the terrible outcome of the attack. Thirty-two people were killed by a killer armed with a handgun and 15-round magazines. But the killer had the one thing needed most–time. No one could shoot back, so whether he had magazines holding 10-rounds or 15, he had all the time in the world to reload and ply his trade.

breitbart59,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-06-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2017/06/21/babin-bill-gives-congress-firearm-carrying-opportunities-national-reciprocity-would-not-give-ordinary-americans/,"On June 20 Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX-36) introduced legislation that will allow Congressional members to “supersede” concealed carry laws and have a gun with them for self-defense “in nearly every conceivable scenario.”

This comes as Americans have been yearning for Congress to take up national reciprocity so that the common man can simply have a gun with him as he crosses state lines. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC-8) introduced national reciprocity on January 3, 2016, and the common man has been waiting.

Breitbart News has already highlighted this bill’s strategic flaws in that it would empower politicians while not helping all Americans. In response to that first piece, Babin’s office provided Breitbart News with the following quote from the Congressman:

Rep. Babin is a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment who fully supports reciprocity rights for every American. He is a proud cosponsor of Rep. Hudson’s national reciprocity legislation and believes all law abiding American citizens should be able to conceal carry across state lines.

But that quote does not address the fundamental extra protections this bill would seek for members of Congress in addition to what national reciprocity would provide to ordinary Americans.

Babin’s bill, titled “Bill to Enhance Safety and Protection of Members of Congress,” would give Congressional members “the ability to attempt to qualify for a concealed carry permit – either through their home state or a training program created by the United States Capitol Police (USCP).” It would then:

Direct the USCP to grant Members of Congress the ability to concealed carry in nearly every conceivable scenario – including federal parks and buildings, the national mall, to and from their offices, at schools and military bases – with only a few limited restrictions. These would include National Special Security Events, other areas under the direct jurisdiction of the Secret Service and commercial airliners.

So Babin’s bill gives special carry privileges to members of Congress–privileges the common man will never have–but Americans are just yearning to exercise their God-given, constitutional right to bear the arms they keep for the purposes of self-defense. As of now, a citizen with a concealed carry permit from Texas can only carry a gun for self-defense in his home state and scattered states that recognize the Texas permit. The same is true for residents of Utah; they can carry a gun for self-defense in their home state and scattered states that recognize the Utah permit. But residents from Texas or Utah would face criminal charges if they carried a gun for self-defense in California.

National reciprocity would fix this convoluted mess by guaranteeing that a permit from any one state is valid in every other state.

In other words, national reciprocity means the common man with a concealed carry permit can be armed for self-defense even if he drives coast-to-coast in this great land.

Babin’s bill will allow Congressional members to “supersede any other federal or state law regarding concealed carry.” This, too, is something the common man will never get to experience.

Breitbart News reported that the alleged gunman, Kevin Janson Neal, killed four on Tuesday. However, the Associated Press now reports that investigators found the body of Neal’s wife under the floor of their home, which raises the number of innocents killed to five.

Neal’s shooting spree lasted about 45 minutes and covered numerous locations, after which time he was killed by police.

A judge barred Neal from possessing firearms after he “was charged with stabbing a neighbor” this year. And Neal’s attorney, Leo Barone, indicated that he “should have been unable to legally purchase guns because of the court order.” But Neal had two rifles and two handguns, all of which he acquired illegally.

Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston indicates that Neal had two rifles and two handguns. The rifles were “homemade” and the handguns were “registered in someone else’s name.” Neighbors told law enforcement that Neal “had been firing off hundreds of rounds of ammunition day and night.”

California has Gun Violence Restraining Orders, which amount to court-ordered confiscation of an individual’s firearms, and they have universal background checks, gun registration, 10-day waiting period on gun purchases, a gun safety certificate requirement, a “Good Cause” requirement for concealed carry, an “assault weapons” ban, a limited state-approved roster of guns that are legal to own, a ban on campus carry, a ban on teachers being armed in K-12 schools, a ban on open carry, and many other controls as well. Yet Neal was able to possess and use two rifles and two handguns to carry out his treachery.

The transfer fee is $19, out of which $5 is used to “fund enforcement efforts against illegal firearm purchases.” The suit revolved around NRA and the California Rifle and Pistol Association Foundation’s (CRPA Foundation) efforts to stop the state from taking that $5 to fund disarmament efforts.

According to Reuters, a three judge panel of the Ninth Circuit ruled unanimously in favor of upholding the fee. The court ruled that the law requiring the fee “advanced California’s interest in disarming people who are forbidden from possessing guns and rifles.” They ruled than any burden the fee places on the Second Amendment is only “minimal.”

The NRA and CRPA Foundation claimed the fee amounted to “unconstitutional tax on a fundamental right.”

Chief Ninth Circuit Judge Sidney Thomas wrote, “The government has demonstrated an important public safety interest in this statutory scheme, and there is a reasonable fit between the government’s interest and the means it has chosen to achieve those ends.”

The other $14 of the $19 transfer fee is used to pay for the background check and paperwork involved in a firearm transfer.

On June 9, 2016, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Americans have no right to carry a concealed handgun in public for self-defense. The court’s majority opinion was written by Judge William Fletcher, who said, “We hold that the Second Amendment does not preserve or protect a right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.”

The number of heroin deaths was 12,989 and the number of firearm-related homicides was 12,979.

The Washington Post published the CDC numbers, which show the deaths from all opioids combined topped 33,000 in 2015. That means opioid deaths outnumbered firearm-related homicides nearly 3 to 1.

Opioids include heroin and prescription drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and oxymorphone.

In November 2015 Breitbart News reported Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) numbers which showed the death rate from all drugs combined–opioid or otherwise–was 46,471 in 2013. For that same year, the death firearm-related death rate–including homicides, suicides, and accidental deaths–was 33,636. So drug-related deaths surpassed all types of gun deaths by nearly 13,000.

Car-related deaths surpassed gun deaths in 2013 as well. There were 33,636 gun-related deaths that year and 35,369 car-related deaths. And Breitbart News reported that Duke University researcher Chris Conover explained that car deaths, when viewed as a percentage, were so much higher than gun deaths that evidence showed that owning a car is “80 percent” riskier than owning a gun.

Conover explained this by pointing to the fact there were nearly 100 million fewer cars than guns in 2013. Yet even with 100 million fewer cars the number of people killed in or by cars surpassed the number of people who died in a gun-related death.

In August, Breitbart News reported that Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS)—the gun control group founded by Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly—began pushing temporary confiscation as part of its bid to find something that would resonate with the American people and give the group some traction.

At that time, the Arizona Republic reported that ARS was pushing for “Gun Violence Restraining Orders” which would “authorize law enforcement to remove access to guns, with court oversight and plenty of protections to prevent abuse of this authority.” They also wanted a prohibition barring “persons involuntarily hospitalized [from] purchasing or possessing firearms.”

So on March 18, Giffords was in New Jersey to discuss Democrat proposals for expanding gun prohibitions on firearm possession so that it not only covers those who are guilty of domestic violence, but also those who might be under a restraining order while awaiting trial for domestic violence.

According to MSNBC, the proposals to ban firearm possession include confiscation by mandating the “surrender” of firearms for those guilty of domestic violence or “if a domestic violence restraining order is in effect.”

Gov. Christie met with Giffords behind closed doors, and his office did not reveal specifics of their conversation.

The NRA tweeted about the new anti-gun rules, which will soon be effective in Rotary International’s “Code of Policies”:

Rotary International Gives the Boot to Gun Owners, Cites “Reputation Risk” In New Firearms Ban https://t.co/tv3cR7BpLI #2A — NRA (@NRA) April 3, 2017

Rotary International Director Bradford R. Howard posted a letter containing a summary of the new rules, which include prohibitions against:

Rotary clubs, districts and other Rotary Entities from transferring ownership of weapons.

[Rotary] clubs, districts and Rotary Entities from conducting or sponsoring gun shows.

[Rotary] clubs, districts and Rotary Entities from using any visual that includes weapons.

Licensing by Rotary International of guns or weapons.

Moreover, the new rules even “[prohibit] clubs, districts and Rotary Entities from accepting sponsorships from gun/weapon companies or stores, and preventing use of Rotary’s logo with the name or logo of a gun/weapon company or store.” This begs the question–what happens if a renowned gun maker is involved in an event to benefit a local community and that involvement includes the use of their logo? Would this mean the local Rotary Club would be barred from involvement in the event altogether or would it simply mean the club would be prohibited from using its logo in the event because of the gun maker?

Even more confusing is the fact that Howard used his letter to let Rotary Clubs know they “are still permitted to conduct sporting events that may include guns. (e.g., turkey shoots, skeet shoots, etc.).”

Howard explained the reasoning behind Rotary International’s new anti-gun stance:

In early 2016, Rotary, and the Board discovered that there is a lack of clarity around RI’s policy governing Rotary clubs, districts, and other Rotary Entities when participating in activities involving guns, weapons, and other armaments, and when interacting with gun companies, including for sponsorship purposes.

On March 13, a Tucson, Arizona radio host published a photograph of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords holding an AR-15 rifle at a gun range. Giffords has since confirmed that the photograph is authentic.

James T. Harris, blogging at the website of “101.4 FM The Truth,” wrote:

What is wrong with this picture? Absolutely nothing, and prior to the aggressive progressive opportunistic fear mongering in the wake of Sandy Hook, this picture would have raised no eyebrows and garnered little public attention. However, in response to the exploitative political scheming of Mark Kelly, persons connected to Congresswoman Giffords released this photo in response to what they perceived to be her husband’s hypocrisy.

Subsequently, Breitbart News confirmed the authenticity of the image through law enforcement sources in Arizona, and obtained a copy of the photograph from a source who requested anonymity.

The latter source was present when the photograph was taken, and said that Giffords had requested it for campaign purposes during October 2010.

According to the source, the image sent to Breitbart News was cropped to protect the identity of the person on the right-hand side of the original photograph (to Giffords’s left).

The source, who is a member of the law enforcement community, told Breitbart News:

“We were told she wanted to toughen her image. She asked to come out and she wanted to shoot a rifle. She had one of our guys out there to show her how to shoot an AR-15.”

In January 2011, Giffords suffered near-fatal wounds in a mass shooting while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The perpetrator used a 9mm Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol.

Giffords and husband Mark Kelly have since formed an organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, to press for policy changes such as limiting the sale of “assault weapons, ” including the AR-15.

Breitbart News reported last week that Kelly attempted to purchase an AR-15 from a gun store in Tucson earlier this month.

Likewise, the AR-15 that Giffords is shown holding in the image is a standard, semi-automatic civilian weapon, according to the source who saw it being taken.

The source saw a campaign official take the photograph, which was later provided to law enforcement personnel as a courtesy, according to the source.

The source says the existence of the photograph has been known in the local law enforcement community for a while: “I’m not the only one who knows about this photo.”

Multiple law enforcement sources in Arizona told Breitbart News that Mark Kelly’s campaign against “assault weapons” has generated resentment within the law enforcement community–and a desire that the photograph be made public.

The source who witnessed the photograph put it this way:

“Giffords and Kelly came across with a different demeanor in 2010. To me, it seems like they’ve done a complete 180 because of what happened. And with the latest controversy–with Mark Kelly doing what he did with the AR-15 stunt–this photo needs to be put out.”

While Kelly declined to comment, Americans for Responsible Solutions spokesperson Jen Bluestein told Breitbart News: “Looks like the photo is cropped.”

Bluestein noted that there are “many images of Gabrielle Giffords with guns,” though she said she had not seen the image of the AR-15 before.

At 1:14 p.m. PDT, Giffords posted two images on her Facebook page with the following statement:

Here are two photos of me that a conservative blog has dug up. I remember both of these days fondly. The first is at the Tucson Police Department firing range. They invited me to test rifles and tasers that they bought with federal funds, which I helped secure. The second was in Afghanistan while I was visiting with our troops serving abroad. My work as Southern Arizona’s Congresswoman frequently put me in close contact with some of the world’s most powerful and deadly weapons – supporting police departments, advocating for the Border Patrol, standing up for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and supporting my constituents’ and my own Second Amendment rights. I grew up with guns, and I like owning them. So does my husband Mark. It’s an interest we’ve shared ever since we met. It’s part of my heritage as an Arizonan and it’s my right as an American. Being able to shoot a gun is something I haven’t been able to do since I was shot – because my right arm is paralyzed, and I’m less mobile than I was. As I member of the House Armed Services Committee, I proudly spent a lot of time with our military, border patrol and state and local law enforcement. I guess the intention of those who have publicized these photos is to somehow call into question my belief that military style assault weapons should be more strongly regulated with background checks and other safeguards. I have never wavered in my support for those who serve our country. I fought to make sure they have the weapons and safety gear needed to carry out their mission, and proper health and mental care when their service ends. Both sides of the gun violence debate usually miss the point. We don’t have to choose between owning, using, and enjoying guns, on one hand, and preventing gun violence, on the other. Both sides need to come together to support commonsense solutions to gun violence, like keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like the young man who shot me. That’s why I’m fighting this fight. That’s why I’m working to bring people together to support gun rights and reduce gun violence. I hope you join me.

He says he learned of the block via a notification informing him he had “posted something that violates Facebook’s policies.”

On September 28 Petersen published an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, which said in part:

In my campaign for the United States Senate, I have made Facebook a centerpiece of my outreach efforts. I have used both my Personal Profile and my Official Page to connect with friends, family, and supporters, and to share and express our views about the future of the country. That’s why, on September 22, I was so shocked to receive a notification from Facebook informing me that I had been “blocked” from using Facebook for thirty days because I “recently posted something that violates Facebook’s policies.” Believing this to be a mistake, my campaign reached out to Facebook for more information. Today — six days later — I still have not received an explanation, and the block remains in effect. At the same time the block was affected, a Facebook Live video I had posted to my Official Page promoting my campaign’s AR-15 giveaway was removed. A few days later, a Status Update posted to my Profile referencing the same giveaway was also removed.

Petersen went on to express his confidence that the AR-15 giveaway is not against Facebook policies, as “several posts promoting the giveaway, including paid ‘Dark Posts,’ remain visible on [Petersen’s] page.” He observed that the continued visibility of the posts make it “unclear” why the giveaway “would warrant an immediate takedown and thirty-day ban.”

While awaiting a response from Zuckerberg, Petersen is working around the Facebook block by using Tweeter to let supporters know they can still win the firearm:

The ""offensive"" rifle that triggered my facebook ban can be won here: https://t.co/3Ybm7vvabl pic.twitter.com/AgLfjchjoJ — Austin Petersen (@AP4Liberty) September 24, 2017

In another portion of the open letter to Zuckerberg, Peterson wrote, “It’s difficult to ignore that this action comes during a period of heightened tension regarding Facebook’s role in our elections, and its perceived bias against conservative voices.”

Their father is a Harris County Precinct 1 deputy constable, and the boy knew what he had to do to keep himself and his sister alive. Around 2:30 PM, two men tried to break in, with one going through the front door and the other in the back.

The boy grabbed the AR-15 and shot at them. The two later showed up at a Tomball hospital. The adult was hit three times and was flown to Memorial Hermann hospital, while the juvenile was taken back to the crime scene.

“We don’t try to hide things from our children in law enforcement,” Lt. Jeffrey Stauber said. “That young boy was protecting his sister. He was in fear for his life and her life.”

More stories are coming out about armed citizens defending their lives and property with legally owned firearms. In the span of a week, Breitbart News has reported how a mother used a .38 revolver against an intruder, a man used his weapon to protect his 2-month old son, and a Colorado man invoked the Make My Day law in Colorado in using lethal force to defend himself against three intruders.

Senator Dianne Feinstein and others are trying to push through major gun control laws that would include banning the AR-15, the same gun used by the teenage boy."
breitbart69,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-08-25 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/08/25/ca-ar-15-owners-loophole-foil/,"Firearm owners in California have discovered a way around the state’s latest “assault weapons” ban, which requires registering AR-15s with bullet buttons.

Bullet buttons are a mechanism law-abiding Californians placed on their AR-15s to allow their rifles’ magazines to remain detachable, yet compliant with the state’s last “assault weapons” ban. A bullet button is a button located where the normal magazine release is located, but designed so that it can only be pressed in with pressure from a sharp object, most commonly the point of a bullet.

The Los Angeles Times reports that the updated “assault weapons” ban—signed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) on July 1, 2016—contains a “ban [on] the sale of semiautomatic rifles equipped with bullet buttons.” And it requires that rifles possessing such buttons be registered the state, where they are listed in a database.

The California Department of Justice just launched an online registration website to accommodate bullet button registration, and Fox News reports gun owners find the new registration scheme “more intrusive” that previous registration requirements. For example, attorney and Artemis Defense founder Steven Lieberman said, “The registration is seen by many as a trap to purge the owner since they ask for very specific information about acquisition of the original rifle that most owners don’t have or remember. As a result, [they] ‘guesstimate’ as most would…[but] are potentially committing perjury.”

But bullet button owners have discovered a way around the registration process, an option by which they can mark their guns as a “featureless” firearm on the state’s website. Assemblyman Marc Levine (D) is hinting that this option may be short-lived, but it is there now. Levine said, “By closing the bullet button loophole, it is slowing down the reloading mechanism. Lawmakers will continue to do whatever it takes to keep communities safe.”

breitbart70,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-06-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/19/10-reasons-ar-15/,"Because of the frenzied push to ban “assault rifles” in general and AR-15s specifically — together with the media’s clear attempt to malign the AR at every turn — Breitbart News thought it would be the perfect time to share six reasons why it makes sense to buy an AR-15 now.

AR-15s are easy to operate — An AR-15 rifle is a simple firearm to operate and understand. Anyone who owns a gun of any kind should be well-acquainted with it so as to know where every bullet will go if you have to grab the weapon and use it in a defensive situation. With the AR-15, acquiring such familiarization is easy.

AR-15s are accurate — AR-15s are popular for hunting because they are accurate weapons. This is also why they are extremely popular for shooting targets. An AR-15 fires one round — and only one round — every time the trigger is pulled, so it is a precision weapon when used in long-range shooting applications. That makes mastery of the weapon for long-range shots both fun and rewarding.

AR-15s are easy to accessorize — AR-15s are the Glock or Colt 1911 of the rifle world; if you need a part for an AR, you can get it. If you need a light, laser, sight, scope, grip, trigger, stock, suppressor, sling, magazine, etc., you can get it. If you want the same grips and stock-types but in different colors, you can get them. In effect, you can personalize an AR-15 so that it’s not just a gun, rather, it’s your gun.

An AR-15 is a “defensive rifle” — Medium.com’s Jon Stokes makes a great point about the defensive uses of an AR-15. He refers to an AR-15 as an “assault rifle” for the purposes of making his argument, then writes: “An assault rifle is a defense rifle, and a defense rifle is an assault rifle; these two concepts are identical — such is the very nature of armed combat, in which one person is trying to prevent himself from being killed by killing the other guy first.” These two aspects — “assault” and “defense” — coalesce perfectly when a police officer arrives on the scene and must end an active threat posed not only to bystanders but to himself as well. “Assault” and “defense” also go hand in hand after a homeowner hears someone kick in his front door and knows he has to seek and stop that intruder before innocent family members are harmed.

AR-15s are an American firearm — The “AR” in AR-15 stands for “Armalite Rifle.” NSSF reports that Armalite is the company that designed the gun in the 1950s. Armalite’s website shows that the company began working on the AR platform via funding from “the Capital Southwest Corporation Dallas, Texas.” To put it plainly, the AR-15 is an American rifle just as the Kalashnikov is Russian weapon.

The final reason to buy an AR-15 is the most simple of all:

Buy one because you can — You have a natural right to keep and bear arms that is bestowed upon you by your Creator, rather than government (so says Thomas Jefferson). Moreover, Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia explained that the protections on this right cover “firearms that millions of Americans commonly own for lawful purposes.” And guess what? AR-15s are owned by “millions of Americans,” and the pool of AR-15 owners is growing exponentially at this time.

So get one because you can.

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed “to hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”

When confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, sometimes conflating an AR-15 with the 30-round magazines that can be used in such a firearm.

For example, a Twitter user named Greg tweeted to remind Carlson that our Founding Fathers did not write the Second Amendment so we could hunt. Greg wrote: “2nd amendment was not written to protect deer hunting Gretchen.”

Carlson responded: “It also wasn’t written to blow away people with 30 rounds.”

@Greg69640587 @Mediaite it also wasn't written to blow away people with 30 rounds — Gretchen Carlson (@GretchenCarlson) June 14, 2016

Another Twitter user–John–asked: “Why do you rich elitists who always want to make it more difficult for us common law abiding folks to protect ourselves?”

Carlson responded: “U need 30 rounds to do that?”

@ManViking u need 30 rounds to do that? — Gretchen Carlson (@GretchenCarlson) June 14, 2016

And another Twitter user–who goes by the name The New Independence–asked: “Let me ask you a question Gretchen Carlson. Somebody breaks into your house to kill your children. How do you stop them? Will they be nice?”

Carlson responded: “With a gun that isn’t an assault weapon.”

And just to sure everyone understands she does support banning AR-15s, Carlson responded to praise for her “objective reporting” by tweeting, “That’s why I backed the assault weapon ban today thanks.”

Carlson explained that her decision to go all-in against AR-15s after one was used in the Pulse Orlando gun-free zone was partly because of Sandy Hook–another attack in a gun-free zone–and partly because her daughter works for a Newton charity.

The journalist — Neil Steinberg — attempted to buy the gun at Maxon Shooter’s Supplies in Des Plaines, Illinois. He needed a FOID care (Firearm’s Owners’ Identification Card) — which he had — was required to fill out background check forms — which he did — and then had to wait 24 hours before picking up the gun. It was during the 24-hour wait that Steinberg found out Maxon would not sell him an AR-15 because of the past charge and “an admitted history of alcohol abuse.”

Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, Steinberg explained the process of going into the store — seeing the “cases of weapons” — and of trying to buy the AR-15.

He looked at a Smith & Wesson M&P AR-15 and made sure to point out that the gun comes with a “standard issue 30-round magazine.” He agreed to buy the gun.

While explaining the process of buying the gun, he wrote in a way that showed him reflecting on friends who have suffered the loss of family members to suicide. He also reflected on his neighbor’s shocked reaction when he told her, “I just bought an assault rifle.”

But in the end, he did not really buy the rifle. Rather, the gun store rejected the sale, saying, “It was uncovered that Mr. Steinberg has an admitted history of alcohol abuse, and a charge for domestic battery involving his wife.”

Steinberg responded to the cancelled sale by writing, “Would-be terrorists can buy guns. Insane people can buy guns. But reporters . . . that’s a different story.”

The video was clearly part of the establishment media’s concerted effort to demonize AR-15s by suggesting they are semiautomatics that can be modified into all out war machines.

The video begins with an image of a basic AR-15 rifle captioned, “Texas Church Gunman’s AR-15 Style Rifle.” The video then proceeds to list possible modifications, including items that were either one-offs or prototypical. USA Today listed so many that they had to follow the video with a disclaimer stating, “To clarify, the video shows both the shooter’s modifications, as well as other possible modifications. The shooter did not use a chainsaw bayonet.”

USA Today was mocked relentlessly for posting the video.

Another simply made fun of Democrats and their surrogates for pushing legislation on guns and other things that they “know nothing about”:

breitbart74,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-03-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/03/06/patriot-pin-let-ar-15-owners-avoid-registering-guns-assault-weapons/,"As of January 1, 2017, new gun controls expanded the definition of “assault weapons” in California and required owners of all such guns to register them with the state government.

But now two inventors, Travis Klein and Bart McCurdy, have created a new method of taking down an AR-15 that they say will allow owners of said guns to legally avoid registering them with the state.

According to Law Officer.com, Klein and McCurdy’s invention allows AR-15 owners to quickly take down their rifles in order to switch out an empty magazine for a full one.

The newest laws in California were aimed at outlawing “bullet buttons” — special California-specific buttons which allowed AR-15 owners to eject empty magazines by using a sharp tool or bullet point. With such buttons outlawed, the only way to legally eject magazines in California is to break down the AR — to literally remove the rear pin and separate the upper receiver from the lower, and only then to remove the empty magazine.

The Patriot Pin allows AR-15 owners to do this quickly. A small “take down arm” affixes to the rear pin of the AR, allowing the person holding the gun to use his or her thumb to quickly remove the pin after the magazine is empty. With the pin removed, the upper receiver separates from the lower and an “ARMagLock” can then be pressed with the index finger, dropping the empty magazine.

The Patriot Pin website says, “The new [gun control] law states you must disassemble your rifle before you are able to release the magazine. By installing an ARMaglock, by definition, you are compliant under the new laws.”

The installation of the Patriot Pin and the ARMagLock require “no permanent modifications” to your AR-15.

Russia essentially shut down a United Nations meeting in Geneva on the subject of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) by categorically refusing to participate in any restriction or ban on the development or use of such weapons.

Their official statement amounts to a plain attempt to obscure the issue, claiming that “LAWS” is too broad a term, and that is presently unnecessary. Both of these points are demonstrably untrue, as evidenced by virtually every other developed nation participating. However, the obstruction is beneficial to Russia — a point that some in the Geneva meeting readily pointed out. One anonymous attendee simply stated that “the Russians are not interested in making progress on this.” But Russia says:

According to the Russian Federation, the lack of working samples of such weapons systems remains the main problem in the discussion on LAWS…this can hardly be considered as an argument for taking preventive prohibitive or restrictive measures against LAWS being a by far more complex and wide class of weapons of which the current understanding of humankind is rather approximate.

They also claim that making a distinction between military and civilian use of autonomous systems will somehow stall the progress of artificial intelligence development in general.

The one notable exception to the otherwise general consensus was none other than the chairperson of the Group of Governmental Experts, Indian Ambassador Amandeep Singh Gil. Multiple attendees lay blame for the efficacy with which the Russians derailed the talks at the feet of Gil for both his comments and echoing position paper.

Meanwhile, Russia’s own Kalashnikov weapons manufacturer is giving the lie to their claims, with the development of very real and quite distinct robots of mass destruction. Convenient, then, that its government would be so resistant to calling them what they are.

The bill–HB 731–is sponsored by Mary Margaret Oliver (D-83rd), Stacey Abrams (D-89th), Carolyn Hugley (D-136th), Pat Gardiner (D-57th), Dar’shun Kendrick (D-93rd), Dee Dawkins-Haigler (D-91st).

According to the text of HB 731, the bill focuses on ” dangerous instrumentalities and practices” by prohibiting the “possession, sale, transport, distribution, or use of certain assault weapons, large capacity magazines, armor-piercing bullets, and incendiary .50 caliber bullets.” Moreover, the details punishment for crimes involving “the possession, sale, transport, distribution, or use of certain assault weapons, large capacity magazines, armor-piercing bullets, and incendiary .50 caliber bullets.”

It also “[designates] certain weaponry and ammunition as contraband and [requires] seizure of such by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.”

Representative Mary Margaret Oliver suggests 10 other representatives have joined the six original bill sponsors. An announcement posted to Oliver’s webpage says:

[Oliver] and fifteen Democrat women House members introduced HB 731 on the first day of the 2016 Session. The bill bans assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Georgia needs debate about these weapons which are only used for rapidly killing people. Assault weapons are not necessary for deer hunting.

Pro-Second Amendment group Georgia Carry responded to HB 731 by tweeting, “Dems finally honest about gun control, their ultimate goal is confiscation.”

Associate Justice Clarence Thomas dissented–Antonin Scalia joining him–suggesting that wordsmiths were finding categories of guns to ban by listing types of firearms outside those explicitly in focus in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008).

In other words, Heller struck down D.C.’s handgun ban, but the ban in Highland Park is on “assault weapons.”

The problem with this, as Thomas–joined by Scalia–explained, is that the Second Amendment protections reiterated in Heller were not limited to striking down handgun bans. Rather, the decision was to protect “firearms that millions of American commonly own for lawful purposes.”

In dissenting from the December 7 SCOTUS decision not to intercede and strike down the “assault weapons” ban, Thomas first set forth the details of the ban and then provided his reasons, shared by Scalia, for viewing the ban as a violation of the Second Amendment.

Ban details:

The City of Highland Park, Illinois, bans manufacturing, selling, giving, lending, acquiring, or possessing many of the most commonly owned semiautomatic firearms, which the City branded “Assault Weapons”. … The City also prohibited “Large Capacity Magazines,” a term the City used to refer to nearly all ammunition feeding devices that “accept more than ten rounds.” The City gave anyone who legally possessed “an Assault Weapon or Large Capacity Magazine” 60 days to move these items outside city limits, disable them, or surrender them for destruction. … Anyone who violates the ordinance can be imprisoned for up to six months, fined up to $1,000, or both.

Thomas noted that even within the Seventh Circuit’s considerations, justices admitted that certain “assault weapons” make formidable self-defense weapons and may be a good choice for that application because they are “less dangerous per shot than larger caliber pistols or revolvers.” Yet the Seventh Circuit upheld the “assault weapons” ban anyway, by recognizing that Heller “holds that a law banning the possession of handguns in the home … violates” the Second Amendment.

The thinking is that an “assault weapon” is not a handgun; therefore, it may not have the same protections.

But Seventh Circuit Justice Daniel Manion looked beyond the explicit mention of one type of gun over another and simply considered the Second Amendment protections reaffirmed in Heller, as well as in McDonald v. Chicago (2010). After doing this, he dissented from the Seventh Circuit decision, saying, “Both the [‘assault weapons’ ban] and this court’s opinion upholding it are directly at odds with the central holdings of Heller and McDonald.” That is Thomas’s point precisely, and it is the point for which Scalia stood, as well.

Thomas criticized the majority SCOTUS decision to allow the Seventh Circuit’s ruling to stand, suggesting the SCOTUS action runs the risk of allowing the Seventh Circuit to “[relegate] the Second Amendment to a second-class right.” And he pointed to an even greater existential risk arising from allowing “assault weapons” bans to stand when he wrote, “If a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the Second Amendment guarantees nothing.”

The February 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia leaves the GOP-controlled Senate with the duty to refuse confirmation of any jurist to the SCOTUS unless that jurist is as committed to the Constitution as was Scalia, as is Justice Thomas.

breitbart78,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-08-11 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/08/11/nuclear-weapon-protesters-call-total-abolition-weapons/,"With tensions between the U.S. and North Korea rapidly increasing, nuclear war protesters who gathered to remember the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are calling for the “total abolition of weapons.”

The protests were held outside of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, roughly 200 protesters came together outside the Livermore Laboratory “to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the bomb that decimated Nagasaki, just three days after another atomic blast did the same to Hiroshima.” Survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki attended the protest alone with the anti-nuclear weapons activists.

One of the local groups at the protest was Tri-Valley CAREs. That group’s executive director, Marylia Kelley, said, “We are here to stand with the survivors of that nuclear attack, but we are also here to stop the next nuclear war before it starts.” Kelley added, “We understand if we are ever going to rid the world of the threat of nuclear war, we need to have the total abolition of weapons. There are no right hands for these wrong weapons.”

The Chronicle reported that the protest was “heavy with emotion: indignation, outrage and fear over a potential nuclear build-up” as the U.S. and North Korea increasingly appear prepared to go head-to-head.

The protests against nuclear weapons–based on the prior use of atomic weapons against World War II Japan–overlook many things. Chief among them is the fact that the United States’s conventional weapons were literally burning the Japanese to death via a multitude of air raids. The ordnance burst and tumbled upon impact, spewing fire and death upon those in its path. Richard B. Frank points to colleague estimates “that between a quarter million and 400,000 Asians, overwhelmingly noncombatants, were dying each month the war continued.” This is death on a scale far greater than was caused by the two atomic bombs.

Moreover, the protesters overlook how many Americans would have died had a land invasion been chosen over the dropping of two atomic bombs. The estimates were hundreds upon hundreds of thousands and beyond, and these estimates do not include the POWs being held in Japan who would have immediately been killed.

breitbart79,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-10-13 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/10/13/chris-murphy-assault-weapons/,"Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) says the federal “assault weapons” ban that lapsed in 2004 would have prevented the Las Vegas attack, had that ban still been in force today.

This claim shows a deep misunderstanding of the “assault weapons” ban, which did not ban the possession or purchase of “assault weapons.” Rather, it limited importation and mandated types that could be manufactured in the U.S., thus driving up prices. For a man of means like Stephen Paddock, paying the higher price for an “assault weapon” would have been no problem.

According to CBS News, Murphy was asked to respond to Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-CA) affirmation that no law would have stopped the Vegas attacker from striking. He said, “I respectfully disagree with my colleague.” And while admitting that Paddock had no criminal record to prevent passage of a background check or ownership of firearms, Murphy suggested that limiting the types of firearms Paddock could have owned would have made all the difference.

He said, “What if [the attacker] did not have an assault weapon? What if the assault weapons ban still applied? What if he was up in that hotel with a pistol or a shot gun or a non-semi-automatic rifle? Maybe he would have gone through with the crime, but I guarantee you less people would be dead.”

Again–the “assault weapons” ban Murphy references did not prevent the ownership of “assault weapons.” And although it contained a “high capacity” magazine ban too, Breitbart News reported that it did not pose an out-right ban on ownership of “high capacity” magazines either.

Murphy’s appeal to such bans is a smoke-and-mirrors ploy to enact more gun control for the sake of gun control; to re-enact a ban that did not really ban anything, but which gave the impression that Democrats cared.

Moreover, looking at it from another angle, even if we had a ban that really did prohibit such weapons, why would we expect an outcome different that the one we have seen in Paris, where 130 people were gunned down in one night–November 13, 2015–by terrorists with “assault weapons.”

Murphy is missing a simple point–gun control does not control criminals or terrorists, but it does make their victims easier to kill.

breitbart80,breitbart,['John Hayward'],2017-11-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/11/30/north-korea-releases-photos-video-new-missile/,"North Korea released photos and video of its new missile on Thursday, showing what appears to be a larger and more powerful version of its previous top-shelf ICBM, the Hwasong-14.

Analysts have debated whether the new vehicle is enough of a generational improvement to merit the new Hwasong-15 designation North Korea has given it, but a spokesman for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said his country’s analysis of the photos “showed that there were clear differences between the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-14 in terms of the looks of the warhead, the joint of the first and second stages of the missile, and overall size.”

Reuters quotes Michael Duitsman of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies agreeing with the South Korean analysis, saying, “This is a very big missile. And I don’t mean ‘Big for North Korea.’ Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club.”

“The first stage seems to use essentially the same case but has two engines. The second stage looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant. The combination of those two things means it really is a new, more capable missile,” said David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists, comparing the new vehicle to the Hwasong-14.

“They wanted to hit all of the U.S., and they wanted something big to hit it with. This seems on the surface level to be that missile,” said David Schmerler of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, as quoted by CNN.

A U.S. intelligence official added that the test launch “appears to demonstrate a more powerful North Korean solid-fuel propulsion system, especially in its second-stage rocket.” Among other advantages, solid-fuel rockets can be launched more quickly than those using liquid fuel.

The New York Times cites analysts who believe the second engine nozzle in the first booster stage and greater fuel capacity of the second stage appear to give the Hwasong-15 much greater range than its predecessor, dispelling theories that the Wednesday launch was essentially a stunt in which a slightly modified Hwasong-14 was given a lighter test payload so it could fly higher.

The photos published by North Korea indicate that the weapon has a mobile launch system, although U.S. intelligence analysis of the Wednesday launch indicates it was conducted from a fixed position, not a mobile platform. Contrary to dictator Kim Jong-un’s claim that the new missile is “100 percent” produced by North Korean industry, the mobile launch truck appears to be a modified version of a vehicle provided by China.

Perhaps most disturbingly, the new missile has a larger, blunter nose cone design that appears to indicate North Korea has made progress toward reliable reentry shielding—one of the last pieces of nuclear ICBM technology they do not yet possess.

The BBC notes that the “vast size” of the Hwasong-15, comparable to the American Titan II missile from the Cold War, cannot be overstated:

“A jubilant Mr Kim is seen in many of the pictures, grinning as the rocket takes off. The missile’s steep trajectory can be seen on screens in the background, apparently charted in real time,” the BBC reports, wryly noting that Kim has a habit of walking around giant fuel-laden missiles while puffing on cigarettes in publicity photos.

CNN quotes a North Korean official who said that more tests would be coming soon, including the long-threatened above-ground “large-scale hydrogen bomb” test."

On Stephen K. Bannon’s return to Breitbart News Network as Executive Chairman, Mr. Kurtz asked if Breitbart would be seen as more of a “weapon”?

Kassam replied: “Breitbart’s always been a weapon, quite frankly. It’s a weapon for the American people. It’s a weapon for the base who put President Trump in the White House.”

“We don’t hide where we come from on the spectrum,” he added. “That’s the problem we have with the CNNs of the world. They try and hide where they are on the political spectrum. We actually own our purvue and our remit in that regards.”

.@RaheemKassam: I think Breitbart has always been a weapon. It's a weapon for the American people. It's a weapon for the White House. — #MediaBuzz (@MediaBuzzFNC) August 20, 2017

Kurtz observed: “The word ‘weapon’ makes it sounds as if you are political activists as much as you are journalists.”

“I think when you look at the media landscape, everybody is weaponised right now,” said Kassam.

“CNN will run a story saying that Antifa is not a violent organisation. That’s a nonsense. The Washington Post‘s slogan ‘Democracy dies in darkness‘ – that’s a nonsense. They would not have done that had Hillary Clinton won.

“The media is weaponised all across the board. The only difference is we’re honest about it.”

.@RaheemKassam says ""we [Breitbart] don't hide where we come from on the spectrum. That's the problem we have with the CNN's of the world."" — #MediaBuzz (@MediaBuzzFNC) August 20, 2017

Asking if Breitbart News Network would temper its support for President Trump, Kassam said: “My personal analysis is that Trump still believes in the economic nationalist agenda that’s what we’re interested in. That’s the America First agenda.

“I’ll just give him the benefit of the doubt. Let’s see how this plays out.”

Referring to Trump’s campaign promises to voters, the Breitbart London chief editor said: “I want to see Trump standing in front of that famous Bannon whiteboard. If that’s still in the White House, then that’s a-okay with me.”

breitbart82,breitbart,['John Hayward'],2017-02-15 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/02/15/former-cia-director-james-woolsey-iran-may-relatively-short-time-away-nuclear-weapons/,"James Woolsey, CIA director under Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, said in a CNN interview on Monday that Iran may be a “relatively short time away” from developing nuclear weapons.

“Iran is a very serious problem already and will be a much bigger one very shortly,” he warned.

Woolsey was alarmed by recent developments in North Korea as well, recommending a show of American strength in the region, along the lines of a carrier battle group deployment. He worried that America may have developed a reputation as a “paper tiger” that would make any less impressive demonstration insufficient.

“I think that the situation with North Korea is worse than a lot of people realize,” he said. “Because they can orbit a satellite, and they can fire a nuclear weapon. They have nuclear weapons. If you can detonate a satellite with a nuclear weapon in it, up above the Earth in certain locations, you can knock out the electric grid underneath. That’s, to put it mildly, a very big problem.”

As it happens, former NASA mission controller Jim Oberg sounded this very same note of alarm a few weeks ago at The Space Review. Oberg warned that North Korea’s satellite program, conducted at great expense with seemingly very little to show for it, might have always been intended to deliver an EMP weapon into orbit. Such a strike would require very little precision and have no need of re-entry protection for the weapon, two areas in which North Korea lags conspicuously behind.

Woolsey said North Korea may be the most urgent threat, but Iran was a more “fundamental” threat.

“Iran is the world sponsor of terrorism all over the place, and they are really committed to the destruction of the United States,” he observed. “North Korea may be. Russia and China, especially Russia I think is a matter of some substantial concern. But I’d put North Korea and Iran right up there at the top.”

When CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer objected that Iran does not have the capability to destroy the United States, Woolsey replied, “Not yet with a nuclear weapon, but I don’t think they are many years away from a nuclear weapon.”

“I think they may be a relatively short time away,” he said. “And in terms of their attacks through terrorism, through the Revolutionary Guard and elsewhere throughout the Middle East and throughout other parts of the world, Iran is a very serious problem already — and will be a much bigger one very shortly.”

“You don’t accept the notion that they’re honoring their commitments to halt their nuclear program with the nuclear weapons deal — the nuclear deal that the U.N. put together, the U.S. participating in that?” Blitzer asked somewhat incredulously, citing reports that the Trump administration has signaled an increased willingness to honor the deal, despite stern criticism during the campaign.

“I think that the chance the Iranians are keeping their word is about as close to zero as diplomatic relationships go,” Woolsey replied.

Blitzer sputtered about the testimony from various sources that Iran is keeping the deal, prompting Woolsey to smile and say, “Maybe very briefly.”"
breitbart83,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-08-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/08/09/fox-prohibits-showing-guns-ads-lethal-weapon/,"As Fox prepares to bring Lethal Weapon to the small screen, the network has made clear that images of guns will not be allowed in advertisements for the program.

Clayne Crawford (Rectify) and Damon Wayans (In Living Color) will take over the roles played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the films. But neither actor will be able to hold guns in the poster for the television series, whereas all four Lethal Weapon film posters have featured the characters wielding their trusty firearms.

According to Entertainment Weekly, Fox chairman Dana Walden indicated the network is trying to find “the right balance” between stories that are relevant and stories that are overly violent.

Walden said:

“These are entertaining shows. We think about it a lot from the marketing side. Even the artwork you saw of Lethal Weapon, we’re trying to focus on the characters, not on guns, or the violence, in the show. You have to hit a balance. They’re trying to create stories that are relevant in this day and age and feel heightened and have life and death stakes and take place in a cop world or in the world of terrorism, it’s hard to imagine that without any violence, so it’s just trying to find the right balance.”

The network also said it will purposely lessen the amount of “gun play” depicted in its reboot of action thriller series 24. The new series will be called 24: Legacy, with newcomer Corey Hawkins taking over for previous series star Kiefer Sutherland.

“We’re telling a thriller story, so clearly there will be gun play, but we’re trying to tell it in a thoughtful and modulated and complicated and humanistic way,” Fox entertainment president David Madden told EW. “Jack Bauer was a one-of-a-kind character. Corey Hawkins, playing Eric Carter, has a whole different worldview. You’ll see some gunplay, but you’ll see it expressed in a thoughtful way.”

Madden did not explain how an anti-terror agent could “thoughtfully” kill a terrorist intent on harming Americans.

breitbart84,breitbart,['Katherine Rodriguez'],2017-01-26 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/26/u-s-navy-laser-weapons/,"The U.S. Navy will deploy a new laser weapon system on its ships within the next two years, according to a naval official.

“We’re doing a lot more with lasers,” Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall, director of the Surface Warfare Division, said earlier this month at the annual Surface Naval Association national symposium, according to Scout Warrior.

Boxall said the Navy plans to test a 150-kilowatt weapon from a ship within a year, and to deploy that weapon on a carrier or destroyer a year later.

The weapon will destroy incoming missiles, drones, aircraft, and other threats from the enemy.

The Navy unveiled a 30-kilowatt laser weapon on the U.S.S. Ponce during patrols of the Persian Gulf in 2014, the Daily Mail reported.

The AN/SEQ-3 (XN-1) Laser Weapons System (LaWS) aboard the USS Ponce was available to the ship’s commander as a defensive weapon to shoot down incoming missiles, drones, boats and other potential threats.

The laser weapons are very precise, designed to destroy threats at a cost of 59 cents per shot, and do not require old-style expensive ammunition.

The new laser weapons system will require a massive amount of power to operate. “The Navy will be looking at ships’ servers to provide three times that much power,” Donald Klick, director of business development for DRS Power and Control Technologies, told Scout Warrior. “To be putting out 150 kws, they [the weapons] will be consuming 450 kws.”

The power requirement for the new weapons system is more than most ships are able to accommodate. That means most ships require an “energy magazine” that would store energy for the laser to use as needed, according to a Naval Postgraduate School paper titled “Power Systems and Energy Storage Modeling for Directed Energy Weapons” by Jeremy Sylvester.

Klick says the laser weapons system has to go through rigorous Navy certification testing before it deploys on Navy ships, but he eventually sees the system being deployed on military aircraft in the future."

The Chicago Tribune reports that the violence brought the number of homicides to 242 for January 1 through May 30, 2017.

But WGN 9 notes that 49 shot and six killed is actually an improvement over Memorial Day Weekend 2016. On that weekend 71 were shot and seven were killed.

An example of the violence that marked Memorial Weekend was witnessed on Monday night. Three men “were…standing in the street at 69th and Harvard” when approached by another man who opened fire. One of the men was killed–shot in the head–and the other two are in stable condition.

There were no arrests in the shooting.

This kind of violence has flared up throughout 2017 (just as it did in 2016). For example, on March 30, 2017, two brothers were shot dead in front of their mother. The brothers, ages 19 and 20, went to the restaurant where their mother worked to say hello and were shot and killed as she looked at them through the window. Moreover, Breitbart News reported that 29 people in Chicago were shot in less than 18 hours on April 15, 2017.

On April 24, 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) suggested the violence in gun-controlled Chicago proves the need for more gun control. He specifically pushed for more regulations on Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders.

But on the day after Christmas, she was shot in the head.

Brooklyn Rouse, 21, agreed to keep driving into the neighborhood to deliver pizzas to customers in the dangerous Bloomfield area, even after another employee was robbed and shot in the shoulder on a delivery less than a week prior.

Rouse was shot in the head on December 26 as she tried to deliver two pizzas. Police found the shooting victim lying on the ground lapsing in and out of consciousness, the Macon Telegraph reported. The woman was taken to a nearby hospital and was listed in critical condition.

Police reported that Rouse was conscious enough to tell them she was robbed, then shot. The victim also told police she did not want to die. “(I) told her to keep squeezing my hand as she was in and out of consciousness,” an officer noted in a police report.

The young woman’s pizza shop boss praised her as a worker.

“I could call her in any time and she’ll be here like that,” manager Frank Hurley told the Charlotte Observer. “Yesterday, she was originally off. I had a driver call in because of the last incident, so I called her in to cover his shift and then it happened to her.”

Since Rouse was shot, the store has canceled all deliveries to the dangerous neighborhood.

That means 86 were shot and wounded and 14 were killed over one holiday weekend in Chicago. Yet Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) supports even more gun control on the good guys–federally licensed firearms dealers–and opposes concealed carry reciprocity for law-abiding citizens.

According to the Sun-Times, “36 people [were] shot across the city in an 8-hour span of violence between 8 p.m. Tuesday and 4 a.m. Wednesday” alone. During that 8-hour span, six people lost their lives.

The weekend’s first fatal shooting occurred just before 9:00 p.m. on Friday “in the South Side Englewood neighborhood.” The victim–52-year-old John Hunter–was shot and “pronounced dead at his apartment.” He was one of three individuals shot in that one incident. The other two victims–30-year-old Javon Jackson and 50-year-old Sedrick Ringer–were shot and fatally wounded as well. Ringer was pronounced dead at the scene and Jackson died at the hospital.

On June 30–the first day of the July 4th weekend–Breitbart News reported that President Trump had seen enough. He tweeted that he was sending “federal help” to gun-controlled Chicago to try to get the violence under control. He wrote:

Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017

He originally put Chicago city leaders on notice on January 24, when he tweeted about the “carnage” in Chicago and pledged to “send in the feds” if the tide of violence was not stemmed.

If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017

There were nearly 4,400 shooting victims in gun-controlled Chicago in 2016 and almost 800 homicides. At some point city officials have to realize that the gun control-first approach is inhumane. Human beings are being preyed upon by armed street criminals and gang members who are not concerned with laws prohibiting the possession of guns or laws prohibiting murder. Gun control does not stop them. Rather, it empowers them.

One was killed while two others sustained injuries.

Authorities responded to a call of shots fired in the rural community of Fronton, Starr County Sheriff’s Office Major Carlos Delgado said to Breitbart Texas. Local, state, and federal authorities found two fishermen who had been injured and a third killed by gunfire. The survivors are expected to recover.

According to preliminary witness statements, the male victims had been fishing when a group of suspected gunmen began firing from the Mexican side for unknown reasons, Delgado said.

The area where the shooting took place is not far from the spot where a U.S. Border Patrol agent and a Texas State Trooper were shot in November 2016, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. In that case, law enforcement officials were stuck by gunfire from an apparent battle between Mexican law enforcement and cartel members. The trooper was shot in the hip area while the agent was shot in the chest but was saved by his body armor and a loaded ammunition magazine.

Just days after the shooting of the two lawmen, cartel gunmen murdered another Texas fisherman west of that region in the area known as Falcon Lake in Zapata County. Falcon Lake is an area commonly used by Los Zetas to smuggle large quantities of marijuana and migrants into Texas. The area is immediately south of Zapata and Starr Counties. In that case, two men were fishing when a another boat approached them from the Mexican side, leading to a confrontation and the two victims being shot at. One of the men died from his wounds while the second fisherman has since recovered. The gunmen returned to Mexico after that shooting.

Falcon Lake is the same area where in 2015 Texas State Troopers on gunboats captured a top Los Zetas commander who was trying to sneak into Texas, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. In that case, authorities arrested Jose Manuel “Z-31″ or “El Borrado” Saldivar Farias, a regional leader for the cartel.

Falcon Lake was also the scene where Los Zetas gunmen murdered David Hartley in 2010 while he and his wife were jet-skiing, Breitbart Texas previously reported. Hartley and wife Tiffany had been riding in the lake until an apparent failed kidnapping led to David being struck by gunfire, while Tiffany managed to escape.

The video shows officer Nizaam Alexander conducting a routine traffic stop when he is approached from behind by a gunman.

The gun initially jammed, but the gunman was able to fire off a shot into the back of Alexander, hitting him in the back of his bullet-proof vest.

The officer returned fire at the retreating suspect and then radioed for help. Once the suspect escaped, Alexander returned to the traffic stop to finish giving the ticket.

Alexander was awarded for his “professionalism and dedication to duty” by the City of Cape Town’s traffic services.

Justin Lampkins, 25, was waiting in line at the drive-thru with his friends inside a truck when the veteran got involved in a fight and was shot, WTHR reported.

Police say the veteran was involved in the fight after someone honked the horn in the line and suspect Evan Schaffer, 22, allegedly got out of the line and punched Lampkins.

Police are not sure who honked the horn.

“The victim shoved the accused back, the accused then presented a handgun,” Joe DeWees, Bedford assistant police chief, told WTHR.

Schaffer then allegedly shot the victim in the chest before he fled the scene. Lampkins was taken to the hospital, where he later died, according to the Bedford Police Department’s Facebook page.

Authorities arrested Schaffer Sunday and charged him Monday with murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

“It’s a senseless act to kill somebody over a horn,” DeWees said. “This is one of the most senseless, senseless acts I have ever seen.”

The extent of the suspects’ injuries was unclear.

A video of the incident shows the two suspects enter the store with hoodies partially covering their faces. One of the suspects talks with the cashier while the other walks through the aisles then returns to the front. The first suspect then climbs the counter, pulling a gun as he goes over.

The second suspect soon follows and takes off his backpack, which he apparently planned to use as a bag to hold valuables.

The cashier put his hands in the air was stepping out of the way when the security guard entered the building. The guard immediately fires at the suspects, who scream, “It’s fake, it’s fake.” The guard responds, “Oh well, mine’s is real.”

After shooting at the suspects the guard orders them both to stand up and put their hands behind their back. He tells the cashier, “Call 911.”

As many Chicagoans enjoyed the beautiful weather, from late Friday until early Saturday evening, others suffered the constant raging violence too often seen in the Windy City.

Thus far, the city has suffered one killed and nearly 40 shot before noon on Easter Day.

The one shooting death occurred in the 1300 block of South Fairfield Ave., the result, police said, of an argument between teenagers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The victim was shot in the back of the head and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Two other teens were also shot during the incident. All were treated at Mount Sinai.

Police say as many as 20 gunshots may have been exchanged during a heated argument at a house party.

While the death toll is low this year, with many hours still to go until the holiday weekend is over, more shootings are sure to come.

Despite the low death rate, the number of wounded for the holiday weekend has far exceeded that of the last three years.

Though the weekend bloodshed will continue as Sunday winds down, thus far, about 40 have been wounded compared to 33 in 2016, 31 in 2015, and 36 in 2014. But by noon on Easter Day, only one had been killed, while 3 died in 2016, 6 died in 2015, and 10 were killed in 2014.

The shootings bring the city’s violence count to 159 shot and killed, 752 wounded, and another ten murdered by other means.

While the focus has often been misplaced on the police in the Windy City, those killed in confrontations with cops is relatively low. For instance, in 2017, only four of the city’s 717 shooting deaths were at the hands of police. Thus far this year, there have been no police-involved shootings.

In one 16-hour period, 16 were shot with one killed.

From 1 PM on Friday to 2 Am early on Monday morning, the body count tallied higher than the bloodletting of the same day in the last two years, with several shooting incidents once again featuring multiple victims at once.

Friday blasted in with ten shooting victims, of which two died, with one of the incidents featuring a pair of victims in the same incident.

Two more incidents with multiple victims occurred overnight on Sunday, too, with four victims in a shooting in the Grand Crossing neighborhood and another three victims in an incident in the Douglas area.

One of the incidents on Sunday involved a civilian employee of the Chicago Police Department, who when confronted by a trio of armed robbers drew his own pistol and wounded one of the assailants, causing the rest to flee. The CPD employee was not injured.

Sunday also saw a flurry of shootings over the second half of the day, with 16 shootings and one death in a single 16-hour period.

The fatal shooting occurred when a 19-year-old man was shot in the chest at around 3:30 PM. A 14-year-old girl was also wounded that same afternoon.

The number of shootings was up this weekend over the same weekend for the last two years. The 42 shot and 5 killed this weekend was up over the 7 killed and 34 wounded in 2015 and the 2 killed and 30 wounded for 2014.

The weekend’s carnage was a capper for another dangerous week in neighborhoods already drenched in blood. In the Austin neighborhood, for instance, five were shot on the very same block where six were shot the weekend before.

The totals so far this year find an incredible 2,319 citizens shot with 340 shot and killed.

breitbart94,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/06/hero-with-ar-15-nra-instructor/,"The hero who stopped Sunday’s Sutherland Springs, Texas, attack with an AR-15 is a former NRA instructor who retrieved his rifle after his daughter ran into his bedroom to tell him she heard gunshots at the church.

CNN described Stephen Willeford as someone who grabbed his AR-15 before he grabbed his shoes. He ran out of his home barefooted, rifle in hand, to engage the attacker, Devin Kelley. Willford positioned himself behind a car and shot the attacker as he walked out of the church during the attack.

Once shot, Kelley fled the scene.

Willeford, gave an emotional interview to KHBS and stressed that the people he went to help were friends of his, that “they were family.”

He said, “Everytime I heard a shot I knew that probably represented a life. I was scared to death. I was. I was scared for me and I was scared for every one of them and I was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away.”

He recounted coming to the church, waiting for Kelley outside, then opening fire: “He saw me and I saw him. I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover. I know I hit him. He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again.”

Once Kelley took off, Willeford jumped into a truck with eyewitness Johnnie Langendorff and literally chased the attacker until he died. Langendorff said of Willeford, “He’s very much a hero. He acted quicker than he could think … He did absolutely the right thing, which was try and take [the attacker] down on the scene.” He said Willeford was “just taking a nap and heard the gunshots and reacted.” Then he came out of his house “barefooted.”

Willeford stressed, “I am no hero. I am no hero. I think my God, my Lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done. And I just wish I could have gotten there faster but I didn’t know. I didn’t know what was happening.”

breitbart95,breitbart,['George Urmston'],2018-02-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/28/george-urmston-machine-gun-assault-rifle-ar-15-not/,"I just read an article on “assault rifles.” Though written by a firearm professional and fairly accurate, the article still missed the mark on a few items.

First off, an AR-15 is not an “Assault Rifle,” as it is not capable of firing in either burst or automatic modes. The AR in AR-15 stands for “Armalite Rifle”. Armalite was the first company to manufacture Eugene Stoner’s rifle design in the late 1950’s.

Another inaccuracy in the article was the suggestion that civilians cannot own machine guns. This is simply false.

Machine guns can be obtained for civilian ownership, however they come at a price of around $15,000 to $100,000 (or more). There is no required permit or license to own a machine gun, but the purchaser is required to submit an ATF form 5320.4 and submit to an extensive FBI background check which usually takes 12-18 months. Upon approval the citizen is issued what is called a federal “Tax Stamp,” and they must keep a copy of that stamp with the rifle at all times.

After receiving the stamp the purchaser is then required to fill out an ATF form 4473 and submit to yet another background check. Then they can take possession of the firearm.

In addition to the extensive paperwork and background checks involved in acquiring a machine gun, it must be noted that only machine guns manufactured before 1986 are legal for purchase. This shrinks the supply of machine guns available for ownership, which in turn drives up cost amid high demand.

A machine gun is an “assault rifle,” an AR-15 is not.

breitbart96,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-10-03 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/10/03/7-deceptive-claims-kimmel-guns-one-monologue/,"During his opening monologue on Monday night’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, host Jimmy Kimmel made seven false or misleading statements about gun laws as part of a push to shame Congress into enacting increased gun control measures following Sunday’s attack on a country music concert in Las Vegas that left 59 people dead and hundreds more injured.

Ironically, he did this after admitting that the Las Vegas attacker complied with all gun controls in purchasing a number of firearms–meaning he passed background checks for those guns. Moreover, Kimmel even admitted that the attacker had “no criminal record,” and therefore, nothing to keep him from passing a check to acquire a gun.

Breitbart News reported Monday that the attacker purchased three guns within the last year from Guns & Guitars in Mesquite, Nevada, where store manager Christopher Sullivan said the attacker came across as “a normal guy.” Sullivan said the attacker had no criminal history and indicated that he passed a FBI background check for his firearms.

Kimmel is correct on one point–there was nothing in the attacker’s past that signaled a problem. But after making that point, Kimmel argued that there are still things that Congress could be doing (and this is where the falehoods and/or misdirection come into play).

1. Kimmel said, “Orlando, Aurora, Newtown, San Bernardino, [in] every one of these shootings the murderer used automatic or semiautomatic rifles.” The inclusion of the word “automatic” is very misleading. In all four instances the rifle used was semiautomatic, period. Pistols were also present. Moreover, Kimmel did not mention that in three of the four instances, the attackers acquired their guns via background checks. Exceptions to this would be the rifles used in San Bernardino–they were acquired via a friend–but the San Bernardino handguns were acquired via a background check. And the guns used by the Newtown attacker were stolen. He stole them from someone who passed a background check for them.

2. Kimmel made the classic leftist claim that AR-15s and the like “are not weapons used for self-defense.” In doing so, he ignored the report of the Houston boy who used his father’s AR-15 to defend his sister’s life during a home invasion. When the two intruders broke into the home, the boy grabbed his father’s AR and shot one of them three times. He also ignored the Michigan gas station owner who stopped a robbery in progress at his station by pulling his AR-15 on the robbers. He also ignored the Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, son who was home alone when he used his father’s AR-15 to stop a home invasion by shooting all three suspects. The suspects died but the son’s life was preserved.

3. He accused President Trump of “signing a bill that made it easier for people with severe mental illness to buy guns legally.” This was a reference to Trump’s repeal of Obama’s Social Security gun ban; a ban that was actually not directed toward people with severe mental illness but toward recipients of disability benefits who required help with finances. Yes, mental health labels were given to these people, but those labels could reference easily treatable and temporary conditions. This is why Duke University psychiatry and behavioral science professor Jeffrey Swanson said Obama’s Social Security gun ban targeted the “vulnerable” rather than the dangerous.

4. He said that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “won’t do anything about [the attack] because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” In reality, Breitbart News has been reporting that NRA-supported legislation revolving around concealed carry reciprocity has stalled because of Ryan.

5. Kimmel said, “Right now, there are loopholes in the law that let people avoid background checks if they buy a gun privately–from another party–if they buy a gun online or at a gun show.” For starters, there is no loophole. The Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 and since that point (and before), Americans have been buying guns from Americans. It is not a loophole, it is freedom. The left pushed background checks and secured them on retail sales in 1998–i.e., there have been background checks on retail sales for nearly two decades–and the left has spent the last four or five years inaccurately describing private sales as a “loophole” as a way to persuade Americans to support more gun control. Also, it must be noted that it is illegal to buy a gun online without going through a background check. If an individual from Florida wants to purchase a firearm online from a gun store in Oklahoma, that gun has to be shipped to a Florida store where the buyer passes a background check before taking possession of it.

6. Kimmel then showed a collage containing the photos of Senators who voted against closing the fictional private sale, online sales, and gun show “loopholes” after the June 12, 2016, Orlando Pulse attack. He did not mention that the Orlando Pulse attacker did not use these “loopholes.” Rather, he passed background checks and a waiting period for his firearms.

7. Lastly, Kimmel said Congress is now working to “legalize the sale of silencers.” In reality, “silencers”–or suppressors, as they are properly called–have been legal and are legal in 42 states. They are widely owned and used by hunters and sport shooters because of the hearing protection benefits they offer. What Congress is considering is a bill that removes the federal tax on suppressors, as well as the burdensome acquisition process to obtain one.

Sanders stated that Trump will “continue to support the Second Amendment,” despite fears from gun-rights activists that he is interested in compromising with anti-gun Democrats in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Sanders spoke with reporters on Friday after Trump met with NRA executives in the Oval Office on Thursday night.

Privately, the NRA expressed concerns with Trump’s rhetoric on Wednesday, although the organization publicly dismissed it as “great TV” without policy teeth.

Sanders stated that Trump was not “necessarily” interested in requiring universal background checks for all private sales of firearms, only that he was interested in improving the existing background check system.

She reiterated the president’s support for the Cornyn-Murphy bill that had the NRA’s approval.

Sanders also indicated that Trump might not be interested in federal legislation to raise the legal age to purchase a rifle to 21, despite his vocal support for the idea.

“Conceptually, he still supports raising the age to 21. But he also knows there’s not a lot of broad support for that,” she said, adding that Trump believed the proposal would “probably have more potential in the states than it would at the federal level.”

Trump traveled to Rev. Billy Graham’s funeral in North Carolina on Friday and will then spend the weekend at his resort at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida."
breitbart98,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/22/trump-opens-door-national-gun-registry-proposed-gun-controls/,"President Trump opened the door Thursday morning to a national gun registry via his proposed “comprehensive background checks.”

He called for such checks via Twitter:

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue – I hope! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Although there is a lack of clarity on what Trump means by “comprehensive background checks,” as to whether he is referencing an overhaul of our current system or is pushing the universal background checks lauded by Democrats, it is important to note that this represents a turning point which opens the door to a national gun registry.

This is so because universal background checks are not enforceable without a gun registry.

For contemporary, real world proof of this danger just look at California, where universal background checks led to registration requirements which resulted in gun confiscation laws. This has all played out before our eyes and is evident to those who pay attention.

For evidence from law enforcement, just consider the way New Mexico Sheriff’s rallied to defeat universal background checks on the grounds that such checks would have led to a gun registry in that state. On February 9, 2017, Breitbart News reported that 32 of New Mexico’s 33 sheriffs signed a letter opposing the universal background checks that were being debated in the state legislature at that time. They described the checks as a “scheme” that “would be unenforceable without creating a gun registry.”

In addition to the contemporary evidence from California and the evidence from law enforcement, common sense proves that a gun registry is necessary if the government is to know who is selling a gun, when they are selling it, and to whom they are selling it. In other words, government officials cannot know that gun sales are being universally monitored unless they know the name of every gun owner and have identifying information about every gun possessed by those owners.

Would a gun registry prevent mass shootings? No, but it would set the stage for the kind of confiscatory actions seen in California. And it would be another step toward narrowing the means to acquire firearms, thereby empowering the government to more easily restrict the guns law-abiding citizens can or cannot own, as we have seen in California.

On August 8, 2016, Hillary Clinton used a Newsweek column to call for “comprehensive background checks.” On February 22, 2018, Trump tweeted his support for “comprehensive background checks” as well. The question before us is whether Trump is voicing support for the same checks Clinton had in mind. If so, a gun registry will be necessary to make them work.

breitbart99,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-26 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/26/parkland-shooting-survivor-vows-not-return-school-unless-gop-passes-gun-control/,"Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg says he will not return to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School until more gun control is passed.

Hogg made the comments Sunday during a gun control rally held at Temple B’nai Abraham in Livingston, New Jersey.

The New York Daily News reports that Hogg said, “I’m not going back to school on Wednesday until one bill is passed.” He did not specify which law he wants most, only that he is not going back until at least one law garners the support of lawmakers.

He said, “Literally any legislation at this point would be a success. Considering the fact that so few legislators in Florida met with us and they want the people to forget, that’s disgusting. The fact that they want people to forget about this and elect them again as the child murderers they are, that’s unacceptable and we’re not going to let that happen.”

To date, state-level gun control proposals include “tougher background checks,” a bump stock ban, a waiting period for long gun purchases, raising minimum age for rifle purchases to 21-years old, and gun confiscation orders similar to California’s Gun Violence Restraining Orders. All of these gun controls were proposed last week by Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and not a single one of them would have prevented the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Proposed gun controls at the federal level include proposals similar to Gov. Scott’s, plus an “assault weapons” ban and “universal background checks.” Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) is a leading voice for these gun controls, even though neither one would have prevented the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. (The “assault weapons” ban would not have prevented the shooting because such a ban, if fashioned like the 1994-2004 ban, does not actually ban certain guns. Rather, it bans cosmetic features. And universal background checks would be impotent because the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, passed a background check for the rifle he used on February 14.)

The one change that could make an immediate difference in school safety would be to arm teachers as Utah did over 15 years ago, and as is currently being done in school districts in Colorado, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and other states. But David Hogg, Gov. Scott, and Rep. Deutch all oppose arming teachers for school safety.

Gov. Scott said we should rely on law enforcement, Deutch said talk of arming teachers is a “distraction,” and Hogg said money that would be used to arm teachers should instead be put into S.T.E.M. studies so teachers “can do more cool stuff and we’ll be able to create jobs in renewable, clean and independent American energy like wind and solar.”

According to Rasmussen, 54% of Americans believe government failure is to “blame for the mass shooting.” Only 33% of Americans blame guns. Eleven percent of Americans say they are unsure what contributed to the occurrence of the mass shooting.

When the sample group was adjusted so as to focus only on Americans “who have children of elementary or secondary school age,” the percentage of Americans who cite government failure as causal jumped to 61 and the percentage who blamed guns dropped to 23.

On February 23 Breitbart News summarized government’s failure:

The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBCSO) received 911 calls about Nikolas Cruz in November 2017. The calls referenced violence and erratic behavior. CNN reports that in one of the calls with the host family, with whom Cruz was living after the death of his mother, told PBCSO they feared Cruz was going to turn a gun on the family. The family member told deputies that Cruz was “buying “tons of ammo” and had allegedly put “put [a] gun to others heads in the past.” No charges were filed, no arrest made. On January 5, 2018, the FBI received a tip describing “Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” The FBI did not act on the tip. On February 14 Cruz attacked students and unarmed teachers in Stoneman Douglas High. A report from CNN claims four Broward County sheriff’s deputies were at the school as the attack was taking place but not one of them entered the school. On February 22 Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told ABC 13 that video showed deputy Scott Peterson by building 12 on campus, yet Peterson never went inside to confront Cruz. The CNN report quotes Coral Springs sources that claim there were actually four Broward County deputies on scene who did not enter the building.

Additionally, Breitbart News reported that Broward County Sheriff’s deputy Scott Peterson was outside the school’s building 12 while the attack occurred. He never went in to confront Nikolas Cruz.

On the other hand, the 19-year-old who attacked the school complied with gun control laws in acquiring his rifle. He passed a background check at a gun store just as the law demands.

The school was gun-free zone, and he ignored that, as criminals regularly ignore laws that would otherwise hinder them from carrying out their crimes. The school was also an ammunition-free zone, but Cruz ignored that too.

He also ignored statutes against murder.

What difference would once more law have made?

“This is a moment. This is exactly what happened during the Civil Rights Movement where people … they were 18-, 19-, 20-years old, young people who said, ‘We have had enough.

Encouraging the gun control protesters to get “organized,” Oprah Winfrey said the “reason why the Civil Rights Movement worked, [is because] there was a strategy. There was a plan. It wasn’t just out there, hocus pocus protesting all the time. There was a strategy, there was a plan.”

The OWN boss joined George and Amal Clooney on Tuesday in pledging $500,000 to the student gun control “March for Our Lives,” which is organizing a planned march next month.

“George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives,'” Winfrey tweeted.

Partial transcript as follows:

The shortcomings of this administration are clear. They are usually worth it though, for two reasons. First, the ideas the president ran on are basically right. America first ought to be the principle of every administration by definition it’s an American administration. America should be first. But that’s not the motto of most administrations. Not even hardly. Second, the alternatives to what we have now are scary and getting scarier. The Democratic Party is completely irresponsible and increasingly anti-American. They prefer illegal aliens to our middle class. It’s true and terrifying. Somebody needs to defend the country from these people. Trump mostly does that. So for these reasons, most of the president’s supporters have stuck by him no matter what has happened, and a lot has happened. But there is a limit to the tolerance. They will not tolerate, and they shouldn’t have to tolerate, by the way, betrayal on the core promises of his campaign. And it seems to be happening on guns, unfortunately.

A few days ago, the president called for raising the minimum age for buying a gun to 21. By the way, that’s four years after we let people join the military. They can joint at 17. But he is saying you can’t buy a gun until you are 21. Nobody is even arguing this will save actual lives because there is no research that it will. It’s propaganda, and sneaky propaganda, by the way, incremental step toward more gun restrictions. That’s all it is. The president went further than that—met with lawmakers to talk gun control at the White House. At that meeting, he went after Republicans who wanted to defend the Second Amendment, suggesting they are puppets of the NRA. At one point the president said the government should, quote, take the guns first, go through due process second. Now, I mean, how honest do you want to be? Imagine if Barack Obama had said that? Just ignore due process and start confiscating guns? Obama would have been denounced as a dictator. We would have denounced him first, trust me. Congress would be talking impeachment. Some would be muttering success. The media agreed—they underplayed it and suggested a battle between the president and NRA. It’s not about the NRA. It’s not even about the president. It’s about the Constitution, and the Constitution remains the same no matter who is in power. That’s the point of the Constitution."
breitbart103,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-12-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/12/30/top-25-defensive-gun-uses-of-2017/,"With 2017 quickly drawing to a close, Breitbart News thought the timing right to review the top 25 defensive gun uses (DGUs) of 2017.

And while it must be noted that these 25 examples are only a smidgen of the hundreds of thousands of DGUs that occur each year–see the academic work of Florida State University’s Gary Kleck–they nonetheless present a well-rounded summation of the various locations and circumstances in which law-abiding citizens use guns to defend their own lives and the lives of others.

Here are the top 25 DGUs of 2017:

January 2, 2017–Kay Dickinson was attacked while entering her Wilmington, North Carolina, apartment. WWAY repoted that Dickinson had just gotten off work and was going into her apartment at Colonial Parke when she was attacked.” The suspect held her at gunpoint, “beat her and then tied her up with a broken belt in her bedroom.” She was able to work free, retrieve her gun, and kill the suspect.

January 12, 2017–An concealed carry permit holder saw an Arizona State Trooper being beaten on the side of Interstate 10. The permit holder pulled over, asked the Trooper if he needed help, then intervened when the Trooper answered in the affirmative. The permit holder ordered the attacker to stop, then shot him dead after he refused to comply. It turned out that the suspect had shot the Trooper before the permit holder arrived, then climbed on top of him in a rage and began beating him on the side of the road. The permit holder saved the Trooper’s life.

January 20, 2017–Charlotte, North Carolina’s Kim Badger was attacked in “broad daylight” by a home invasion suspect armed with a baseball bat. WCNC reported that the attacker struck Badger with the bat, then pursued her through the house. Throughout the attack Badger fought to deny the suspect control of a knife that was on a counter and, eventually, to deny him access to a sword. Badger’s teenage son joined the fight to keep the suspect away from the sword. As the son fought, the mother retrieved her gun and shot the suspect dead.

January 29, 2017–Two masked suspects entered West Philadelphia’s Eagele’s Corner Chinese takeout and “announced a robbery.” According to 6 ABC, police indicated that two store owners were present at the time and one of the owners pulled a gun and opened fire. The owner opened fire, causing both of the suspects to flee. One of the suspects was struck by the owner’s gunfire and was arrested after his accomplice drove him to the hospital for treatment.

February 9, 2017–A legally armed citizen in Holland, Michigan, shot and critically wounded a suspect who would not stop assaulting a woman inside a convenience store. Holland Police issued a press release recounting the incident by explaining that “the suspect violently punched the victim several times and threw her down to the ground, and it is at that point that the [armed] customer arrives and tries to intervene.” The suspect then turned and attacked the customer who was trying to intervene, leading the customer to open fire. The suspect was shot twice and hospitalized in critical condition.

March 8, 2017–A home invasion suspect who approached a family was shot and killed by the father after refusing to accept food stamps in lieu of money. WBRZ quoted East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore saying, “The [father] was at his own home with his family and was confronted by another individual who was armed. There was a scuffle which eventually led to shots being fired and the person who came to the home was shot and killed.” The father offered the suspect food stamps prior to fighting and eventually killing him.

March 9, 2017–A Houston, Texas, smoke shop owner was shot multiple times yet managed to pull his own gun and kill one of two robbery suspects. ABC 13 reported that customers were in the store when the two suspects entered. Those customers called 911 and the dispatcher could hear the sound of gunshots in the background. The store owner was hospitalized in critical condition after the uninjured suspect fled the scene.

March 21, 2017–A 21-year-old suspect kicked in his ex-girlfriend’s apartment door, then died after being shot multiple times. As it turns out, the ex-girlfriend’s brother was in the Detroit apartment and opened fire on the suspect. Police responded to find the suspect had a gun and had left his car parked in the street with the engine running.

April 14, 2017–A homeowner in Pierce County, Washington, awoke to the sound of someone trying to enter his home around 3:30 a.m. The homeowner retrieved a gun and went to investigate, ultimately firing one shot and killing 28-year-old Viktor Starovevrov.

Police explained that the permit holder intervened out of fear that inaction would lead to a further “loss of life.”

May 12, 2017–A female homeowner shot and killed a suspect who allegedly brought his sevem-year-old son along for the home invasion. The San Antonio Express-News reported the suspect allegedly tried to break in through a window in the very room where the homeowner happened to be asleep.

Police arrived in time to transport the alleged intruder to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

May 18, 2017–A home invasion suspect wearing only underwear was shot and killed after breaking into a pastor’s home in Cypress, Texas. The suspect entered the home around 2:00 a.m. and attacked the pastor and his wife.

That family member shot and killed the intruder, saving others in the home from coming under attack.

May 29, 2017–An armed neighbor in Ada, Oklahoma, came to the rescue of three children who were being drowned by their father. Cash Freeman was alerted to the situation when a terrified 12-year-old ran to his house to say the estranged father had taken the children from the mother and was trying to drown them. Freeman arrived to find the father holding three-month-old twins under water. Freeman shot the father twice, killing him and saving the children.

June 7, 2017–An Indianapolis mother protected her children by opening fire and killing a home invasion suspect who struck in broad daylight.

July 17, 2017–With a car thief on the lose near her family’s home 17-year-old Kimber Wood called her dad and asked if she could retrieve one of his guns to keep close at hand for self-defense. Her father said yes, so Kimber retrieved the gun and was ready when the suspect entered the house. Kimber and the suspect came face to face, only to have to him flee when she pointed the gun at him and ordered him to leave the home. She chased him as he fled and fired a warning shot to assure him that she knew how to use the gun.

July 31, 2017–A Katy, Texas, grandma opened fire on two home invasion suspects, leaving one dead. According to ABC 13, Harris County Sheriff’s deputies said the 60-year-old grandma was home alone when two suspects allegedly entered through the garage.

September 6, 2017–Three Taco Bell employees opened fire and killed an armed robbery suspect in Cleveland, Ohio. According to Fox 8, police said two suspects entered the store “wearing masks and ordered the employees to the ground at gunpoint.” There were multiple employees in the store at the time and three of them responded by opening fire. When officers arrived the suspect who had been fatally wounded was lying face down and a gun was still in his hand.

September 14, 2017–An Indianapolis father shot and killed an intruder who burst through the front door and rushed into the apartment. The father’s two young children were home at the time of the foiled invasion. CBS 4 quoted Indianapolis Metropolitan Police officer Aaron Hamer, who said, “It appears [the suspect] was yelling to get into the residence because he believed his kids were in the house. It turns out the kids inside did not belong to him.” The father and his two children were not harmed.

September 18, 2017–A female accountant shot and critically wounded a suspect who broke into her office as she was there typing alone.

The homeowner was not injured.

November 5, 2017–Stephen Willeford was in his home in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when his daughter rushed inside to let him know someone was shooting congregants at the First Baptist Church. Willeford grabbed his AR-15 and a handful of bullets and ran barefoot toward the church in order to confront the killer. Upon arriving, Willeford took a defensive position behind a truck and exchanged fire with the killer, shooting him twice. The killer fled the scene after Willeford shot him, driving roughly 11 miles before taking his own life. Willeford proved anew the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.

December 6, 2017–A father with a handgun license shot and killed an armed suspect who confronted the father and his family in a Popeye’s restaurant. According to Fox 29, the suspect pointed a gun at the father and “demanded his property.” The father asked that his family be released, then pulled his own gun when the suspect became distracted by individuals walking out the restroom. The father shot the suspect multiple times, killing him on the spot.

The Second Amendment is not about duck hunting or plinking, but protecting our lives and liberty from threats as they arise. The top 25 defensive gun uses of 2017 show that law-abiding Americans understand this and are putting their guns to good use.

The record attendance comes as Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Bill Nelson (D-FL) push more gun control for gun shows. Other Democrats, like Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL), are pushing an “assault weapons” ban, a bump stock ban, and universal background checks, among other controls.

The public response to the gun control push was a record turnout at the Florida Gun Show.

WTSP reports “almost 7,000” people attended the show Saturday, and they expected even more people to attend on Sunday.

Gun show manager George Fernandez said he has never seen crowds so big. And he quickly admitted, “Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights.”

WTSP reporter Shannon Valladolid tweeted video from the gun show:

breitbart105,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-12-15 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/12/15/ninth-circuit-10-day-waiting-firearm-purchases-constitutional/,"On December 14, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that California’s ten-day waiting period on gun purchases is constitutional.

People who purchase firearms in California undergo a background check and pay for the gun, then are required to wait ten days before being allowed to actually take possession of the firearm. The court described this waiting period as “a reasonable safety precaution.”

According to the Wall Street Journal, Calguns and the Second Amendment Foundation filed the suit against the waiting period in 2011. They “argued that current gun owners are entitled to take home guns they purchase as soon as they pass a background check.” A federal judge sided with the Calguns and the Second Amendment Foundation in 2014, ruling that “the waiting period served no public-safety purpose when enforced against buyers who already own guns and who pass the background check.” But the 2014 ruling was appealed, and the Ninth Circuit has now ruled in favor of the state of California.

The Ninth Circuit saw the ten-day wait as a “cooling-off period.” Judge Mary M. Schroeder wrote, “An individual who already owns a hunting rifle, for example, may want to purchase a larger capacity weapon that will do more damage when fired into a crowd.”

Ironically, Florida has a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases. The Orlando attacker waited three days, as required, before picking the handgun he carried into Orlando Pulse nightclub the night of his attack.

It is important to note that the language of a “cooling-off period” has been part of the liberal lexicon for decades; it is part of their justification for waiting periods. But framing a waiting period in this way misses a key point: namely, many innocent people–women in particular–are harmed by waiting periods. In New Jersey in 2015, Carol Bowne needed a gun for self-defense, and while she waited for the state’s permission to buy one, she was brutally stabbed to death in her own driveway.

breitbart106,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-01-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/19/bloomberg-turns-firearm-burglaries-campaign-gun-control-gun-stores/,"Bloomberg is using ATF reports on gun store burglaries to call for more gun control for licensed firearm dealers.

Such controls have been pushed in California, where they would serve to drive neighborhood, mom & pop gun stores out of business. In a word, the expensive security measures would allow only those with the deepest pockets, and/or the largest conglomeration backing, to survive.

Bloomberg quotes ATF numbers to show that gun store burglaries across the U.S. went from 3,355 in 2013 to 7,841 in 2017. They point out that gun-friendly Texas had the largest number of guns burglarized at 769, after which the highest number for any other state was 456.

Equally gun-friendly Georgia came in at 427 guns burglarized last year, but that number was down considerably from 1,069 gun burglarized in Georgia in 2016. This shows a lot of fluctuation and may indicate that the overall number of burglaries have an ebb and flow which escapes the untrained eye.

Breitbart News has reported gun store burglaries on numerous occasions and, as with high profile firearm attacks, it is clear that the burglaries would not be easily deterred. For example, it is not uncommon to see “smash and grab” robberies where suspects in large vehicles drive to glass or walls to get to firearms:

Nevertheless, Bloomberg asked Gabby Giffords’ gun control group what they thought and policy advisor David Chipman said:

When states require gun dealers to take responsible steps to prevent their stores from being burglarized—by properly securing not only their stores, but the firearms themselves—they eliminate the risk of thieves taking off with weapons. We know how to solve this problem, but we need more states to acknowledge this issue and put best practices for reducing gun store theft into action.

Once the onus for gun store robberies is shifted from the perpetrator to the gun store owner–and the owner required to spend more and more money on various, expensive security measures–it is only a matter of time until mom & pop gun stores across the U.S. find they can not longer afford to be in the gun business.

breitbart107,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-10-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/09/donald-trump-americans-gun-choice/,"In expressing his opposition to an “assault weapons” ban, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stresses that Americans should be able to own the “firearm of their choice.”

Under a Trump administration, that means individual Americans should have the freedom to own the gun they are most comfortable with using for self-defense, whether a revolver, a semi-automatic handgun, a shotgun, or an AR-15 or AK-47.

According to Business Insider, “One thing Trump’s 2016 presidential platform is clear on is protecting the rights of gun owners and preventing any legislation that impedes their right to bear arms.”

Trump views an “assault weapons” ban as something that clearly impedes the Second Amendment.

When questioned in March about his position on an “assault weapons” ban, Trump said, “I do not support the ban on assault weapons.” His website says: “The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.” And Trump also believes Americans should be able to own “high capacity” magazines if they are comforted by having the added rounds for self-defense.

Breitbart News previously reported that Trump views “assault weapons” and “high capacity” magazine bans as leftist ploys to limit the freedom of citizens. Trump said:

Opponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like “assault weapons,” “military-style weapons” and “high capacity magazines” to confuse people. What they’re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans. Law-abiding people should be allowed to own the firearm of their choice.

The hero cop who was shot in the face by an ex-con died Monday after a two day struggle to stay alive, sources said… It also means that Demetrius Blackwell will likely face a murder charge for gunning down the 25-year-old officer in Queens Village on Saturday, the sources said.

Read the rest of the article here and be sure to check out Breitbart News Network’s live account of the Saturday night attack here.

The New York Daily News also published an account of the deadly shooting:

Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch was shaken following a bedside visit with the gravely wounded cop from Massapequa, L.I. “We’re praying that our hero officer comes through, but with any kind of brain injury, it’s difficult to tell,” Lynch said.

As Moore struggled in the hospital, Blackwell, 35, was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, assault and criminal possession of a weapon.

The cretin allegedly told detectives following his arrest, “They call me D. They also call me hell-raiser on the streets.”

[…]

Moore was driving an unmarked police car when he and partner Erik Jansen, 30, both on-duty but in plainclothes, pulled up behind Blackwell, whom they had spotted “adjusting an object in his waistband,” said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.

Moore identified himself as a police officer and asked, “Do you have something in your waistband?” a source said.

Blackwell responded: “Yeah, I got something,” pulled his gun and fired two to three shots into the car at the corner of 212th St. and 104th Road, hitting Moore in the face, the source said.

The woman who lives in the house where Blackwell fled said she heard the gunshots.

“When I came outside, all I heard (the officer) saying . . . ‘Partner, please stay with me.’ I saw him pick up his radio and call it in,” she said.

Cops nabbed Blackwell, who has nine prior arrests, including two for assaulting officers, at the home about 90 minutes after the attack.

Andre Tucker, 26, who also lives at the house where Blackwell was busted, said the suspect was one cool customer — hiding in plain sight just feet from the crime scene.

“(Blackwell) was hanging out for an hour and a half, smoking cigarettes and talking like everything is normal,” Tucker said.

He, Blackwell and others stood in the front yard gawking at the growing manhunt until cops ordered them all to go inside.

[…]

Blackwell, a cousin of former Giants cornerback Kory Blackwell, went to prison on an attempted murder conviction after firing into a car in July 2000 following a robbery. He was released from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate Dannemora in June 2008.

Blackwell was also wanted by authorities on a criminal mischief charge stemming from an incident last November in which he threw bricks at the windows of a house while toting a gun, police said.

Moore was the fifth NYPD officer shot since December. Two of the victims, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, were assassinated by the same cop-hating madman.

Israel, with its long and painful history of contending with terrorism, is rich with examples that prove this contention. In recent years, armed citizens have stopped dozens of terrorists. In some cases, those citizens acted when cowardly police officers shrank from danger.

For instance, on March 6, 2008, a terrorist disguised as a delivery man entered the Merkaz Harav seminary in Jerusalem with an assault rifle hidden in a television box. He opened fire on students studying in the library.

Two beat cops arrived on the scene but failed to enter the building to stop the killing.

In the event, a seminary student armed with a handgun, and an off duty infantry officer who lived in the neighborhood, heard the shots and ran to the seminary. The student, a young rabbi, was armed with a handgun; the officer was carrying his assault rifle. Both men ignored the police officers who told them not to go inside. They entered the building and killed the terrorist, ending the massacre. By the time they arrived, eight students, including five high school students, had been killed, while eight more were wounded.

The most recent Palestinian terror campaign, which lasted more or less from October 2015 through April 2016, showed the need for an armed citizenry. In two major attacks in Tel Aviv, the terrorists, armed with rifles were able to kill at will for several minutes because none of the civilians at the sites of the attacks were armed.

In contrast, terror attacks in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, which took place during the same period, were repeatedly stopped at their outset by armed civilians who ran to the scene within moments.

In response to the public outcry, Public Security Minister Glad Erdan slightly loosened restrictions on eligibility for gun licenses and encouraged citizens with gun licenses to carry their weapons wherever they go.

Erdan’s move to loosen restrictions on eligibility for gun permits shone a light on an aspect of Israeli life of which foreigners are largely unaware.

The widespread conception in the U.S. in particular is that Israeli gun laws are liberal. This is incorrect. Israel has strict gun laws. But at the same time, it has mandatory conscription in the military.

Active duty combat soldiers on leave are often required to take their weapons home with them. Soldiers who do not own gun safes large enough to store their assault rifles are required to take them everywhere they go. As a result, tourists often happily snap pictures of young Israelis carrying assault rifles at restaurants and nightclubs.

Israel’s gun laws are the nightmare of Second Amendment champions. To be eligible for a gun license in Israel you must be 21 years old and a military veteran, or 27 years old.

Only people who meet specific criteria are eligible to apply for gun permits. Israelis who live or work in communities defined as at-risk from a national security perspective by the government can apply for gun licenses. Farmers, tour guides, and people who transport hazardous materials are permitted to carry a gun. Military officers and NCOs on active duty may carry a personal handgun. Veterans of special forces units and other elite security services are permitted to carry a gun. Retired senior officers are entitled to carry a gun.

To receive a weapons permit, you must first undergo weapons training at a certified training facility and receive a health certification from a licensed physician.

If you are healthy and are eligible, you may receive a gun permit. That permit enables you to own and carry one handgun and fifty bullets.

Shotgun and rifle ownership is limited to veterinarians, nature preserve employees, and licensed hunters. These weapons may only be used for animal control.

However, whereas in the U.S. most states do not permit armed citizens to walk around with their weapons exposed, Israel has no such restrictions on its gun owners. Gun owners may carry their weapons openly or in a concealed manner, whichever they prefer.

Whereas private ownership of firearms is constrained, public use of firearms is more widespread. Every school in Israel is guarded by an armed security guard. Everyone entering a school has to pass through a manned, secure entrance.

Armed guards escort all school trips everywhere in the country.

Armed guards and metal detectors are stationed at the entrance to every underground parking lot, every supermarket, every hospital, every shopping mall, and every hotel in Israel.

All major public events need to be approved by the police. The organizers need to secure the perimeter of their events in coordination with the police. As a result, most of the mass shooting attacks that happened in the U.S. and Europe in recent years would have been much more difficult to carry out in Israel. For instance, the truck ramming attack on Bastille Day in Nice in 2016, in which an Islamic State terrorist killed 86 and wounded 458, would not have been possible in Israel.

In Israel, police would have cordoned off the entire area where the event took place. No trucks would have been permitted to enter the perimeter and likely no unauthorized vehicles would have been permitted to enter the perimeter. Moreover, security guards and metal detectors would have been deployed at all entry points to the event.

The massacre outside the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino in Las Vegas last year would also have been more difficult, if not impossible, to have carried out in Israel.

A security officer at the entrance to the hotel would have stopped the shooter from bringing his weapons and ammunition into the building.

If the killer had managed to smuggle his weapons into the hotel, and had begun shooting, it would have taken hotel security officers very little time to identify the source of the fire, enter his room, and stop him.

Israel bars gun ownership from mentally ill individuals. While there are a lot of illegal weapons in Israel – particularly in the Arab community – there is no legal way for someone who is mentally ill to acquire a weapon lawfully.

Despite the vast differences regarding the private ownership of weapons, there are two lessons from Israel’s experience that may be significant for Americans searching for ways to stop mass shootings.

The first lesson that Israel can offer relates to tactics for minimizing the risk of attack. Americans can learn from the Israeli model of controlling entry and exit points from schools and other public facilities; from Israel’s ban on guns to the mentally ill; and from its unapologetic policy of profiling terror suspects.

The second lesson from Israel’s experience that bravery is a vital social virtue.

Like millions of Americans, Israelis are brave. Because they are brave, they stand up to terrorists. When they have guns, they stand up to terrorists with guns. When they lack guns, they stand up to terrorists with whatever they have.

In February 2017, a group of citizens outside a sewing machine repair shop in Petah Tikva in central Israel stopped a terrorist who had been shooting and stabbing bus passengers by throwing sewing machines at him.

In January 2016, a mom-and-pop grocery store owner in a small town in Judea blocked two knife-wielding terrorists from entering his store by pushing them out with a shopping cart.

A society that values bravery can rely on its citizens to be brave more easily than a society that values victimhood.

Israel’s restrictive gun laws are a function of many aspects of Israeli society that are very different from conditions in America, including its powerful central government, its socialist roots, and its large Arab community.

Israel’s tragic history with terror attacks has required Israel to learn how to secure all public spaces and deploy forces to major civilian thoroughfares. And it has also taught Israelis to be brave."

The incident occurred approximately one week after 17 people were shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

The Sacramento Bee reported that the symbol was widely discussed and one student’s comments that the square root symbol “looked like a gun” fueled speculation of a “terroristic threat.”

KATC TV3 tweeted:

Is this what things have come to?? 😔 — Scott J. (@cajunsj) February 22, 2018

Police went to the student’s home and searched it but found “no guns or any evidence that he had any access to guns.” Moreover, the Bee indicated they found “no evidence the student had any intent to commit harm.”

The Allen Parish Sheriff’s Office observed, “The student used extremely poor judgment in making the comment, but in light of the actual circumstances, there was clearly no evidence to support criminal charges.”

On November 29 Breitbart News reported that the HPD had sent letters to about 30 medical marijuana cardholders ordering them to surrender their guns within 30 days. KITV pointed out that the letters informed cardholders to “surrender weapons, permits, and ammunition to HPD or to transfer ownership.”

The Honolulu Star reported that police have been sending letters throughout the year and the one dated November 13 was signed by HPD chief Susan Ballard. It informed cardholders that their “medical marijuana use disqualifies [them] from ownership of firearms and ammunition.”

The Associated Press reports that the HPD is reviewing the policy after it “sparked backlash from residents.”

Although federal law prohibits firearm purchases by persons who use marijuana, Dr. Clifton Otto said the HPD “cannot justify taking firearms away by citing medical marijuana use as a violation of federal law.” He suggested “federal scheduling of marijuana does not apply for medical use in Hawaii.”

However, on August 31, 2016, Breitbart News reported that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a ban on gun ownership for medical marijuana users as constitutional. The decision came in light of the fact that marijuana use remains illegal on the federal level, whether state-sanctioned or not. This means medical marijuana cardholders cannot pass background check form 4473 and, therefore, cannot legally purchase a firearm.

Does this also mean cardholders cannot keep firearms that they currently possess? That is the question with which the HPD is grappling.

The legislation supported by the NRA is the Hearing Protection Act, a bill which removes suppressors from the auspices of the National Firearms Act (1934) in order to streamline the process law-abiding citizens must go through to purchase one. The current process requires a would-be buyer to be fingerprinted, photographed, and submit to a background check. Moreover, the buyer has to pay the federal government a $200 tax and register the suppressor with the ATF. The entire process takes six to eight months. The Hearing Protection Act would change this, allowing law-abiding citizens to buy suppressors by simply passing the same background check they pass to buy a gun at retail.

In an editorial titled “Echoes of Gunfire Hurt Tender NRA Ears,” NYT said:

The National Rifle Association argues, self-servingly, that noisy guns are a public health hazard. With supporters like President Trump’s son Donald Jr., …it wants to roll back an 80-year-old federal law that tightly controls the sale of firearms silencers. Immune to irony, the NRA’s congressional friends have introduced a measure called the Hearing Protection Act, which contends that the sound of gunfire is hard on the ears of gun owners.

They then make claims similar to those put forward by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Gabby Gifford’s gun control group, and others, saying, “When it comes to public health, the noisier a gun is the better the chances for innocent bystanders to hit the ground and for police officers to apprehend the shooter.”

It is interesting to note that on March 20–four days before the NYT regurgitated the argument of Gillibrand and others–The Washington Post rejected claims that firearm suppressors will allow guns to be used criminally without detection. WaPo give Gillibrand’s claims three Pinnochios, indicating such claims contain “significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions.”

“[T]he Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable,” he wrote. “They should try winning an election. Sad!”

Trump suggested that the media was bored with the Russia investigation, saying that investigations over his campaign’s collusion with them were a “total hoax.”

Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2018

“The only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia,” he added.

Trump has gone to war against the Michael Wolff book, calling into question it’s accuracy.

“I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!” Trump wrote on Thursday night. “I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.”"
breitbart114,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-03-27 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2017/03/27/canadian-researchers-more-education-gun-control-needed-to-curb-unintentional-firearm-injuries/,"Canadian researchers, who released a study showing “one child or youth” is shot every day in Ontario, suggest more public health education and gun control are key ways of curbing the frequency of the incidents.

The study was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ).

The researchers involved with the study believe more gun laws are needed at this time, including a focus on gun storage. Researchers also intimate that unintentional firearm injuries are tied to a lack of education in general, not simply firearm education.

The researchers note:

Household gun ownership increases the risk of unintentional firearm injuries. The lower rates of unintentional firearm injuries observed among nonrefugee immigrants may relate to low rates of firearm ownership by immigrants, residence in urban areas and selection policies for immigrants to Canada who are highly educated. The increasing risk of firearm injury with longer time spent in Canada highlights one area for possible public health education and consumer regulation around gun safety and storage.

It is interesting to note that Canada already has stringent gun control laws. Breitbart News reported that Canadian gun laws include criminal background checks, mental background checks, and licensing requirements for gun ownership.

Canada also requires checks to ensure the would-be gun owner does not have a history of or familial proclivity to domestic abuse. Additionally, the University of Sydney’s GunPolicy.org reports that the would-be gun owner has to demonstrate a good reason for owning a gun, his “spouse, partner, or next of kin” has to be interviewed, and “third party character references” have to be submitted to the licensing authority.

Even with all these controls, researchers want more. They believe Canadians who jumped through myriad hoops for law-abiding gun ownership now need to face more “regulation” on gun storage.

Breitbart News has long contended that gun control is insidious. And once a nation, province, or U.S. state — like California or Washington — manages to expand background checks on law-abiding citizens, the appetite for more gun laws remains insatiable.

According to California Health Report, state lawmakers designated $5 million to launch the center. Napolitano said:

The state’s decision to provide public funding for a center to study firearm violence — the first of its kind in the nation — demonstrates great leadership by the state and presents a unique opportunity for the University of California to be at the forefront of researching a growing public health issue.

While researchers at the Sacramento campus will be the driving force behind looking at guns through the prism of public health, Napolitano “expects scientists at the other UC campuses to contribute to the research,” as well.

“The center will train post-doctoral researchers, such as epidemiologists or physicians, who want to study violence. And it will issue small grants to scientists across the country who are conducting firearm-violence prevention research.” The center will be guided by “an advisory board,” which consists of elected officials, law enforcement personnel, and academics.

Jones estimates he has taught over 5,000 people across Oklahoma.

According to Fox News, the course Jones teaches “takes eight hours and includes lectures that cover handling a weapon, Oklahoma laws regarding gun ownership, and shooting in self-defense.” The course also includes “practice at the instructor’s private range and a 15-question exam.”

When asked about the often-state Christian maxim of turning the other cheek, Jones intimated that Christians are called to turn the other cheek if attacked while preaching the gospel. However, a Christian is not called to turn the other cheek when their loved ones’ lives are in jeopardy or even when their own lives are exposed to peril via a home invader, public attacker, or murderer. In that situation, a Christian’s duty is to fight to defend life.

Jones put it this way: “We will turn the other cheek. I’m the least likely guy to pull out a gun in a fight. But we will not turn the other cheek if you’re going to assault my family or cut off my head in the process.”

He points to two examples from Oklahoma, one in which a woman was mauled to death by two dogs and another in which a woman was stabbed to death at work by a former employee. He asked, “[What] if they’d had a legal gun and been trained to use it?” And referencing the woman who was stabbed, Jones said, “Can you imagine what went through her mind the last few minutes of her life?”

Jones wants Christians to understand that defenseless is not a virtue.

In the understatement of the decade, the “About” section on the RoyJonesConcealedCarry Facebook page says, “Roy offers concealed carry handgun certification classes. These classes are not your typical gun class.”

breitbart117,breitbart,['Bob Price'],2015-06-29 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/06/29/passenger-discharges-firearm-at-texas-airport-check-in-counter/,"HOUSTON, Texas – A man preparing to depart Houston on a Delta Airlines flight discharged a firearm he prepared to put in checked luggage. No one was injured in the incident and airport operations were not interrupted.

The man approached the Delta Airlines ticket-counter at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), Terminal A, prepared to check his bag, said IAH spokesman Bill Begley in a phone conversation with Breitbart Texas. Following TSA procedures, the ticket agent asked the man to open the gun case and demonstrate that the weapon was clear and safe for check-in. During this examination process, the firearm discharged. The gun was still in the case at the time of the discharge and no one was injured.

Houston Police spokesman John Cannon told Breitbart Texas they were called at 2:10 p.m. on Monday and notified that a firearm had been discharged. Officers responded and conducted an investigation. The gun was a .45 caliber handgun that did not belong to a law enforcement officer, Cannon said.

“We detained the suspect and contacted the Harris County District Attorney’s Office,” he explained. “The District Attorney’s Office accepted charges of Deadly Conduct, a Class A misdemeanor.”

Cannon said the suspect, whose name has not yet been released, is being detained at the airport police office and will eventually be transported downtown for processing. The police department expects that formal charges will be filed sometime overnight, Monday night.

The status of whether the suspect is a licensed Concealed Handgun License holder has not yet been revealed. Authorities have also not released the exact type of handgun other than to say it was a .45 caliber.

The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) lists the procedures for checking a firearm in your luggage. That information can be found on the TSA website. It includes the following instructions:

All firearms must be declared to the airline during the ticket counter check-in process.

The term firearm includes:*Please see, for instance, United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 44 for information about firearm definitions. Any weapon (including a starter gun) which will, or is designed to, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. The frame or receiver of any such weapon. Any firearm muffler or firearm silencer. Any destructive device.

The firearm must be unloaded. As defined by 49 CFR 1540.5 – “A loaded firearm means a firearm that has a live round of ammunition, or any component thereof, in the chamber or cylinder or in a magazine inserted in the firearm.”

The firearm must be in a hard-sided container that is locked. A locked container is defined as one that completely secures the firearm from being accessed. Locked cases that can be pulled open with little effort cannot be brought aboard the aircraft.

If firearms are not properly declared or packaged, TSA will provide the checked bag to law enforcement for resolution with the airline. If the issue is resolved, law enforcement will release the bag to TSA so screening may be completed.

TSA must resolve all alarms in checked baggage. If a locked container containing a firearm alarms, TSA will contact the airline, who will make a reasonable attempt to contact the owner and advise the passenger to go to the screening location. If contact is not made, the container will not be placed on the aircraft.

If a locked container alarms during screening and is not marked as containing a declared firearm, TSA will cut the lock in order to resolve the alarm.

Travelers should remain in the area designated by the aircraft operator or TSA representative to take the key back after the container is cleared for transportation.

Travelers must securely pack any ammunition in fiber (such as cardboard), wood or metal boxes or other packaging specifically designed to carry small amounts of ammunition.

Firearm magazines and ammunition clips, whether loaded or empty, must be securely boxed or included within a hard-sided case containing an unloaded firearm.

Small arms ammunition, including ammunition not exceeding .75 caliber for a rifle or pistol and shotgun shells of any gauge, may be carried in the same hard-sided case as the firearm, as long as it follows the packing guidelines described above.

TSA prohibits black powder or percussion caps used with black-powder.

Rifle scopes are not prohibited in carry-on bags and do not need to be in the hard-sided, locked checked bag.

The bill–SB 1122–covers the private sale of private property in general and includes firearms as part of that property.

The NRA-ILA reports, “[SB 1122 would] prevent the state of Arizona, a county, city or town government from requiring a person to access or facilitate access to any state, federal or third party database as a condition of selling, gifting, donating or transferring personal property.”

SB 1122 is designed to shield Arizona residents from compliance with universal background checks, should a future administration work with a Democrat-controlled Congress to secure them.

Universal background checks exist at the state level in places like California, Washington state, and Colorado, and require every gun sale–retail or private–to be conducted via the auspices of a government representative. That representative–a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL)–does a background check on the buyer of the firearm, thereby creating a paper trail on guns that may have spent decades on grandpa’s nightstand rather than a retailer’s shelf.

Such checks allow the federal government to continue accumulating the names and addresses of all gun owners, as well as information on the types of guns owned.

SB 1122 would protect Arizona gun owners from participating in a broadened federal attempt to expand the paper trail on firearms.

breitbart119,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-05-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/05/28/nssf-suppressor-event-daniel/,"Last week the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) held an event in Manassas, Virginia, focused on the hearing protection offered by firearm suppressors.

Suppressors and firearms from Daniel Defense and Sig Sauer were used at the event, which was designed to be hands-on. This means the reporters and writers who were present got to shoot every firearm and use every suppressor at the range.

Breitbart News attended the event, which drew attention to the suppressor legislation contained in the Hearing Protection Act. That Act was put forward by Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) on January 9. It is focused on the hearing protection offered by firearms suppressors–protection that far exceeds that provided by ear plugs or muffs–and eliminating many of the cumbersome steps to suppressor acquisition, thus streamlining the gun owner’s process of getting the hearing protection he needs.

NSSF focused on these major points:

Firearm sound suppressors reduce, but do not eliminate, the noise of gunfire to levels safer for one’s hearing. It is legal to own a suppressor in 42 states, and legal to hunt with a suppressor in 40 of those 42 states. Although suppressors are already legal in over 4 out of 5 states, they “are rarely used by criminals.” Instead, they are used as “important safety devices” that provide hearing protection and “help reduce noise complaints against [gun] ranges.” The Hearing Protection Act would not completely deregulate but sale of suppressors but would eliminate “the current onerous process,” which means “the purchase of a suppressor would follow the same rules as the purchase of a firearm including an FBI background check.”

Sig Sauer’s Jared Hillis was on hand to discuss his company’s firearms and suppressors. He said, “The biggest misconception that I’ve heard is that everybody thinks that it is going to make the firearm completely silent, which is just not true. What it’s doing is it’s regulating the gases coming out the end of the barrel, so there’s not that big [explosive], concussive over-pressure happening. But it still sounds like a gun shot.”

Daniel Defense’s Lee Thompson said, “For a lot of people, their only exposure to… sound suppressors is from the media; from Hollywood movies, television, and that’s not the most accurate representation of how the product actually works. Gun muzzle blast is an extremely loud event, a sound suppressor dampens that to some extent but it does not completely eliminate it. It is still a loud event.”

Reporters and writers gathered at Elite Shooting Sports and were able to shoot the firearms without suppressor and then with a suppressor attached, in order to see the difference first hand. They were also able to shoot firearms which are integrally suppressed, which means the suppressor is an nondetachable part of the firearm itself.

The firearms attendees were able to sample included various offerings from the gun makers including the the a Daniel Defense DDM7 variant, Sig Sauer MPX 9mm, Daniel Defense DDM4 ISR, and Sig Sauer 227 and MCX 300 Blackout. Suppressors for each of the firearms were on hand as well.

breitbart120,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-10-22 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/22/telegraph-u-s-top-country-gun-ownership-not-even-top-10-firearm-deaths/,"On October 22 The Telegraph published a map showing the U.S. leads the world in private firearm ownership but does not even crack the Top 10 when it comes to firearm-related deaths.

According to the Telegraph, the countries with highest per-capita gun ownership are:

USA – 112.6 guns per 100 residents Serbia – 75.6 Yemen – 54.8 Switzerland – 45.7 Cyprus – 36.4 Saudi Arabia – 35 Iraq – 34.2 Uruguay – 31.8 Sweden – 31.6 Norway – 31.3

Note–the Telegraph presents gun ownership as so expansive in the U.S. that guns actually outnumber people. Yet the U.S. does not appear on the list of the Top 10 countries for firearm-related deaths. Those countries are:

Honduras – 67.18 per 100,000 residents per year Venezuela – 59.13 Swaziland – 37.16 Guatemala – 34.1 Jamaica – 30.72 El Salvador – 26.77 Colombia – 25.94 Brazil – 21.2 Panama – 15.11 Uruguay – 11.52

The map and the accompanying Telegraph article were drawn from the Small Arms Survey and the 2012 Congressional Research Serrvice Report. As Breitbart News previously reported, the CRS report shows privately owned firearms jumped from 192 million in the U.S. in 1994 to 310 million in 2009. At the same time, the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” rate–which was 6.6 per 100,000 Americans in 1993–fell to 3.6 per 100,000 by 2000. Gun sales continued to surge and the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” rate fell to 3.2 in 2011.

Think about it–as gun ownership rose, the murder rate plummeted in the U.S. Couple that with the fact that only one of the Top 10 countries for gun ownership is also in the Top 10 for firearm-related deaths–Uruguay is number eight for gun ownership number 10 for gun deaths–and the point is clear: More guns correlate with less crime.

The bill was introduced by over two dozen Democrats, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).

According to the Hill, Feinstein released a statement with the legislation, saying, “We’re introducing an updated Assault Weapons Ban for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.”

Missing from Feinstein’s statement is an admission that the bill targets the kind of rifle which NRA member Stephen Willeford used to end the attack. As Fox News’ Tucker Carlson said on Tuesday, “He was armed with an AR-15, that’s exactly the sort of rifle we’ve been told must be banned to keep us safe.”

In addition to this, the gun control bill pushed by Feinstein would not have stopped the Texas church shooting, as the bill allows persons with AR-15s and similar rifles to keep those rifles. Moreover, it allows persons to transfer such rifles to other people as long as a background check is passed. Kelley possessed an AR-15 because he passed a background check for it.

This latest “assault weapons” ban also contains a ban on bump stocks, even though a bump stock was not used in the Texas church attack. It appears the Democrats decided to bundle a bump stock ban with an “assault weapons” ban in hopes of securing one or the other.

Neither ban would have prevented the Las Vegas attack or the Texas church attack, although the absence of a bump stock may have made the Vegas attacker more accurate, thereby leading to even more deaths as he opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

The video showed Hamilton wearing ear and eye protection while shooting an AR-15 at a target down range, but some Formula One fans reacted negatively because the video appeared “just hours after a gunman” illegally used a different kind of gun to carry out an attack on a train in France.

According to Mail Online, car sponsor Mercedes addressed the video and photographs without criticizing Hamilton, suggesting he pay better attention to “what is happening out there in the world.” But some Formula One fans were not so forgiving.

For example, the Mail cites readers from The Sunday Mirror who responded to the video and photographs by writing, “‘F**k! You are a fool. Take a police car and leave F1.” Another wrote, “Now Lewis Hamilton—a role model for youth—publishes a video with him shooting rifles with pleasure. C’mon Champ, that is not cool.”

But Hamilton made no excuses. He responded to the criticism by saying, “‘I went to the shooting range, shot some fun targets. It was a lot of fun.”

Spike’s Tactical is located in Apopka, Florida.

The AR-15 is listed as The Crusader Rifle on the manufacturer’s website, described as a “lightweight mid-length rifle,” built to be used for tactical applications or for competition. The words of Psalm 144:1—”Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle”—are etched upon the right side of the gun’s lower, while a cross and shield are etched upon the left side.”

Along the AR-15’s safety lever are the Latin words “Pax Pacis” (Peace), “Bellum” (War), and “Deus Vult” (God Wills It). Peace is the gun’s safe position while “War” is the gun’s fire position.

According to WTSP 10 News, Spike’s Tactical spokesman Ben “Mookie” Thomas explained why the company decided to create the Crusader:

Right now and as it has been for quite some time, one of the biggest threats in the world is and remains Islamic terrorism. We wanted to make sure we built a weapon that would never be able to be used by Muslim terrorists to kill innocent people or advance their radical agenda.

Among the stated reasons for their opposition, lawmakers cited that the ban would “interfere with Second Amendment rights” by disrupting the ammunition market far beyond M855 sales and/or restrictions.

In the letter, the lawmakers pointed to ongoing and broad-based efforts to restrict or fully ban lead ammunition throughout the country. This effort is occurring at federal and state levels.

With this war on traditional ammunition already underway, lawmakers indicated an additional ban on M855 rounds under the ATF’s fluctuating “framework” for what constitutes “armor piercing,” which is certain to “inhibit the development and use of rifle ammunition containing non-lead materials.” Under typical conditions, this could result in an ammo shortage, but amid the buying frenzies that result from fear of a political war on firearms and firearm supplies, a shortage on all types of AR-15 ammo is all but certain.

According to lawmakers, this disruption in the ammunition market interferes with Second Amendment rights.

It is a backdoor means to gun control, which, in lieu of banning guns, bans the ammunition with which the guns operate.

Kelly, gun-control proponent and husband to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, recently purchased an AR-15 (an “assault weapon,” he called it)–which he now says he intended as an illustration of the need for more stringent gun laws.

Kelly reportedly bought the AR-15 and a 1911-style semi-automatic pistol at a gun store in Tucson, Arizona.

Breitbart News received a tip on this when Neil McCabe, editor of Guns & Patriots newsletter, contacted us on March 7 and said:

Mark E. Kelly, made purchases which included an AR-15–sometimes described as an “assault rifle”–at 3:30 pm on the afternoon of March 5 at Diamondback Police Supply, 170 S. Kolb Street, Tucson, AZ.

According to McCabe, witnesses to the purchases claimed Kelly purchased “high capacity” magazines as well.

On March 6, McCabe contacted Kelly’s gun control group–“Americans for Responsible Solutions”–and on March 8 they replied that his message had been passed on to colleagues who handle press requests. Breitbart News then began investigating the details surrounding the purchase, including visiting the gun store.

Suddenly, Kelly announced on his Facebook page that he was not going to keep the AR-15, which he has yet to pick up from the store.

Days after making the purchases, Kelly wrote on Facebook:

I just had a background check a few days ago when I went to my local gun store to buy a .45. As I was leaving, I noticed a used AR-15. Bought that too. Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes. I don’t have possession of it yet but I’ll be turning it over to the Tucson PD when I do.

Testifying to the Senate Judiciary Committee Jan. 30, Kelly had urged senators to restrict sales firearms based on their lethality–a common refrain with other witnesses that day, who argued that semi-automatic weapons, which chamber subsequent rounds as bullets are fired, and other guns with military-style features level the playing field against law enforcement.

Kelly and Giffords founded their own advocacy group to restrict gun rights, Americans for Responsible Solutions, in January. On its website, ARS wrote: “High capacity magazines are a deadly factor in gun violence.” A 30-round magazine is considered a high-capacity magazine.

The ARS website says: “Congress should act to limit the sale of high capacity magazines, which are not needed for hunting or self-defense, but have proven very lethal.”

Similarly, the ARS website says: “Congress should act to limit the sale of assault weapons.

In February, Kelly told Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace that lawmakers need to address “assault weapons.” He said the purpose of an “assault weapon” is “to kill a lot of people very quickly,” and he lamented that such products were “too readily available.”

Kelly has not commented on whether he will also return the .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol he purchased.

breitbart127,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-03-16 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/16/five-great-ar-15-rifles/,"Below is a list a five great AR-15 rifles. The five vary in appearance, due to accessories, finish, etc., and they also vary in price, due to the variation of accessories and differences in materials and levels of craftsmanship involved in building and tuning the rifles.

All are AR-15s, and all five can be relied upon to deliver the shooting experience that owners of AR-15 rifles have come to love through the years.

Bushmaster XM15-E2S — This is a classic AR-15 with no accessories. It is a great AR for those purists who want the old, fixed buttstock — nothing adjustable here — and a fixed rear sight as well. The rear sight aperture is adjustable, but the sight itself is built into the carry handle, thus fixed. The gun has a 20-inch barrel, is accurate, and is certainly durable.

The XM15-E2S weighs 8.6 pounds.

The XM15-E2S is no longer in the Bushmaster catalog, but a used one can be acquired for around $750.

Smith & Wesson M&P15 Sport — The Sport is somewhat of a throwback AR, in that the style is very basic. Apart from the Magpul rear sight and telescopic buttstock — which lets you choose between 6 different positions for rifle length — the Sport is pure old-school AR without any bells and whistles. It does come with a 30-round magazine, but beyond that, the Sport’s key characteristics are dependability, accuracy, and durability.

As for durability, while it is smart to clean and maintain your firearms regularly, the Sport, which I had shot for an extended period of time, appeared not to care less. The gun operated flawlessly, regardless of whether it had or had not been cleaned at proper intervals.

The Sport weighs 6.45 pounds.

Because the Sport is bare bones, it is one of the more affordable ARs on the market. Suggested retail for a new Sport is $739.

Colt LE6920 — The Colt LE6920 is a civilian version of the Colt M4, a gun countless military personnel have relied on for safety during times of war and tumult. The LE6920 comes with a Magpul rear sight and various other Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) parts — including MOE SL handguards, MOE SL carbine stock, MOE SL pistol grip, and MOE vertical grip. The buttstock is position adjustable, like the stock on the Smith & Wesson M&P15 Sport.

The LE6920 weights 6.9 pounds.

Many AR-15 fans view the Colt as the only AR they will own because of the company’s rich history with the military. That is certainly another selling point for the rifle. The gun is extremely accurate and a pleasure to shoot.

Suggested retail on a LE6920 is $999.

SIG516 Patrol — Sig Sauer’s 516 Patrol comes with a SIG adjustable buttstock and a SIG grip and handguard. It has flip-up adjustable iron sights, front and rear, and comes with a 30-round magazine. The 516 Patrol handguard is aluminum and presents four M1913 Picatinny rails where various accessories can be added — lights, lasers, a vertical tactical grip, etc.

The SIG516 weighs 7.3 pounds.

The 516 Patrol is accurate and smooth in its operation. It is more refined than some of the other ARs on this list, and the price reflects that. The price on a new 516 Patrol is approximately $1250 to $1299.

Daniel Defense DDM4 V1 — The V1 takes AR-15 refinement to the next level. Whereas the Bushmaster XM15-E2S is at one end of the spectrum — capturing the essence of the AR-15 for the shooters who are purists — the V1 is at the other end of that spectrum, demonstrating everything an AR-15 can be in the hands of a person well-acquainted with it and trained in tactical usage.

The V1 is also just a heck of a lot of fun to shoot.

Daniel Defense makes their own accessories/furniture for their rifle, so the V1’s buttstock is made by Daniel Defense, as is its pistol grip, rail panels, handguard, sights, flash suppressor, etc. The V1 is a precision weapon and you know it as soon as you pull the trigger.

The V1 weighs 6.7 pounds.

Suggested retail on the V1 chambered in 5.56 is $1799.00.

breitbart128,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2015-03-22 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/22/democrat-to-meet-with-new-atf-director-to-revive-ar-15-ammo-ban/,"Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) plans to meet with incoming ATF director Thomas Brandon and talk to him about reviving the AR-15 ammo ban on the M855 round.

Breitbart News previously reported that current ATF director B. Todd Jones tendered his resignation on March 20 in the wake of the AR-15 ammo ban backlash and will be relinquishing his office at the end of the month. At that time, his deputy director, Brandon, will be taking the agency’s reins at that time.

According to The Hill, Israel wants to meet with Brandon to encourage the agency to revive the ban. Israel is convinced Jones handled the ban “sloppily,” which led to the ban being pulled. He “[hopes] under new leadership the ATF can have a more transparent and responsive process” than during the failed ban push.

On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.) says Jones’ departure marks the end of the AR-15 ammo ban. Moreover, he said “the departure of Jones is further proof the ATF should be eliminated.”

breitbart129,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-11-22 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/11/22/movie-producer-giving-away-ar-15-honor-texas-church-attack-hero-stephen-willeford/,"Movie producer J.P. Johnston is giving away a DPMS AR-15 on Christmas Day to honor Stephen Willeford’s courageous stand against Texas church attacker Devin Kelley.

After being alerted to gunshots at the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Willeford ran out of his house barefooted with an AR-15 and a handful of bullets to confront Kelley, ultimately shooting him and forcing him to flee the scene.

Johnston’s AR-15 giveaway is happening as his new film, The Reliant, is about to be released in theaters. The film stars Kevin Sorbo, Brian Bosworth, Mollee Gray, and Eric Roberts. It focuses on faith and family. It presents a scenario where”the economy collapses, widespread rioting and looting leaves a 19-year-old lovesick girl struggling to care for her four younger siblings in a stretch of woods on the outskirts of their burning town, wondering why a good God would let this happen.”

It features family members standing in defense of other family members, and using guns to do it.

The Reliant was written to deal with gnawing questions like, “Why do bad things happen to good people?” The goal of the film is to answer such questions “in a memorable, entertaining way that honors God, satisfies the conscience, and strengthens your faith.”

Standard Newswire reported the AR-15 giveaway and asked producer Johnston why he would give away the type of gun used by the Texas church attacker.

Johnston posited Stephen Willeford’s heroic use of the same gun as the reason. He added:

Who knows how many Sunday services the murderer [Devin Kelley] would have visited if it weren’t for the courage of Stephen Willeford. But his courage wouldn’t have amounted to much more than a brave death if it weren’t for the Second Amendment. Our forefathers knew that arms in the hands of the law-abiding was necessary to protect against criminals and tyrants. That’s why they secured this right in the Bill of Rights, and required our leaders to take an oath to uphold and defend it.

Johnston says, “The Reliant is subtle, yet relevant and winsome in its defense of the right to keep and bear arms.”

breitbart130,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-08-03 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/08/03/oregon-reverend-won-ar-15-destroy-may-face-charges/,"The Oregon reverend — who spent $3,000 in church funds to win an AR-15 so he could destroy it — ended up giving the gun to a parishioner “for safe keeping” and may now face charges for failure to perform a background check.

Oregon instituted universal background checks in the spring of 2015, and those require a check for every sale — private or retail — as well as transfers.

On July 27, Breitbart News reported that Reverend Jeremy Lucas — Christ Church Episcopal Parish, Oswego, Oregon — won an AR-15 after using discretionary church funds to buy 199 raffle tickets in the rifle giveaway. His plan was to win the gun and destroy it, but he changed his mind, deciding instead to have an artist turn it “into something symbolic.” He said, “I want it to be a symbol where we take something destructive, because a gun can never be constructive, and turn it into something else.”

In the interim, he passed the gun to a parishioner and may now face charges.

According to Oregon Live, Oregon State Police “are looking into the case.” OSP Capt. Bill Fugate said, “Lake Oswego police had asked them to look into the case.” But he stressed that “the investigation was still in its infancy stages.” He said OSP has “multiple troopers who investigate weapons transfers,” but he was not made aware of Reverend Lucas’s actions until August 1.

If Lucas is convicted of “an unlawful transfer of a weapon, a misdemeanor, he could face a maximum fine of $6,250 and up to a year in jail.”

breitbart131,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-06-17 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/17/armed-citizen-captured-ga-cop-killers-loaded-every-weapon/,"The Rutherford County, Tennessee, resident who captured Donnie Rowe and Ricky Dubose, the suspected Georgia cop killers on Thursday, said, “I loaded every weapon I could” after becoming aware of a high-speed chase and “gunfire on nearby Interstate 24.”

The resident, 35-year-old Patrick Hale, had just loaded his family into the car to get out of the path of the killers when they walked upon him.

According to the Tennessean, Hale saw the two men cross a fence “about three hundred yards away from his back door.” He said, “I prayed like I have never prayed before.” He then backed out of the driveway with a gun “on him” and his family in the car. While backing up, he realized the men had already closed the distance and were waving frantically, trying to get him stop.

He slowed and said the two convicts reached his driveway, then “started to surrender.”

Hale said:

I began to slowly back up as they came closer. At that point, I realized I had two ex-cons wanted for murder who just shot at law enforcement and nothing to lose. And for some reason, they started to surrender and lay down on their stomachs on my concrete driveway. If that doesn’t make you believe in Jesus Christ, I don’t know what will.

Hale called 911 and said deputies arrived within three minutes.

Holly Morelock, who works in the area in which Hale lives, said, “I feel like it was a good thing. When you mess around out here in the county, most of us here have carry permits and carry (weapons). And it’s our job to protect our families and our homes.”

Speaking of Patrick Hale and his family, Morelock said, “And I’m very proud of the family … because they didn’t just turn around and mind their own business. They did what they had to do to protect everybody else around.”

breitbart132,breitbart,['Chris Tomlinson'],2017-01-25 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/01/25/police-warn-future-islamic-state-chemical-weapon-attacks/,"The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has warned that Islamic State may deploy chemical weapons in future terror attacks in Europe.

The BKA claim the threat of chemical weapons attacks have been overlooked and Islamic State supporters and other Islamists “are willing and able to procure large quantities of chemicals”. The BKA report says chemical weapons could be used in attacks similar to the 1995 Tokyo sarin gas subway attack or used to poison water supplies, Kronen Zeitung reports.

According to the BKA, other chemical attacks could occur on the food supply or on the transportation of hazardous chemicals themselves. The report, which was presented to the German government, advocates for better safety precautions for those who transport and handle dangerous chemicals as well as safety measures to mitigate the effects of potential attacks.

The BKA has heightened concern over chemical weapons after reports have come from Syria indicating Islamic State has been working on its own chemical weapons programme. According to some reports, Islamic State has already carried out 52 chemical attacks in Syria.

The fears of the BKA are also backed up by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls who said in November, “We know that there could also be a risk of chemical or biological weapons”.

In December 2015, the European Union parliament released a report claiming Islamic State had employed people capable of creating chemical and biological weapons writing, “In August 2014, a laptop owned by a Tunisian physics and chemistry graduate fighting with ISIL/Da’esh in Syria was found to contain a 19-page document on how to develop bubonic plague from infected animals and turn it into a weapon”.

The possibility of Islamic State smuggling chemicals and other dangerous materials to Europe could also be enhanced by reports they are slowly taking over, and profiting from, the people smuggling trade which has become a new source of revenue after their oil sales were largely cut off by Russian and American air strikes.

Chemical attacks have long been a concern for authorities after the September 11th, 2001 attacks. Shortly after, envelopes containing anthrax were mailed to the offices of several politicians and news outlets. Five people died due to exposure to the substance and the perpetrators were never identified, though assumed to be linked to terror groups.

The most infamous chemical attack occurred in 1995 on a Tokyo subway in which members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo released sarin nerve gas on a packed subway train killing 12 and severely injuring 50 others."
breitbart133,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-02-15 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/02/15/assault-weapon-requirements-withdrawn-california-doj/,"California’s Department of Justice has repealed “assault weapon” regulations it had submitted to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for the purposes of enactment without public comment.

The NRA and the California Pistol and Rifles Association sent a letter to the DOJ which pointed out “flaws in the regulations” and pledged legal action if the regulations were not withdrawn.

According to NRA-ILA, “It is unclear exactly why the DOJ [recalled the regulations], however it can be surmised that the NRA-CRPA legal letter likely prompted the move.

NRA-ILA previously reported that the regulations were an attempt to piggy back more “assault weapon” requirements on the back of expanded “assault weapon” ban rules signed by Governor Jerry Brown (D) in July 2016. “The regulations were submitted to OAL as ‘File and Print’ only, meaning DOJ [claimed] that the regulations [were] expressly exempted by statute from public comment or OAL review.”

The regulations were compiled in a way that read “like a wish list” for gun control advocates. The regulations included:

Excessive personal information requirements for registering a firearm, requirements that individuals provide information on where they acquired their firearms, requirements that individuals provide DOJ with photos of their firearms, requirements for serializing firearms built from 80% receivers, expansion of the “assault weapon” definition to bullet-button equipped shotguns, and restrictions on removing the “bullet-button” once the firearm is registered as an “assault weapon.”

But the regulations have now been recalled. The prospect of a defending them in a pro-gun legal climate overseen by Attorney General Jeff Sessions was not appealing.

A photo on Twitter by photojournalist Bob Daemmrich (Twitter: @bobphoto) shows a man in police custody near the SouthPark Medows shopping center polling location on the south side of Austin. The man is dressed in black except for a red baseball cap. The black t-shirt has Arabic-seeming writing on the front that purports to say, “F*ck Isis.” The incident reportedly occurred Tuesday morning at about 11 am.

A few minutes later Daemmrich tweeted that while he did not personally witness the incident, the man had reportedly pulled an “assault rifle” out of his car.

I didn’t see it but witness reported pulling an assault rifle out of his car — bobphoto (@bobphoto) November 8, 2016

That action, in and of itself, would not be illegal in Texas unless the man did so in a manner to cause alarm or if he was within 100 feet of the polling location, a gun free zone.

Daemmrich told Breitbart Texas the man was eventually release by police and that he had no further information about the incident The hat was said to be an HEB hat.

Breitbart Texas reached out to the Austin Police Department to learn if the man had been arrested or if any other action was taken. Police officials were in the middle of a “network crisis” with their systems and could not readily obtain any information about the incident. The spokesperson promised to update Breitbart Texas when information became available.

The incident comes on the heels of a Breitbart Texas report on a possible FBI investigation into “online chatter on terrorist websites” which mentioned possible attacks in Texas, New York, and Virginia. The FBI reportedly interviewed three Muslims in Texas about the reported threat.

Texas officials reported on Friday they had been warned by national security officials about the potential for an attack on Texas and the other states before the Tuesday General Election.

“My office is working with law enforcement officials and we are continuing to monitor the situation in close coordination with the Texas Department of Public Safety,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “Texans should go about their daily lives as usual, but remain vigilant over the next several days and report any suspicious activity to state or local law enforcement. The State of Texas will continue to do everything it can to ensure the safety and security of its citizens.”

Mario Granados-Alvarado, 18, an El Salvadorian illegal immigrant, was arrested by agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after he was released days before by Montgomery County, Maryland, which prides itself on being a sanctuary city.

ICE officials said upon Granados-Alvarado’s release by Montgomery County, they placed a detainer on the illegal immigrant, which requests that the locality keep the suspect in custody until federal immigration officials can take over the case.

“Keeping people safe means not tolerating the release of aliens that present a clear public safety threat back into our communities,” said ICE Field Director in Baltimore Dorothy Herrera-Niles said in a statement. “ICE is committed to fostering positive collaboration with our local law-enforcement partners, and welcomes changes from county officials that would prioritize public safety.”

In March 2014, U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested Granados-Alvarado in Falfurrias, Texas, after he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico Border. At the time, he was issued a notice to appear before an immigration judge.

Most recently, though, Granados-Alvarado was arrested after it was discovered that he brought a stolen AR-15 onto the property of Albert Einstein High School, along with a car that he allegedly stole. Police say the illegal immigrant stole the rifle days before from a police vehicle.

Granados-Alvarado is now awaiting deportation.

This assertion runs counter to the official report of the Connecticut State Police, who list semi-automatic weapons–rather than automatic ones–as those used by Lanza.

According to the police report, Lanza used a Glock 10mm handgun, a Sig Sauer P226 9mm handgun, and a Bushmaster AR-15 style .223 rifle, all three of which are semi-automatic.

Obama brought up Lanza in a discussion of gun control laws recently enacted in Colorado. “[T]he issue of gun violence is something that has haunted families for way too long,” the President lamented, “and it is possible for us to create common-sense gun safety measures that respect the traditions of gun ownership in this country and hunters and sportsmen, but also make sure that we don’t have another 20 children in a classroom gunned down by a semiautomatic weapon — by a fully automatic weapon in that case, sadly.”

In the push for expanded gun regulations following Sandy Hook, Senate Democrats led by Dianne Feinstein (CA) wanted a ban on “assault weapons,” a term describing rifles like AR-15s which cosmetically look like automatic weapons but function far differently.

Feinstein’s assault weapons ban will not be included in the Senate’s gun control bill and will have to face a vote as its own amendment, which effectively dooms its chances of passage."
breitbart137,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-07-01 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/07/01/assault-weapons-ban-firearms-licensing-did-not-stop-terrorist-with-ak-47-in-istanbul-airport/,"Turkey, which recently suffered an attack in the Istanbul airport by a terrorist with an AK-47, has a complete prohibition on private ownership of semiautomatic rifles, firearm licensing requirements, and background checks.

In American leftist lingo, an AK-47, a type of semiautomatic rifle, is an “assault weapon.” AK-47s are completely banned from private possession. That, however, did not keep a terrorist from getting one. And that alone highlights the foolishness of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wisc.) pursuit of more gun control following the June 12 Orlando terror attack.

In fact, the gun controls in Turkey are so strict that a terrorist in position of an AK-47 only highlights what we should have already learned from Chicago–namely, that gun control empowers wicked people, while making law-abiding citizens vulnerable.

According to The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy.org, Turkey’s gun controls are “restrictive.” In addition to the semiautomatic rifle (“assault weapon”) ban and firearms licensing, Turkey has background checks that are so invasive an applicant undergoes an examination of his “criminal, mental health, domestic violence, medical and addiction records.” If an applicant passes all aspects but a “likelihood of family violence” is discovered, the license is denied.

Moreover, the licensing requirement to own a firearm is complemented by a licensing requirement to own ammunition–and “authorities” maintain a record of both.

This is what “restrictive” looks like, and one of the three terrorists who struck Istanbul’s airport was carrying an AK-47.

France has “restrictive” controls, as well, yet 12 were shot and killed at Charlie Hebdo headquarters on January 7, 2015, and terrorists shot 130 to death on November 13.

Here’s the lesson: Gun control does not keep bad guys from getting guns. Rather, it keeps law-abiding citizens unarmed.

Ron Paul (R-TX) suggested the chemical weapon earlier this week blamed on the Syrian government could be a false flag.

Paul went as far to say there was zero chance Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to blame because it wouldn’t make sense for him to use chemical weapons at this point in time.

“I looked at The New York Times to get the explanation, and they said ‘Worst Chemical Attack In Years In Syria, U.S. Blames Assad,'” Paul said. “So it is all over and done with? But it is not quite so easy, is it? What happened four years ago in 2013? You know, this whole thing about crossing the Red Line. And ever since then the neo-cons have been yelling and screaming — even part of the administration has been yelling and screaming about Assad using poison gasses on his people four years ago. Not quite true. It was never proven.”

“[I]t doesn’t make any sense for Assad under these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gasses,” he continued. “I think there is a zero chance he would have done, you know, this deliberately. But we could also go ask a famous Senator who is famous for foreign policy. We could go ask John McCain to explain it. And he found somebody to blame. And I don’t know why he has it in for the president.”

“McCain says blame Trump,” Paul later added. “It is all Trump’s fault because he hasn’t been aggressive enough.”

Moreover, the Times points out that the threat posed by the private ownership of “assault weapons” is mythological in comparison to FBI stats on the actual use of such guns in crime.

According to the NYT, America was “suffering from a spike in gun crime…in the early 1990s” so “Democrats created and banned [an entire] category of guns.” The ban lasted from 1994 to 2004 and although crime fell during that time, a “detailed study found no proof” the decline was due to the ban.

Hard numbers showed the percentage of “assault weapons” recovered by police during the ban only rose from 1 percent to 2 percent.

On top of all this, the Times points out that “assault weapons” are not the gun of choice for criminals anyway–and never have been. “In 2012, only 322 people were murdered with any kind of rifle, FBI data shows.” And as Breitbart News reported on January 15, 2013, deaths in which an “assault rifle” were involved constituted less than .012 percent of the overall deaths in America in 2011.

The New York Times did report one clear outcome of the “assault weapons” ban in 1994–Democrats got creamed at the polls in November.

The Daily Mail reports Trevor’s South African mechanic stepdad, Abel Shingange, shot the comedian’s mother Patricia at their home in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2009 and, believing she was dead, attempted to find a then-25-year-old Noah while armed with a handgun.

The Daily Show heir’s grandmother tells the Mail Noah escaped with his life only because he was hard to find. In an exclusive interview with the British site, 88-year-old Nomalizo Noah said:

After shooting the mother Abel went around with a gun trying to find Trevor, but Trevor was always here, there and everywhere, performing on stage, you never knew where he was. So when Patricia’s husband began to hunt him he couldn’t find him… They are very lucky to be alive, thank you to God, Abel was a horrible, horrible man, I hated him.

Trevor’s former stepdad was reportedly often violent and sometimes beat his mother with old bicycle frames and slapped her in public. In 2009, his actions were near fatal after he became jealous that Patricia was engaged to her current husband, a man named Sfiso Khoza, the site reports.

“I was shot in the face and back. The bullets went through the nose and passed my jugular and one narrowly missed my spine,” she told the Mail. “I am lucky to be alive. When God writes he has to write for humans and he gives you a message that God is bigger than death.”

She was rushed to the hospital and credits Noah with footing the bill for her private health care.

“I was very grateful. The minute Trevor paid for me in that hospital, to go private, my prayer was that after three days I’m out of this hospital,” she said.

Noah grew up in poverty in the Soweto township in South Africa and was named in honor of his mother’s favorite Hollywood star: John Travolta.

“Trevor was the closest I could get to Travolta,” she told the site.

The son of a white Swiss father and a black South African mother, Noah reportedly struggled growing up in the divided country. Children in the slums allegedly screamed whenever they saw him, because they had “never seen anything like him.”

Jon Stewart handpicked Noah this week as his Daily Show successor. He became a regular contributor only four months ago.

The 31-year-old South African came under fire from critics on both the left and the right of American politics Tuesday when old posts surfaced from his Twitter account, which many determined to be racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic.

The suspected gunman was able to ran away after the attack. Police later apprehended the shooter.

UPDATE, Jan. 8, 12:00 CST: Mexican Investigators with Jalisco’s Attorney General’s Office, have confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the suspected shooter has been identified as a 31-year-old man from India who then became a naturalized U.S. citizen.

The suspected shooter, Zafar Zia, was arrested by Mexican authorities as part of the investigation into the attack. At the time of the arrest, authorities seized a .38 caliber handgun, an automobile with California license plates and a wig that is believed to have been used at the time of the attempted murder.

According to authorities, Zia had moved to Guadalajara in November 2016 from Phoenix and had been residing in the city since. The apparent motive for the attempted murder appears to have been a disagreement over an undisclosed visa process.

Original Story Continues:

Authorities in this state have identified the shooting victim as Christopher Ashcraft, a consular agent with the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara, Jalisco.

A security video obtained by Breitbart Texas shows the moment when Ashcraft walks to a booth to pay for parking in the shopping center. The consular agent carryied a gym bag and was dressed in a manner that led authorities to believe that he was leaving a local gym inside the shopping center. The video shows a man wearing dark blue shirt and pants similar to a nurse’s Authorities following Ashcraft.

A second video shows the man in blue walking in circles as he awaits for Ashcraft’s vehicle. When the consular agent arrives at the exit of the parking lot, the gunman pulls a handgun from his pants pocket and fires a single shot at the consular agents vehicle before running away.

Authorities revealed to Breitbart Texas that the gunman had been using a hat or a wig, mustache, glasses and gloves during various stages of the crime — such as when he followed Ashcroft, during the shooting, and when he fled the scene.

The diplomat was left bleeding inside his compact vehicle until medical personnel arrived. An ambulance transported him to a local hospital. Ashcraft’s vehicle had consular license plates BCC0911 from Mexico’s Foreign Relations Secretariat.

Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigations arrived at the shopping center to go over the crime scene and take copies of the surveillance videos. A second team of agents rushed to the San Javier Hospital where Ashcraft was undergoing emergency surgery. Medical personnel confirmed that the consular agent was shot in his right midsection.

For security reasons, Ashcraft will be sent back to the U.S. while authorities continue to look into the failed assassination attempt. The consular agent served in the Guadalajara Consulate since March 2016. Authorities announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gunman and any accomplices.

On Friday morning, officials with the Jalisco Attorney General’s Office confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the suspected gunman had been arrested.

[Warning: Violence, Strong Language]



The Compton rapper posted a video to his Facebook page in which he appears bloodied and seemingly dazed by the alleged shooting.

“Got shot. I guess I’m really a rap n**ga now, I just got shot,” Royal says to the camera.

In an earlier post, Royal explained what happened:

“Yes me and the homies got shot at couple days ago,” the rapper wrote. “AK47 bullet flew past my head and I was hit with the bullet fragments, 3 frags stuck in my forehead for life. They stopped right on my skull before they could enter my brain… GOD IS REAL YALL ! I should’ve died that night but I felt God move me back just enough for the bullet to miss. Take this life shit serious ! I was almost on a T-shirt I’m just blessed enough to be here for a reason, can’t nobody stop Gods plans.”

Royal also posted what appeared to be an X-ray of his head showing the location of the bullet fragments.

Royal didn’t immediately respond to Breitbart News’ request for comment."
breitbart143,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-10-03 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/10/03/jimmy-kimmel-didnt-cry-nearly-59-people-shot-month-chicago/,"During the opening monologue on Monday’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, host Jimmy Kimmel cried over the Las Vegas attack, pushed for more gun control, bad-mouthed Republicans, but did not say a word about the number of innocents gunned down in Chicago every month.

Kimmel rightly lamented the “59 innocent” who are dead as result of the Las Vegas attack, but there was a not a peep about the nearly 59 a month on average that have been killed year-to-date in Chicago in 2017.

The Chicago Tribune reports that the current death toll for Chicago 2017 sits at 527.

Moreover, Kimmel’s monologue contained no lamentations for the more than 63 individuals who were killed on average every month in Chicago during 2016 (the Chicago Tribune reported a total of 762 murders for 2016). And nothing was said for the nearly 4,400 victims who were shot and wounded during 2016.

But Kimmel suggests Republicans ought to be ashamed for not passing more gun control now.

Chicago is a tough one for the left because all the gun control imaginable has been tried–including an all-out ban on handguns — so Chicago is actually a case study in the ineffectiveness of gun control; an example of how murder numbers rise when strict gun control laws are in place.

For example, the handgun ban was instituted from 1982 to 2010 and Breitbart News reported that the death toll was much higher during that time. Chicago Police Department reports show there were 850 homicides during 1993. That is nearly 100 more homicides in 1993 than the 762 homicides for 2016. Moreover, the Chicago Police Department shows there were 930 homicides in 1994; 921 homicides in 1991; and a startling 940 homicides in 1992. If you break these figures down by averages, it means over 78 individuals were killed every month in 1992, 70 were killed every month in 1993, and 77 were killed every month in 1994.

Where is the hand-wringing for these deaths?

We should mourn every innocent life that was taken in Las Vegas and we should be outraged at the animal who took those lives. But we should also be broken over the death that continues to mark Chicago and we should be outraged at the vestiges of gun control that continue to make the acquisition of self-defense handguns a difficult proposition.

Starr County officials confirmed to Breitbart Texas that a trooper was apparently struck by a stray bullet from a gun battle taking place across the Mexican border. The shooting took place near Roma, Texas, an area immediately north of Miguel Aleman.

The trooper was airlifted to a hospital in McAllen where he is expected to recover.

UPDATE 3:15pm local time

Law enforcement officials confirmed to Breitbart Texas that a U.S. Border Patrol agent was shot as well but his duty-issued ballistic gear protected him.

Federal and state authorities are looking into the case to determine if the shots were in fact a stray bullets from a gun battle on the Mexican side or if they were purposely aimed at law enforcement.

Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Johnny Hernandez confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the trooper was shot in the leg. He is undergoing tests and is expected to recover.

Breitbart Texas will provide more updates as they become available.

Chicago 5 reports that the boy was wounded in a shooting that left an adult dead and a teenager injured. The adult was a 27-year-old female who was “shot in the head” and pronounced dead at the hospital. The wounded teenager is 19. The four-year-old boy was shot in the arm and treated at the hospital.

The shooting occurred around 5:19 pm Friday and marked gun-controlled Chicago’s first homicide of the weekend.

On July 29 Breitbart News reported that Chicago exceeded 400 homicides this year, placing the city on track to tie or surpass the nearly 800 homicides witnessed last year. The Chicago Tribune reported that it was only four years ago that “Chicago didn’t record 400 homicides until just before Thanksgiving Day.”

Gun-controlled Chicago surpassed 1,000 shooting victims for the year before the month of April was over. Yet in the face of the dismal failure of gun control, Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s (D) response was more gun control. On April 24 Breitbart News reported that Emanuel was pushing more controls on Federal Firearms License holders (FFLs). In other words, his response to gang and street crime is to punish gun dealers who attain a federal license to sell guns and who perform a background check for every gun they sell.

Note to Emanuel—criminals are not buying their guns from FFLs. A study by the University of Chicago Crime Lab shows that criminals in Chicago avoid buying guns anywhere that draws attention to the purchase. This means they avoid gun show purchases, internet purchases, or purchases from licensed, brick & mortar gun stores. The Chicago-Tribune quoted crime lab co-director Harold Pollack, saying, “[The study shows] some of the pathways [regarding guns] people are concerned about don’t seem so dominant.”

The Chicago Tribune reports the number of shooting victims January 1 through January 30 is 302; this includes fatal and non-fatal shootings. The number of homicides alone is 54, which means the city has averaged 1.8 killings a day every day this year.

On January 23, Breitbart News reported that shootings and murders for January 1 through January 22, 2017, were up markedly over the number of shootings and murders for the same period in 2016. According to the Tribune, “At least 228 people were shot in Chicago [January 1 through January 22, 2017].” That was an increase of 16 victims above the number shot during the same period in 2016. There were “at least 42 homicides,” marking a “23.5 percent … [increase from] the 34 homicides from the same period in 2016.”

This news follows the grim report that gun-controlled Chicago had nearly 4,400 shootings and almost 800 murders.

During a January 25 interview with ABC News, President Trump described gun-controlled Chicago as a “war zone.” He also took to Twitter to make clear he is sending in the feds if city leaders fail to rein in the “carnage”:

If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017

Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL-4) and other Democrats derided Trump’s observations, rather than seeing the violence as a reason to support arming law-abiding citizens for self-defense.

(AP) — Authorities say a man opened fire on a police officer investigating a report of a damaged vehicle in south Georgia and was wounded when an officer returned fire.

Valdosta Police Chief Brian Childress says the officer also was wounded, but both men are expected to survive. He says the officer was shot “multiple times” but is going to be fine.

The suspect was not identified. Childress would not discuss a possible motive.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman Scott Dutton says one of the shots hit the officer in the abdomen, just below his protective vest. Other shots hit the officer’s vest. Dutton said it’s early in the investigation, but there’s nothing to indicate that the shooting was related to the ambush of police officers in Dallas."

The former NRA instructor engaged Devin Patrick Kelley as he exited the church.

“I’m no hero. I’m not,” Stephen Willeford told 40/29 News reporter Joshua Cole in a video interview on Monday. “I think my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills I needed to do what needed to be done.”

“I just wish I could have gotten there faster,” Willeford said in an emotional interview. “I didn’t know. I didn’t know what was happening.”

Willeford told Cole the experience was surreal. “I was scared,” he said. “It was surreal to me–it couldn’t be happening.”

After hearing the “pop pop pop pop” sound that was all too familiar to a former NRA instructor, Willeford said he grabbed his rifle and quickly loaded rounds into his magazine. When he stepped out onto the street, he saw a man wearing all black, a tactical helmet, and a ballistic vest.

“I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots – just ‘pop pop pop pop’ and I knew every one of those shots represented someone, that it was aimed at someone, that they weren’t just random shots,” Willeford explained. “He saw me and I saw him.”

He said he took cover and did what he had to do.

Texas officials reported in a press conference Monday night that Devin Patrick Kelley, the killer of 26 in the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, was struck by Willeford’s gun fire two times–once in the torso and once in the leg.” He then dropped his rifle, got in his car, and fled the scene before he could shoot any other people who were outside the church.

Willeford then stopped a passing neighbor and asked for help. “That guy just shot up the Baptist church,” he told the driver. He climbed in the car and together, they took off in pursuit of the deranged killer.

They eventually caught up to Kelley’s SUV shortly before he crashed into a road sign. They later learned Kelley shot himself in the head after calling his father.

Willeford and his companion shouted at Kelley to get out of his truck. There was no movement.

Willeford’s family has lived in the unincorporated Texas community of Sutherland Springs for four generations. Many of those who died or were wounded were friends of his.

He says he is not a hero–others are sure to disagree.

Other segments of the video interview can be viewed at 40/26 News."
breitbart149,breitbart,['John Nolte'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/02/22/cnn-tapper-face-intense-criticism-anti-gun-show-trial/,"CNN’s anti-gun town hall event and its left-wing moderator, Jake Tapper, are facing widespread criticism over what many saw as a bullying “show trial.”

Tapper is being singled out for much of the criticism from those who say he remained silent as abusive personal attacks were hurled at Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch. Incredibly, Tapper also remained silent as his audience booed a rape victim.

At the Wednesday night spectacle, those in favor of protecting our Second Amendment civil rights were vastly outnumbered by an audience packed with hostile gun-haters and emotional questioners, including children.

According to various reports, the anti-gun participants were given scripted questions crafted by CNN. The last-place network has denied this by attacking a school shooting victim as a liar. His accusation, however, is credible given CNN’s long and disturbing history of using plants.

Throughout the hour, the audience heckled, howled, and poured derision on Loesch and Rubio. Other than admonishing his audience for calling Loesch a “murderer,” Tapper stood by in silent approval as abuse and personal attacks rained down on his outnumbered guests.

The Media Research Center writes, “Jake Tapper sat back as the wild crowd targeted … Rubio with boos and jeers… The wildest moment allowed by Tapper was when Parkland, Florida student Cameron Kasky smeared the Senator by equating him to the shooter that killed 17 of his classmates. And Tapper thanked him for all of it.”

Specifically, this is what Kasky snarled at Rubio, “Senator Rubio, it’s hard to look at you and not look down the barrel on an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz[.]”

Tapper then thanked Kasky.

Actor Adam Baldwin was one of many who compared the event to a “show trial.”

Jake Tapper is in danger of losing control of this show trial. — Adam Baldwin (@AdamBaldwin) February 22, 2018

CPAC panel on the media calls last night’s CNN town hall on guns a “Trotskyite show trial against the Second Amendment"" — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) February 22, 2018

Tapper faced even more intense criticism for allowing the 17-year-old Kasky to bring Loesch’s children into the debate by attacking her as a mother.

“I wish I could have asked the NRA lady [Loesch] a question,” Kasky said to Rubio. “I would ask her how she can look in the mirror, considering the fact that she has children[.]”

As the crowd burst into cheers, Tapper muttered something about “What was that, I’m sorry?” The crowd roared on.

“Absolutely despicable behavior by Parkland student Cameron Kasky … question[ing Loesch’s] motherhood and whether she cares about her children,” tweeted Curtis Houck, managing editor of Newsbusters. “Jake Tapper does nothing. How un-American. Simply unacceptable[.]”

Houck attached video of the moment to his tweet:

Others chimed in over the left-wing Tapper’s silent approval:

Disgusting. After Tapper stayed silent last night when Dana Loesch's kids were attacked and threatened now they attack a survivor and call him a liar. — Evan G. (@Evan_G1126) February 22, 2018

God, such rudeness and disrespect shown to Dana Loesch. Booing, hostile yelling as she speaks…Jake Tapper not controlling the crowd on purpose. CNN Town Hall is an agenda driven joke. pic.twitter.com/0CbgQNDfJE — SeaMonkey (@OldSalt45) February 22, 2018

At the CNN Town Hall, Jake Tapper sat back while a disrespectful punk compared Marco Rubio to Nikolas Cruz and questioned if Dana Loesch cares about her children. Yes, the joke of a “journalist” and liberal puke Jake Tapper did not say a damn word. Slime. #StudentsStandUp — Mike (@mike_Zollo) February 22, 2018

Tapper, who likes to present himself as male feminist, also chose to remain silent when the audience booed a rape survivor who now supports the Second Amendment.

Journalist Mike Cernovich compared the night to a “Two Minute Hate,” an event in George Orwell’s “1984” where the elite deflect from their own sins by allowing people to pour out their loathing and hostility on an innocent person or symbol.

Rubio looked weak The audience cheered banning guns One person looked really nasty, attacking a mom Tapper and CNN showed their agenda, no pretense of dialogue, it was 2 Minutes Hate Loesch looks great, held court. Rubio looked weak and will never be POTUS#StudentsStandUp — Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) February 22, 2018

Another viewer summed the event up as “abusive.”

The country is democracy which means majority rule! It is NOT ruled by who yells the loudest or who protest the most or by intolerant obnoxious abusive crowds at a @CNN event. The “Town Hall” further demonstrated the lefts inability to have a civil debate or discussions! — P M W Family (@PMWellsFmly) February 22, 2018

CNN and Tapper, a former Democrat operative and Salon contributor, have faced growing criticism over the climate of hate (detailed here) the network frequently manufactures against Trump and his supporters, or anyone on the right — oftentimes through fake news.

For example, although debunked, Tapper continues to spread lies about Trump mocking a reporter’s disability. He also spread fake news with false claim that the president did not offer his condolences after a mosque shooting. While Tapper frequently attacks others over their tone and rhetoric, he does so while ginning up hatre against Trump by smearing the president as “un-American,” “unhinged,” and “unmoored.”

Tapper has yet to apologize for his behavior or to the rape victim, he also has not disavowed Kasky’s personal attacks or the behavior of the audience.

breitbart150,breitbart,['John Nolte'],2018-02-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/02/21/criticism-grows-cnns-use-children-push-anti-gun-agenda/,"The far-left cable channel CNN is facing a growing storm of criticism over its frequent use of minor children (14 to 17) to further its anti-gun agenda.

Already a number of the children, those who witnessed last week’s shooting massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida, have made countless appearances on the anti-Trump cable network. In furtherance of its anti-gun propaganda push, CNN’s anti-Trump pundit, Jake Tapper, will host a town hall Wednesday night featuring these children.

Many, however, see CNN’s use of these minors as an act of partisan exploitation that is not only immoral, but also not good for the mental health of children so soon after they have witnessed such a traumatic event.

Appearing on Fox News, the Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway said, “There’s been unfortunate media handling of these traumatized children. They’ve used them as ways to enact what they always like to do, a gun control agenda,” she said before referencing CNN’s upcoming town hall. “These children aren’t forcing their ways on to CNN, town halls, or covers of magazines. Media is choosing them to put there, to shut down debate and keep people from having a conversation about gun control.”

Truth Revolt also singled out CNN. “[The children’s] outrage is more than understandable after witnessing a mass shooting and fearing for their lives, but it’s shameful that CNN, and many other leftist outlets, would exploit them over and over again online and on-air to push the media’s gun control agenda. ”

The Federalist asks, What if putting “traumatized teenagers” on TV is “not healthy?”

“But what if putting traumatized teenagers, mere days removed from a shocking and life-changing event, in front of cameras and crowds is not healthy? Have we thought that through,” the Federalist asks, before closing with this, “Leave the kids alone. It’s our job to lead, not theirs.”

In her syndicated column, Michelle Maklin writes, “Many [of these children] may be exceptionally smart, passionate, and articulate beyond their years, but they do not possess any semblance of wisdom because they have not lived those years. Their knowledge of history, law, and public policy is severely limited … And their moral agency and cognitive abilities are far from fully developed.”

She adds, “Most are in no position to change the world when they can’t even remember to change their own bedsheets … Yet, [Lawrence] Tribe relishes the opportunity to hide behind the young Parkland activists headed to CNN’s propaganda town halls[.]”

At National Review, Ben Shapiro writes, “CNN plans a full primetime special with the victims’ classmates, parents, and community members … What, pray tell,” Shapirios asks, “did these students do to earn their claim to expertise? They were present during a mass shooting, and they have the right point of view, according to the Left.”

Singling out CNN, Shapiro points out that “There’s a reason that producers at CNN are eager to put [high school] junior Cameron Kasky in front of the cameras: He says things like ‘You’re either with us or against us.’ It seems a stretch to think that if Kasky were instead advocating for more armed school security, CNN would be breaking into its primetime lineup to air his views.”

Talking about CNN and other left-wing news outlets, National Review’s Dan McLaughlin writes, “’I’m never in favor of the whole spectacle of using kids as political props, which both sides do, but it’s one thing when it’s relatively benign stuff — a politician campaigning with his family … Those aren’t efforts to use kids as human shields against hard questions being asked in a serious public-policy debate.”

Hot Air’s John Sexton believes CNN is feeding these traumatized children talking points: “Perhaps what’s most striking is how closely some of [student Emma Gonzalez] points seem to mirror talking points tweeted out a couple days earlier by, wait for it, CNN. It’s almost as if CNN is feeding the students information for the events it then covers as the authentic voice of the students.”

Sexton also worries if CNN is exploiting these kids to promote its agenda. “Is it odd to anyone else that a CNN news story about student gun control efforts features a segment promoting CNN’s own town hall event? Is CNN reporting here or promoting an agenda?”

When Tapper himself, the former Salon writer and host of CNN’s upcoming anti-gun town hall, was criticized for “using traumatized teenagers,” he avoided the subject by accusing his critic of lying.

Twitter user @kengardner11 tweeted to the left-wing Tapper, “Using traumatized teenagers who don’t even yet know enough to have coherent political views as emotional props to push a particular political agenda is not healthy or logical.”

Tapper fired back with a non sequitur: “You said something demonstrably false and now you’re trying to change the subject.”

Gardner replied, “Um…really? What did I say that you claim that was demonstrably false? Demonstrate it to me. But focus on what I actually said.”

Tapper was then forced to change the subject, arguing that Gardner accused him of bias. When Gardner challenged Tapper to point out where he did this, Tapper abruptly shut down the discussion. “[T]his doesn’t seem a conversation you’re trying to have in good faith, so adios! Have a great weekend,” Tapper snarked.

Um…really? What did I say that you claim that was demonstrably false? Demonstrate it to me. But focus on what I actually said. If you do, this won’t take long. — Ken Gardner (@KenGardner11) February 18, 2018

I was about to answer this again — it was about how just a few hours ago i was defending a kid who spoke in favor of having his teacher armed. The point was people shouldn’t attack; they should debate. But now I see your other tweets about me. So I don’t really see the point. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 18, 2018

You suggested i would never voice such support for anyone who publicly took a conservative position. I literally had done so minutes before. But again, this doesn’t seem a conversation you’re trying to have in good faith, so adios! Have a great weekend. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 18, 2018

Tapper’s intellectual dishonesty has been the typical response from CNN to those criticizing the last-place network for using children, who are obviously traumatized, as a means to push its anti-gun agenda.

Rather than address the actual issue at hand — Is it appropriate to use children as young as 14 in this way? — CNN manufactures arguments its critics did not make or focuses on straw men, like a few conspiracy theorists claiming these children are actors.

CNN has yet to address the matter directly or to bring mental health experts on the air to discuss it.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) declared Monday that Congress ought to follow the example of Emma Gonzalez, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who spoke out for gun control after last Wednesday’s shooting.

“It’s time for Congress to have the same courage and compassion as Emma Gonzalez and the parents, students, and faculty at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It’s time to stand up to the gun lobby,” Harris tweeted.

In her speech at a gun control rally on Saturday, Gonzalez accused President Donald Trump of being bought by the National Rifle Association (NRA). After a tearful introduction, she launched into a set of talking points familiar from gun control campaigns nationwide.

CNN posted a transcript of her remarks, a portion of which follows:

Every single person up here today, all these people should be home grieving. But instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see. Since the time of the Founding Fathers and since they added the Second Amendment to the Constitution, our guns have developed at a rate that leaves me dizzy. The guns have changed but our laws have not. … Because Australia had one mass shooting in 1999 in Port Arthur (and after the) massacre introduced gun safety, and it hasn’t had one since. Japan has never had a mass shooting. Canada has had three and the UK had one and they both introduced gun control and yet here we are, with websites dedicated to reporting these tragedies so that they can be formulated into statistics for your convenience. … We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He [the shooter] would not have harmed that many students with a knife. … If the President wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association. You want to know something? It doesn’t matter, because I already know. Thirty million dollars.

Pollak'],2018-02-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2018/02/19/pollak-please-name-one-new-law-stop-mass-shootings/,"The mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week has caused shock and grief to the entire nation.

The left is, as usual, demanding gun control — and it has enlisted several students from the school in its cause.

(Actually, the students are, like the rest of America, divided on the issue, but apparently only the students who support gun control are earning national media headlines and support from politicians and parents.)

One can understand the desire to do something — anything — to prevent another terrible event, but once again it is unclear what law or regulation would stop mass shootings.

Outlawing “assault weapons”? Automatic weapons are already largely illegal, and are not involved in most mass shooting events. The last “assault weapons” ban did nothing to stop mass shooting events — including Columbine.

Banning the AR-15 — a single-pull, single-shot weapon falsely described as an “assault weapon”? The Charleston shooter murdered his victims at the church with a handgun. Stephen Willeford, the hero who stopped the Texas church shooter last year, did so with an AR-15 rifle.

Gun violence restraining orders (GVROs)? These arose in California after the Isla Vista shooting in 2015, to allow relatives of a troubled person to have police take their guns away. But these orders are only temporary. The Sandy Hook shooter’s mother gave him his guns. And in Parkland, the parents who took the killer in had no idea he was so troubled. They told reporters that he had been showing improvement, and thought they had locked his guns away.

Improved background checks? That might help, although that solution depends on the ability of the bureaucracy to manage databases properly, which it failed to do in the case of the Texas shooter, who never should have been able to buy a gun. And just as in Parkland, many other mass shooters, including Islamic terrorists, have previously been reported to law enforcement or the FBI, but have either been ignored, or have been left alone after a brief inquiry.

As Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Breitbart News last week, “there are signals and signs before these shootings that, if recognized, could lead to intervention, and could stop these events from occurring.” They are being missed.

So — what new gun laws or regulations would actually prevent mass shootings?

There is one possibility, but the left will not allow us to try it: namely, allowing teachers to carry guns.

Last year, five largely rural California school districts adopted policies to allow teachers with concealed carry permits to bring their weapons on campus, so that they could respond to any active shooting situation that might arise, and — more likely — deter one from happening.

In response, the Democrat-dominated California legislature passed, and Governor Jerry Brown signed, a law to “delete the authority of a school district superintendent, his or her designee, or equivalent school authority to provide written permission for a person to possess a firearm within a school zone.”

We will never know if the districts’ policy would have helped prevent shoot shootings because California Democrats never gave it a chance.

And so, thanks to Democrats and the media, we are reduced to debating gun laws and regulations that we know would not have prevented the shooting in Parkland, or elsewhere.

The best that can be said of these ideas is they might prevent future mass shootings. But most new gun controls would also come at the heavy cost of infringing a fundamental constitutional right, and of stripping law-abiding citizens of the ability to defend themselves.

Although the March is officially titled “March for Our Lives,” BuzzfeedNews reports the march is indeed focused on securing gun control:

Florida shooting survivors announce March For Our Lives on March 24 in support of gun control: ""We've been hearing is that it's not the yet time to talk about gun control…so here's the time we're going to talk about gun control, March 24."" pic.twitter.com/jWG9ZbXoy2 — BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) February 18, 2018

ABC News reports that South Broward High School students have already begun rallying for gun control, with Sophomore Genesis Campbell leading chants while holding a sign that read, “No more silence, end gun violence.” And this all comes after Nikolas Cruz complied with gun control to acquire a rifle, then carried that rifle into a gun-free school zone and opened fire, killing 17.

Actress and gun control advocate Julianne Moore praised the students for pressuring Congress to act:

This is an exciting and important moment. On March 24, students are leading marches in DC & across the country to demand that lawmakers do their jobs and take action to prevent gun violence. Get involved: https://t.co/u4MKGLpoZR #MarchForOurLives @Everytown — Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) February 18, 2018

Josh Gad voiced support for the gun control march as well:

We are all sickened by what happened in FL last week, but we cannot ignore these tragedies any longer. I am so inspired to see the students of Parkland & kids all over this country standing up to the status quo. On March 24, we march. Join us. #MarchForOurLives @MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/2v3yABKYn3 — Josh Gad (@joshgad) February 18, 2018

Singer Justin Bieber gave a shout-out to March organizer and high school junior Cameron Kasky, tweeting:

Cameron good talking to you last night. All of your bravery is amazing. I stand with you guys. #march24 #marchforourlives https://t.co/oKG8MmhzaI — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) February 18, 2018

And Alyssa Milano tweeted:

Milano tweeted within hours of the February 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas High, asking NRA members to demand “sensible gun control.” She did not say what such gun control might be, but the “sensible” gun control pushed by Hollywood and Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control groups has historically been background checks. But the Florida school gunman passed a background check.

breitbart154,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2018-02-15 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/15/gun-store-owner-there-are-far-more-lethal-weapons-than-an-ar-15/,"A USA Today column presenting the AR-15 as the end-all be-all for mass shooters was politely disrupted by a gun store owner who told the paper that there are far more lethal weapons than the AR-15.

Because of this, the column, which hinged on quotes from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, actually served to undermine the left’s hysteria-charged perception of AR-15 rifles.

For example, USA Today quoted the Brady Campaign saying, “[AR-15s] are accurate and they can basically shoot as quickly as you can pull the trigger.” They continued, “Along those lines, [AR-15s are] very customizable — most average people can figure out how to install accessories like forward trigger grips that let you hold the gun at waist height and spray bullets while stabilizing the gun, laser sights, and you can add high-capacity magazines.”

Note the use of “forward trigger grips” (whatever those are) and the intimation of a pray-and-spray shooting style.

But master firearms instructor and gun store owner Dean Hazen looked right past the hype and told USA Today that the focus on AR-15s is not because the firearm is the best suited for mass public attacks but because those carrying out such attacks have a “copy cat mentality” which causes them to use a gun used by previous attackers.

Hazen said, “It’s really just a perception thing.” He added, “There are rifles that are more powerful and more dangerous than that, but they’re not being used.”

He is correct inasmuch as there are far more effective weapons. However, the left does not see this because they focus on things like “forward trigger grips” (whatever those are) and other firearm accessories that sound ominous to them. In reality, the greatest advantage an attacker has is time and when the area he strikes is designated “gun-free” then time is certainly on his side.

For example, Breitbart News reported that the Sandy Hook Elementary School gunman had over 9 minutes without armed resistance during his December 14, 2012, attack. With that kind of time the type of firearm used is largely a moot point, as an untold number of people could be killed or wounded by a gunman armed only with a snub-nose revolver and a pocket full of bullets.

Yet there are firearms that could make heinous crimes even worse. Those firearms are “more powerful and more dangerous” than an AR-15. Hazen alluded to his when he said, “Thank God [the attackers] don’t know any better because if they did they would use much more effective weapons.”

The attack occurred at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, at approximately 11:30 a.m. central time. Celebrities began calling for gun control before the number of casualties was confirmed and before the gunman had been identified, or his possible motive discovered.

Horror novelist Stephen King was quick to call for new gun laws:

How many more have to die before we enact sane gun control laws? — Stephen King (@StephenKing) November 5, 2017

King’s gun control push was echoed by comedian and actress Sarah Silverman:

When a plane crashes, air travel becomes exponentially safer bc of the lessons learned. But 1 mass shooting after another…nothing. — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) November 5, 2017

And actor Josh Gad:

Terror attack that kills 6 gets travel bans same day; Deadliest mass shooting & deadliest church shooting ever get prayers & 2 soon to talk — Josh Gad (@joshgad) November 5, 2017

Comedian and former Netflix talk show host Chelsea Handler blamed the attack on Republicans:

Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) November 5, 2017

Meanwhile, actor Timothy Simons blamed the attack on the NRA:

.@nra you are a terrorist organization. you aid, abet, and protect terrorists. — Timothy Simons (@timothycsimons) November 5, 2017

Joy Reid blamed the NRA as well:

The @NRA is soaked and bathed in blood. How do its adherents sleep at night? — Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) November 5, 2017

And a producer for Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show unleashed a profanity-laced tweet against President Donald Trump, Russia, and guns:

Fuck Trump

Fuck Russia

Fuck guns

Yes I’m fucking politicizing all of it https://t.co/dSXXyGhRDw — andy lassner (@andylassner) November 5, 2017

Director Adam McKay tweeted:

Mass carnage in Sutherland Springs.

We can do better than this.

The idea of zero new gun safety laws isn’t just idiotic it’s murderous. — Adam McKay (@GhostPanther) November 5, 2017

And Silicon Valley actor Kumail Nanjiani called for “#GunControlNow:”

Breitbart News reported that celebrities also came out in droves to call for gun control within hours of the illegal use of firearms in the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas attack at a country music concert.

breitbart156,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-11-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/21/17-gun-controls-currently-pushed-democrats-surrogates/,"Senate Democrats and their surrogates in various groups are currently pushing 21 new gun controls for law-abiding citizens.

These controls range from an all-out ban on semiautomatic firearms to regulations on single shot muzzleloaders and limits on the number of guns someone can pass to a felon.

Breitbart News outlined the first nine of these gun controls on October 11. They were:

Ban on Bump Stocks – Sen. Dianne Feinstein is pushing this with her Automatic Fire Prevention Act. She admits that bump stocks are an accessory—that they do not convert semiautomatics into automatics—but she wants to ban them anyway. Her bill explicitly bans any accessory that allows an increase in rate of fire in short bursts but does “not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun.” Ban on Trigger Cranks – Sen. Feinstein’s bill bans trigger cranks too. Like the bump stock, trigger cranks are another novelty that gun owners can use to achieve short, rapid bursts of fire. Such cranks allow a gun owner to mimic automatic fire yet do not convert a semiautomatic gun into an automatic one. Ban on Semiautomatic firearms – Sen. Feinstein voiced support for this ban during her appearance on Face the Nation, and the Washington Post pushed for such a ban two days later. Implementation of Universal Background Checks – Sen. Chris Murphy used an appearance on State of the Union to stress that a bump stock ban is only the beginning for Democrats. They plan to follow that ban with the implementation of universal background checks, which means private gun sales would require a background check just like retail sales. Democrats claim these checks would save lives, yet Sen. Murphy and others ignore the fact that the Vegas attacker purchased his guns via background checks, as did so many attackers before him. The real reason Democrats want universal background checks is because such checks require a gun registry to be enforceable. Therefore, the implementation of such checks would immediately lead to one more gun control: a gun registry. Ban on “Assault Weapons” – Sen. Murphy also mentioned an “assault weapons” ban, suggesting it would be next in line after background checks. The Los Angeles Times called for an “assault weapons” ban as well. Ban on “High Capacity” Magazines – The Los Angeles Times also called for a ban on “high capacity” magazines, describing them as one of the most dangerous aspects of “assault weapons.” The Times points to attacks like ones on Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, and the San Bernardino County Building as justifications for an “assault weapons” ban that contains a “high capacity” magazine ban. In so doing, the Times overlooks the fact that all three attacks—Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, and San Bernardino—occurred in gun-free zones. This means the attackers had no threat of armed response and could take their time, reloading as often as needed. In such scenarios magazine capacity is a moot issue. Opposition to Concealed Carry – Breitbart News reported that Sen. Feinstein took time to argue against concealed carry for law-abiding citizens during an appearance on Face the Nation. Speaking of concealed carry she said, “I don’t believe it’s protected by the Constitution.” Opposition to National Reciprocity – Sen. Feinstein also voiced opposition to the national reciprocity legislation currently pending before Congress. She said, “Well, my opinion of that bill is it’s terrible. … [Do] we want every American to feel comfortable packing a concealed weapon around the country?” Australian-style Gun Ban – The Washington Post put forward the idea in an October 9 editorial.

Numerous others have flooded in since the introduction of those original nine. The newest suggested controls include regulation on single shot muzzleloaders. In fact, Gabby Giffords gun control group suggests muzzleloaders could be the next bump stock. Her group also wants gun control on “high capacity shotguns,” binary triggers, “AK and AR style pistols,” arm braces for AR style pistols, “AR pistol blade stabilizers,” .50 caliber rifles, .50 caliber ammunition, and tracer rounds for various calibers of firearms.

Giffords’ group seeks to substantiate their call for a ban on tracer rounds by writing, “Tracer rounds allow a shooter to see where rounds are tracking at night.”

Two other gun controls are being pushed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The first of the two is a federal ban on firearms trafficking. She is pushing this ban although such trafficking is already clearly prohibited via ATF background check form 4473. LIBN reports that Gillibrand is also again pushing the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking & Crime Prevention Act, which “would make it illegal to sell purchase, or transfer two or more firearms to someone whom the seller knows, or has reasonable cause to know, is a felon or convicted domestic abuser.”

Lastly, the 21st gun control currently being pushed is regulation on so-called “ghost guns.” These are guns that are legal to manufacture at home, but require a significant amount of know-how and equipment to accomplish. The establishment media is currently pointed to two crimes committed with “ghost guns” as justification for a new federal law to regulate the sale, manufacture of the firearms.

On October 19, 2017, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urged his Democrat colleagues to drop gun control. He worried that it will politically hurtful for those trying to get re-elected in red states in November 2018. Apparently, Schumer’s colleagues are not listening.

breitbart157,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2017-03-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/30/doctors-for-responsible-gun-ownership-firearm-suppressors-fight-hearing-loss/,"Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership (DRGO) have released a position paper explaining how firearm suppressors fight hearing loss and announcing their support for theHearing Protection Act.

The doctors contributing to the position paper include Matthew P. Branch, MD; Gerard J. Gianoli, MD, FACS; Bradford Ress, MD, FANS; and Timothy Wheeler, MD. Their paper comes as Congress moves closer to taking up the Hearing Protection Act, which was put forward by Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) on January 9.

According to DRGO:

Particularly harmful for firearms enthusiasts is the explosive blast (or impulse) generated when firing a handgun or rifle. This explosive blast generates 1,000 times more pressure than the actual noise of a gunshot. Such blasts can result in significant, permanent hearing loss with a single exposure of 140 decibels or more… This is the same “acoustic blast trauma” suffered by survivors of IEDs on the battlefield.

After showing that “significant, permanent hearing loss” can result from “a single exposure of 140 decibels or more,” DRGO points out that that “muzzle blast sound levels for most firearms (handguns, rifles and shotguns) range from 140 to over 170 decibels, more than sufficient to cause instant, permanent hearing damage.”

The doctors then explain the insufficiency and potential risk of using “ear plugs or ear muffs” to protect against hearing loss:

Hearing protection in the form of ear plugs or ear muffs, alone or in combination, can only reduce noise exposure by approximately 20-30 decibels. This limitation in noise reduction may still expose a firearms user to damaging levels of noise; 120 decibels is still louder than a car horn from three feet away. Thus, inside the canal and over the ear devices (i.e., ear plugs and ear muffs)—the only current generally available protection—are inadequate for impulse noise protection, and when used together they deafen the wearer to all external sound.

They point to a study conducted by Dr. Matthew Branch, who also contributed to the DRGO position paper. His study found:

All suppressors offered significantly greater noise reduction than ear-level protection, usually greater than 50% better. Noise reduction of all ear-level protectors is unable to reduce the impulse pressure below 140 dB for certain common firearms, an international standard for prevention of sensorineural hearing loss… Modern muzzle-level suppression is vastly superior to ear-level protection and the only available form of suppression capable of making certain sporting arms safe for hearing.

It is interesting to note that Gabby Giffords’ gun control group claims Americans should use “ear plugs” instead of suppressors. Giffords’ group tweeted, “You know what protects your hearing better than a silencer? Ear plugs. Don’t be fooled: the so-called ‘Hearing Protection Act’ does nothing to protect hearing.”

FACT: Silencers do not protect your hearing. pic.twitter.com/EXe8e4VgmY — ARS (@resp_solutions) March 13, 2017

So it appears we must choose whom we believe: doctors trained in evaluating hearing and threats to hearing or gun control propagandists?

Breitbart News reported that that Hearing Protection Act was introduced by Representatives Jeff Duncan (R-SC-3) and John Carter (R-TX-31) on January 9, 2o17. The legislation recognizes the hearing protection benefits for firearm suppressors and removes them from the purview of the National Firearms Act (1934) to make the process of acquiring one less cumbersome for law-abiding citizens.

According to Politico, Duncan has now included the suppressor legislation in the Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act (SHARE Act) and “a ‘discussion draft’ of SHARE Act will be reviewed by…[the subcommittee] on Wednesday.”

Duncan held a demonstration of how suppressors work for some of his colleagues at a U.S. Capitol Police shooting range last week. He spoke about his legislative push on suppressors, saying:

The Hearing Protection Act has been one of the most important bills for sportsmen and women this Congress, which is why it’s common sense for it to be included in this year’s sportsman’s legislative package. By changing the outdated regulation of suppressors to an instant background check, just like the requirements to purchase a typical firearm, I hope the sportsmen and women in the United States will have greater access to noise reduction technology as they carry the hunting and recreational shooting tradition to future generations.

During a September 26, 2017, interview with SilencerCo’s Josh Waldron, Donald Trump Jr. lauded the benefits of suppressors and talked of how the devices are commonplace throughout Europe:

I’ve had the privilege of being able to hunt in Europe, where some of the strictest gun laws in the world exist. And guess what, virtually every hunting gun there is suppressed. It’s about safety. If you have that kind of noise levels in any of industry, like you do shooting sports, OSHA would be going crazy. It’s about safety.

He then pointed out the cumbersome regulations for acquiring suppressors in the U.S. and described them as “[rules] the government wants to put in place for no reason.”

Donald Jr. made clear that his father would sign the Hearing Protection Act if Congress passes it. He said, “We want to go through Congress, want to do it the right way, but if you line up those votes he is obviously going to be for it.”

breitbart159,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-03-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/06/eight-states-where-2nd-amendment-is-only-carry-permit-required/,"The West Virginia House overrode Tomblin’s veto on March 4 and the West Virginia Senate followed suit on March 5. WSAZ 3 reports that permitless carry “becomes law” 90 days from date of veto override.

This means there are now eight states where the Second Amendment is the only carry permit required.

It is important to note that there are still various rules that need to be learned and followed–in Montana, for instance, there are requirements for a permit in order to carry concealed in a city setting and many of the states have different rules for residents vs. non-residents–but apart from such caveats, permitless carry is the law of the land in Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Vermont, Wyoming, and West Virginia.

Alaska: The Alaska Department of Public Safety succinctly explains the state’s concealed carry law, “Alaska’s laws do not prohibit anyone 21 or older who may legally possess a firearm from carrying it concealed. A special permit is not required.” Alaska does have certain prohibitions as to where a concealed carry firearm cannot be possessed, such prohibitions include bars but differentiate between restaurants that serve alcohol and actual bars. The prohibitions also include private property where permission to carry is denied. The full list of prohibitions can be viewed here.

Arizona: Arizona’s carry laws are very similar to Alaska’s. If you are 21-year-old or older and are not barred from gun possession then you can legally carry a concealed handgun for self-defense without a permit. There are restrictions, one of which is a prohibition on carrying into “businesses serving alcohol for consumption on the premises.” You can carry in a such a business if you have an Arizona concealed carry permit, but such locations are off limits otherwise. The Arizona Department Public Safety lists other restrictions.

Kansas: Permitless concealed-carry became the law of the land in Kansas on July 1, 2015. Since that time the Kansas Attorney General’s website says, “A Concealed Carry Handgun license from Kansas or any other jurisdiction is no longer required in order to carry concealed firearms in Kansas for most individuals. So long as the person is 21 or older and lawful to possess firearms.” The Kansas Attorney General’s website also contains specifics on restrictions pertaining to concealed carry in the state.

Maine: Permitless concealed-carry became the law of the land in Maine on October 15, 2015. Maine.gov expounds: “Concealed carry without a permit is limited to people who are 21 or older, with the following exception: If a person is 18 years of age or older, and is on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard, or has been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces or the National Guard, and is not otherwise prohibited from carrying a firearm, the person may carry a concealed handgun. ” Other restrictions tied to concealed carry can be found on Maine.gov.

Montana: According to the Montana Department of Justice, “You may carry a concealed weapon without a permit if you are outside the official boundaries of a city or town or the confines of a logging, lumbering, mining or railroad camp.” However, carrying concealed without a license is not permitted in municipal areas. The details on the restrictions for carry in municipal areas can be found on the Montana Department of Justice website.

Vermont: Carrying a concealed handgun for self-defense without a permit is lawful in Vermont. According to the NRA-ILA, “It is lawful to carry a firearm openly or concealed provided the firearm is not carried with the intent or avowed purpose of injuring a fellow man. It is unlawful to carry a firearm within any state institution or upon the grounds or lands owned or leased by such institution.” As with other states that recognize permitless carry, there are restrictions on where a concealed handgun can be carried–including schools, courthouses, etc. Those who plan to carry concealed in Vermont need to familiarize themselves with all restrictions before do doing.

Wyoming: It became lawful for Wyoming residents to carry a concealed handgun without a permit in 2011. But Wyoming has a number of restrictions differentiating between concealed carry requirements for residents and non-residents, and everyone who plans to carry in Wyoming should familiarize themselves with those restrictions prior to carrying. Smart Gun Laws provides a good starting summary of the Wyoming carry statutes.

West Virginia: The West Virginia House and Senate just overrode Governor Earl Ray Tomblin’s (D) veto of House Bill 4145, sponsored by Delegate Saira Blair (R-Martinsburg). This means the Second Amendment will be soon be recognized as a sufficient carry permit for those 21-years old and older in West Virginia. HB 4145 also lowers the age for acquiring a concealed carry permit to 18-years of age, so that persons 18 to 20 years old can get a permit in order to carry a gun for self-defense prior to turning 21. Those planning to carry without a permit in West Virginia need to keep an eye on emerging information on official websites for the West Virginia government and follow pertinent restrictions."
breitbart160,breitbart,['Awr Hawkins'],2016-07-19 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/07/19/ar-15-flying-off-gun-store-shelves-following-newest-gun-controls/,"Gun store owners in California say the demand for AR-15s has skyrocketed in the wake of the new gun controls signed by Governor Jerry Brown on July 1.

Among those controls is a law that will enhance the state’s ban on “assault weapons.”

According to KION, Ray Parga, owner of Marina’s Del Valle Gunsmithing, said “California compliant rifles” sold so fast they are now “now-existent” on store shelves. Moreover, he said, demand is so great that the incoming shipments of such guns “have already been sold.”

Parga said the demand for the rifles arises from the simple fact that Californians “want to be able to have one before they aren’t allowed to buy them anymore.” And he stressed that the new gun laws are misplaced, in that they burden law-abiding citizens with rules criminals will never follow. He added, “Criminals don’t care about the law. Evil is as evil is.”

Six new gun bills in total were signed by Brown. One seeks enhancement of California’s “assault weapons” ban by outlawing rifles with “bullet buttons.” Such buttons are simple releases that allow gun owners to trade out an empty ammunition magazine for a full one.

Breitbart News reported that gun owners rallied in Sacramento the day after the bills were signed, proclaiming their determination to refusal to recognize the new requirements.

According to the Sacramento Bee, the protesters held banners that declared, “WE WILL NOT COMPLY.”

Earlier in July, Breitbart News reported that one innovator has already devised a way to circumvent the ban on “bullet buttons”: “… on July 5, the inventor of the ‘bullet button’ introduced the ‘Patriot Mag Release,’ a.k.a. ‘Bullet Button Reloaded.'”

California’s Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom has been pushing a November referendum that will require background checks for ammunition purchases in the state. Such campaigns almost always drive up the demand for weapons."

The use of a vehicle as a deadly battering-ram, followed up by a dismounted gun or knife attack is directly out of the Islamist playbook, and the repeated use of the method follows orders disseminated through Islamist propaganda to commit these styles of attacks. We have learnt over the course of Friday that the killer even called the customary war cry “Allahu Akhbar” as he ploughed his truck into the crowds.

While Europe has already seen several similar attacks — some of which have been already forgotten or dismissed as the work of the mentally ill — Islamist car assaults are already familiar to the people of Israel. Breitbart Jerusalem reported last night on how Palestinian killers routinely deploy the deadly tactic — with one Palestinian male attempting a car attack against Israeli border police just two days ago.

Little more than a week ago, IDF soldiers were similarly targeted, with attacks going back eight years using not just cars but heavy vehicles too, just like Thursday’s deadly Nice attacks.

Many may be shocked to discover this is not the first time Islamists have used this method in France — Nice has merely been the most deadly. Just weeks before the deadly Islamist attack on the offices of Paris satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, Breitbart London reported on 13 seriously injured pedestrians as a man driving his car and shouting “Allahu Akhbar” mounted the pavement and repeatedly drove into crowds of people.

Of the injured two were left in critical condition, and one victim was just eleven years old. That attack came just weeks after an Islamic State propaganda video was released in the French language entitled ‘What are you waiting for?’ which entreated true believers to “kill them and spit in their faces and run them over with your car”.

The next day on December 22nd , terror struck again as a delivery van was driven at speed into a Nantes Christmas market, injuring 11. British newspaper of record The Times reported reliable eyewitnesses including a police officer who stated the driver shouted “Allahu Akhbar”.

The method has grown in popularity among would-be terrorists because it is so deadly, and so effective. Islamist propaganda including recruiting magazines such as the Islamic State’s Dabiq and Al-Qaeda’s Inspire have both called on readers to use cars to run over enemies of Islam.

Automobiles are easily acquired in Western countries without arousing the suspicion of the security services, and as has been tragically demonstrated in the past 24 hours can be even more deadly than a trained shooter.

Another Islamist terror attack against France in August 2015 which saw Moroccan national Sliman Hamzi open fire on a speeding Thalys train was brought to an abrupt end after his Ak-47 rifle jammed, allowing him to be overpowered by an off-duty American marine who happened to be on the train. Unlike the firearm — illegally acquired in France — the 7.5 tonne truck kept going for two trouble-free kilometers as it was driven through crowds of revellers celebrating France’s national day.

Reportedly armed with guns and grenades, Nice killer Mohamed Lahouaiej Boisvert was then ready to keep killing.

As Breitbart London reported in September 2014, the chief spokesman of the Islamic State called for such attacks, in a speech apparently inspired by the murder of British soldier Drummer Lee Rigby on the streets of London. He was run over by a car traveling at more than 40 miles per hour by Islamist killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale who then dismounted and attempted to behead him with knives.

Following the attack ISIS boss Abu Mohammed al Adnani said to followers in Europe and the United States: “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him”.

The call was similar to Al-Qaeda-linked English language magazine Inspire, which said in a 2010 edition “The idea is to use a pickup truck as a mowing machine, not to mow grass but mow down the enemies of Allah”. According to International Business Times, the magazine is read by 4,000 people in Britain every week.

Giving detailed instructions which seem to have been carried out to the letter in Europe, the article continued: “To achieve maximum carnage, you need to pick up as much speed as you can… be able to strike as many people as possible in your first run… the ideal location is a place where there are a maximum number of pedestrians and the least number of vehicles… if you have access to firearms, carry them with you so that you may use them to finish off your work if your vehicle gets grounded during the attack”.

The emphasised importance of speed was put into practice in the June 2015 car attack in Graz, Austria. Driving a 4×4 at speeds as high as 90 miles per hour up and down the provincial city’s main shopping street, before getting out of his smashed car and attacking bystanders with a “large knife”, Alen Rizvanović killed three including a four-year-old boy.

Although it was claimed at the time the attack had nothing to do with terrorism and that the driver was a Catholic with mental health issues, it later transpired he was a devout Muslim who went to Mosque six times a week, and followed dozens of Islamist pages on Facebook and Twitter. There is now concern in Austria that the killer could soon walk free because court-appointed psychiatrists deemed him to be mentally unwell, and therefore not liable for his actions.

The mayor of Graz, who was out shopping on the day of the attack is campaigning to have Rizvanović locked up for life.

While the Bataclan attacks in Paris killed more — some 137 French and tourists in the city — it was the work of nine men, compared to 84 deaths for one Islamist killer with a battering-ram truck. All counter-terror experience has shown these individuals gravitate towards what they would consider success which strongly suggests that vehicle attack stabbings — one of the hardest forms of mass-casualty attacks for security services to prevent — are here to stay.

After all, as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said today”Times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism”, so we’d better get used to it."

“Think about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It doesn’t keep us safe if the United States secures its nuclear arsenal while other countries fail to prevent theirs from falling into the hands of terrorists,” Kerry told students at a high-tech U.S.-funded cultural center at a Jakarta mall.

Kerry added, “The bottom line is this: it is the same thing with climate change. In a sense, climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even the worlds most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.”

Kerry explained to the Indonesian students that climate change represents an existential threat to their very survival.

“Because of climate change, it’s no secret that today Indonesia is…one of the most vulnerable countries on Earth,” Kerry said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say that the entire way of life that you live and love is at risk.”

Kerry went on to deride scientists and citizens who challenge global warming’s scientific validity.

“We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,” said Kerry. “The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand. We don’t have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society.”

Kerry’s Indonesia speech was just one portion of his three-nation jet-setting tour of Asia."

Last night, CNN attempted to do the same through blowhard Piers Morgan. But there is just one problem: CNN and The Daily News are 100% wrong. The FBI has just confirmed that a shotgun and two pistols were recovered, and that the “gunman was NOT armed with [an] AR-15.”

Tuesday morning’s Daily News cover hysterically blared, “Same Gun Different Slay.”

Inside, Mike Lupica continued the blare:

This time the shooter is reported to be a Navy reservist named Aaron Alexis and when he is shot dead by law enforcement, taken out before he can put a gun to his own head the way Lanza did, he has his light, handy assault weapon with him, and a semiautomatic pistol, and a shotgun.

But even if the shooter had used a semiautomatic rifle (which we now know he didn’t), it would have been one he took from a security guard during the rampage. Maybe the Daily News didn’t get it wrong; maybe Lupica and company are so far over the edge that they are now calling for the American military to be disarmed?

Meanwhile, over at CNN, within hours of the shooting, the network allowed Piers Morgan to launch his own sanctimonious attack against the AR-15:

—

But just a few hours later, CNN had to walk it back. Buried in an article singling out the AR-15, CNN reported that an AR-15 was not found on the scene.

Apparently, sometime yesterday, the talking point went out that said that the anti-gun narrative coming out of the Navy Yard shootings would be to turn the AR-15 into this massacre’s convenient left-wing bogeyman — all in an effort to get it banned.

The left-wing, anti-science media blows it again by caring more about the agenda than the facts.

This is especially devastating for CNN, a cable network desperate to get off the floor after non-stop debacles involving the Boston Marathon bombing, being caught openly pushing for gun control, and all things George Zimmerman. Eventually, CNN has to see Piers Morgan as the low-rated liability he really is. Straight out of the gate, within hours of this massacre, CNN already is a punchline … again.
