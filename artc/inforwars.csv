“Strong leaders don’t automatically agree with the last thing that was said to them. We have the Second and due process of low for a reason. We’re not ditching any Constitutional protections simply because the last person the President talked to today doesn’t like them.“

President Trump told a group of lawmakers that they must do something to keep guns away from mentally ill individuals – even if that means raising the minimum age for rifle ownership to 21, Bloomberg reports.

His remarks appeared to contradict a CNN report from earlier in the week, which quoted anonymous White House aides saying Trump would soon walk back his support for raising the age limit.

But on Wednesday, in what the New York Times characterized as a “shocking” break with his Republican Congressional allies, Trump told lawmakers during a televised meeting in the Cabinet Room that easing gun owners’ ability to carry concealed weapons across state lines, a provision of the House-passed gun bill and the NRA’s top legislative priority, should be part of a separate bill, a strategy favored by Democrats. The House bill combining background check provisions with the loosening of concealed carry rules has stalled in the Senate after passing the House. Instead, Trump said he supports the proposal from Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., which he says is best positioned to pass. Sen. Amy Klobuchar agreed that the Manchin-Toomey bill is a “good place to start.”

“It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everyone could support,” Mr. Trump said as Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, sat smiling to his left. “It’s time that a president stepped up.”

Per the Times, Trump repeatedly suggested that the dynamics surrounding the gun control debate had shifted, in part, because of his presence in the Oval Office – a remark that earned him cheers from Democrats.

Trump predicted his plan would pass with broad support, suggesting that he plans to win over a sizable chunk of the Democratic caucus.

Trump told his audience that raising the ownership age is “something you have to think about,” Trump said. He added that “people don’t bring it up” because the NRA opposes the policy. Trump had initially claimed that he would convince the NRA to go along with it.

As the Hill pointed out, he also said he supports confiscating guns from mentally ill individuals, a position vociferously opposed by Republicans.

“I like taking the guns early like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida … to go to court would have taken a long time,” Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence. “Take the guns first, go through due process second,” Trump said.

He also said mentally ill people shouldn’t have guns.

“A lot of people are saying ‘oh you shouldn’t be saying that’,” Trump said. “But I don’t want mentally ill people having guns.”

To be sure, states don’t need to enact the exact same restrictions, Trump said. But “what does have to be the same is the background checks and all of the data.”

Per Reuters, Trump urged lawmakers to pass a comprehensive gun control bill as the national conversation surrounding gun control – a conversation that was triggered by a shooting at Marjory Douglas Tillman High School in Parkland Fla. The shooting left 14 students and 3 faculty dead, and more than a dozen injured.

Rebutting accusations that he is beholden to the NRA, Trump added that gun lovers have less power over him than lawmakers.

Earlier today, Dick’s Sporting Goods said it is “going to take a stand” and announced it would permanently ban sales of the AR-15 – the rifle used by Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz and several other mass shooters – from its stores.

The meeting with lawmakers was his fourth “free-flowing gun policy discussion” since the Valentine’s Day massacre in Florida, according to Reuters.

“We’re going to come up with some ideas,” Trump said. “Hopefully we can put those ideas in a very bipartisan bill. It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody can support, as opposed to – you know – 15 bills, everybody’s got their own bill.”

Seven senators and representatives were invited to Wednesday’s session. The group included Democrats and Republicans who, according to Reuters, have diverse views on gun control.

Republican Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who have proposed legislation to fix holes in the background check system for gun buyers, and their Democratic co-sponsors.

Trump also said he back Cornyn’s bill while urging senators to add more items to the bill to make it more comprehensive."
inforwars1,['Paul Joseph Watson'],2018-02-26 06:28:36-06:00,https://www.infowars.com/google-searches-for-buy-a-gun-hit-all-time-high/,"Google searches for “buy a gun” have hit an all time high as interest in purchasing firearms dramatically increases in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting.

Expecting new restrictions on guns and ammunition, anecdotal evidence suggests the AR-15 semi-automatic weapon is becoming popular once again following a lull in interest after Trump’s election.

Google searches for “AR-15” are at their highest since just after the Sandy Hook massacre over five years ago.

However, the more generic term “buy a gun” just hit its highest level ever, with incomplete data suggesting it could be an even more popular query than it was just after Sandy Hook.

With the NRA facing a boycott campaign that has caused numerous major companies to sever connections, searches for “join NRA” are also spiking to levels not seen since December 2012.

The Google data correlates with interest in this weekend’s Florida State Fairgrounds gun show, which organizers say was attended by more people than ever before.

“Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights,” said Florida Gun Show manager George Fernandez, amidst fears that the so-called “gun show loophole,” which allows people to buy guns without a background check, will be closed.

Stoneman Douglas high school shooter Nikolas Cruz passed a background check before legally purchasing a semiautomatic AR-15 style rifle.

Gun sales typically spike after every mass shooting, but the data suggests that Americans are exercising their Second Amendment rights more vehemently than ever before in response to a media-driven campaign that is using Parkland survivors as cheerleaders for gun control.

Unsurprisingly left out of the debate are pro-Trump or pro-Second Amendment voices, like Jalen Martin’s, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School whose opinion runs contrary to those of his fellow students.

#ParklandStudentsSpeak ….. unless they have an opinion that doesn't correlate with the agenda in which case you'll never see them on television. — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 21, 2018

In a Wednesday interview with Infowars, Martin discussed his experience encountering media who did not want to listen to his pro-gun views.

“I was at the vigil. I was taking pictures. This photographer came up to me, he’s like, ‘Oh, who you taking pictures for? You’re just doing that for pleasure?’ I was like, ‘We’re not doing it for pleasure, but I’m taking pictures. I’m going to send them to Infowars.’ He was like ‘Oh,’ and then he walked away immediately, like he knew that, ‘OK, these guys’ views aren’t the same.’”

Jalen remarked that “As soon as someone appears on Infowars or has an opposing view to the one viewpoint that they’re gonna express tonight [at the CNN townhall], which is gun control,” they are immediately shut out of the debate.

“I’m especially going to the CNN townhall. So hopefully if they don’t pre-screen questions like Donna Brazile and Hillary Clinton, then maybe i’ll get to ask some real questions, not something prepared on a note card.”

Not only has the media refused to interview Martin, his credibility was attacked by a Snopes managing editor after he appeared last week on the Alex Jones Show following the shooting. The editor claimed Martin could not possibly be a student at the school.

MSNBC’s Lyin’ Brian Williams also attempted to bait Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior Brandon Minoff into giving an anti-gun comment last week, but the student blamed mental health issues for the shooting instead.

“Gun-wise I don’t think there’s any way to prevent it,” Minoff told Williams. “You outlaw guns it just creates a higher demand for it.”

“I think it has to do with mental health, though,” he added. “If he’s been expelled three different times from three different schools, I think he needs to be helped out.”

A 17-year-old Junior ROTC member, Colton Haab, was also given very little airtime after claiming his coach could have prevented further bloodshed if only he’d been armed.

“I believe that if we did bring firearms on campus to teachers that are willing to carry their firearm on school campus if they got their correct training for it, I think that would be a big beneficial factor into school safety,” Haab said, adding, “just because, I mean if Coach Feis had had his firearm in school that day I believe that he could have most likely stopped the threat.”

Haab later ended up giving the fake news media a run for their money Wednesday after claiming he was given scripted questions by CNN to ask during a Town Hall debate hosted by the network.

“CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions, and it ended up being all scripted,” Haab told Local 10 News Wednesday night.

Local10.com reports: “Haab wrote questions about school safety and suggested using veterans as security guards, but he claims CNN wanted him to ask scripted questions instead.”

CNN was forced to issue a statement refuting Haab’s claims.

While an objective media should be offering different perspectives and letting their audiences form their own opinions, the MSM’s selective promotion of a few students with certain viewpoints exposes their bias and subversive anti-Second Amendment agenda.

As journalist Matt Drudge commented Sunday, the media’s manipulation of people “has reached absurd levels.”

Axios reports that Trump has “told associates that he doesn’t think high school kids should be able to buy guns, and is open to the idea of imposing a minimum purchase age of 21 for guns like those used in the Florida high school massacre.”

While the report states that the talk is “relatively loose and open-ended so far,” and that no firm decisions have been made, the President tweeted out the following call for politicians on both sides of the aisle to back stronger background checks for gun owners:

Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2018

The White House also released a memo Tuesday that indicates Trump has directed the Justice Department to draw up legislation to ban firearm modifiers including the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas massacre.

Trump wrote in the memo, “Although the Obama administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns.”

Fox News reports that a DOJ official has confirmed that the department is acting “quickly” on the president’s order.

“The department understands this is a priority for the president and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process,” spokesman Sarah Isgur Flores said. “We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed.”

The Washington Post has also reported that Trump has “signaled an openness to modest gun-control measures following what he called an ‘evil massacre’” in Florida.

“In private, he has indicated that he might do more,” the report states, “telling advisers and friends in recent days that he is determined to push for some sort of gun-control legislation.”

Some reports have suggested that Trump may look to impose a ban on the sale of firearms in private."

The non-profit RAND corporation spent two years and $1 million on the analysis, searching for evidence of benefit from gun control policies. RAND’s analysis looked to establish connections between gun policies and rates of homicide, suicide, self-defense gun use, hunting, and other categories. The vast majority of those categories went unaffected by legislation, however, according to NPR.

“Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn’t find any evidence,” Andrew Morral, who lead the analysis.

RAND’s analysis found some evidence that laws aimed at keeping firearms out of the hands of small children had some effect on rates of suicide and accidental gun injuries. Morral also surveyed 95 gun policy experts on both sides of the debate, asking them to rank the ideal outcomes of any given gun control legislation. The outcomes included lowering homicides, suicides, and mass shootings as well as protecting privacy, and enabling hunting and sport shooting. The vast majority of the expert responded that cutting suicides and homicides should be the top priorities.

This is a completely false statement. Alex Jones or Infowars have never been sued for “pedaling lies” about a school shooting.

As a survivor of the shooting, the media has pounced on Hogg and used him as a mouthpiece to push for gun control, demonizing anyone who questions Hogg as being insensitive to the victims of the tragedy.

However, Hogg is now a public figure and an activist. He is not immune from criticism. Nor should criticism of him be used as an excuse to curtail the First Amendment, as is happening with CNN lobbying YouTube to ban Infowars.

Infowars has invited Hogg on the Alex Jones Show to clear the air and we hope to see this happen as soon as possible.

CBS Los Angeles featured Hogg as the eyewitness and videographer of a testy encounter between Hogg, a veteran Redondo Beach, Calif., lifeguard and a surfer, who was reportedly Hogg’s friend, in August of 2017.

Hogg claimed the lifeguard accosted his surfer friend over the issue of resting a sandy bodyboard on a beach trash can.

Interestingly, Hogg has reconnected with CBS for an appearance on CBS This Morning as the mainstream media unabashedly features high school students as figureheads for a new anti-gun push.

A CBS employee posted a photo of Hogg with fellow teen activists and CBS reporter Gisela Perez, which was later taken down after Kristinn Taylor of The Gateway Pundit reported on the photo shoot and how strange it seemed that all parties looked so cheerful and enthusiastic in the wake of such a tragedy.



“These photos were taken over the weekend on the set of an interview taped for broadcast Monday morning,” Taylor wrote. “This means the students were only three or four days out from surviving a massacre in their school.

Hogg has become an overnight celebrity, appearing on international media outlets and television shows, vehemently calling for strict gun control, regularly slamming President Trump, and defending the FBI – of which his father is a retired agent, which many have found to be a peculiar coincidence as the FBI has come under fire for not preventing the Parkland massacre despite being warned about suspected killer Nikolas Cruz repeatedly beforehand.

“The retired FBI dad is very significant,” asserts former Navy SEAL and commentator, Matt Bracken. “The FBI has been hiring SJW’s for years. It’s not just the 7th Floor of FBI HQ. It’s endemic.”

Illinois — the land of Obama and the Blagojevich mafia — is serious about making the Second Amendment so expensive only the rich will be able to exercise it. Kenneth Dunkin, a former social worker and Democrat member of the Illinois House of Representatives, has introduced HB0687, entitled the “Firearm Owners ID-Insurance” bill. It is currently in the Rules Committee.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t



Dunkin’s bill amends the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act, a previous bill aimed at chipping away at the Second Amendment. Dunkin’s amendment states “that any person who owns a firearm in this State shall maintain a policy of liability insurance in the amount of at least $1,000,000 specifically covering any damages resulting from negligent or willful acts involving the use of such firearm while it is owned by such person.”

A million dollars!

Can you imagine the premium on such an insurance policy? It would be astronomical and out of the reach of most people in Illinois.

If the firearm owner cannot afford the insurance or decides that it is simply crazy and also unconstitutional and refuses to participate, “the Department of State Police shall revoke and seize a Firearm Owner’s Identification Card,” thus making the the firearm illegal and the owner a criminal.

If Dunkin’s bill makes it out of committee and is passed by the Illinois General Assembly, a whole lot of people will have their firearms confiscated by the State Police."

July 2, 2013

New gun laws enacted in Colorado yesterday have crippled some gun and pawn shops.

The state once considered part of the Wild West is now reduced to imposing universal background checks on gun purchases and is also banned from selling ammunition magazines that hold over 15 rounds.

New gun laws followed in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school last December in Newtown, Conn. where 20 children and 6 adults were killed. Although the story has been widely publicized and city governments nationwide have even implemented legislation based on this event alone, many questions remain unanswered about the gruesome killings.

The most important question left unanswered is why? Why did Adam Lanza suddenly slay 20 school children at a school that he himself once attended? When tragedies like this occur, usually the public is interested in getting inside the mind of the killer and finding out why. But in this case more questions were left unanswered than information was provided.

Blogs and alternative media websites questioned what type of mental state Adam Lanza was in, asking what prescription drugs, if any, he was on.

The establishment media sidestepped these questions completely, and it was never made public what prescription drugs Lanza was on.

Despite loads of unanswered questions, the mainstream media waged a war against AR-15s demanding they be abolished and even managed to inflict hoplophobia, the fear on firearms, on the entire country.

Since then, all sorts of gun laws have been proposed including gun taxes, mandated firearm insurance, universal background checks, mandatory gun-registration, magazine restrictions and even all-out bans on particular firearms.

While the US government is the world’s largest firearms distributor, they are now adamant to stop private gun companies from selling certain firearms and magazines.

Colorado is the most recent state to be hit with new gun laws. Rod Brandenburg, the owner of Grandpa’s Pawn and Gun, says the new law “bars him from returning such magazines to the customers who show up at his shop to repay the principal and interest on the loans they got,” according to local Colorado newspaper.

Last Saturday Brandenburg said his business had “between 50 and 100 ammunition magazines that will be in violation of the 15-round limit.”

Brandenburg was able to call customers in advance of the new law and warn them that they needed to come pick up their magazines and bring something else to pawn before the law went into effect on Monday. However, many customers were not able to retrieve them in time.

The owner told the local newspaper that “the new law is forcing him to violate the contract between him and his customers”, adding that he’s meeting with his local sheriff on Tuesday for “advice on what to do.”

Gander Mountain, a Colorado sporting goods store that previously sold so called high-capacity magazines prior to the law going into effect, told Infowars.com how the new laws were affecting them. “We are currently waiting to hear from the corporate office on what to do with the left over stock of high-capacity magazines. We will most likely ship them out to states that don’t have the same firearm restrictions.”

It seems silly to ban the magazines in one state just to have them shipped out and sold in another state. But fortunately for the franchises, they have the option of transferring their merchandise to another store, but what about the mom and pop shops?

Lamont Norris, an employee at Pawn Bank in Englewood, Co., told Infowars.com there’s absolutely nothing they can do with their high-capacity magazines, and as of now they’re just sitting idly on the shelves. Norris also said, “It is illegal to release them, so as of now we have no plans on what to do with them.”

The Colorado State Patrol Office, the entity who’s supposed to be in charge of answering questions regarding the new law, said they don’t have any information or instructions to offer businesses that are stuck with these now illegal magazines.

In fact the Colorado State Patrol office couldn’t even provide direction on who to contact regarding this issue.

Even some Colorado sheriffs are against the new gun restrictions. Last Saturday at a rally protesting the new laws, Weld County Sheriff John Cooke told thousands of participants that “he didn’t intend to enforce the new laws because they’re unenforceable.”

According to the Daily Caller, Cooke and 54 other elected sheriffs are suing the state in an attempt to overturn the new law. In a July 10th hearing, the plaintiffs will request a suspension on the law until the lawsuit is settled."
inforwars12,['Kit Daniels'],2016-05-24 12:49:43-06:00,https://www.infowars.com/hawaii-considers-gun-owner-registry-for-firearm-confiscations/,"Hawaii wants to become the first state to register gun owners into a federal database – and expects other states to follow its lead, despite the Second Amendment.

Under a bill proposed by Sen. Will Espero, Hawaii would enter gun owners into an FBI database available to local police.

The FBI already has a similar database for people in “positions in trust,” such as school teachers and other public officials, but Hawaii would be the first to enter gun owners into a database.

“I don’t like the idea of us being entered into a database,” firearm instructor Jerry Ilo told AP. “It basically tells us that they know where the guns are, they can go grab them.”

“We get the feeling that Big Brother is watching us.”

His fear is not unfounded; New York City already had a similar registry in place which was used by police to confiscate firearms.

After N.Y. passed the SAFE Act in 2013, the NYPD sent out notices to registered gun owners demanding they give up their guns.

The notice ordered gun owners, who possessed firearms now prohibited under SAFE Act, the “options” to either surrender their firearms to the police, remove them from the city limits or otherwise render them inoperable.

That’s exactly what Hawaii’s authoritarian lawmakers want, but their proposed registry faces significant legal challenges.

“You’re curtailing that right by requiring that a name be entered into a database without doing anything wrong,” said Kenneth Lawson, faculty at the University of Hawaii’s William S. Richardson School of Law.

The NRA called the proposal “extremely dangerous.”

“Exercising a constitutional right is not inherently suspicious,” said the NRA’s Amy Hunter. “Hawaii will now be treating firearms as suspect and subject to constant monitoring.”

The billionaire investor is in a strong position to make such a call: He’s one of the leading financiers of the gun control movement, and the fund he leads recently owned a piece of the firearms industry.

On Thursday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros expressed interest in the divestment idea. Asked by International Business Times if investors who support gun control should sell their holdings in firearms companies, Soros responded: “I’m very much against guns. And if it can be organized on a large enough scale, I wouldn’t be opposed to it.”

Securities and Exchange Commission filings reviewed by IBT show Soros Fund Management as a top institutional shareholder in Vista Outdoors — considered the country’s top ammunition manufacturer — and Olin Corp., which makes ammo under the Winchester name. Soros Fund Management purchased a stake in Vista in early 2015 and possessed $11.4 million worth of shares in the company at the end of September, the most recent time the firm reported its holdings. Soros’ firm appears to have bought $5.2 million worth of Olin shares between July and September.

CNN downplayed the ISIS-style Parliament attack as a “firearms incident” despite UK media reporting it as a combined knife and car attack.

The network published an article with the headline “UK police investigate ‘firearms incident’ near parliament” around 11:30AM EST.

“London’s Metropolitan Police said on Twitter they were called at approximately 2:40 pm to reports of an incident near Westminster Bridge and that it was being treated as a firearms incident,” CNN said. “TV images have emerged of a car crashed into a fence outside the Parliament building.”

CNN did admit a police officer was stabbed in the “firearms incident,” but the article was light on details.

In comparison, both the Sun and the Daily Mail said a knifeman was shot outside the UK Parliament right after he mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, an attack which copies the methods used by jihadis during recent terror attacks.

And the Drudge Report had the following main headline as the CNN piece was going up:

“We heard a loud bang, lots of shouting and men running around. Someone rushed through, attacked a policeman,” a witness told The Sun. “He appeared to be carrying a knife or a gun. We then heard gunfire, five or six rounds.”

“The man approaching one of the police officers with a knife.”

As of this writing, police have not identified the suspect, although reports circulating on social media suggest the suspect was Middle Eastern.

Additionally, the two methods of the attack – a knife and a vehicle – mimick recent terror attacks in the West.

In November, a Somali refugee attacked at least nine people with a knife at Ohio State University.

“A high-ranking faculty member who spoke to NBC 4 Columbus said that one of his colleagues was in Watts Hall at the time and was slashed in the leg with a machete,” reported the Daily Mail on Nov. 28. “…The attack then got out of the car and started stabbing and slashing victims, a witness said.”

More recently, in Germany, one person was killed and three were injured by a knife-welding jihadi who shouted “Allahu Akbar” at a train station near Munich.

A similar attack happened on a train between Würzburg and Treuchtlingen.

“A German official described the footage of the teenage suspect in the German train stabbings as a ‘classical farewell video’ of a suicide attacker that indicates he was inspired by ISIS,” CNN reported. “Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the 17-year-old also left a goodbye letter saying he prayed that he could take revenge on all infidels.”

And let’s not forget the lorry attacks in Berlin and Nice, France, in which dozens of people were mowed down by jihadi drivers encouraged by ISIS to use trucks to kill “infidels.”

The Parliament is located in London, which has attracted so many Muslim migrants over the past several years that the city is now called “Londonistan.”

Even the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is a Muslim.

The NSC’s “Injury Facts -2017 Edition” shows a 17 percent decrease in accidents involving firearms from 2014 to 2015, a period when gun sales soared.

There were 489 unintentional firearms-related fatalities during that time period, the lowest total since record-keeping began in 1903, accounting for less than 1 percent of accident deaths.

This decrease, which was the largest percentage decline of any category cited in the NSC’s report, came in a year that saw record-high firearm sales.

The new push for gun control from the left comes courtesy of ABC News which recently published a piece promoting the use of an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) that many believe is nothing more than a thinly veiled confiscation plan that would allow a judge to “issue an ex parte order” for the direct confiscation of an American citizens firearms.

Unbelievably, the order can actually be issued without the firearm owner even being present, which would in turn end with police at the citizens door demanding he hand over his weapons or face violence from the state.

ABC’s Andy Fies, on the other hand, apparently wants Americans to see the orders differently, painting a more friendly picture of the ERPO’s while quoting two different left-wing gun control groups as seemingly unbiased experts on gun violence.

As of now, only Washington, California, Connecticut and most recently Oregon have ERPO laws (while Indiana and Texas have modified risk warrant statutes). Over the past year, however, spurred by a string of mass shootings beginning with the Pulse Nightclub attack that killed 49 in June 2016, legislatures in 19 states and Washington, D.C., have taken up 32 separate ERPO bills for consideration, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that advocates for gun control.

Everytown’s deputy legal director, William Rosen, told ABC News that list will grow. “We expect to see at least as much interest in 2018,” he said.

“There is a growing consensus,” added Lauren Alfred of the gun violence prevention group Sandy Hook Promise, “that this is the first step we should be taking when we are talking about people who are at risk of hurting themselves or others.”

Current laws barring gun ownership are limited. Generally, a person with a long history of mental health issues can still legally buy or possess firearms if they don’t fall into specific statutory categories such as having been adjudicated mentally ill or under a domestic violence restraining order. But, as was the case with Texas church gunman Devin Kelley, even these restrictions may not work if the person’s troubled past is not recorded on a background registry.

With an ERPO, however, if family members or police can show a gun owner to be an imminent danger to themselves or others, they can force the person to surrender their weapon(s).

Keep in mind that Everytown for Gun Safety is a Michael Bloomberg funded, left-wing gun control group that was created as part of a rebranding effort by the billionaire gun grabber after his previous group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, was outed by multiple former members as actually pushing an agenda of full-scale gun confiscation.

The Extreme Risk Protection Orders scheme seems to be nothing more than another attempt at slowly eroding the right of lawful Americans to own firearms.

As AWR Hawkins reported in an April 2017 article about a similar law being pushed in Oregon, “Oregon state Sen. Brian Boquist (R-Dallas) is pushing a confiscation bill that would broaden the number of prohibited gun purchasers as well as require certain individuals to hand over any guns in their possession.”

At the time, gun rights activist and NRA member Keely Hopkins rightfully described the law as an attempt to remove your Second Amendment rights by using a third-party who would need little evidence to declare you unfit to own a firearm. (Imagine a vengeful ex-wife/husband)

“This bill allows for a protective order to remove your Second Amendment rights, not because of a criminal conviction, but based on third-party allegations using an evidentiary standard that falls far below what’s normally required for the removing of fundamental rights.”

It is also important to note that gun control advocates and the mainstream media are using The Las Vegas Massacre, which the authorities are openly lying about (there were at least 7 different shooters) as a pretext to further take away Americans right to bear arms. This is, and has always been, the modus operandi of the power elite."

Rep. David Cicilline, (D-R.I.), announced Monday he is introducing the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. Over 150 Democrats have signed on in support of the legislation, according to Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL).

“Today I joined @RepCicilline and 150+ of my colleagues to introduce the assault weapons ban. It’s time for Congress to listen to the will of a majority of Americans and pass sensible legislation to get these weapons of war off our streets. #NeverAgain #MSDStrong,” Deutch tweeted.

Ted Deutch (@RepTedDeutch) February 26, 2018

The legislation would make it “unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon.”

The bill also lists over 205 different kinds of rifles and handguns that would be banned, including the AR-15 and AK-47.

“In addition to rifles, this bill would ban virtually every self-defense handgun sold in the U.S. – but the anti-gunners swear they aren’t trying to ban guns…” the NRA tweeted on Tuesday.

The mainstream media has been calling for an outright repeal of the Second Amendment since the shooting, including The New York Times, MSNBC, and NPR.

However, President Trump has indicated that he would veto such a bill.

“He campaigned for president and was opposed to the assault weapons ban, and his position hasn’t changed on that,” White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said last week.

“What we are looking for are solutions that don’t ban a class of firearms for all individuals but ban all weapons for certain individuals who are identified as threats to public safety.”

Trump also said Democrats are just playing politics, as they weren’t able to pass any kind of gun control legislation when they had majorities in the House and Senate during Obama’s term.

“Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!” he tweeted last week.

The Orlando Mayor says he used an assault rifle, while Florida Congressman Alan Grayson adds that he believes the attack is “more likely than not” ideologically motivated.

CBS added that the FBI is currently checking if he was linked to extremists.

According to BBC, Mateen was not on any terrorism watch list, although as CBS also adds Islamic terrorism is being investigated as one of the possible motives behind the mass shooting.

CNN adds that the suspected Orlando gunman was trained in use of weapons.

Yesterday it was revealed that the ATF intends to ban sales of the ammunition, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

Gun stores immediately reported that people were panic buying cases of the bullets, with Ryan Cook, manager of Eagle Armory in Springfield, noting that suppliers were telling him “there was none available to order”.

It appears as though some Walmart stores are also beginning to sell out of the same ammunition.

Alex Jones Show listener Monte Bosak contacted us to relate how his local Walmart in Anchorage, AK went from having “way too much” of the ammo in question two weeks ago, according to the store clerk, to completely selling out after yesterday’s announcement.

“Two weeks ago, I purchased a thousand rounds of XM855 62 grain green tip ammo at this exact Walmart location for $350,” writes Bosak. “While purchasing, I spoke to the lady who works the gun counter and asked her if she had been selling a lot of it. $350/1k rounds is extremely cheap. She said no they hadn’t been selling much of it, and that they had many pallets in the back… “way too much” as she put it.”

“So that leads us to today (2/26/15) when the Drudge Report broke the story of the impending executive order to ban this specific ammunition. Naturally, I went straight to this Walmart after work to purchase what I could, only to find out that they had “sold out”. I spoke to the same lady behind the counter, and I spoke to a manager. Neither of which could look me square in the eye while telling me they sold out,” adds Bosak, who suspects that Walmart may even have deliberately “pulled their stock of the ammunition.”

“There’s no way possible in my mind that they sold all that ammunition,” writes Bosak.

Walmart has previously faced accusations that it has restricted ammunition sales in accordance with the Obama administration’s gun control agenda, but has denied them every time.

Shortly after the Sandy Hook massacre, reports circulated that the retail giant had stopped ordering ammunition and would not be making more sales in anticipation of expected curbs on the second amendment. Other customers reported that they were told Walmart would not stock ammunition for assault rifles, only for shotguns.

Following a surge of demand, in January 2013 Walmart restricted sales of ammunition to three boxes per customer, per day.

“To the extent the January 2015 Open Letter implied or has been construed to hold that incidental, sporadic, or situational ‘use’ of an arm-brace (in its original approved configuration) equipped firearm from a firing position at or near the shoulder was sufficient to constitute ‘redesign,’ such interpretations are incorrect and not consistent with the ATF’s interpretation of the statute or the manner in which it has historically been enforced,” ATF assistant director Marvin Richardson wrote in an official letter.

The ATF’s opinion deals with a complicated part of the National Firearms Act of 1934. That federal law sets standards for which firearms are subject to a special tax and registration with the federal government. One type of firearm regulated under the act are short-barrel rifles, which have rifled barrels under 16 inches in length and are designed to be fired with the stock of the firearm pressed against the shooter’s shoulder.

A video posted by Official Bouchards Milwaukee (@bouchards1) on Jul 23, 2015 at 9:59pm PDT

Rami Murrar, owner of Milwaukee-based Bouchards Clothing Store, posted video of the encounter to the company’s Instagram account Thursday with a stark warning to any other potential burglars.

“Just to set the record straight, we go to work to make our living and to feed our families, not to have shootouts,” Murrar wrote. “Don’t come to our establishment with guns or try breaking in our stores and expect less than us defending ourselves, and if this is what it’s gonna take then let it be, we will protect our business and employees at any cost.”

According to Murrar, who was armed with an AR-15 rifle, one suspect was shot after the would-be robbers attempted to crash a stolen van through Bouchards’ front door.

Detailing the “dumb criminals” mistakes in the video description, Murrar confirmed that at least one of the men were arrested following the incident.

This video also shows the perfect example of dumb criminals. these are the steps:

1- Steal a van.

2- Crash the stolen van into a store and make all of that loud noise when it’s quiet at night.

3- Don’t expect anyone to be monitoring or securing they’re small business.

4- GET SHOT.

5- GET ARRESTED.

6- Leave with nothing.

At the end of the day it’s just some clothes it’s not worth anyone’s life.

An alleged friend of Murrar commenting on Facebook stated that the business had previously been hit by criminals multiple times, prompting Murrar to finally take steps to defend his livelihood.

“He’s had enough. Time to start blasting back at those scumbags!”

Murrar says if it weren’t for his firearm, he may very well may have lost his life once the suspects made their way inside.

Natural News

Jan 14, 2013



Here at Natural News, we have a reputation for asking intelligent questions about things that don’t add up. There are a lot of mysteries out there, and they deserve to be explored and questioned: Why is there still mercury in vaccines? Why did the WTC 7 building implode and fall when no airplane hit it? If the government can create money from nothing, why are we still paying taxes?

And today, I’m adding to that list this commonsense question: Why has no surveillance footage been released from the Sandy Hook shooting, showing Adam Lanza blasting away with an AR-15?

Here’s why the non-release of this video footage is so interesting:

Every time a school shooting takes place, one of the very first things that gets released to the media is the school surveillance footage depicting the gun and the shooter. The purpose of this is to associate the pain and anguish of the massacre to the image of a scary-looking rifle.

In mere days after the Columbine shooting in 1998, for example, the media received footage from the massacre and began playing it over and over again, hammering home the images of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold with their guns. The same is true with numerous other school shootings as you’ll see below.

But with the Sandy Hook school shooting, no video footage has been released. A reasonable person has to ask the question: WHY?

You see, the release of footage of Adam Lanza murdering children with an AR-15 — if such a thing even happened — would strongly support the mainstream media’s call for banning so-called “assault rifles.” It would also:

• Amp up the emotional impact of the fear mongering being carried out by the media.

• Provide visual support for the gun-grabber’s plea to ban all rifles.

• Provide a wealth of images to be used by newspapers and magazines to further demonize the image of rifles.

… and yet, for some reason, we see no surveillance footage from Sandy Hook.

Why is that?

Answer: The AR-15 appears to have been left in his car and never even used in the shooting

The real answer to all this — and this reveals the “Big Lie” of the mainstream media — is that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was left in Lanza’s car.

It was never brought into the school in the first place. As a result, it was not used in the shooting.

This was openly admitted in an NBC news report that has since been scrubbed and marginalized. But NaturalNews captured the video and posted it on our own private video network which is immune from censorship:

Click here to watch the NBC News video yourself.

Here’s a partial transcript of the video:

Matt Lauer: Pete Williams, our chief justice correspondent, has got some new information as well, good morning.

Pete Williams: Matt, good morning to you. This continues to be a very complex investigation, and there is a lot of contradictory information out there, but there is some new information this morning from a couple of federal officials and state officials. They say now that there were actually four handguns recovered inside the school. Not just two as we were initially told. Four handguns and apparently only handguns that were taken into the school.

We knew that Adam Lanza… also had an assault-style, AR-15 style rifle that he had taken to the school that was in the car he drove there, his mother’s car. But we’ve been told by several officials that he left that in the car.

Adam Lanza left the AR-15 in the car

This simple fact, which was confirmed by “federal officials and state officials” has been completely scrubbed out of the mainstream media, and replaced with the “assault weapon lone gunman” theory that just happens to fit nicely with the citizen disarmament agenda being pushed by anti-American traitors like Dianne Feinstein and Joe Biden.

This is why no video footage has been released. Because the real video footage almost certainly shows HANDGUNS used in the massacre, not a rifle. There may even be other elements in the video footage that they don’t want the public to see, including the possibility of multiple shooters.

But take a look at the images and video footage we normally see from other shootings:

Zero Day shooting on May 1, 2001

In all those shootings (and many more), video footage and still images are quickly released to the media for the purpose of blasting these images into the minds of viewers everywhere. Video is played over and over again in the media with the hopes that people will be driven into a state of total irrational fear. It’s also, of course, a good way to cause copycat massacres which result in even more news ratings.

And yet with Sandy Hook, we see no video footage at all. Why is that?

Three possible explanations

Explanation #1) They are busy doctoring the video footage to insert an AR-15 into the video frame by frame. The technology to do this has existed for many years as we all saw with the movie Forrest Gump, where actor Tom Hanks was shown shaking the hand of JFK. You can see that at the :48 mark of this YouTube video.

Explanation #2) No video footage was ever taken by the school. This is absurd, as it’s already on the record that the Sandy Hook school had installed a video security system to monitor anyone entering or leaving the school. In fact, it’s even more interesting than that: this school security policy letter was sent to parents at the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year, and it clearly states:

…the office staff will use a visual monitoring system to allow entry. Doors will be locked at approximately 9:30 a.m. Any student arriving after that time must be walked into the building and signed in at the office…

It’s quite clear that if a student approached the school carrying an AR-15 rifle, he would not have been allowed entry! The only way he could have entered the school with the security system in place was to hide handguns under his clothes. You cannot hide an AR-15 rifle in a pocket, obviously.

Explanation #3) The video footage has been seized by the government and “archived” along with the footage of the missile that struck the Pentagon during the 9/11 attacks. Where is all that video footage? It was all seized and completely hidden from public view.

To be considered “armor piercing” under 18 U.S.C. 921 (a)(17)(B), a bullet must have an entirely metal core or have a jacket weighing more than 25% of its weight, which wouldn’t include M855 rounds because their bullets are partly lead.

The definition in full:

(17) (A) The term “ammunition” means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellent powder designed for use in any firearm. (B) The term “armor piercing ammunition” means- (i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or (ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile. (C) The term “armor piercing ammunition” does not include shotgun shot required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Attorney General finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device.

For years the ATF exempted the M855 from its list of “armor piercing” rounds, but its clear from the statue it never needed an exemption because legally it’s not an “armor piercing” round.

But the law hasn’t stopped the ATF from banning M855 ammo, which is popularly used by AR-15 owners for target shooting due to its relatively cheap cost and availability.

“Now [the ATF] says that since the [M855] bullets can be used in semi-automatic handguns they pose a threat to police and must be banned from production, sale and use,” Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner reported.

Earlier this week, the ATF announced its intention to ban sales of the ammunition, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

The news prompted panic buying, with numerous gun stores reporting a rush of demand for the ammunition.

According to Travis Brunson, owner of Guns on 41 in Ft. Myers, Florida, he is getting calls from customers asking, “whether this ammunition is gonna be banned, how much can I get and what’s happening to the price.”

“We probably sold 2,000 rounds today, where normally we might sell 100, 200,” Brunson told Fox 4. The price of the bullets is also starting to rise.

It’s a similar story at Fowler Firearms, where manager Jon Dezendorf said he began receiving calls about the ammunition shortly after the ATF made its announcement.

Steve Ellis, owner of Top Guns in Terre Haute, Indiana, told WTHI that supplies were dwindling.

“Everyone is selling out of ammunition, distributors are out, manufacturers are out, most dealers are out,” said Ellis.

It was also reported that a Walmart in Anchorage, AK went from having plentiful supplies of the bullets to none whatsoever.

Meanwhile, Ryan Cook, manager of Eagle Armory in Springfield, said that suppliers were telling him “there was none available to order”.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte asserts that the proposed ban is a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act and has vowed to fight the measure in court.

Congressman Tom Rooney has also introduced a bill which will shoot down the ban, with Rooney charging that the measure infringes upon the second amendment.

The key to winning World War III will be to strike hard and to strike fast, and the Russians understand this. Meanwhile, the U.S. military has totally shifted gears from a “Cold War mindset” and is now completely focused on fighting smaller regional wars in the Middle East and elsewhere. As a result, U.S. strategic forces have suffered. There has been very little effort to modernize, and many of our nuclear missile silos are using technology that is ridiculously outdated. For example, CBS News has documented that eight inch floppy disks are still being used in many of our missile silos. And don’t expect things to change any time soon. At this point, the U.S. military plans to keep Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles that were originally deployed in the 1960s and 1970s in service until 2030.

What all of this means is that the Russians are feverishly preparing to fight World War III and we are not. The following are just a few of the next-generation weapons that Russia will use against the United States during the next great global war…

The Sarmat Intercontinental Ballistic Missile

Most Americans have heard of the infamous SS-18 “Satan” intercontinental ballistic missiles. But these are now being replaced by the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile…

The Sarmat (also known as Sarmatian) is a Russian liquid-fueled, MIRV-equipped, super-heavy thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missile in development as of early 2015, intended to replace the previous SS-18 Satan and carry extensive counter-missile defense measures. Its large payload would allow for up to 10 heavy warheads or 15 lighter ones, and/or a combination of warheads and massive amounts of countermeasures designed to defeat the anti-missile systems. The Sarmat is expected to be ready for deployment around 2020, but other sources state that the program is being fast-tracked and it could comprise up to 80 percent of Russia’s land-based nuclear arsenal by 2021.

As you can see below, these missiles are extremely huge…

The Borey Class Nuclear Submarine

Of even greater concern than the Sarmat are the new Borey class nuclear submarines that Russia is building. The following is from an article about the launch of one of these new submarines, the Vladimir Monomakh, in 2013…

Russia recently launched its near silent nuclear submarine following several years of development. The Borey Class submarine, dubbed Vladimir Monomakh, has a next generation nuclear reactor, can dive deeper than 1,200 feet, and carries up to 20 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). Each of these “Bulava” ICBM’s can carry ten detachable MIRV warheads, what they call “re-entry vehicles,” capable of delivering 150 kiloton yields per warhead (luckily, tests of the warheads only yielded 11 “successes” out of almost 20 attempts). Which doesn’t mean they aren’t a concern, MIRV’s are what shook the Cold War to its foundation when they first appeared in the 1970s.

One of the primary things that has U.S. military planners worried is how quiet these subs are. In fact, according to an RT article these subs are supposed to be “almost silent”…

It belongs to a class of missile strategic submarine cruisers with a new generation of nuclear reactor, which allows the submarine to dive to a depth of 480 meters. It can spend up to three months in autonomous navigation and, thanks to the latest achievements in the reduction of noise, it is almost silent compared to previous generations of submarines.

So why is that a problem?

Well, imagine a scenario where Russian nuclear subs approach our coastlines completely undetected and launch a barrage of missiles toward our cities and military bases. We could be wiped out before we even knew what hit us.

If you don’t think that this could ever happen, just consider the following excerpt from a Fox News article published back in 2012…

A Russian nuclear-powered attack submarine armed with long-range cruise missiles operated undetected in the Gulf of Mexico for several weeks and its travel in strategic U.S. waters was only confirmed after it left the region, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. It is only the second time since 2009 that a Russian attack submarine has patrolled so close to U.S. shores.

If we can’t detect them, how are we going to defend against them? Here is a look at one of them in the water…

The Bulava Submarine-Launched Nuclear Missile

The Borey class submarines are going to be carrying Bulava submarine-launched nuclear missiles. The Russians have had some difficulties with the development of these missiles, but most of those difficulties now appear to be ironed out. The following is a description of these missiles from globalsecurity.org…

The Bulava (SS-NX-30) is the submarine-launched version of Russia’s most advanced missile, the Topol-M (SS-27) solid fuel ICBM. The SS-NX-30 is a derivative of the SS-27, except for a slight decrease in range due to conversion of the design for submarine launch. The SS-27 has is 21.9 meters long, far too large to fit in a typical submarine. The largest previously deployed Russian SLBM was the R-39 / SS-N-20 STURGEON, which was 16 meters long. Russian sources report that the Bulava SS-N-30 ballistic missile can carry ten warheads to a range of 8,000km. Other sources suggest that the Bulava might have a range of 10,000 km, and is reportedly features a 550 kT yield nuclear warhead. Apparently up to six MIRVs can be placed at the cost of offloading warhead shielding and decoys.

The Bulava is specifically designed to avoid interception, and each warhead is independently maneuverable to help ensure that they reach their targets intact. The following was written by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Tom Spahn…

Similar to its land-based variant, the Topol-M SS-27, to thwart evolving Western ballistic-missile-defense shields, the Bulava can conduct evasive post-launch maneuvers and deploy a variety of countermeasures and decoys to defend against interception. Its ten hypersonic, independently maneuverable warheads are protected against both physical and electromagnetic-pulse damage to ensure that they can reach their targets intact.

The Barguzin Strategic Missile Train

When nuclear missiles are in a stationary location (such as a missile silo), they can be pretty easy to target. But if you put them on a mobile platform, you can gain quite a strategic edge.

With that in mind, the Russians have reintroduced the strategic missile train…

A Russian military source outlined the capabilities of Barguzin strategic missile train. The country may roll out five such disguised mobile launch platforms each carrying six RS-24 Yars missiles in five years. A ‘nuclear train’ – properly called BZhRK, short for ‘combat railway missile complex’ in Russian – is a mobile platform for transporting and launching strategic nuclear missiles. Similarly to nuclear submarines, such trains are hard to wipe out in a preemptive strike because of their mobility and ability to be disguised as regular freight trains. The Soviet Union had 12 such nuclear trains, each carrying three RT-23 Molodets (SS-24 Scalpel in NATO disambiguation) missiles, but they were released from combat duty after Russia and the US signed the START-2 treaty in 1993 and eventually decommissioned. Last year the Russian military said that nuclear trains – which are no longer banned under the New START treaty – would be revived.

The S-500 Missile Defense System

Lastly, I want to discuss a very important weapons system that I recently mentioned in another article.

It is called the S-500 missile defense system, and it fundamentally changes the balance of power between the United States and Russia.

Once fully deployed, the S-500 will be able to intercept our intercontinental ballistic missiles. This means that the concept of “mutually assured destruction” does not necessarily apply any longer. If the Russians can take out most of our nukes with a devastating surprise first strike and intercept whatever we are able to launch back at them with the S-500, the cost/benefit analysis of a nuclear conflict completely changes.

The following information about the S-500 comes from military-today.com…

The S-500 is not an upgrade of the S-400, but a new design. It uses a lot of new technology and is superior to the S-400. It was designed to intercept ballistic missiles. It is planned to have a range of 500-600 km and hit targets at altitudes as high as 40 km. Some sources claim that this system is capable of tracking 5-20 ballistic targets and intercepting up to 5-10 ballistic targets simultaneously. It can defeat ballistic missiles traveling at 5-7 kilometers per second. It has been reported that this air defense system can also target low orbital satellites. It is planned that the S-500 will shield Moscow and the regions around it. It will replace the current A-135 anti-ballistic missile system. The S-500 missiles will be used only against the most important targets, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, AWACS and jamming aircraft.

Sadly, most Americans do not believe that there is even a remote possibility that we will ever fight a war with Russia.

As a result, most Americans will never see the point of articles like this one.

But over in Russia, anti-American sentiment is at an all-time high and many of their talking heads and intellectuals are now convinced that a shooting war with the United States is inevitable.

So what do you think?

September 19, 2013

Officials involved in the investigation of the Navy Yard shooting, have come forward with new insights on the weapon that was used in the shooting. Alexis had carved the words ‘My ELF weapon’ on his Remington 870-Express-Tactical shotgun. ELF stands for ‘extremely low frequency’, and usually refers to communications or weather. [1]

For those who are familiar with this technology, it is well understood that this is used in programs such as H.A.A.R.P. It has also been reported by several government whistle blowers, and even political activists that they suspected a ‘ELF weapon’ was being used on them.

The report about the carvings is most interesting, because it seems to confirm the claim made by Alexis that 3 men were following him using an ELF weapon while he was in his hotel room. He even filed a report to the Newport, Rhode Island Police stating these claims. Aaron stated he had to change his hotel 3 different times because these people were using the microwave machine on him.

On August 7, the police alerted the Newport Naval Station about the incident, however they did not hear from Alexis again. Although he was being treated for multiple ‘mental disorders’, Aaron was still able to keep his security clearance, enabling him to use his key card to gain access into the Naval Yard Building’s fourth floor and open fire.

The news about the etching on the stock of his rifle is incredible to say the least, as such information rarely reaches the public. The use of ELF waves on humans is usually thought to be science fiction to most, but to others it is very real. Researchers such as Fred Bell, who died after shooting an episode of ‘Conspiracy Theory’ with Jesse Ventura; spoke about said weapons. [2]

Mike Adams

Natural News

March 15, 2014

Exclusive investigation: The 239 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may still be alive. This stunning realization is now supported by considerable emerging evidence detailed in this article. At the same time, the “vanished” Boeing 777 may also be in a hanger in Iran right now, being retrofitted with nuclear weapons and turned into a suicide bomb to be deployed over a major city in the Middle East. This possibility is discussed in detail, below, with supporting evidence.

The idea that Flight 370 passengers and crew may still be alive is not a bizarre theory. Even Reuters is now reporting that U.S. authorities have stated, “…it’s also possible the plane may have landed somewhere.”

Here’s the evidence in support of this emerging “piracy” theory of what may have happened to Flight 370 and why the people who may have diverted it might also be planning on turning it into a weapon:

Five critical pieces of astonishing supporting evidence that Flight 370 passengers may still be alive

Please understand that I do not wish to create false hope for all those families who have greatly suffered through this ordeal. My heart goes out to them, and we can only hope these 239 passengers and crew are, indeed, being kept alive somewhere to be used as a bargaining chip for ransom or political purposes. Here’s the substantial evidence in support of this theory:

• Fact #1: No crash debris has been located, despite an exhaustive search

The search for debris has involved over two dozen nations and is unprecedented in aviation history. If the plane had crashed in the ocean anywhere near its intended flight path, the debris almost certainly would have been located by now.

• Fact #2: The plane’s transponder appears to have been manually turned off several minutes before other communication systems stopped transmitting

As the Associated Press reports, “…key evidence for ‘human intervention’ in the plane’s disappearance is that contact with its transponder stopped about a dozen minutes before a messaging system quit.”

This almost certainly means someone deliberately disabled the transponder (the device which transmits location to air traffic controllers).

Why would someone do that? Because they don’t want to be tracked as they change course and take the plane to a new destination.

A Reuters article adds more detail:

Analysis of the Malaysia data suggests the plane, with 239 people on board, diverted from its intended northeast route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and flew west instead, using airline flight corridors normally employed for routes to the Middle East and Europe.

This adds some evidence to the idea that the plane may have been diverted to the Middle East. Together with the suspicion of stolen passports and the identities of those who traveled with them, this starts to paint a more clear picture in support of piracy as the underlying explanation, with possible ties to Iran (see more below).

What’s especially fascinating to me in all this is that once the transponder was turned off, this massive aircraft apparently went into “stealth mode” where nobody could track it. Although this seems to defy the laws of physics and radar, we cannot argue with the fact that the plane was apparently untraceable as it flew for four hours after the transponder was turned off.

• Smoking Gun Fact #3: The plane’s engines continued to broadcast performance data to satellite for four hours after radar contact was lost

This fact is really the smoking gun in all this. The Wall Street Journal has posted an excellent investigative article revealing that Boeing’s own people have confirmed the plane kept flying four hours after disappearing off radar. As the WSJ reports:

The investigators believe the plane flew for a total of up to five hours, according to these people, based on analysis of signals sent by the Boeing satellite-communication link designed to automatically transmit the status of certain onboard systems to the ground. Throughout the roughly four hours after the jet dropped from civilian radar screens, these people said, the link operated in a kind of standby mode and sought to establish contact with a satellite or satellites. These transmissions did not include data, they said, but the periodic contacts indicate to investigators that the plane was still intact and believed to be flying.

Obviously, this system cannot continue to transmit data if the plane has crashed or exploded. The existence of these signals is very nearly conclusive proof that the aircraft continued flying and did not crash or explode. This eliminates most of the scenarios which would result in the death of passengers, and it strongly supports the piracy / hijacking scenario.

• Fact #4: The mobile devices of many passengers continued to stay online for days after the disappearance

The Washington Post has reported that phones of Flight 370 passengers were active and online for several days following the disappearance of the plane:

…a few relatives said they were able to call the cellphones of their loved ones or find them on a Chinese instant messenger service called QQ that indicated that their phones were still somehow online. A migrant worker in the room said that several other workers from his company were on the plane, including his brother-in-law. Among them, the QQ accounts of three still showed that they were online, he said Sunday afternoon. Adding to the mystery, other relatives in the room said that when they dialed some passengers’ numbers, they seemed to get ringing tones on the other side even though the calls were not picked up.

This evidence also fits the piracy theory remarkably well. If the plane was diverted and landed with passengers alive, their mobile devices could have indeed stayed online by automatically connecting to cell towers. The pirates or kidnappers may have overlooked this and failed to confiscate and destroy the mobile devices, allowing them to connect as long as they had battery life remaining.

• Fact #5: Black box transponders are not broadcasting homing signals because the plane never crashed

Normally, when aircraft crash into the ocean, their black boxes emit homing signal transmissions so they can be located. But no signals were ever detected from Flight 370 black boxes.

Now that seems to make sense: if the plane was hijacked / pirated, then it never crashed and the black boxes are still intact, sitting on the aircraft. This may be why they cannot be found (and why there is no wreckage or debris).

Could passengers still be alive?

If the plane kept flying for four more hours, then it was obviously being piloted with an intent to take it somewhere for some specific purpose. Anyone sophisticated enough to disable the transponder in-flight would have also been sophisticated enough to plan the final destination and landing of the aircraft.

As Reuters now reports:

Military radar data suggests a Malaysia Airlines jetliner missing for nearly a week was deliberately flown hundreds of miles off course, heightening suspicions of foul play among investigators, sources told Reuters on Friday.

Anyone pirating a jetliner and diverting it to another location really only has two key assets to work with: The aircraft itself, and the passengers onboard.

Obviously, acquiring a large aircraft like a Boeing 777 would be a huge asset for terrorist groups who could turn it into a weapon. If this is the intent, then the passengers on board would most likely be killed, as they would serve no particular purpose to the hijackers. Sadly, this remains one of the possible outcomes of piracy, and I don’t want to publish any false hope that might mislead families who have lost loved ones. Realistically, the odds of the passengers being alive right now are probably no better than 1 in 3, in my estimation. But that’s better than zero chance.

A second possibility is that the passengers themselves are going to be used as bargaining chips in an elaborate K&R (kidnap & ransom) scheme. It’s also possible that selected passengers have special value in some way we don’t yet realize, and only they will be kept alive as bargaining chips while the others are killed by the hijackers. Sadly, this is another likely outcome of all this.

And yet, despite all the very negative possible outcomes, there does remain a legitimate scenario in which the passengers and crew of Flight 370 remain alive at this very moment, long after their plane was diverted to an unknown location and safely landed. If this is the case, then we would expect to sooner or later hear from the hijackers with their list of demands for the safe return of the passengers. Such demands, if they ever materialize, would no doubt be multinational in nature.

On the more pessimistic side, if the hijackers only sought the aircraft and not the passengers, then we will probably never hear from them until the day a Boeing 777 flying without a transponder in “stealth mode” delivers a terrorist weapon of some sort to whatever city is being targeted.

Turning a Boeing 777 into a nuclear, chemical or biological weapon

A Boeing 777 is a very large aircraft and can obviously be outfitted with a wide variety of weapons systems by anyone with sufficient knowledge and technical skills (not to mention a soul of pure evil).

According to the Boeing website, the 777 has a “revenue payload capacity” of 112 tons, or about 102,000 kg.

With that sort of enormous carrying capacity, a Boeing 777 could be outfitted with elaborate, high-volume chemical spraying weapons, air-dropped biological weapons or of course a nuclear weapon capable of destroying an entire city. Technology also exists to remotely control large aircraft, and Iran in particular has already demonstrated its technical ability to seize control of U.S. military drones through a process of GPS-spoofing. In support of this feat, Russia just recently “electronically captured” another U.S. drone over Crimea.

Shockingly, the next time the world sees this aircraft may be when it deploys itself over a city like Tel Aviv and detonates a large nuclear weapon at altitude. The reason I deliberately choose Tel Aviv in this example is because there appears to be a possible link with Iran in all this, and the Iranian government leadership has reportedly said it wishes to see Israel wiped off the map. The elaborate nature of this aircraft piracy, if indeed this is the true explanation, also smacks of state-sponsored involvement. This is not the kind of operation that can be pulled off by a couple of yahoos trying to score some quick cash.

The fact that this aircraft was able to fly undetected for at least four hours after the transponder was turned off means the plane can very effectively be used as a “stealth” weapon of sorts, and it could theoretically be deployed over major cities across Europe, Asia, the Middle East or even North America.

Where is Flight 370 now? Pakistan, Iran both potentially in range of the landing

According to this Boeing web page, the 777 has a cruising speed of around Mach .84, or around 650 miles per hour.

If the aircraft cruised for four hours after the transponder was turned off, it could have flown nearly 2600 miles, putting it just within reach of Pakistan, and possibly even southeast Iran if it flew at a slightly higher speed and had sufficient fuel. The Iran Shahr Airport, located less than 100 miles from the border of Pakistan, is conceivably within range and sits at an altitude of around 2,000 meters. This airport has a runway length of 7,711 feet, and according to page 16 of this document on the Boeing website, the required runway length for landing a Boeing 777 is less than 7,711 feet as long as the runway is not wet. This is true even if the aircraft is fully loaded and flying at maximum weight.

The aircraft was actually designed to take advantage of shorter runways. Even Boeing itself says the 777 “uses a new semi-levered gear, which allows it to take off from fields with limited runway length.”

Thus, Flight 370 could have conceivably and successfully landed in Iran. Remember, too, that the aircraft was “using airline flight corridors normally employed for routes to the Middle East and Europe,” according to Reuters (link above).

This flight path, however, would have put it directly over India, and it is difficult to imagine the Indian government not noticing a Boeing 777 aircraft flying over its airspace without a transponder. Then again, the Malaysian government seems to have no idea where the plane went, either, and so we may be dealing with regional military incompetence on these matters, or possibly some amazing new stealth technology that was somehow deployed on the plane.

To help explain where this aircraft could have gone, I put together this flight range map, showing the possible locations where Flight 370 could have flown in the four hours after it disappeared from its intended flight path:

Notice that this range encompasses North Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, Afghanistan and even part of Iran.

An interesting area of investigation in all this would be to find out how much fuel the aircraft was loaded with, and determining whether that fuel load could allow it to fly four or even five more hours."

inforwars37,['Paul Joseph Watson -'],2014-09-09 06:12:27-06:00,https://www.infowars.com/new-police-compliance-weapon-blinds-targets/,"A firm that provides non-lethal equipment to law enforcement is set to release a new “compliance weapon” that temporarily blinds targets for up to 15 minutes, amidst a national conversation about the militarization of police in the aftermath of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.

Shield Defense Systems, LLC, a company based in Reno, Nevada, is currently developing the Z-RO “retinal obfuscation” gun. According to the firm’s website, the weapon, “Obstructs the target’s vision temporarily for up to 10-15 minutes via proprietary technology when deployed on engaged mark.”

Or in other words, despite coming under intense scrutiny over their treatment of protesters and journalists in Ferguson, militarized police departments are about to get their hands on a new toy that blinds people. The weapon will be available for purchase in December.

The company claims that the weapon inflicts no lasting damage on the target and does not harm their retina and cornea, although we heard the same thing about taser weapons which have killed over 500 people in the United States since 2001.

The image of the weapon on the company’s website isn’t likely to calm nerves given that the Z-RO is surrounded by what appear to be standard bullets. There is no explanation of how the “retinal obfuscation” gun actually works.

The notion of “pain compliance,” a technique increasingly being utilized by police departments, has led to concerns that officers have been given the green light to resort to a form of torture that provides plausible deniability.

Fresh spotlight has been thrown on tactics and weapons being used by police departments in America following last month’s disorder in Ferguson, Missouri during which numerous journalists were arrested and had sniper rifles pointed at them simply for doing their job.

A four day trade show in Oakland called Urban Shield has also come under criticism, with Mayor Jean Quan announcing that the event will no longer be held in the city after hundreds of residents protested against the sale of military-style weapons to domestic law enforcement bodies.

According to the Guardian, the show is an opportunity for “weapons contractors who normally deal with the US military seek to redirect their products to domestic use on America’s streets,” and includes the sale of sniper rifles originally designed for the British and German armies.

A recent major ACLU report warns that the increasing use of military-style vehicles and weapons in domestic law enforcement situations is part of a transformation towards militarized policing where Americans are treated “like wartime enemies.”

The clip is a promo for episode 11 of the ABC show Designated Survivor, in which Kiefer Sutherland plays an obscure cabinet secretary who is “unexpectedly thrust into the presidency after an attack at the capitol during a State of the Union address.”

The scene shows the fictional president attending the swearing in of a Congressman before a gunshot is heard and panic ensues.

“Who took the bullet?” asks the promo before the scene cuts to a hospital as surgeons operate on the victim.

Viewers did not find out in the previous cliffhanger episode if the president in the show was shot or if someone else “took the bullet,” although the implication that the president could have been the victim is clear.

One viewer complained to Infowars that he thought the airing of the ad during the interview with Trump was “distasteful”.

The idea of Trump being assassinated has repeatedly been invoked by commentators, journalists and television networks.

Back in February last year, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat caused outrage after he joked about how an assassination attempt could end Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Douthat tweeted a clip from a movie in which a political figure is gunned down by an assassin.

The day before his inauguration, CNN aired a piece asking what would happen if Trump was killed in an attack, along the same lines as the plot in Designated Survivor.

As we reported yesterday, German newspaper publisher and editor Josef Joffe appeared on a panel show during which he “joked” that someone in the White House could “murder” Trump to end his presidency.

I’m sorry. The words I chose hurt people. I apologize.

Name: Greg Morelli

Born: 1967

Roles: Son, Brother, Citizen In Crisis

We live in a time of mass shootings. This is my mass apology.

The thoughts have not worked. The prayers have not worked. What lead me to think Twitter was a good idea is beyond me. I simply do not know what to do about the shootings. Truly, I’m lost!

I own the words I wrote. They hurt people. I apologize.

Some have suggested I take them down. I don’t know if you can. Once it’s out there, it’s out there. But I’ll try.

There. I just took them down. Let’s see if it’s a step in the right direction.

For those who called, who think I’m advocating Gun Control, I’m sorry. I have no answers. Only questions. I do not want to take your guns. It’s up to you to decide what to do with your guns.

I simply do not know what to do about these mass shootings. I’m sorry.

For those who called, threatening my life, I’m sorry. Maybe this is my time. I’m going to try and make this right. But maybe I can’t. So maybe this is my time.

We’re all called. Maybe I’m being called. And not just by angry callers. Maybe I’m being called by something higher. We’ll see.

God Help Me!

Sorry to my staff, who took too many threatening phone calls, got scared and closed early. Sorry to my mom, who read all the comments, took them to heart and fears for my life. I let you down, Mom.

Sorry to my brother. I don’t know what else to say.

I apologize.

I have no appetite, as you can probably imagine. But if I did, I’d make myself a bowl of oatmeal with bananas, blueberries, strawberries and a little bit of milk. I’m drinking coffee, black.

I love music. All music. I believe in the power of dancing to heal a broken heart. In the country music genre, I love Johnny Cash. I love the honesty he brings to his songs. In the rock genre, I love Perry Ferrell, not only for the earthquake of Jane’s Addiction, but Lollapalooza, a music carnival responsible for lifting more artists than I can name. In the genre of life, I love Stevie Wonder. Songs In The Key Of Life re-set the emotional space where music and heart co-exist.

I’m sorry, to all of the artists I named. I hope by association I didn’t bring you down. To those I hurt, I’m sorry. To those who died in Las Vegas, who died in Sandy Hook, who died in Virginia Tech, who died in Fort Hood, who died in Columbine, I’m sorry. I have no answers. I wish I did. I can’t even find the words.

I tried to participate. But all I did is put my foot in my mouth. These mass shootings have me freaked out.

I’m sorry.

Wearing a ski-mask, 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson opened fire at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ at 11:15am yesterday morning, killing 39-year-old parishioner Melanie Smith as she was walking to her car.

Samson then entered the rear of the building and began firing indiscriminately. He was stopped after a struggle with licensed gun owner Robert Engle, who was pistol whipped but forced Samson to accidentally shoot himself in the chest during the fight.

The shooter was taken to hospital and will now be charged with murder and attempted murder.

Samson shared a Mic video back in February entitled “white terrorism” which facetiously argued that Donald Trump should be “considering a ban on white men” because of the claim that, “You’re more likely to be killed by a white man than a Muslim terrorist.”

Mic is a left-wing website that routinely peddles far-left content that appeals to social justice warriors and Black Lives Matter supporters.

“Stop falling for stupidity so easily,” commented the killer.

So the man who shot seven white people at a church in #Antioch shared this @mic video titled ""White Terrorism"" back in February. pic.twitter.com/dz8fMKVq1r — Far Left Watch (@FarLeftWatchOrg) September 25, 2017

The video is typical of far-left anti-white rhetoric that plays on racist propaganda and has become normalized on social media.

Leftists appear to be panicking about the fact that the incident bolsters Donald Trump’s travel ban, given that Sudan was on the original list of banned countries.

One Reddit poster asked another user not to link to a story that showed a picture of the gunman because it would “embolden Trump voters”.

The left is panicking over the Sudanese migrant who shot up a church in Tennessee. pic.twitter.com/PBPT8oNBhc — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) September 25, 2017

Last year, Dallas massacre gunman Micah Johnson was motivated by a similar grievance, stating that he “wanted to kill white people” before killing five police officers and injuring seven.

NYPD cop killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley also executed two police officers at point blank range as part of a Black Lives Matter revenge attack in response to the death of Michael Brown.

Suggestions that Samson’s motivation was racial once again emphasize how the extremist rhetoric of the alt-left is causing unstable people to act out violently.

Or more specifically, is it common for blacks to be unfairly shot by police? Judging by most media coverage and SJW responses, you’d think so (see Chaos in Milwaukee After Police Shoot Armed Suspect. Because #BlackLivesMatter and Blue Lives Matter? Hillary Specifically SNUBS National Police Union). But as it turns out, the numbers state otherwise…

A recent deadly force study by Washington State University researcher Lois James found that police officers were less likely to shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white or Hispanic ones… Harvard economics professor, Roland Fryer… found that blacks were 24% less likely than whites to be shot by officers even though the suspects were armed or violent [in Houston].

When they’re not busy “peacefully” rioting… do you ever hear Black Lives Matter mention those statistics? Yeah, that’s not a thing. Just like “systemic” police racism isn’t a thing. For a group that claims to care so much about blacks (oft times exclusively), they don’t seem to care about the statistics regarding the deaths of black people…



See, statistics bring to light the fact that the inner cities have been destroyed by leftist policies (watch Detroit Real Time Ride-Along). Thus when it comes to hyper liberal SJWs, numbers aren’t as effective as, say, a hashtag. Don’t judge. Math is hard, you bigot.

But even if they’re ignored, the facts remain. Meanwhile, racism? Not so much.

Clearly this isn’t to say that there are no instances of racism ever. PragerU is simply pointing out the fact that blacks aren’t unfairly targeted. They make a compelling argument, considering they did actual research and stuff. I know, I know. I can already hear Shaun King’s culturally-appropriated cornrows simmering with anger. Worry not, we have even more “racist” facts below…"

October 1, 2011

Flu shots are becoming the most widely recommended vaccine on the planet, with The Federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) changing their flu shot recommendation from children between 6 months and 5 years old demographic to virtually everyone except those between the ages of 19-49 who are in perfectly good health. Even within this category there is a barrage of organizations warning against avoiding the ubiquitous flu shot.

The fact of the matter is that seasonal flu shots are simply not backed by reputable science, and a number of major studies have even shown that the seasonal flu shot is not effective at all in preventing the flu.

Adding fuel to the fire, this ineffective shot comes with pages of nasty side effects that will certainly make you reconsider getting one this year. Here are 3 major reasons you, your family, and the medical establishment should reconsider flu shots as effective flu prevention tools:

1. Seasonal flu vaccines have been found to only be 1% effective

A new major study has numerically determined the effectiveness of the flu shot to be 1%. This means that despite the H1N1-loaded flu jab, there is still a 99% chance that you will not be protected against the flu. The reason for this, despite the faulty science behind the development of the vaccine, has to do with flu strains. It is extremely challenging, to the point of guessing, which flu strain will affect your area. With such a wide selection, it is very rare (about 1%, according to the study), for it to be the correct strain.

The researchers from the study stated:

“The corresponding figures [of people showing influenza symptoms] for poor vaccine matching were 2% and 1% (RD 1, 95% CI 0% to 3%)” announced the study authors. In other words, you would have to vaccinate 100 people to reduce the number of people affected by the influenza virus by just one.

The findings do not stop there. The researchers also highlighted other findings about the flu vaccine, which topple the mainstream concept of their safety and effectiveness:

“Vaccination had…no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates.”

“Vaccine use did not affect the number of people hospitalized or working days lost.”

“The analysis howed that reliable evidence on influenza vaccines is thin but there is evidence of widespread manipulation of conclusions…”

“There is no evidence that [influenza vaccines] affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission.” — Meaning vaccines do not affect transmission of disease, what they are designed for.

“In average conditions (partially matching vaccine) 100 people need to be vaccinated to avoid one set of influenza symptoms.”

2. Flu shots have been linked to killer nerve disease

Even government health officials have confirmed the link between the H1N1-containing flu shot and the killer nerve disease known as Guillain-Barre Syndrome. A government agency known as The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a warning over the connection following the phony swine flu pandemic. The news came after mainstream media reported on the fact that even 50% of doctors were refusing the H1N1 vaccine over health concerns.

Neurologists around the world were even warned about the safety of the vaccine by Professor Elizabeth Miller, head of the immunization department for UK’s Health Protection Agency.

The vaccines used to combat an expected swine influenza pandemic in 1976 were shown to be associated with GBS and were withdrawn from use,” she wrote in a letter to neurologists.

3. Vitamin D is over 800% more effective with no side effects

A major clinical trial performed at the Division of Molecular Epidemiology in the the Department of Pediatrics at the Jikei University School of Medicine Minato-ku in Tokyo found that vitamin D was extremely effective in preventing and reversing influenza. Led by Mitsuyoshi Urashima, the study involved 334 children, half of which were given 1200 IUs per day of vitamin D3. This is actually a very low amount of vitamin D, with many natural health experts recommending around 5,000 IUs per day for most individuals. If the researchers used a higher amount like 5,000 IUs, the findings and subsequent percentage would most likely be even more profound.

What the study found was that 31 of 167 children in the placebo group contracted influenza over the 4 month duration of the study, while only 18 of 168 children in the vitamin D group did. This is in comparison to the flu shot being effective in 1 out of 100 participants, with countless side effects.

This means that vitamin D is 800% more effective in preventing the flu than vaccines at 1200 IUs daily. The percentage could likely climb into the thousands if the dosage was upped to the recommended 5,000 IUs per day, and perhaps even higher beyond that.

There is simply no reason to receive a flu shot when natural alternatives like vitamin D exist. Deadly nerve disease, narcolepsy, and overall ineffectiveness are but a few of the negative aspects of the flu shot."

So this is what you get. … We not the one’s that killing us, ya’ll are killing us. We can’t make a change if ya’ll don’t change.”

He’s wrong. The biggest threat to black lives is other blacks.

May 12, 2014

A woman in Alpine, Texas has accused a DEA agent of smashing her neck with the butt of an M-16 rifle during a raid on her sister’s smoke shop.

KWES NewsWest 9 / Midland, Odessa, Big Spring, TX: newswest9.com |

Ilana Lipsen, owner of the Purple Zone, told reporters that the incident began when DEA agents confronted her sister as she attempted to open the store late last week. According to the DEA, Lipsen’s shop was targeted as part of a nationwide crackdown on “synthetic drugs.”

“She pulled up and they said, ‘Do you have the key?’ and there’s not a key for my property,” Lipsen told News West 9. “We have smart locks and they’re all on codes. She said, ‘I don’t have a key, but I have…’ and at that exact moment, one of the officers said, ‘Break it down.’ It didn’t give her a chance to say, ‘I have a code.'”

Lipsen says agents then entered her shop, disconnected her surveillance cameras and confiscated hard drives, cameras, cell phones and several firearms. Lipsen refutes claims by DEA agents that she was selling or in possession of any synthetic drugs.

“The only information that I could get was they were looking for some type of document,” Lipsen said. “I said, ‘Well, could you please tell me what kind of document that you’re looking for and I can help you?’ But they wouldn’t give me any information.”

As Lipsen’s sister watched from the sidewalk, one agent reportedly approached and demanded she leave the area, prompting her to ask, “What are you going to do, shoot me?”

“He grabbed her by the shoulders and started roughhousing her,” Lipsen said. “My sister has never been arrested, has never had any other problems and she was terrified.”

Lipsen says the situation grew worse after her sister flinched, causing the agent to become even more violent.

“At that moment, he took his foot and tripped her to get her off of her feet and have her down to the ground. One of her feet came flying up and accidentally hit him in the shin,” Lipsen said. “At that time he started saying, ‘Well now you’re assaulting a police officer.’ And he started attacking her more. He took the butt of his M-16 rifle and smashed it into her neck.”

Lipsen’s sister was then handcuffed by one agent as another reportedly grabbed her by her neck.

“She was yelling, ‘Get off of me. You’re hurting me. You’re choking me.’ He had his hand around her neck as he was holding her face into the ground of the neighbors property,” Lipsen said.

The DEA denied all allegations and claimed the blood on scene was from an agent who accidentally cut himself while breaking down the store’s door. Although the DEA did confirm the arrest and assault charge, no explanation was given over how Lipsen’s sister received the large wound on her neck.

The sisters were charged with three felonies for selling an illegal substance, charges both sisters deny.

While both parties deny the other’s claims, the issue at large continues to be the militarization of law enforcement through the failed war on drugs.

Gary Tuchman, a correspondent for the network, also drew widespread laughter for effeminately handling the weapon and closing his eyes while firing.

1. All guns are loud

2. There is no such thing as full semi-automatic he should be a part of the @migos making up words like that.

3. The gun doesn’t kick that hard this Guy is just super saiyan beta.

4. Every gun is design to inflict

5. JUST THROW THE WHOLE @CNN AWAY pic.twitter.com/27iZnJeVAE — Colion Noir (@MrColionNoir) February 27, 2018

The clip begins with Tuchman struggling to hold the rifle properly as retired Lt. General Mark Hertling explains the weapon’s mechanics.

Despite Hertling’s alleged expertise, the former military man goes on to claim that the AR-15 is capable of being fired “full semi-automatic.”

The made-up term appears to be part of an attempt to frame the rifle as more dangerous than other semi-automatic rifles, the Daily Caller’s David Hookstead argues.

“It’s also worth noting that these two are pushing a narrative that somehow an AR-15 shoots at a more rapid rate than other semi-automatic weapons. That’s of course completely false,” Hookstead writes. “The cyclical rate of AR-15 can be faster than some semi-automatic weapons and slower than others.”

Social media users were also quick to pick apart the report, making fun of Tuchman and Hertling in the process.

The report is strikingly similar to a 2016 article in which a New York Daily News journalist claimed to have acquired post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after firing an AR-15.

“The recoil bruised my shoulder, which can happen if you don’t know what you’re doing. The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face,” the writer said. “The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary form of PTSD. For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.”

Despite the AR-15 being identical in capabilities to countless hunting rifles, anti-gun advocates are demanding the rifle be outright banned based merely on its appearance.

Infowars.com

January 28, 2012

In an end-run around an all out gun ban, the New Jersey Assembly Law & Public Safety Committee is set to consider legislation that would ban ammunition under the auspices of protecting police.

The language seemingly targets the already prohibited ‘armor piercing ammunition’ but would encompass any ammo that is deemed to “pose a threat to the safety and well being of law enforcement.” Ammoland is reporting that “Common hunting, target, and self-defense ammunition would be subject to ban, along with BB’s, airgun pellets, and non-metallic ammunition like plastic airsoft pellets.”

The NRA concurs with Ammoland, reporting that while the language of the bill seemingly deals only with handgun ammo, the actual legislation could include the ban of many rifle ammunition, particularly as there is a bleed over between cartridges that work with both types of firearms:

Although the bill only mentions handgun ammunition, it is in fact not limited to handgun ammunition, and would apply to all rifle ammunition for which a handgun is ever made. As an increasing number of gun manufacturers make handgun models that shoot rifle caliber ammunition, the line between “handgun” vs. “rifle” ammunition has become blurred, and the New Jersey State Police have already begun treating rifle ammunition in this category as if it were handgun ammunition for regulatory purposes. As long as a handgun exists that shoots a particular caliber of rifle ammunition, New Jersey treats that ammunition as if it were handgun ammunition.

The bills would also “criminalize the use of a defaced or stolen firearm,” which would again, through vague and ill-defined language, deceptively restrict the lawful ownership of virtually any modified or restored firearm.

The Judiciary Committee, sister to the Law & Public Safety Committee in the New Jersey assembly, has previously pushed sweeping gun ban legislation, as in 2008 where it passed 5-to-1 out of committee a long-list of firearms, including modern weapons, traditional muzzleloaders, older guns and even replicas that were targeted for a ban.

Police have repeatedly admitted that they can’t protect us and have pointed out that they have no liability to do so. Yet, this and other legislation proves that they don’t want us to be able to protect ourselves either. Further, it is the criminal intent of the aggressor, not the tool he holds, that poses the threat to law enforcement or anyone else targeted. Leaving all the tools in the hands of criminals and taking them away from law abiding citizens does nothing to even the score and makes little sense, despite what may well be good intentions. Still, lawmakers are ever eager to encroach on the guarantee of the right to bear arms so clearly outlined in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.

Assembly Bill 588 and Assembly Bill 1013 are scheduled for hearing on January 30, and would enable the state’s Attorney General to instate a de facto restriction of the Second Amendment via executive fiat.

There are, of course, many pushing for whatever restrictions can be sustained under the current political climate at any given time.

New Jersey, like other big city venues including New York and Chicago, has long been a hotbed for victim disarmament. Newark Mayor Cory Booker has been publicly demonizing gun ownership for some time, offering a $1000 reward for anonymous tips and warning that ‘illegal’ firearm possession will lead to jail time. Booker is a prominent member of the national Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, who advocate many of the same restrictions.

Meanwhile, the resignation of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords a year after her attempted assassination has prompted renewed cries to embrace federal legislation to ban certain ammo-clips, backed by the vigilant anti-2nd Amendment Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, the Brady Center and other disarmament advocates.

According to reports, President Obama secretly vowed to the Brady Center last year to work on gun legislation “under the radar,” prompting many commentators to connect it with the Fast & Furious gun-walking scandal, as well as many other related covert operations, asserting that it was in part an attempt to demonize the 2nd amendment and garner support for firearm legislation.

Further, efforts are being made in 2012 to coerce that U.S. Senate into ratifying the United Nation’s Small Arms Treaty, an international agreement that seeks to disarm ordinary Americans and limit the ability to purchase a wide array of products in the firearm industry.

“The robot was a game changer here,” said Capt. Jack Ewell, a tactical expert with the Sheriff’s Department — the largest sheriff’s department in the nation. “We didn’t have to risk a deputy’s life to disarm a very violent man.”

It began late in the evening of Sept. 8, when deputies in Lancaster were pursuing a man suspected of trying to kill one person and robbing two others.

Natural News

Jan 28, 2013

In yet another huge blow to the rhetoric and narrative of the Obama administration and its desire to disarm the American public, a DHS bid has been uncovered (see documents below) showing that the Department of Homeland Security recently put out an offer to purchase 7,000 full-auto “assault weapons” to be used domestically, inside the USA.

Keep in mind that President Obama is on the record saying, “AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals; that they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities.”

But it seems he really means they don’t belong on the streets of our cities unless they are in the hands of homeland security enforcers, in which case they can be FULL-AUTO assault weapons.

The DHS bid for 7,000 full-auto assault weapons is found by clicking here. The original credit for discovering this goes, to my best knowledge, to Awr Hawkins at Breitbart.com.

In the hands of the government, they’re called “Personal Defense Weapons”

The juiciest part of this bid is the use of the phrase “Personal Defense Weapons” to describe the full-auto AR-15s being purchased by DHS.

Apparently, when YOU hold an AR-15, it’s an “assault rifle.” But magically, if you hand that same rifle to an armed government homeland security enforcer, it instantly transforms itself into a “personal defense weapon.”

The request for bid actually says:

DHS and its components have a requirement for a 5.56x45mm NATO, select-fire firearm suitable for personal defense use in close quarters and / or when maximum concealment is required.

So there it is, right in black and white: DHS enforcers need full-auto AR-15s which are “suitable for personal defense in close quarters” and for “maximum concealment.”

But if you or I make the same claim, suddenly we are branded lunatics by the fringe left and all the gun grabbers across America who apparently have no clue that their own government is arming up like never before.

Senator Feinstein, the gun-grabbing Senator from California, says she wants to take all the guns from all Americans. “Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ’em all in,” she says on the record. But while Mr. and Mrs. America are turning in their guns, ‘roid-head DHS goons are arming to the teeth with full-auto assault rifles.

This is all on top of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition the U.S. government has already stockpiled, as was discovered last year. What kind of government wants to domestically stockpile ammo and full-auto weapons, putting them in the hands of domestic agents who have nothing whatsoever to do with overseas wars? Well, the kind of government that plans to NEED 1.6 billion rounds of ammo and full-auto assault weapons, of course.

Read some language from the contract bid: Pistol grips, full-auto and more

Here’s some selected text from the bid:

Click here for the PDF document containing the following text:

The scope of this contract is to provide a total of up to 7,000 5.56x45mm North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) personal defense weapons (PDW) throughout the life of this contract to numerous Department of Homeland Security components. The action shall be select-fire (capable of semi-automatic and automatic fire). The action shall be capable of accepting all standard NATO STANAG 20 and 30 round M16 magazines (NSN 1005-00-921-5004) and Magpul 30 round PMAG (NSN 1005-01-576-5159). The magazine shall have a capacity to hold thirty (30) 5.56x45mm NATO rounds.

The fire control selector shall have three positions; safe, semi-automatic, and automatic. The pistol grip shall be a fixed, vertical pistol grip constructed of a durable material.

DHS admits AR-15 with 30-round magazine is “suitable for personal defense use in close quarters”

This government document openly admits that AR-15s with 30-round magazines and capable of fully automatic fire are “suitable for personal defense” in close quarters (i.e. your home).

CNN, of course, doesn’t want you to ever hear that. Nor does Feinstein, Cuomo, Schumer, Obama, Eric Holder or any other gun grabbers. Even while their own government is arming up with 1.6 billion rounds of ammo and 7,000 full-auto “assault rifles” (plus lots more in other bids), they are trying to completely disarm the American citizenry through new gun registration and confiscation legislation.

The whole point of all this, of course, is to create firepower disparity between the government and the citizenry… To disarm the People while arming up the government agents who operate domestically. That way, the people can be forced at gunpoint into doing almost anything the oppressive government demands! (Taking vaccine shots, giving up private property, turning over farms and businesses, etc.)

What’s really hard-hitting about this is that the radical left keeps claiming things like “no one needs an assault rifle for personal defense.” Okay, if that true, then the Department of Homeland Security should abandon all such rifles first! Let’s see DHS turn in all its rifles and ammo, thereby setting an example of the “fact” that “nobody needs an assault rifle” for self defense.

In truth, a full-auto AR-15 is an outstanding weapon for self defense, which is exactly why DHS is buying thousands of them. Nothing stops bad guys faster than a barrage of high-velocity lead aimed in their direction. Again, that’s why DHS wants these rifles in the first place. One of these rifles in the hands of a citizen could have stopped the Sandy Hook shooting in seconds.

Pay attention to the word games (which are really mind games)

As you observe the highly manipulated gun control argument, pay special attention to the word games you’re being subjected to:

An AR-15 in the hands of a citizen is an “assault rifle.”

But an AR-15 in the hands of a DHS agent is a “Personal Defense Weapon.”

A full-auto-capable rifle in the hands of a citizen is called a “machine gun.”

A full-auto-capable rifle in the hands of a DHS agent is called a “select-fire rifle.”

According to the media, all government agents with assault rifles are presumed innocent and assumed to be stopping crime.

But all private citizens with assault rifles are presumed guilty and assumed to be causing crime.

When one citizen goes crazy and murders a bunch of people, the call goes out for ALL citizens to be stripped of their firearms.

But when one government agent goes crazy and murders a bunch of people, the calls goes out for MORE guns to be placed in the hands of MORE government agents!

Thank you, DHS, for admitting the truth

In summary, it looks like we actually need to thank the DHS for admitting the truth that Obama won’t: AR-15s are personal defense weapons, suitable for use in close quarters, especially when equipped with 30-round magazines.

That’s why I own one, and it’s why DHS wants thousands more (but theirs are full-auto, while mine is only semi-auto).

As a general rule, all freedom-loving Americans should want the same firepower their domestic government possesses. That’s the whole point behind the Second Amendment, and it represents the distribution of power in a free society.

But instead of firepower being equal in America today, DHS is using our taxpayer dollars to purchase thousands of full-auto weapons for their own agents. This is apparently being done under ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).

This brings up the question for another entire article, and here’s the question: Why does immigration need 7,000 full-auto assault rifles? Is there a friggin’ Mexican invasion planned that nobody told me about? Is ICE going to invade Mexico and start a shooting war with the Mexican drug cartels?

Seriously: Why does ICE need 7,000 full-auto assault rifles? And why does DHS need 1.6 billion rounds of ammo?

24-year-old Daniel Frisiello was arrested after a federal investigation traced the unsigned letters to him as a result of Frisiello also ordering a “glitter bomb” for one of the intended recipients using his own name.

“You are an awful, awful person. I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV,” Frisiello wrote in the letter addressed to Trump Jr.

It also said: “You the family idiot. Eric looks smart. This is the reason why people hate you. You are getting what you deserve. So shut the f*** up.”

A cursory scan of Frisiello’s Facebook page confirms him to be a gun control advocate who has endorsed and supported numerous anti-Trump political causes and campaigns.

Numerous posts over the last two weeks by Frisiello expressed support for the Parkland students who have been given platforms by the mainstream media to advocate for Second Amendment restrictions.

“Oh how karmas a bitch!” wrote Frisiello in response to companies ending their relationship with the NRA over the Parkland shooting. He also donated to the anti-gun March For Life which is set to take place later this month.

“Oh how I laughed! Karmas a bitch when you get money from the NRA!” wrote Frisiello in response to Senator Marco Rubio being confronted during last week’s CNN town hall.

Frisiello’s “likes” include numerous anti-Trump campaigns as well as pages such as “CNN Heroes,” MSNBC host Joe Scarborough and COngressman Adam Schiff.

Frisiello also posted an image of a sign that reads, “Trump For Prison 2017.”

In the video, Hogg, who works for the Marjory Douglas high school newspaper, asks fellow students what their thoughts are on gun control — while shooter Nikolas Cruz was terrorizing the school.

“So what are your thoughts?” Hoggs asked a terrified girl.

“I don’t think there’s really anything more to say, but there shouldn’t have to be, cause if you look around this closet and saw everyone just hiding together, you would know that this shouldn’t be happening anymore, and that it doesn’t deserve to happen to anyone,” she said.

“And that no amount of money should make it more easily accessible to get guns and that’s that.”

Another girl said that she used to be pro-gun until the shooting started.

“I wanted to be a junior NRA member, I wanted to learn how to hunt, I was always fascinated by guns as a young girl, but this experience was so traumatizing to the point where now I can’t even fathom the idea of a gun in my house.”

She added she was even going to a gun range for her 18th birthday to learn to shoot.

“But at this point, I don’t even want to be behind a gun, I don’t want to be a person behind a bullet, because I don’t want to be the person to point a bullet at someone, and to have a bullet pointed at me, my school, my classmates, my teachers, my mentors – it’s just, it’s definitely eye-opening to the fact that we need more gun control in this country.”

Hogg’s intrepid journalistic spirit is better explained when one learns he’s an avid CNN fan, having toured the Atlanta headquarters and sporting the Fake News Network’s shirt in several photos.

His liberal and anti-Trump views on Twitter help explain why CNN is so eager to elevate him as a spokesman for the current anti-gun movement.

Viewed nearly 7 million times at the time of publication, the video, created by Facebook user Danny Farnsworth, dismantles the myth that the AR-15 is any different than countless other rifles.

“Let me try to clear the air here a little bit,” Farnsworth begins. “All this talk about ‘assault weapons, assault guns,’ is total bullshit.”

Farnsworth continues by comparing an AR-15 and a small hunting rifle, noting that both weapons share the exact same capabilities and only differ in terms of cosmetics.

“A weapon that looks like this, people are super scared of,” Farnsworth says while holding up an AR-15.

“Yet this,” Farnsworth says while displaying the wooden rifle, “is totally fine. No problems.”

“I have news for you. These two guns are exactly the same weapon… the only difference in these two guns is the way it’s built with wood or plastic… that’s it!”

The gun enthusiast goes on to show how the AR-15’s magazine is compatible with the wooden rifle and notes that both fire only as fast as the trigger is pulled.

“But somehow this will be made illegal and this is fine, yet they are the exact same gun, Farnsworth adds. “So please, those people out there calling for bans, calling for ‘stop the assault rifles,’ you don’t know what the fuck you are talking about.”

“Your ignorance is showing and it makes your argument moot.”

The video comes amid heightened debate over gun control in the wake of a tragic school shooting in Florida that took the lives of 17 people last week.

Unlike previous presidents, Donald Trump opted to put the focus on mental health during an address to the nation, drawing the ire of gun control proponents.

“It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,” Trump said. “We must actually make that difference.”"

The survey, which was conducted at the start of the week, finds, “Only 24% of Americans trust the government to fairly enforce gun control laws.”

A full 58 per cent of Americans lack trust in the government’s ability to implement such laws, while 18% are not sure.

The numbers emphasize how while support for new gun control measures is clearly a majority opinion, confidence in the success of those measures having any positive effect isn’t solid.

Almost half (49%) of Americans think more gun control laws will have no impact on violent crime. Even amongst Democrats, a relatively slim majority, 56 per cent, think new gun restrictions will decrease violent crime.

A Quinnipiac poll released earlier this week found that support for gun control is at an all time high, with 67% of Americans supporting what the media has termed an “assault weapons” ban.

President Donald Trump has called for allowing “gun adept teachers with military or special training experience” to carry a concealed weapon in schools so they could “immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions”.

Meanwhile, NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre told an audience at CPAC today, “The elites don’t care not one whit about America’s school system and school children. Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment (of the Constitution) and our firearms freedoms so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.”

“No more ‘thoughts and prayers,’ please,” Blythe wrote on his Instagram on Thursday. “You can take those and put them towards something that only God, fate, random chance, the universe, whatever you believe/do not believe in can affect — they might do some good there.”

“Instead of ‘thinking and praying,’ here’s a CONCRETE ACTION you can take — you can contact your legislators and DEMAND that there be some reasonable, common-sense gun law changes. DEMAND IT AND KEEP DEMANDING IT.”

“The time for ‘thoughts and prayers’ is long past — it’s a slap in the face of people who continue to die as a result of crazy people armed with LEGALLY obtained high-powered semiautomatic weapons, weapons that are designed for JUST ONE THING — killing human beings,” he added.

The heavy metal singer then asserted that AR-15 rifles should not be legal because they’re used for “hunting men,” not deer.

“I grew up in the country with guns in the house — these were shotguns, used for hunting,” he said. “You don’t use an AR-15 for hunting deer, you use it for hunting MEN or (apparently) CHILDREN.”

Instead of calling AR-15s “assault rifles,” which is already a misnomer, Blythe suggested calling them “Kid Killers” to drive home his message.

“Some people don’t like the term ‘assault rifle.’ Okay, cool — why don’t we call them ‘Kid Killers’ then? Is that a little better? Can we get a little KID KILLER control happening? Is it still ‘too early’ to start talking about getting these KID KILLERS off the streets? Are the students who survived the massacre in Florida and who are publicly begging us, the adults in charge of things, for gun law reform ‘politicizing’ the whole thing? Is it ‘too early’ for THEM to bring it up? Should we just tell them to shut up because they are children and don’t understand adult matters, stuff like why crazy people can easily buy assault rifles and then SHOOT THEM DEAD in the classroom?”

Blythe fails to grasp a couple of things. First, the shooter Nikolas Cruz had a long history of mental issues, violence, and trauma, and was alerted to the FBI and local authorities on numerous occasions. So this particular attack could have been easily prevented by law enforcement.

Second, Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school is a gun-free zone. So the facility already heeded the advice from anti-gun advocates, which just means a building full of people who were defenseless.

Several schools recognize the problem with gun-free zones, and are taking steps to arm their faculty should another shooting incident occur.

Perhaps Blythe should stick to growling into his mic, and heed his own lyrics when following the left’s talking points about the Second Amendment:

“This is the art of ruin.

This is the resolution

The end of all progress

The death of evolution

It bleeds all life away.”

Kennedy (R., La.) railed against stricter gun control provisions, saying that America needs ‘idiot control’ rather than gun control.

CNN host John Berman questioned Kennedy regarding his stated opposition to legislation being considered in the Senate that would give federal agencies greater access to state records, in order to better determine the eligibility of a person to buy firearms.

The bill would offer greater federal funding to state agencies that comply, while withholding it from those that don’t.

“I don’t think we need more gun control laws,” Kennedy said.

“Not a single one?” Berman asked.

“No,” Kennedy declared. “I think we need more idiot control.”

When Berman asked Kennedy to expand on what he meant by the term ‘idiot’, the Senator stated that he was referring to violent criminals like the shooter in Parkland.

Kennedy said he was not referring to anyone with a mental illness, and that he may have “misused” the term in that context.

Kennedy then stated that violent criminals are too often assumed to be mentally ill when many are just plain “evil.”

The Senator noted that the mental stability of the Parkland shooter has not been properly determined at this stage.

“I don’t know that, so I will call him an idiot,” Kennedy said."

August 7, 2013



A Colorado apartment complex has sent out a letter to all tenants (and future disarmed slaves) stating that starting October 1, “firearms and weapons are prohibited” from the complex.

Retired Marine Art Dorsch, 77, contacted 9News in Castle Rock, Colorado after receiving the “updated community policies” notice which turns his fine abode into a “victim disarmament zone.”

“I’m a hunter. I’m a licensed conceal and carry person,” Dorsch said to the news channel.

That didn’t matter to the apartment manager who apparently wants to create a mini-Chicago.

A handwritten note on the typed letter emphasizes that even handguns for licensed concealed carry are included in the ban.

“It upsets me very much,” Dorsch said.

To comply with the heavy demand, Dorsch said he may have no choice but to leave his guns with a friend 30 miles away.

Firearm bans at apartment complexes could encourage criminals to perform “home invasions” after realizing that the apartment dwellers are likely unarmed.

Violent crimes will increase as anti-gun attitudes grip Colorado, but many Coloradans are pushing back.

After Colorado Senate President John Morse introduced strict gun control legislation last spring, the “Recall Senator John Morse” committee gathered more signatures to remove Morse from office than he even received in votes for his election.

“It’s pretty amazing,” said Paul Paradis, owner of Paradise Sales Firearms in Colorado Springs. “You think he might have ticked off some of his constituents?”

Colorado recently banned magazines that hold more than 15 rounds, which effectively prevented gun shops from selling rifles that typically use 20 and 30 round magazines.

“We can sell the gun, but we won’t be able to sell the magazine with it, so what’s the point?” gun store manager Richard Taylor said to the Denver Post.

Several northern Colorado counties even recently proposed seceding from Colorado and forming their own state in response to such state gun control legislation among other things.

“Northern and Northeastern Colorado and our voices are being ignored in the legislative process this year, and our very way of life is under attack,” said Weld County Commissioner Sean Conway.

Unfortunately an “unarmed slave” mentality is spreading beyond legislation as evidenced by Oakwood Apartments’ new “community policy.”

The complex is managed by Ross Management Group, with a claimed “solid reputation with Finance Authorities, tax credit investors and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.”

The management company operates multiple apartment complexes around the Denver area.

Castle Rock, approximately 30 miles south of Denver, has a population of nearly 50,000.

The new crime statistics released by the agency reveal that out of 11,961 murders performed within the U.S. in 2014, 660 were committed unarmed, 1,567 were committed with knives and only 248 murders were known to have been committed using rifles of any type, including single-shot long arms and “assault rifles” routinely demonized by gun control groups.

Granted, the FBI did list 2,052 murders under “unknown firearm type,” but given the percentages of the known firearm categories, it is unlikely that more than four percent of the “unknown firearms” were in fact rifles, and less than that were semi-automatics.

In other words, despite the calls to ban “military-style assault rifles” by anti-gun groups, conservatively less – and likely much less – than four percent of murders were committed using AR-15s, AK-47s and other semi-automatic long arms.

This figure is a decrease from 2013.

In comparison, AR-15s are used far less often in murders than shotguns, a fact which contradicts Vice President Joe Biden who once implied otherwise.

That isn’t that surprising considering the recent study by the University of Chicago Crime Lab which revealed that AR-15s and AK-47s are unpopular amongst criminals.

Overall the number of murders involving guns has plunged from 8,855 in 2012 to 8,454 in 2013 and now 8,124 in 2014, following a significant decline in gun-related violent crimes since the mid-1990s.

“…The 2014 estimated violent crime total was 6.9 percent below the 2010 level and 16.2 percent below the 2005 level,” the FBI stated.

Guns are used exponentially more often to stop crime than to kill; each year firearms prevent an estimated 2.5 million crimes in the U.S., usually without a shot being fired, meaning that guns are used over 300 times more often to save innocent lives, given the 8,124 murders committed with firearms in 2014.

It’s also been estimated that over 56 million people have died due to gun control in the last century, according to Gun Owners of America:

In 1911, Turkey established gun control. Subsequently, from 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, deprived of the means to defend themselves, were rounded up and killed. In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. Then, from 1929 to 1953, approximately 20 millon dissidents were rounded up and killed. In 1938 Germany established gun control. From 1939 to 1945 over 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, mentally ill, union leaders, Catholics and others, unable to fire a shot in protest, were rounded up and killed. In 1935, China established gun control. Subsequently, between 1948 and 1952, over 20 million dissidents were rounded up and killed. In 1956, Cambodia enshrined gun control. In just two years (1975-1977) over one million “educated” people were rounded up and killed. In 1964, Guatemala locked in gun control. From 1964 to 1981, over 100,000 Mayan Indians were rounded up and killed as a result of their inability to defend themselves. In 1970, Uganda embraced gun control. Over the next nine years over 300,000 Christians were rounded up and killed.

BREAKING: Florida Gov. Rick Scott says the state ""will require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older."" https://t.co/n7TqA3VDnW pic.twitter.com/knob4wzFEK — ABC News (@ABC) February 23, 2018

Scott announced the new measure at a press conference Friday, adding that military and law enforcement members would be exempt.

“We will require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older,” Scott said. “There will be exceptions for active duty and reserve military and spouses, National Guard members, and law enforcement.”

The previous minimum age required to buy a firearm was 18.

The governor added the state would also allocate $500 million to improving school safety, after a 19-year-old gunman killed 17 at a Florida high school last week.

Most of the money will be used to bolster school security, including adding police officers or sheriffs to schools, bulletproof glass, steel doors and metal detectors for some schools.

Scott’s plan would also add a mental health counselor to schools and open a hotline for students to be able to anonymously report concerning behavior.

“Anyone who has an injunction for protection against stalking, cyberstalking, dating violence, repeat violence, sexual violence, or domestic violence would be prohibited from purchasing a gun for at least 60 days,” reports Washington Examiner.

The plan also dedicates $50 million toward improving mental health for Floridians.

“I want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who has mental issues to use a gun. I want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who is a danger to themselves or others to use a gun,” Scott stated.

“I want to create a new program in Florida. I call it the Violent Threat Restraining Order. This concept is very simple and very common sense in my view. This will allow a court to prohibit a violent or mentally ill person from purchasing or possessing a firearm or any other weapon when either a family member, a community welfare expert, or a law enforcement officer files a sworn request and presents evidence to the court of a threat of violence involving firearms or other weapons.”

Additionally, the plan also bans bump-stock modifications for rifles.

Nationally, the President has called for strengthening background checks and potentially arming educators, but at a CPAC speech Friday Trump warned that Democrats would try to “take away your Second Amendment” if they prevail in mid-term elections.

The argument particularly made little sense in this case given that reports quoting law enforcement suggested that suspected killer Dylann Storm Roof was given the gun used in the shooting spree by his father as a gift, when Roof was ineligible to own a firearm due to drug related crimes.

The story then evolved into Dylann STOLE the gun, a Glock, from his parents.

In either case, laws were flouted, and further restricting the rights of law abiding Americans would have done NOTHING to prevent this from happening.

CNN reports today, however, that in actual fact, the shooter BOUGHT the gun he used himself:

He himself bought the .45-caliber handgun used in the shooting last April at a Charleston gun store, according to the two officials. Earlier, a senior law enforcement official had indicated that [his] father bought him a Glock firearm for his birthday. […] His grandfather says that Roof was given “birthday money” and that the family didn’t know what Roof did with it.

If this information is accurate, it means that Roof passed a background check in a gun store, a check that gun control advocates want to see applied to ALL transactions, public and private.

This begs the question then, if background checks on all firearm transactions are the one stop solution to gun crime, then how did Roof, a known felon, pass the background check that we are told over and over again is the key to reducing gun violence?

Indeed, it is the case that the majority of other mass shooters in recent years managed to buy the firearms they used legally after passing background checks.

The shooters at Virginia Tech, the Aurora Colorado movie theater, Fort Hood, Isla Vista, the Washington Navy Yard, the attempted mass killing at Arapahoe High School ALL passed background checks.

The shooter at Washington Navy Yard even managed to buy his firearm after the background check system was supposedly strengthened following the incident at Virgina Tech.

The fact is that criminals break the laws, and it seems the laws don’t work anyway. Further infringing on the rights of those who abide by the laws will not change either of these situations.

BREAKING: Democrat Admits Obama Agenda Is Total Gun Ban

The New York State Police are suspending the handgun permits of people in the state who are prescribed anti-anxiety medication, according to Jim Tresmond of the Tresmond Law Firm in Hamburg, New York. Tresmond Law specializes in firearm litigation.

“We are representing a client right now who is impacted by this onerous activity of the government,” Tresmond told WBEN, a news talk radio station in Buffalo, New York.

“We were flummoxed by this whole matter,” the attorney said. “The HIPPA act is supposed to prevent this kind of thing from happening. It’s a gross invasion of our privacy rights.”

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Tresmond said the New York State Police are responsible for taking action against legal firearms owners. “Based on information the county received from the New York State Police, they’ve suspended the permits. The State Police instigates the proceedings.”

Section 9.46 of the NY SAFE Act of 2013 authorizes therapists, doctors, nurses and social workers to report patients they determine may engage in conduct that may result in harm to self or others. If a determination is made that the person in question poses a threat, the provision permits the government to confiscate firearms. The provision is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment and the legal standard of probable cause.

Experts said many mental health providers will likely ignore the provision.

In what is being referred to as a landmark ruling, Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis denied a request by Remington Arms Co., Bushmaster and others to dismiss the suit submitted by 10 Sandy Hook victims’ families.

Asserting the court has the proper jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit, Bellis said the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) which ordinarily shields firearm companies from legal liability does not meet “legal sufficiency” to nullify claims made by the families.

“The court concludes that any immunity that PLCAA may provide does not implicate this court’s subject matter jurisdiction,” Bellis wrote according to The Independent. “Accordingly, the defendants’ motions to dismiss, in which they claim that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, cannot be granted on the basis of PLCAA.”

Judge Bellis added that her ruling did not affect claims from the plaintiffs that “negligent entrustment” is an exception to the PLCAA, or claims from defendants that the PLCAA provides them immunity.

Regardless, lawyers for the plaintiffs celebrated the ruling, calling it a “huge victory for the Sandy Hook families.”

“We are thrilled that the gun companies’ motion to dismiss was denied,” a lawyer representing the families said. “The families look forward to continuing their fight in court.”

A few findings by Congress regarding the PLCAA, found in 15 U.S. Code § 7901 (a), make note that firearm manufacturers should not be held liable for harm caused by their products:

(5) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to the public of firearms or ammunition products that have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and should not, be liable for the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended. (6) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation’s laws, threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional right and civil liberty, invites the disassembly and destabilization of other industries and economic sectors lawfully competing in the free enterprise system of the United States, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreign commerce of the United States.

“Bellis ordered participating lawyers to her courtroom on April 19 for a status conference,” reports the Connecticut Post. “But an appeal of the decision could sidetrack the issue, particularly any action by manufacturers filed in federal court. Calls to attorneys for the gun makers were not immediately returned Thursday.”"

Infowars.com

February 25, 2014

The State of Connecticut is now demanding that gun owners across the state turn in all newly-banned, unregistered firearms and magazines or face felony arrest.

The State Police Special Licensing & Firearms Unit began mailing out notices to gun owners who attempted to register their firearms and accessories with the state but did not do so in time for the Jan. 1 deadline of Connecticut’s newly enacted gun control law.

The law bans the sale of magazines holding over 10 rounds and “assault rifles” manufactured after 1994 and requires that residents who possessed either before the ban to register them with the state.

“We are returning your application for [an] assault rifle certificate and/or [a] large capacity magazine declaration because it was not received or postmarked prior to January 1, 2014 as required by law,” the notice states.

The letter breaks down the gun owner’s “options,” including surrendering their firearms and magazines to the police, selling them to a gun dealer, removing them from the state or rendering them inoperable.

Because these owners attempted to register their guns and accessories, the state can now prosecute them at will because they know exactly who they are.

But when it comes to the vast majority of gun owners who did not register at all, Connecticut lacks clout.

Last month it was revealed that out of the over 2.4 million high-capacity magazines in Connecticut, only 38,000 have been registered.

“So, where did these millions of magazines go?” reporter Warner Todd Huston asked. “All that can be said is that it appears that gun owners in Connecticut are not quite the sheep that jackbooted government officials may have imagined they were.”

“After all, if there really were millions of high capacity magazines in the state – and it is very likely that there are – and they have now gone unregistered, that means that thousands of gun owners have refused to bow to this unconstitutional, anti-Second Amendment law.”

Likewise, only 50,000 semiautomatic rifles were also registered, further proof that Connecticut’s gun owners are revolting through civil disobedience.

These gun owners correctly realize that registration only leads to confiscation and that the overall agenda of gun control is to completely ban private gun ownership.

Last year, the New York Police Department began confiscating guns which were previously registered but are now banned under New York’s newest gun control law.

The NYPD knew exactly which gun owners to target by using the city’s centralized firearms registry which was already in place.

Connecticut’s anti-gun politicians want their own registry so they can eventually confiscate firearms in the exact same manner.

According to Fox 2 Now St. Louis, the incident all began in late 2013 when the councilwoman, Janet Dixon, retaliated against officers for arresting her drug-dealing son.

The councilwoman’s son, Terrance Dixon, who admitted to selling crack-cocaine and heroin out of his home following a drug raid arrest, was given probation after the city council fired all three officers involved in his arrest.

Although the officers were quickly reinstated, one of the officers involved was fired yet again after investigating a domestic violence call the following year that involved none other than Terrance.

Police dash cam video shows Councilwoman Dixon running from Terrance’s residence and putting the alleged female victim into a vehicle before telling the officer “this will be your last paycheck.”

Police reports reveal the alleged victim had contacted officers previously saying Terrance regularly beat her but that “his momma got him out of it.”

Councilwoman Dixon filed a protection order against the fired officer two days after the encounter, telling a local judge that he had threatened to “kill” her “black ass.”

A St. Louis intelligence officer approached the judge following Dixon and revealed that he had traced the officer’s phone location during an investigation into Dixon’s claims. The trace uncovered that the officer was nowhere near Dixon as she had claimed, resulting in the case being dismissed by the judge.

The situation finally came to a head Monday when the city council voted to fire the department’s 23 officers, alleging budget constraints were solely to blame.

Interestingly enough, Councilwoman Janet Dixon had been arrested that very day on suspicion of possessing a firearm with the serial numbers removed. Only four hours after being released from jail, Dixon met with fellow councilmembers and reportedly spearheaded the decision to disband the department.

According to LEOAffairs.com, now-former Wellston Police Chief G.T. Walker argues that the decision was rooted almost entirely in “dirty politics.”

Linda Garner, a councilwoman who voted against the decision, also noted that the vote was made without any public input whatsoever.

The “North County Co-Operative,” a group of officers from neighboring Vinita Park and Vinita Terrace, will now police the Wellston area according to Fox 2.

May 8, 2013

In yet another example of the massive gap between the American people’s perception of what is going on around them (whether by propaganda channels or simply cognitive bias) and the actual reality, Reuters reports that while gun-related homicides are down 39% from the 1993 peak, only 12% of people believe that gun crimes have fallen. Non-fatal firearm crimes declined by 69% to 467,300 in the same period but 56% of Americans believe that gun crime is higher now than it was 20 years ago, the Pew Research Center said its poll showed. The dichotomy between record food stamp usage (and non-employment) and multi-year highs in consumer sentiment comes to mind – we wonder which is more ‘real’.

Highlights of the report:

– Firearm-related homicides declined 39%, from 18,253 in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011.

– Nonfatal firearm crimes declined 69%, from 1.5 million victimizations in 1993 to 467,300 victimizations in 2011.

– For both fatal and nonfatal firearm victimizations, the majority of the decline occurred during the 10-year period from 1993 to 2002.

– Firearm violence accounted for about 70% of all homicides and less than 10% of all nonfatal violent crime from 1993 to 2011.

– About 70% to 80% of firearm homicides and 90% of nonfatal firearm victimizations were committed with a handgun from 1993 to 2011.

– From 1993 to 2010, males, blacks, and persons ages 18 to 24 had the highest rates of firearm homicide.

– In 2007-11, about 23% of victims of nonfatal firearm crime were injured.

– About 61% of nonfatal firearm violence was reported to the police in 2007-11.

– In 2007-11, less than 1% of victims in all nonfatal violent crimes reported using a firearm to defend themselves during the incident.

– In 2004, among state prison inmates who possessed a gun at the time of offense, less than 2% bought their firearm at a flea market or gun show and 40% obtained their firearm from an illegal source.

March 7, 2013

During the Senate Judiciary meeting today to markup a potpourri of bills designed to deny the American people their rights under the Second Amendment and disarm them, Senator Dianne Feinstein opposed an amendment to her so-called assault weapons ban legislation that would allow veterans to continue buying firearms the bill would outlaw.

Feinstein basically said all veterans have PTSD and should have their Second Amendment stripped. In response to the amendment, she said the following:

…this adds an exemption of retired military. As I understand our bill, no issue has arose in this regard during the 10 years the expired ban was effect… and what we did in the other bill was exempt possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States… that included active military. The problem with expanding this is that you know with the advent of PTSD, which I think is a new phenomenon as a product of the Iraq War, it’s not clear how the seller or transferrer of a firearm covered by this bill would verify that an individual was a member, or a veteran, and that there was no impairment of that individual with respect to having a weapon like this. So you know I would be happy to sit down with you again and see if we could work something out but I think we have to — if you’re going to do this, find a way that veterans who are incapacitated for one reason or another mentally don’t have access to this kind of weapon.

The comments are included in the C-Span video below.

Thankfully, Feinstein’s bill will most certainly be dead on arrival and – for now – the American people (with the exception of Americans unfortunate enough to live in New York state) will have their Second Amendment rights spared.

Feinstein’s remark, however, reveals a deep-seated mistrust and contempt for America’s veterans. It also reveals the fear by government of the revolutionary potential of veterans, a fear dutifully expressed by the Department of Homeland Security when it said returning veterans are “right wing extremists” who may challenge the government.

Incidentally, Feinstein is way off the mark. Although PTSD is a relatively new definition, soldiers returning from combat have experienced anxiety disorders since time immemorial. It is nothing new. She is merely exploiting a modern psychology term in order to add substance to her argument that veterans are insane and as such must have their Second Amendment rights nullified."

The same day the proposal was released, on a Friday of a three day holiday weekend, ATF opened up a shortened 30-day period for the public to submit comments about the new regulation.

But it turns out, ATF has been working on a ban of AR-15 “green-tip” ammunition for quite some time and has already issued the ban in its new, 2014 Regulation Guide. For reference, ATF Regulation Guides come out approximately every ten years.

When you take a look at the 2005 ATF Regulation Guide, you’ll see an exemption for AR-15 “green-tip” ammunition, which means it exempted from the definition of “armor piercing” and therefore is legal on the federal level.

When you look at the last page of the new, most recent ATF 2014 Regulation Guide, which was published in January, there is no longer an exemption for AR-15 “green-tip” ammunition.

The federal agency announced its intention to ban sales of M855 “green tip” bullets, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

Gun stores quickly reported a run on the ammunition, with suppliers unable to keep up with the demand. The buying frenzy has also sent prices skyrocketing, as Liberty Arms Manager Colton May explained to CBS News.

“Ten to 11 bucks, you know, for a box of 20,” May said. “Now I’ve seen it priced for 20 bucks, even higher and that’s just a small batch of ammunition.”

May added that the scare had prompted all kinds of semi-auto ammunition to fly off the shelves, noting that he had sold 6,000 to 7,000 rounds of 2.23 mm or 5.56 mm just on Friday alone.

Some stores, such as Guns on 41 in Ft. Myers, Florida, are reporting that they are selling around 20 times the normal volume of the bullets.

Jack Lesher, owner of Chuck’s Firearms in Atlanta, told CBS that the proposed ban was part of a plan to eventually prohibit all AR-15 ammo.

CBS News put the rush down to “angry gun enthusiasts” who were trying to stockpile the bullets before any potential ban on sales is implemented. A more sober analysis is that the shortages are being caused by the ATF’s second amendment-busting proposal, and not by the emotional state of gun owners.

As we reported yesterday, gun stores in South Carolina, Indiana, Anchorage, Florida, and Springfield, Missouri are all reporting that they have completely sold out of the ammunition.

According to Jamey Ray at Van’s Sporting Goods and Deer Processing in Brandon, Mississippi, suppliers are also completely out of stock.

“There is no distribution of it right now,” Ray told the Clarion Ledger.

The Obama administration publicly addressed the controversy yesterday, with White House press secretary Josh Earnest asserting that the proposed ban was a “common sense step” to protect law enforcement officers.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte penned a bipartisan letter to the administration asserting that the ban would, “Interfere with Second Amendment rights by disrupting the market for ammunition that law-abiding Americans use for sporting and other legitimate purposes.”

The ATF is taking public comments on the proposed ban until March 16.

Rep. Jeff Duncan wants to know why IRS law enforcement agents are training with AR-15 rifles.

As chairman of the House Homeland Security oversight subcommittee, Duncan (R-S.C.) toured a federal law enforcement facility in late May and noticed agents training with the semi-automatic weapons at a firing range. They identified themselves as IRS, he said.

“When I left there, it’s been bugging me for weeks now, why IRS agents are training with a semi-automatic rifle AR-15, which has stand-off capability,” Duncan told POLITICO. “Are Americans that much of a target that you need that kind of capability?”

While Duncan acknowledges that the IRS has an enforcement division, he questions if that level of firepower is appropriate when they could coordinate operations with other agencies, like the FBI, especially in a time of austerity.

After all, perhaps there is a reason that Barack Obama has been branded the world’s greatest gun salesman.

That’s the feeling that gun dealer, historian and author Martin KA Morgan has developed – after watching Americans turn feverishly towards buying up semi-automatic “assault weapons” in the wake of Clinton’s 1994 assault weapons ban.

Before that? Hardly anybody was focused on or buying these guns, and there wasn’t much to say about them.

via the London Guardian:

US author and historian says allure of the taboo may explain why measures such as the 1994 assault weapon ban led to an explosion in popularity When Martin KA Morgan was a kid in the 1970s, military-style rifles were only a “small sliver” of the firearms market in the United States. More than twenty years later, Morgan said, American firearm ownership has been radically transformed. “Semi-automatic, magazine-fed rifles – they dominate the market,” he said. […] By 1994, the Clinton administration was close to passing a federal assault weapon ban… In the months before the 1994 crime bill, which included an assault weapon ban, passed, “there was a mad scramble among the shooting public” […] “I believe that we can assign Freudian psychology to it,” he said… Today, Morgan believes, the popularity of military-style guns “continues to be driven by the ban concept”.

Of course, that doesn’t change the fact that many of the worst villains in government are indeed dead set on stripping down the 2nd Amendment until is has no real meaning.

The attempts at gun control are sincere, in a sense, but they are also quite frightening – perhaps intentionally.

On Wall Street and in the realm of economic crashes, there is money to be made on the way up, and on the way down. The manipulation of all phases of a bubble is key to those who would make a fortune off of the misery of others; it is the essential Machiavellian stroke.

Here, with firearms like the AR-15, a huge money making opportunity has developed around the mad dash to stock up on guns and ammo before and in case of new legislation banning “assault weapons” or anything else.

Perhaps it should come as no real surprise that many of the biggest gun control liberals on Capitol Hill secretly have stocks in gun manufacturers and ammunition supplies, as well as the raw materials.

Many of them hide behind the fact that funds they invest in have such diverse holdings that a bit of firearms-funding is all-but unavoidable.

Nonetheless, intentional or not, President Obama and cohorts like the Brady Center, Sen. Diane Feinstein, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros and plenty of others are driving sales of the very guns that they despise in the hands of citizens:

The Washington Post estimated last year that Barack Obama had given the gun industry at least a $9bn billion boost, in part because of his high-profile advocacy for gun control in the wake of a series of mass shootings in 2012. Gun sales have spiked since the very beginning of Obama’s presidency, with record-breaking sales in recent months, and the trend seems likely to continue if Hillary Clinton occupies the White House.

The question is: why? There is definitely a deception at hand.

Maybe it isn’t fair to apply the saying that a sucker is born every minute, but it is clear that the herd is being fleeced to some degree. Wallets open, and FBI background checks go crazy every time Obama opens his mouth or signs his pen regarding gun control.

More accurately, a populace that is rightly fearful that its 2nd Amendment rights are under threat also make good consumers/ easy marks during their time of greatest fear.

Word on the street is that a shorting of the market, dumping of the stocks and/or drastic tightening of the supply (particularly with ammo) may soon be at hand.

Could it get any more conspiratorial?

Watch wisely, and keep and bear arms like your liberty depends upon it."

“We hope that the Bureau will swiftly review comments on the proposed framework and issue a revised proposal that will address the danger posed by handguns that fire 5.56mm and other rifle ammunition,” Democrats said in a letter to the director of ATF.

The public comment period for the proposed ban ends Monday.

“It is critical to update this legislation as new technologies are developed in order to keep law enforcement officers and our communities safe,” the Democrats continue. “That is why we urge you not to drag out this delay and to act swiftly to keep armor-piercing ammunition that can be used in handguns off the street.”

In an effort to overstep the agency and ignore public opposition to the effort to outlaw the popular ammunition, New York Democrat Rep. Eliot Engel introduced legislation that would outlaw the M855 outright. Engel and the Democrats insist no one other than police and the military the ammo.

Congressional Democrats argue an “out-of-touch gun industry lobby is fighting tooth and nail to keep cop-killing ammunition on the streets.” They also claim “to speak up on behalf of our police officers” who believe upholding the Second Amendment is “madness.”

Despite the rhetoric, the ammunition in question does not threaten police.

“Any ammunition is of concern to police in the wrong hands, but this specific round has historically not posed a law enforcement problem,” James Pasco, executive director of the Washington office of the Fraternal Order of Police, the world’s largest organization, said earlier this month.

The BATFE, however, disagrees and says not only the M855 threatens police, but all 5.56 ammunition does. Last week BATFE Director B. Todd Jones testified before a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing:"

Earlier this week, a Tucson, Arizona, radio talk show host posted a photo of former Congressman Gabby Giffords posing with the dreaded AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.

The photo was taken in October, 2010, prior to Giffords suffering a near fatal gun wound to the head during a political event in January, 2011.

On Thursday, Breitbart News confirmed the photo is real through Arizona law enforcement. The source requested anonymity and said the photo was taken for campaign purposes.

Giffords has admitted the photograph is authentic.

“We were told she wanted to toughen her image,” the source told Breitbart News. “She asked to come out and she wanted to shoot a rifle. She had one of our guys out there to show her how to shoot an AR-15.”

Following the shootings at the Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Connecticut, Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, formed an organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions. The group has called for rolling back the Second Amendment and outlawing semiautomatic “assault” weapons like the AR-15 Giffords posed with in the photograph.

On March 5, Kelly bought an AR-15 and a semiautomatic handgun at a police supply store in Tucson. After Breitbart News received a tip on the purchase, Kelly posted on Facebook saying he intends to turn “it over to the Tucson PD.” In addition to the AR-15, a witness told Breitbart News Kelly also bought a so-called “high-capacity” magazine for the firearm.

The liberal media, including AOL Huffington Post, reported that Kelly bought the AR-15 in order to demonstrate how easy it is to purchase the weapon. “Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes… We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole,” he wrote on his Facebook page.

Kelly told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on March 11 he bought the firearm to show how unobtrusive background checks are.

He told Blitzer it was “important for me to have firsthand knowledge about how easy it is or difficult it is to buy a weapon like that,” and argued for closing down to the so-called “gun show and private seller loop hole,” in other words he wants the government to criminalize private sales between individuals."

Last week, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its intention to ban sales of the ammunition, typically used by sports shooters, in the name of protecting law enforcement officers from “the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest.”

Fearful that this is just the first step towards the eventual goal of banning semi-automatic rifles altogether, gun owners have responded by stockpiling the bullets, which are the cheapest available for AR-15’s, prompting nationwide shortages.

“Oh we sold out of it in two days, every bit of it I had,” said Chuck Scott, owner of the Aiken Gun Rack and Range in Aiken, S.C., adding that the ATF’s proposal had created a a buying frenzy and panic.

Scott noted that the feds were, “banning something that’s going to affect hundreds of thousands of sports shooters, it’s rarely ever used in a crime.”

“Once they get this bullet off the market they’ll go for the next and the next,” remarked Mike Ludwiksowski, a keen hunter.

His sentiments were echoed by another gun owner in Oklahoma, who told News 9, “I think it’s them just trying to do little bits and pieces to get to their ultimate goal to ban tactical style rifles.”

Blue Buchanan, owner of Wilshire Gun in Oklahoma, said the ATF’s announcement had prompted a rush of customers wanting to purchase AR-15 ammo.

“Especially over the last two days we’ve had a large run on 5.56 and 223 ammo. We’ve sold much more than we normally do,” remarked Buchanan, adding, “The distributors are pretty much sold out so what we have is what we have for a while until the panic dies down.”

As we previously reported, gun stores in Indiana, Anchorage, Florida, and Springfield, Missouri are all reporting that they have completely sold out of the ammunition.

The ATF is taking public comments on the proposed ban until March 16. Congressman Tom Rooney has introduced legislation to stop its implementation, while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has authored a bipartisan letter to President Obama and has vowed to fight the issue in the courts if necessary.

Gun grabbers who want to ban the AR-15 might want to talk to Jonathan Haith.

The North Carolina resident who was confronted by a pistol-wielding home invader escaped injury or death when the man missed with the one shot he got.

Haith and his semi-automatic didn’t miss – which means he’s alive and the home invader is behind bars after hospital treatment, according toWTVD, the ABC affiliate in Raleigh.

Haith, of Henderson, told the station he was awakened about 9:15 a.m. Monday by someone banging on his door. Eventually, the door was broken in and Hath took the rifle he keeps under his bed into the hallway.

There, he confronted the home invader who was crouched in a shooting stance and fired once. The bullet missed Haith and lodged in the wall behind him. Haith returned fire and hit the mark. The bullet went through the man’s shoulder and hit another wall.

As the wounded intruder fled up the street before collapsing, a vehicle pulled out of Haith’s yard to pick up the man, WTVD reported.

By then, Haith had called 911.

The wounded man was treated and released into custody, WTVD reported. The driver of the car that picked him up is being charged as an accessory.

And Haith going on with his life.

The AR-15 is at the top of the list for libs when it comes to the guns they want to round up. Maybe they have a better idea of handling a home invader?"

No one has the right to tell you, you can’t publish a book because you might libel somebody. Nobody tells you, you can’t own an automobile because there might be an accident. And nobody should tell you, you can’t own a gun because it might be misused.

If somebody is libel, they have recourse in the courts. If somebody causes an accident with an automobile, this can be dealt with in the courts. The same way with a gun. If a gun is misused, it should be dealt with in the courts.

Unfortunately, government doesn’t enforce the law against those individuals who commit violent crimes. 70 percent of the crimes in this country are committed by individuals who have prior criminal records.

This gun sure looks deadly, but it’s not the least bit deadly unless I point it at someone and pull the trigger.

In the words of Thomas Jefferson, he said that we were “endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights,” and among those rights is our right to defend ourselves, defend our family, and to defend our property.

Unfortunately, in every society, there are those individuals who will resort to force to get what they want. It’s impossible to have a policeman on every corner to protect us, so; therefore, it is very important that we maintain the right to defend ourselves.

I think it’s important that we look at the Second Amendment in the context of the entire Bill of Rights. Our freedoms are based on a philosophy called the Libertarian philosophy. That means we have a right to own anything we want, including guns, as long as we harm no other person.

The Constitution gives us that right. The best way to protect that right is to exercise it. If we sacrifice our liberty in the pursuit of safety, we’ll lose our safety and our liberty.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday the ATF’s ban of M855 AR-15 ammunition is a “common-sense step.”

“We are looking at additional ways to protect our brave men and women in law enforcement, and believe that this process is valuable for that reason alone,” he said.

But of the 12,253 murders reported by the FBI in 2013 (the most recent data available,) only 285, or 2.3%, were committed using rifles, including long arms such as bolt-action and single-shot rifles, meaning that semi-automatic AR-15s would account for less than 2.3% of all murders.

In fact, shotguns, which Vice President Joe Biden famously suggested women should use instead of AR-15s, were used more often in murders than AR-15s.

Overall, the use of rifles in murders decreased since 2012, when long arms accounted for a still minuscule 2.5%.

The number of murders involving guns in general plunged from 8,855 in 2012 to 8,454 in 2013, following a steep decline in gun-related violent crimes since the mid-1990s.

Last week we reported the ATF was trying to ban M855 AR-15 ammunition popular with sport shooters by declaring it “armor piercing,” despite the ammo containing lead which exempts it from the classification according to law.

To be considered “armor piercing” under 18 U.S.C. 921 (a)(17)(B), a bullet must have an entirely metal core or have a jacket weighing more than 25% of its weight, which wouldn’t include M855 rounds because their bullets are partly lead.

“While M855 has carried the exemption from a 1986 prohibition on manufacture, importation and sale, (but not possession) of ‘armor piercing’ rounds, it’s clear from the definition that it should have never needed to be ‘exempted,’” Bryan Black of Itstactical.com wrote.

“We’re doing a lot more with lasers,” said Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall, director of the Surface Warfare Division, at the Surface Naval Association national symposium earlier this month.

Unlike traditional naval guns, Laser Weapon Systems, known as LaWS in military jargon, are measured in kilowatts as opposed to caliber. The Navy plans to test fire a 150 kilowatt laser weapon off a ship within a year. “Then a year later, we’ll have that on a carrier or a destroyer or both,” said Boxall.

The 150 kilowatt weapon is a massive upgrade from the 30 kilowatt AN/SEQ-3 (also known as the XN-1 LaWS) currently deployed on the USS Ponce. The AN/SEQ-3 was first deployed in 2014, and is available to the ship’s commander as a defensive weapon to shoot down incoming missiles, drones, boats and other potential threats.

To put the weapon’s power in perspective, 150 kilowatt is enough energy to power 1,500 modern light bulbs.

Laser weapons offer advantages that traditional kinetic weapons do not. LaWS systems are extremely precise, have a low cost per shot and do not require ammunition. Like the lasers seen in Star Trek, they can also fire in a sustained pulse.

Impressive as the LaWS may be, it requires a massive amount of power to operate.

“The Navy will be looking at ships’ servers to provide three times that much power,” Donald Klick, director of business development for DRS Power and Control Technologies, told Scout Warrior. “To be putting out 150 kws, they (the weapons) will be consuming 450 kws.”

The LaWS huge power requirement would overtax the energy resources of most navy ships, meaning they may require an “energy magazine,” according to a Naval Postgraduate School paper titled “Power Systems and Energy Storage Modeling for Directed Energy Weapons” by Jeremy Sylvester. Theoretically, such a magazine would be made of batteries, capacitors or flywheels and would recharge between pulses.

Once the energy issues are worked out, LaWS systems could prove to be a crucial mainstay in the military’s arsenal. The weapons could be particularly useful against swarm threats posed by drones and fast-attack boats, threats which are being explored by adversaries like Iran and China. Additionally, the laser weapons could see deployment on other platforms, such as aircraft.

“We’re looking at Air Force Special Forces on a C-130. You have to strike a car, but you’re worried about collateral damage,” said Klick. “With that pinpoint accuracy, you don’t have to worry about collateral damage. You can just cause a car to stop running. There’s a lot more capability.”"

The Iranian Fars News Agency reports “A group of Iraqi popular forces known as Al-Hashad Al-Shabi shot down a US Army helicopter that was carrying weapons for the ISIL in the western parts of Al-Baqdadi region in Al-Anbar province” last week.

The report claims that the fighters posted a picture (see above) online of the downed chopper and the weapons that were recovered.

The claims comes on the heels of reports last week that the Iraq Army shot down two British planes also delivering weapons to the Islamic State.

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

Hakem al-Zameli, a senior Iraqi legislator, added that the current government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from security forces in al-Anbar province about flights airdropping weapons to ISIS.

The reason for the drops, according to the legislator, is to prolong a chaotic situation in Anbar Province.

Last week, video was also released claiming to show a US Chinook helicopter dropping two boxes full of weapons for ISIS by flying at a low altitude in an extremist controlled area south of Fallujah. The footage is said to have been filmed by the Iraq-based Hezbollah Brigades.

There were even reports that some US helicopters landed in Fallujah, a main base of ISIS linked Takfiri militants in Iraq. Iraqi lawmakers have urged the government to open an investigation into the matter.

The claims of the US and the UK supplying weapons to ISIS extremists have now been ongoing for some time.

It is certainly evident that US made weapons have fallen into ISIS hands on multiple occasions.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the al-Ahad news website quoted the head of the al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying recently.

Weapons made in Europe and Israel were also discovered in Ramadi, Tarmouz said.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations,” he said.

Prison Planet

September 9, 2008

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward revealed to Larry King last night that the U.S. has embarked on a “secret killing program” in Iraq which has dramatically reduced attacks on coalition troops by wiping out terrorists, but what could this secret weapon possibly be?

A CNN report details Woodward’s revelations.

The program — which Woodward compares to the World War II era Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb — must remain secret for now or it would “get people killed,” Woodward said Monday on CNN’s Larry King Live. “The top secret operations will “some day in history … be described to people’s amazement,” Woodward told King. While he would not reveal the details, Woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities. “The enemy has a heads up because they’ve been getting wiped out and a lot of them have been killed,” he said. “It’s not news to them.”

For the weapon to be comparable to the atomic bomb, one would speculate that it must employ some kind of exotic new technology and is potentially related to neutron bomb and electromagnetic weapons research.

As far back as 2002, a Cox News Service report entitled Super-Secret Microwave Weapons May Be Used In Iraq, speculated that the military was preparing to utilize high-powered microwave weapons that send bursts of electromagnetic energy which completely disable enemy electronic devices.

However, Woodward’s discussion of the secret weapon wiping out alleged terrorists in large numbers suggests it may be a far more barbaric device than an EMP weapon, which would more traditionally be used against standing armies rather than scattered insurgents.

One possibility is that the weapon is something similar that described to film maker Patrick Dillon by Iraqi infantryman Majid al-Ghazali – a frightening giant flame-thrower type device that instead shoots out “concentrated lightning bolts” or radiation bursts that result in vehicles and people being almost literally liquidized.

During a street battle in Baghdad on April 12 2003, Al-Ghazali describes witnessing American troops unveil an oddly configured tank which “suddenly let loose a blinding stream of what seemed like fire and lightning, engulfing a large passenger bus and three automobiles.”

“Within seconds the bus had become semi-molten, sagging “like a wet rag” as he put it. He said the bus rapidly melted under this withering blast, shrinking until it was a twisted blob about the dimensions of a VW bug. As if that were not bizarre enough, al-Ghazali explicitly describes seeing numerous human bodies shriveled to the size of newborn babies. By the time local street fighting ended that day, he estimates between 500 and 600 soldiers and civilians had been cooked alive as a result of the mysterious tank-mounted device.”

Al-Ghazali adds that following the battle, U.S. troops were scrupulous about burying the evidence of the weapon’s deadly consequences, but that telltale signs remained which he showed to journalist Dillon.

Dillon, a battlefield medic in Vietnam, Somalia and Kosovo, stated, “I’ve seen a freaking smorgasbord of destruction in my life, flame-throwers, napalm, white phosphorous, thermite, you name it. I know of nothing short of an H-bomb that conceivably might cause a bus to instantly liquefy or that can flash broil a human body down to the size of an infant. God pity humanity if that thing is a preview of what’s in store for the 21st century.”

An interview with Majid al-Ghazali can be viewed below along with a further exploration of exotic weapons systems being employed in Iraq. Aid workers and others have backed up reports of terrifying new weapons systems being deployed that cause horrific injuries and agonizing deaths. Woodward’s characterization of the victims merely as “terrorists” conceals the fact that a great number of the victims of these brutal weapons are no doubt innocent people caught up in the fighting."

I think most right thinking people are agreed that physical effects aside, the content of the majority of TV programming today (I emphasize the word programming, a process that involves a passive receptor of information) is designed to instill a social worldview and value system that is self-centric and is in fact the opposite of what a healthy and enduring society requires. Individualism at any cost rules the day and it is more and more evident that empathy for one’s fellow citizen and a sense of personal responsibility are rapidly vanishing along with the morality that all healthy civilizations have known to be necessary for survival. Only recently a car I was traveling in was bumped from behind by a driver who was, I would guess, in his mid to late thirties, looked quite respectable and drove a new and expensive car. Rather than stop and offer his details for the damage done he feigned an apology and when our vehicle pulled off to park safely he took his opportunity to flee the scene, no doubt congratulating himself on avoiding a messy process involving insurance agencies etc. People today are only made to feel guilt when caught and exposed for their crimes. They have no higher authority to fear and the current direction of societal attitudes puts paid to that particular view often espoused that it is possible to remain moral and upstanding without religion or a guiding moral principal if you prefer. The crime figures, road rage and general attitude of fellow citizens would tend to indicate otherwise. I believe TV has much blame to shoulder for this.

People spend a lot of their spare time in front of the television. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to state that TV is a major source of many people’s opinions and views on pretty much everything. Given the amount of time people spend watching television it makes perfect sense that if you want to shape public opinion the TV is the medium par excellence by which to disseminate your information. It stands to reason then that if you agree that a movement exists, and I think a lot of people of do, whose aim is to re-make the world in man’s image, albeit a skewed and perverse one, then it makes sense for such an organization to consolidate control of the TV airwaves and turn it into a propaganda video-drome. Some might say that the proof is in the pudding, that TV is so biased toward the crude, libertine, amoral lifestyle and that the portrayal of the Christian religion, the very force that created our society, is so negative, misinformed and hostile that surely such a conspiracy exists. Now to extrapolate this thought is an article unto itself but the facts are there and the conspiracy is out in the open. To give just two examples, we have the admission by the BBC following a leaking of an internal memo wherein it was admitted that they are anti-Christ in their outlook. After complaints that BBC programming repeatedly errs on the side of sensitivity to Islam & other minorities (religious or otherwise) & bias against Christianity (especially Roman Catholicism), the British Broadcasting Corporation has admitted its guilt. A summit meeting of BBC officials culminated in admissions that “the BBC is not impartial or neutral,” as BBC political editor Andew Marr put it. The closed-door summit’s conclusions were leaked to the British newspaper The Mail on Sunday.

Evidence also exists that governments control news output and content. On January 14,1983 President Reagan of the USA signed into effect directive 77 which gave the CIA and government full power to determine and control the content of news that the American public receives, news which can now be uploaded and or modified in minutes with modern technology. Goebbels would be proud. Think about it. It only takes a decision made by one chief editor to determine the news received by millions and in the US it is said that upwards of 90% of all media formats including newspapers and magazines are controlled by 3 or 4 corporations, a number which is going down as more and more news agencies are bought up and amalgamated. All an agency has do to make sure the news delivered suits a particular agenda is to put a very small number of people into the right positions.

Alex Jones, a rising star in the American “Truth Movement” is an independent syndicated radio talk-show host and investigative journalist from Austin, Texas. He has had personal contact with people from many of the US’s major news agencies like FOX and CNN and he says that many people employed with these companies don’t agree with the style and content of news produced and in fact know and believe much of it to be contrived, mis-represented or simply incorrect.

The physical way in which TV affects the brain makes it a perfect vehicle for propaganda. It’s important to note that your eyes grow directly, stem-like, from the brain. They really are the window to the soul and the perfect conduit to access the brain’s inner sanctums.

The human brain works at 4 basic frequencies. These are Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta.

Beta waves are produced when one is thinking and using one’s higher faculties and Delta is associated with sleep and/or deep trance like states. The radiant light and flicker rates of TV cause the brain to drop down to a level of activity somewhere between Alpha and Theta – essentially a sleepy dreamlike state of mind where the higher critical functions are turned off. Even if you’re reading text on a television screen the brain registers low levels of Alpha wave activity. Theta brainwaves engage inner and intuitive subconscious. You will find theta in places where you hold memories, sensations and emotions Any information therefore imbibed from the TV by-passes our logical, critically thinking sieve and goes straight into those sub areas of the mind associated with more emotive response. TV then appeals more to the emotions than the mind and of course how many of us engage in lively informed debate anymore? Very few. The more common reaction to big questions is usually an emotive response followed by a quick change in subject. TV viewing is a somatic experience which means it is “of the body, not of the mind”. I’m reminded of Huxley’s book, “Brave New World” where the drug of choice was called soma and enabled people to escape un-palatable intellectual life problems.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

{openx:49}

Psychologist Thomas Mulholland found that after just 30 seconds of watching television the brain begins to produce alpha waves, which indicates torpid (almost comatose) rates of activity. Alpha brain waves are associated with unfocused, overly receptive states of consciousness. A high occurrence of alpha wave activity does not occur normally when the eyes are open. In fact, Mulholland’s research implies that watching television is neurologically analogous to staring at a blank wall. It’s worth noting that the goal of hypnotists is to induce slow brain wave states. Alpha waves are present during the ‘light hypnotic’ state used by hypnotherapists for suggestion therapy.

The critical side of your brain is the left. As you read this you are making judgements, passing opinions and coming to conclusions which take the form of beta brain wave activity. These are the waves activated when you begin to use that left hand side, the center of logical human communication and analysis.

Researchers have found that once the television set is switched on, that left hand side and all it’s faculties tends to switch off. Instead the image from television go straight to the right brain. The switch from beta to alpha waves shows this. Alpha brain waves are the ones we associate with meditation and sleep. By no means does this mean that we are not taking the information in – we are taking it all in, we are just not able to critically evaluate it as we would with information coming from other sources.

Video Games have been shown to lower brain activity to below that of the Delta frequency!

The TV screen flicker rate alone is known to induce mesmerized states in people. This flicker rate is the rate at which the screen image is updated, generally about 50 or 60 times a second. DARPA is a US military funded research programme. One of their endeavours concerned developing TV flicker rates that could be played whenever a mesmerized state was required in a given section of the population.

Endorphins are released by overexposure to light. The radiant light from televisions causes a release of endorphins. Researcher Herbert Krugman showed that while viewers are watching television, the right hemisphere is twice as active as the left, a neurological anomaly. The crossover from left to right releases a surge of the body’s natural opiates: endorphins, which include beta-endorphins and enkephalins. Endorphins are structurally identical to opium and its derivatives (morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.). Activities that release endorphins (also called opioid peptides) are usually habit-forming (we rarely call them addictive). These include cracking knuckles and strenuous exercise. External opiates act on the same receptor sites (opioid receptors) as endorphins, so there is little difference between the two.

Even casual television viewers experience such opiate-withdrawal symptoms if they stop watching TV for a prolonged period of time. An article from South Africa’s Eastern Province Herald (October 1975) described two experiments in which people from various socio-economic milieus were asked to stop watching television. In one experiment, several families volunteered to turn off their TV’s for just one month. The poorest family gave in after one week, and the others suffered from depression, saying they felt as though they had “lost a friend.” In the other experiment, 182 West Germans agreed to kick their television viewing habit for a year, with the added bonus of payment. None could resist the urge longer than six months, and over time all of the participants showed the symptoms of opiate-withdrawal: increased anxiety, frustration, and depression.

Herbert Krugman’s research proved that watching television numbs the left brain and leaves the right brain to perform all cognitive duties. This has some harrowing implications for the effects of television on brain development and health. For one, the left hemisphere is the critical region for organizing, analyzing, and judging incoming data. The right brain treats incoming data uncritically, and it does not decode or divide information into its component parts.

Researches into the effects of TV have warned that children under two years of age shouldn’t watch any at all due to the negative impact on various areas of a child’s development which include skills of observation, speech, hearing, depth perception, reading ability, inducing attention deficit type behaviour, a lack of motor skills due to immobile viewing habits and so on. TV is a wholly inappropriate and ineffectual teaching tool. It’s pointless having debates lamenting the demise of intellectual ability and endeavour when intellects have never even had a chance to naturally and properly grow due to the numbing effects of television on children particularly.

Conversely its worth noting that radio has the opposite effect and actually develops a higher rate of concentration, the audio forcing people to be stimulated to visualize what they hear. Reading of course further extends the ability to concentrate and critically examine information over longer periods.

Even the style of TV production these days is geared toward an amphetamine-like addiction people have with regard to information reception. The cadence of scene changes, that is the rate and beat at which images are changing on the screen is very fast and further inclines the mind under development to be unable to concentrate for long periods on long pieces of textual information. Average rates of attention span are down from a few decades ago to mere minutes where once it was more than one hour for deep critical thinking.

Studies have linked quality of life to high vocabulary rates which heavy TV consumption impacts negatively. If you have good communication skills you are better able to express the world you live in and how you define it and if this is a yardstick to judge by then for many of our countries’ young folk the world must be very banal indeed. A poor vocabulary means you have a myopic existence, you have a tunnel-like perception of this great planet and your quality of life is adversely effected. Just listening to pop stars in particular, the idols of the young, can make one cringe with embarrassment at the vacuous and inarticulate clap-trap they come out with.

We live in a world today were people’s personalities are formed by unreal things: TV, the music industry, video games, movies, the effects of drugs (be that of the recreational or psychotropic variety). Virtual reality dominates the interests of a lot of people out there, even young adults and people of my own age group in their 30"

In at least one of the incidents, law enforcement officials say the gunman was motivated by recent police shootings of black men.

“Authorities in Tennessee say a man who opened fire on a highway in Tennessee targeted police officers and others because he was troubled by incidents involving black people and law enforcement officers,” the Associated Press reports.

A press release from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation says that the suspect, 37-year-old Lakeem Keon Scott, a black male, targeted only white individuals in the attack. A local newspaper carrier lost his life while three others, including the police officer, were injured by the gunfire.

Details behind the other shootings in Missouri and Georgia are unclear at the moment.

According to local reports, the Missouri officer was ambushed and shot in the neck while sitting in his police car by a black male. The suspect was later located and arrested hiding in an area home.

Motive for the ambush attack has not yet been released.

The Georgia officer, who was shot multiple times and hit in the abdomen while investigating a damaged vehicle, is also expected to survive.

Valdosta Police Chief Brian Childress similarly claimed that no motive was known at the time.

If we follow the logic of Congress and use FBI statistics, the government should outlaw hammers and clubs.

According to the FBI’s annual crime statistics, the number of murders committed annually with hammers and clubs far outpaces the number of murders committed with a rifle.

Awr Hawkins, writing for Breitbart, cites the government figures: In 2005, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 445, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 605. In 2006, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 438, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 618, Hawkins writes.

Moreover, nearly twice as many people are killed by hands and fists each year than are killed by rifles.

But you won’t hear Obama, Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer and the gun-grabbers in Congress calling for outlawing and “grandfathering” hands.

The FBI stats underscore the fact that for Feinstein and crew job one is outlawing the possession of modern firearms. Preventing the murder of children comes in a distant second.

A government that kills thousands of innocents in Pakistan and Yemen and has slaughtered millions since the Vietnam War – including more than 500,000 children through disease, starvation and malnutrition in Iraq – doesn’t give a whit about the murder of school kids in Connecticut.

Feinstein’s jihad against the Second Amendment is about disarming the American people. It is about making sure the government maintains a monopoly on power."

One of the officers, holding an assault rifle, then slowly walks towards the woman, before charging at her, and grabbing at the phone.

The phone hits the ground with a smashing sound, and the officer kicks it aggressively at the woman, before turning away and leaving the scene.

The person filming the video from across the street is heard gasping in shock at the thug cop’s actions, as the woman notices and asks “did you record that?”

There are no further details on the video at this time.

The footage highlights the attitude police generally have to citizens recording them. Every day there are stories of police threatening and assaulting lawful Americans who hold them accountable by exercising their Constitutional right to film in public.

On July 5, the Department of Homeland Security announced on the FedBizOpps.gov website that it plans to buy thirty-six Colt LE901 rifle systems. The latest DHS purchase follows a solicitation issued on July 13 for the purchase of .223 Caliber Remington Enhanced Performance Ammunition in excess of $500,000. The Colt assault weapons are designed to accept the .223 ammunition.

“The 901 is much more than your typical assault rifle,” notes the Prepper Podcast Radio Network website. The weapon will allow “the DHS/FEMA foot soldier to go from an assault rifle to picking off ‘terrorists’ at a distance by only changing the upper receiver.”

In June, FedBizOpps.gov listed a “Personal Defense Weapons Solicitation” issued by DHS calling for 5.56x45mm NATO select-fire firearms “suitable for personal defense.” The due date for the solicitation is mid-October of 2012

In April, we reported on the DHS awarding contracts to a munitions company for 450 million rounds of .40 caliber hollow point ammunition. Prior to this, the feds awarded Winchester a five year contract for 200 million rounds .40 caliber ammunition.

“I could understand if the U.S. military was ordering ammunition in this quantity. When you fight wars you can go through ammunition very rapidly,” the American Dream blog commented following the extraordinary purchase. “But the Department of Homeland Security is only supposed to be shooting at people very rarely.”

Also in April, Paul Joseph Watson reported on the DHS purchasing bullet resistant guard booths. “The purpose behind the bullet proof booths is unknown, but the DHS has publicly announced that it plans to increase the number of unannounced checkpoints manned by TSA VIPR teams and other federal agents beyond the 9300 that were set up last year alone,” Watson wrote at the time.

It looks like DHS and the feds are gearing up for something big. A growing chorus of urgent voices are warning that the economy will finally implode this year and the result with be social chaos.

In February, trends forecaster Gerald Celente told Alex Jones 2012 will witness bank runs, riots and other social dislocation as the economy collapses later this year. Celente has issued spot-on economic forecasts since 1980.

Texas Tribune

Posted December 27, 2010

The federal government wants to curb violence on the U.S.-Mexico border by requiring Texas gun dealers to inform the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives when they sell two or more “long rifles,” including military-style assault rifles like the AK-47.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

{openx:49}

As soon as next month, gun sellers with a federal firearms license in Texas could be required to furnish letters to ATF chronicling the sale of two or more semi-automatic rifles to one person within a five-day period. The policy covers guns with a caliber greater than .22 and a detachable magazine clip, including the AR-15 and AK-47s, which ATF says are increasingly being used in border crimes.

Gun rights advocates, including Gov. Rick Perry, say the policy is misguided and would unfairly target legitimate businessmen — the gun sellers — under the guise of securing the border.

“The federal government as a whole ought to be focusing instead on securing the border to prevent the trafficking of guns — and people, for that matter,” said Katherine Cesinger, a Perry spokeswoman. “The strategy and the concept is flawed.”

You’d think that mainstream reporters would be interviewing as many students as they can who were present at the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Fla., but no: the current media coverage is revolving around a group of teenage gun control advocates.

This coverage, spearheaded by CNN, reveals that the mainstream media is not “unbiased and objective” as it claims to be but is instead pushing an anti-gun agenda.

And this presents a problem to you, the audience. Instead of simply presenting you the facts so you can make your own, informed opinion, mainstream pundits would rather you just stop thinking and do what they say.

Just look at this tweet from CNN, for example:

Here are the 71 Florida lawmakers — all of them Republicans — who refused to vote for an assault weapons ban, along with their NRA rating https://t.co/5RFJWpMqqf pic.twitter.com/Gf47cRDLf8 — CNN (@CNN) February 21, 2018

How is that objective reporting? It’s not: it’s activism.

And if you call out the media for such slanted “reporting,” you’re demonized. You see, you’re a threat to the power structure if you think for yourself.

“After Watergate, few would have predicted today’s dynamic in which some journalists view their job not as questioning the powers that be, but undermining those who report on the powers that be,” once wrote Sharyl Attkisson, a former investigative journalist.

It’s easier to understand once you see the mainstream media as the propaganda arm of the ruling class, which operates through an interconnected network of academia, technology, entertainment, bureaucracies and, of course, media.

That’s why you’ll often see the same agenda – whether it’s “global warming” or gun control – pushed in unison by academics, Hollywood directors and news reporters.

But blind faith in authority is the greatest threat to truth – and your freedoms.

“The third-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking with the majority,” wrote the English author A.A. Milne. “A second-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking with the minority.”

“A first-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking.”

Meanwhile, St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara will be mailing letters to 84 federal firearms licensed gun dealers in the county later today to ask them to stop selling semi-automatic weapons to anyone under 21-years-old.

Mascara is attempting to convince firearms retailers to implement the measure before it becomes law.

Gun stores have been receptive to the move, with Paramount Pawn and Jewelry owner John O’Neill asserting it’s very rare to sell one of the weapons to someone who is under the age of 21.

FLASHBACK: APD Releases Official Explanation of Gun Shows Shut Down

Peaceable Texans For Firearms Rights

September 2, 2010

(PRESS RELEASE – Download .doc) In Federal District Court on July 20, 2010, the ATF won a conviction from an Austin jury that defies logic and reason.

In a trial before Federal Judge Sam Sparks, government lawyers conceded Texas resident Paul Copeland did not know his buyer was an illegal alien, but the jury they should convict him anyway because he “had reasonable cause to believe” he was selling to an illegal alien because the two men and a boy who were present at his table at the time of the sale: 1) were Hispanic, 2) spoke Spanish, and 3) wore cowboy clothing. And the jury did as asked. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Freel acted as lead prosecutor in the case.

The firearm transaction at issue occurred on January 16, 2010, at a gunshow at the North Austin Events Center, at 10601 N. Lamar Blvd., in Austin, Texas. Undercover ATF agents followed Mr. Huerta, his son, and another Hispanic male, Hipolito Aviles, around the “Texas Gunshow” that day, and claimed to observe Huerta’s transaction. Austin P.D. used Copeland’s case as the reason to close down the gunshow, leading to a protest by Austin residents in front of APD headquarters on January 25.

FLASHBACK: APD Releases Official Explanation of Gun Shows Shut Down“Austin Police Department Firearm Review Unit detectives assisted in the Austin portion of the operation. They observed and participated in multiple arrests of prohibited persons (primarily convicted felons and illegal immigrants) that obtained firearms illegally at a local gun show. Federal convictions were obtained in a majority of the cases,” the press release states.

Mr. Copeland is a 56 year old Cedar Creek resident and Vietnam veteran who liked to buy, sell, and trade firearms as a hobby. On January 16, however, he had the misfortune to sell a handgun to Leonel Huerta Sr., who spoke both English and Spanish. Huerta Sr. negotiated his purchase from Copeland in English, showing Copeland his Texas Driver’s License. At Copeland’s trial Huerta admitted on the witness stand, that he is in the country illegally, (Huerta Sr. had previously admitted this fact to Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Agent Leo Buentello). ATF Agent Shawn Kang claimed he saw Huerta later hand off the gun to Aviles. Despite these admissions, Huerta Sr. was never arrested, charged, or deported. Instead, his presence at the gunshow was used to entrap an American citizen into an unwitting violation of a federal gun control law. Huerta Sr., who is a resident of the City of Austin, appeared as a witness at the trial, admitted he was in the country illegally before federal prosecutors and a federal judge, yet he was allowed to leave the courtroom under his own power. To date Huerta Sr. has not been prosecuted for his purchase, possession, or disposition of the handgun he bought from Copeland, while Copeland is now a convicted felon.

“Instead of busting the illegal alien for buying, they bust the citizen for selling,” commented Paul Velte, attorney and founder of Peaceable Texans for Firearms Rights, a gun-owners rights advocacy group from Austin. Velte asked, “who was in a better position to know the buyer’s immigration status, the buyer or the seller?” He also said, “What happened to Paul Copeland should enrage all Americans. The Federal Government is using illegal aliens to entrap citizens lawfully exercising their right to sell firearms. The illegal alien walks free, but the citizen gets convicted. The same government charged with controlling immigration is the one using illegal immigrants to attack its own citizens. Does this make any sense? It makes no sense unless the purpose is to discourage attendance at gunshows and frighten citizens from selling their firearms to other citizens.”

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

{openx:49}

Velte pointed out that “There is no way for a citizen to know who is here legally or not. In fact, under Austin’s ‘sanctuary city’ policy, not even the police officer at the door of the gunshow was allowed to ask a person’s immigration status, yet the average Texan inside the show is expected to assume that a person standing before them with a Texas driver’s license is in the country illegally just because they look Mexican and speak Spanish.”

Velte noted that the federal government’s lawsuit against Arizona was based on that very type of conduct: Concluding someone could be here illegally based on their looks or their language. Velte said gun owners in his group are outraged, and they want to know:

• Why is the illegal alien who purchased the gun, Leonel Huerta Sr., still living in Austin? • Why does he still have a Texas Driver’s license? • Why is ATF using illegal aliens to set up and convict American citizens? • What has he been promised for his cooperation? • Why has he not been prosecuted? He committed three distinct crimes: he purchased a firearm knowing he was an illegal alien, he possessed the firearm, and he transferred the handgun to another illegal alien (Hippolito Aviles, who was convicted and given time served on June 30, 2010). • Why has Huerta Sr. not been deported?

Starting next Thursday, Oklahomans could regularly begin seeing firearms out in plain sight wherever they go.

A new law slated to take effect Nov. 1 will allow the open carry of a loaded firearm, whether in a holster or hidden from view, as long as its owner has a concealed weapons permit.

What began as a Facebook page for people of Oklahoma interested in open carry laws to convene quickly snowballed into a lobby group that was able to spur momentum behind a bill geared to allow open carry.

On May 10, the bill cleared the Oklahoma Senate and five days later was signed into law by Governor Mary Fallin. Following the signing of the bill into law, the founders of the Facebook page formed the Oklahoma Open Carry Association (OKOCA)

Oklahoma Senator Anthony Sykes, the author of Senate Bill 1733, lauded the new law to the New York Times saying it reinforced the notion that gun owners are responsible people: “This enhances Oklahomans’ ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights…I think the evidence is clear that gun owners are some of the most responsible people, and they’ve shown that in not just Oklahoma, where we’ve had conceal carry for quite some time and there’s never been an incident, but in these other states as well.”

Come next Thursday, Oklahoma will become the 15th state in the nation to allow open carry with a permit requirement. There are 44 states that already allow open-carry in various forms."

October 24, 2013

Since at least 2001, the U.S. Department of Education has been building a massive arsenal of guns purchased through steep discounts orchestrated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Capitol Police.

The Education Department’s Office of the Inspector General somehow found it necessary to spend over $80,000 on Glock pistols and over $17,000 on Remington shotguns in the past seven years for investigations into “fraud, waste or abuse of Department of Education funds.”

In July alone, the OIG purchased 30 Glock 27s for a total of $10,800, according to documents released by Muckrock.

Overall, the Dept. of Education is estimated to have over 200 handguns and at least 27 shotguns.

The shotguns even came with Wilson Combat Sights.

“I believe the requested firearms and parts are essential for the safe, effective and efficient operations of [OIG] Investigation Services,” Mary Mitchelson, the former Dept. of Education Inspector General, wrote in a February 2010 memo.

Prior to receiving a firearm, Dept. of Education OIG special agents must complete a training course conducted by the Department of Homeland Security.

In one memo in particular, the OIG requested “10 additional Glock 27 pistols” due to an “increase in hiring.”

Ironically, the Education Dept. is not the only federal agency expanding its firepower outside of the Dept. of Justice.

Back in July, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration bought 72,000 rounds of .40 Smith & Wesson.

The year before, the National Weather Service made a solicitation for 46,000 rounds of .40 caliber jacketed hollow point ammunition.

Also in 2012, the Social Security Administration purchased 174,000 rounds of 125 grain .357 SIG hollow point ammunition to be delivered to 41 locations across America.

SIG Sauer developed the .357 SIG to be the equivalent of the powerful 125 grain .357 Magnum load in common use by lawmen throughout most of the Cold War.

The Department of Homeland Security bought so much ammo last year that it even began censoring the quantity of rounds the agency sought in its solicitations posted on the FedBizOpps web site.

It has been estimated that DHS stockpiled at least two billion rounds of ammunition, enough to sustain the war in Iraq for 24 years.

While the Dept. of Education continues to purchase guns at ease with a steep discount, law-abiding Americans on the other hand are struggling to even find firearms at retail prices in gun stores across America.

Adan Salazar

Infowars.com

July 30, 2013

Police in Cook County, Illinois are demonstrating that, contrary to gun control proponents’ reassurances, a gun registry does eventually and inevitably lead to confiscation.

Last week, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that the Cook County Sheriff’s office has formed a special task force assigned to seek out Cook County suburb residents whose Firearm Owner’s Identification Cards have expired.

“The Chicago Police Department conducts regular missions to recover revoked FOID cards and seize guns from the holders, but there wasn’t a concerted effort to do that in Cook County’s suburbs,” Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told the Sun-Times.

In February, the team confiscated 160 FOID cards and more than 160 guns from citizens whose cards had been revoked due to any number of circumstances, including newly discovered “mental illnesses,” felonies and protection orders, which morphs their non-violent firearm ownership into unlawful activity.

According to the Sun-Times, Sheriff Dart has influenced the Illinois General Assembly to include language in a new FOID law that gives sheriffs and local police the power to obtain warrants and invade the homes of expired permit holders in order to seek out their firearms.

Dart called the provision a “hammer” which gives police the power to conduct home searches, especially when gun owners insist they aren’t in possession of any firearms.

The Illinois State Police are also handing the Cook County Sheriffs leads, telling them which homes are set to have an FOID card expire and also informing them whether those homes have recently purchased any firearms, a detail which shows up in State Police databases due to a background check run at the time of gun purchases.

In most cases, firearm owners who were legal one minute and deemed “illegal” the next will not be afforded the opportunity to explain their situations.

Cook County Police have essentially initiated an early form of pre-crime previously only witnessed in places like California. They no longer have to wait for these so-called criminals to commit actual crimes.

Instead, gun owners can now be approached so long as they’re labeled “mentally ill,” even if just offhandedly reported by overzealous neighbors for, God forbid, believing in “conspiracy theories,” or if they’ve just returned from a military tour of duty and are diagnosed as having PTSD.

Many believe persecuting gun owners one by one using a registry, rather than going door-to-door, will be the template followed in the event that a more concerted national effort goes under way.

This latest effort to masquerade authoritarian gun control as a mere public safety measure is exactly the way it is done in California, where since 2007 gun repo teams have been knocking on gun owners’ doors in hopes to retrieve their weaponry.

Despite what gun control advocates, like the Director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Mark Glaze, attempt to lead Americans to believe, a gun registry inevitably leads to gun confiscation, and in the event of national emergencies, such as witnessed during Hurricane Katrina, homes appearing on these registries will undoubtedly be the first ones to have their firearms taken.

See below how, in the event of a national emergency, the government would like everyone to be disarmed, obedient slaves.

An Oregon man riding a public bus was arrested and booked into the Multnomah County Jail Tuesday for allegedly mentioning firearms during a conversation.

According to reports, a TriMet bus driver claims to have overheard comments made by 41-year-old Patrick O’Brien Nolin, who is accused of telling another passenger that he was carrying a firearm.

TriMet police were immediately called to the scene and began approaching the bus at the intersection of Northeast 82nd Avenue and Sandy Boulevard. Preparing to board, officers suddenly received new reports claiming that Nolin was not only armed, but had his firearm “cocked and loaded.”

Police carefully made their way onto the bus before finally confronting Nolin, who it turned out had no firearm or weapon whatsoever. Despite breaking no law, police decided to arrest Nolin anyway, charging him with “Interfering With Public Transportation,” a Class A Misdemeanor. Nolin was released on his own recognizance several hours later.

According to TriMet regulations, no person, except for law enforcement, can bring or carry any firearm, knife or any other instrument, article, device, material or substance specifically designed for, or attempted to be used to, inflict or cause bodily harm to another.

As Oregon state law preempts any regulation that restricts the possession or transfer of firearms under ORS 166.170, TriMet also goes on to state that a person in possession of a weapon, that cannot be legally banned, may not display or carry the weapon in a manner which is likely to result in fear or alarm by other persons or District employees.

Regardless, Nolin’s arrest clearly illustrates the establishment’s over-the-top reaction to anything Second Amendment related. In countless examples across the country, people, mostly children, have been punished for completely legal activity.

Last April, a highly decorated military veteran was illegally detained and disarmed after an officer accused him of “rudely displaying his rifle while out on a hike with his son.

In 2012, a 5-year-old girl in Pennsylvania was suspended for making a “terroristic threat” after telling fellow students about her “Hello Kitty” toy bubble gun.

The following year, a 5-year-old Maryland boy was interrogated for 2 hours until he wet himself after bringing a toy cap gun to school.

Last September, a 9-year-old boy in Detroit was suspended indefinitely after a teacher accused him of pointing his spinning top machine like a gun."

Dick’s Sporting Goods, another large distributor of firearms, has also taken action by suspending the sale of certain rifles and removing public display cases for firearms. “During this time of national mourning we have removed all guns from sale and from display in our store nearest to Newtown and suspended the sale of modern sporting rifles in all of our stores chainwide,” says apress release on the company’s corporate website. Celebrus Capital management, an investment firm with a stake in firearms maker Freedom Group, which manufactured one of the guns used in the Newtown shooting, said it would sell its ownership in the company.

While thousands have signed an online petitition calling for new anti-gun laws, so too are thousands of Americans taking up arms, so to speak. Within minutes of the newCheaperThanDirt! policies being put into place, hundreds of comments criticizing the company’s move began flowing on social networks:

With free market retailers already bowing to the pressure of anti-gun groups, it shouldn’t be too difficult for legislators to start taking aim at the Second Amendmentthrough guns bans, as well as banning the online sale of ammunition.

The event in Newtown, CT was tragic to be sure.

Equally as tragic, however, is that millions of Americans may soon lose their right to defend their homes and their persons as a result of half-baked, emotionally driven policies and laws.

How many innocents will die once Americans are stripped of their only defense against criminals who will stop at nothing to use deadly weapons to get their way?

The solution is not to try and ban or collect the some 300 million weapons in circulation in the United States; it’s to allow Americans to carry these weapons freely, openly and in a responsible manner.

It’s that simple."

The U.S. government is developing new firearm nanotechnology that can track, disrupt, and even self-destruct firearms.

The technological system, known as a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), utilizes tiny devices that are implanted in guns and other weapons. These devices are more than chips; they are actual mechanical processes created by precision engineering that can affect the weapon’s operations. Media reports reveal the devices include miniature GPS systems designed to make guns easier to track and self-destruct systems that could cause them to explode if they receive a wireless signal.

The technology coincides with the ‘smart gun’ technology Anthony Gucciardi has broken down in the past, which can be used to ‘turn off’ weapons when in gun free zones or whenever designated by government.

Other capabilities being developed include software that could interfere with the operation of targeting systems. This could include laser sights that couldn’t lock onto a person in uniform. Another possibility is targeting systems or sights that simply stop working after a certain date or shut down if they receive a wireless signal.

GUNS THAT SELF-DESTRUCT

The scary thing is that MEMS is being developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon’s science division. The idea is that this technology will be used in weapons given to questionable allies such as the Syrian rebels, who Obama is currently funding with weapons and other resources.

DARPA actually has a program to develop what it calls ‘Vanishing Programmable Resources’; in other words, weapons that will self-destruct. The idea here is to make weapons that can be ordered to self-destruct if they fall into the wrong hands.

HIGH TECH GUN CONTROL

The scary thing is that this technology is emerging right now, and it isn’t hard to imagine law enforcement or gun control zealots demanding that such technologies be built into all guns sold to the public. That way somebody could just push a button somewhere and thousands of guns could simply explode, or the targeting systems could stop working. They could also mandate that all guns contain a tiny transmitter that would make it easy for law enforcement to track down.

This technology isn’t a fantasy; weapons expert Chris Harmer told Bloomberg Businessweek that MEMS capabilities will be built into U.S. weapons within three to five years. Businessweek also reported that the market for MEMS will soon be around $1.1 billion.

Within a few years the federal government and others could have the capability to control guns without banning them. That will mean a huge market for older guns built before this technology became available.

Tuesday, May 19, 2009 Tuesday, May 19, 2009

An alarming document sent to us by an Infantryman based out of Fort Campbell Kentucky shows that active duty military personnel are being secretly ordered to submit information to their Chain of Command on how many firearms they own privately, their location, as well of details of any Concealed Carry permits.

Though the order was apparently rescinded, the fact that active duty soldiers are being asked to submit every detail of their private firearm collection is a telltale sign that the second amendment is in dire straights. Furthermore, Alex Jones has personally confirmed that such directives are being issued all over the country.

The directive orders active duty personnel to report details of all privately-owned firearms to their Chain of Command, as well as future firearms purchases.

The memorandum was sent to us by a concerned 11B Infantryman based at Fort Campbell. In his e mail, the man expresses his shock at being ordered to comply with what amounts to a registration of privately-owned firearms.

Read the document below.

“I live off post, with my firearms (which I don’t bring on post for any reason). A very frightening thing happened at work yesterday,” he writes. “I was ordered to fill out a list containing my firearm information. This included make, model, caliber, and serial number of all firearms I currently posses. In addition, I was also required to list registration information, location of all weapons individually, and information regarding any CCW permits I posses.”

The man tried to ascertain why such information was being demanded by speaking to his First Sergeant but was told, “Just put your info on the form.”

“I don’t know how high this goes, but I am hearing that this is going on in other units at Fort Campbell as well,” writes the Infantryman. “It just seems a little coincidental to me that within 90 days: the most anti-firearm President in history is inaugurated, some of the nastiest anti-firearm laws are put on the table in Washington, and then the Army comes around wanting what amounts to a registration on all firearms, even if they are off post, and doesn’t provide any reason or purpose as to why.”

The man said he had been at Fort Campbell for almost 8 years and had never encountered anything like this directive before.

“I fear something really nasty is blowing in the wind here,” he warns.

[efoods]

According to a World Net Daily article, the order was stopped when it was discovered the commander was not “acting within his authority.”

However, Alex Jones has personally confirmed that bases all over the nation, including in Texas, are directing active duty personnel to provide the same information about their private gun collections.

The story emphasizes how gargantuan threats to the second amendment are not being reported by the mainstream media nor by big gun groups like the NRA.

A similarly grave threat to the second amendment is the so-called ‘No Fly, No Buy Act’, (H.R. 2401), a bill that will merge the TSA’s no-fly list with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), a point-of-sale system for determining eligibility to purchase a firearm in the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

Since the Department of Homeland Security now considers veterans, advocates of the Second Amendment, and states’ rights activists as terrorists, the ‘No Fly, No Buy’ act would effectively disarm the majority of the entire country.

The language of H.R. 2401 reads as follows: “To increase public safety and reduce the threat to domestic security by including persons who may be prevented from boarding an aircraft in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and for other purposes,” according to the Open Congress website. Govtrack.us reports that the bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary."

After two days, the New York Times finally corrected its story claiming Virginia state law blocked Aaron Alexis from buying an AR-15 rifle before his rampage at the Navy Yard. The article, however, still is not accurate.

On Tuesday, I wrote that the Times was part of the widespread effort in the liberal media to tie the AR-15 rifle to the mass murder or 12 innocent people in Washington on Monday.

The headline was — and is — “State Law Stopped Gunman From Buying Rifle, Officials Say.”

It said that the gunman was stopped from buying an AR-15 “because state law there prohibits the sale of such weapons to out-of-state buyers, according to two senior law enforcement officials.”

In fact, there is no residency requirement in federal or state law for purchase of shotguns or rifles.

“This is our objective — save lives, bottom line,” Compton Unified Police Chief William Wu told the board.

Wu argued officers are woefully underequipped in the event of a terrorist attack or mass shooting, in which shooters increasingly wear body armor, which is not penetrable with standard firearms. He cited a recent FBI study that found that roughly 5 percent of mass shooters have worn such armor. Wu said that while assault-style rifles are more deadly, they’re also more accurate.

“Handguns you’d be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards,” Wu said. “With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can be go 50, 100 yards accurately.”

In brief, I must protest a now nearly institutionalized attempt to intimidate us into surrendering our civil rights to other people’s irrational fears.

We all have fears, but what do I mean by irrational fears?

Some fears are, of course, quite rational; for example, being fearful of burning your finger after touching a hot burner as a child.

But the responses to other fears are simply not based on a reasonable assessment of reality. They are are irrational.

Extreme examples can be psychotic or delusional beliefs, such as being afraid to get out of bed at night because of a fixed false belief that a ghost will emerge from the closet to harm you.

Other fears are irrational because the assessment of the likelihood of the event is completely out of proportion to reality. An example would be an unwillingness to leave the house because a meteor might strike and kill you. While a meteor could suddenly come out of the sky and kill you, it only happens 1 time in every 74.8 million years of life.

Unfortunately, our airports are now prime sites where people’s irrational responses to their fears are used as an excuse to bully, intimidate or force us into giving up our liberties.

The Air Force Research Laboratory has been working with Boeing for several years on the perfection, miniaturization and deployment of its Counter-electronics High-powered Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP), which has already been in the arsenal, but which will become increasingly central to the armed forces.

The U.S. Air Force’s confirmation that they and Boeing are developing the Counter-electronics High-powered Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP), an electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, that essentially uses microwave energy to render useless all electronics in its “blast” area without causing structural damage, trended all over the Internet last month […] “This technology marks a new era in modern-day warfare,” said Keith Coleman, Boeing Phantom Works’ CHAMP Program Manager in a Boeing video on the CHAMP test in 2012. “In the near future, this technology may be used to render an enemy’s electronic and data systems useless even before the first troops or aircraft arrive.”

Here’s a video simulation of CHAMP in action, including proud statements from its creators on its powerful effect during tests to use directed energy to neutralize a modern urban environment:

In their test, the electromagnetic attack took out all the computers and other electronic equipment in the office without creating any structural damage, which would have rendered most populations and many enemies helpless in a real world conflict scenario.

In 2012, CHAMP lead test engineer, Peter Finlay, said, “Today we made science fiction science fact.”

Though there are ways to guard against an EMP attack, it essentially amounts to an instant checkmate for anyone who is not prepared.

Lights out may largely translate to game over in future scenarios… bringing the masses to their knees.

That is what the Air Force is eyeing, and why it is (pardon the unfortunate pun) championing CHAMP in its public relations efforts.

Miniaturization and stealth deployment will give U.S. forces the edge, while similar weapons are already in the hands of rival powers and even rogue players.

[Flight Global reporter James Drew] reported that Masiello said the technology is mature and will be miniaturized for the JASSM-ER. CHAMP is “an operational system already in our tactical air force, and that is really what will make us more operationally relevant.

There is little doubt that such an attack could be crippling, as many experts in the U.S. have warned. As the Inquisitr reports:

United States EMP Commission statement about the domino effect an EMP attack would have on the United States. “The primary avenues for catastrophic damage to the nation are through our electric power infrastructure and thence into our telecommunications, energy, and other infrastructures. These, in turn, can seriously impact other important aspects of our nation’s life, including the financial system; means of getting food, water, and medical care to the citizenry; trade; and production of goods and services. The recovery of any one of the key national infrastructures is dependent on the recovery of others.”

But are its devastating effects against civil populations – even in declared wars – fair game? And how long until such an attack threatens the population here at home?"

Infowars.com

August 30, 2013

Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta have admitted to Associated Press correspondent Dale Gavlak that they were responsible for last week’s chemical weapons incident which western powers have blamed on Bashar Al-Assad’s forces, revealing that the casualties were the result of an accident caused by rebels mishandling chemical weapons provided to them by Saudi Arabia.

“From numerous interviews with doctors, Ghouta residents, rebel fighters and their families….many believe that certain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the (deadly) gas attack,” writes Gavlak. (back up version here).

Rebels told Gavlak that they were not properly trained on how to handle the chemical weapons or even told what they were. It appears as though the weapons were initially supposed to be given to the Al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra.

“We were very curious about these arms. And unfortunately, some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions,” one militant named ‘J’ told Gavlak.

His claims are echoed by another female fighter named ‘K’, who told Gavlak, “They didn’t tell us what these arms were or how to use them. We didn’t know they were chemical weapons. We never imagined they were chemical weapons.”

Abu Abdel-Moneim, the father of an opposition rebel, also told Gavlak, “My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry,” describing them as having a “tube-like structure” while others were like a “huge gas bottle.” The father names the Saudi militant who provided the weapons as Abu Ayesha.

According to Abdel-Moneim, the weapons exploded inside a tunnel, killing 12 rebels.

“More than a dozen rebels interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government,” writes Gavlak.

If accurate, this story could completely derail the United States’ rush to attack Syria which has been founded on the “undeniable” justification that Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack. Dale Gavlak’s credibility is very impressive. He has been a Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press for two decades and has also worked for National Public Radio (NPR) and written articles for BBC News.

The website on which the story originally appeared – Mint Press (which is currently down as a result of huge traffic it is attracting to the article) is a legitimate media organization based in Minnesota. The Minnesota Post did a profile on them last year.

Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in providing rebels, whom they have vehemently backed at every turn, with chemical weapons, is no surprise given the revelations earlier this week that the Saudis threatened Russia with terror attacks at next year’s Winter Olympics in Sochi unless they abandoned support for the Syrian President.

“I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,” Prince Bandar allegedly told Vladimir Putin, the Telegraph reports.

The Obama administration is set to present its intelligence findings today in an effort prove that Assad’s forces were behind last week’s attack, despite American officials admitting to the New York Times that there is no “smoking gun” that directly links President Assad to the attack.

US intelligence officials also told the Associated Press that the intelligence proving Assad’s culpability is “no slam dunk.”

As we reported earlier this week, intercepted intelligence revealed that the Syrian Defense Ministry was making “panicked” phone calls to Syria’s chemical weapons department demanding answers in the hours after the attack, suggesting that it was not ordered by Assad’s forces.

UPDATE: Associated Press contacted us to confirm that Dale Gavlak is an AP correspondent, but that her story was not published under the banner of the Associated Press. We didn’t claim this was the case, we merely pointed to Gavlak’s credentials to stress that she is a credible source, being not only an AP correspondent, but also having written for PBS, BBC and Salon.com.

Speaking to the UK’s Channel 4 in a report entitled “Could Trump win?”, Kellyanne Conway said polls showing Trump losing to Hillary are manufactured by the media and do not reflect the actual public sentiment.

“The polling numbers for Donald Trump are looking pretty bad now, aren’t they at the moment?” reporter Matt Frei asked.

“Not all of them, no. Just the cherry-picked polling numbers that are put out by media outlets that are also bent on his destruction,” Conway responded, adding that online polling consistently shows something much different.

“Our internal polling is proprietary and confidential so I won’t discuss it, but I will tell you that Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the election.”

Conway explained American voters are under social pressure to appear as though they dislike Trump, but that anonymous online polling affords voters the ability to make choices they might otherwise be ridiculed for publicly embracing.

“It’s because it’s become socially desirable, especially if you’re a college educated person in the United States of America, to say that you’re against Donald Trump,” Conway described.

“The hidden Trump vote in this country is a very significant proposition,” Conway said.

Asked if they have a number on so-called “undercover voters,” Conway replied, “I can’t discuss it. It’s a project we’re doing internally. I call it: ‘The Undercover Trump voter,’ but it’s real. And I think that if you go around this country and talk to people, you’ll see it’s real as well.”

The campaign manager’s words were quickly reinforced when Frei interviewed Trump impersonator John Di Domenico in front of the White House, who broke character to disclose what he’s personally witnessed.

“You travel all over the country doing this schtick. What’s the impression that you get? What’s your own personal polling telling you about his popularity?” Frei asked.

“I’ve been on the road almost non-stop since last August,” Di Domenico said. “I would say he’s going to win in a landslide. You see it in the polls on the news one way, and when you hit the ground and meet people, it’s totally different.”

Conway’s assertion that Trump is actually polling higher in anonymous online polls was also vindicated by the maker of the Zip question and answer app, who told USA Today earlier this month their polls show Donald Trump in the lead.

The app co-founder, Ric Militi, attributed the discrepancy between their polling and mainstream polls to the factor of online anonymity.

“We’re not a poll. We’re a conversation, and 100% anonymous,” Militi says. “People feel comfortable answering questions without fear of being bullied or being called a racist. People can express themselves safely, and you get a pure answer.”"

In another example of children being considered potential terrorists, a Massachusetts teacher sent home a note to each parent of her sixth-grade class banning all pencils and pens from school including the student’s person, backpack, and on the bus citing that they could be used in “weapon making”.

The letter read:

students would no longer be allowed to bring writing implements to school. It said pencils would be provided for students in class and any students caught with pencils or pens after Nov. 15 would face disciplinary action for having materials “to build weapons.”

After receiving several calls from the media, the school district quickly retracted the ban, stating that the teacher sent the notice on their own authority without prior approval of the school board.

This isn’t the first case of a teacher or school taking a drastic stance against minor and otherwise harmless items at school. A school in Rhode Island banned one student from wearing a hat that featured an American flag and plastic toy soldiers made in honor of soldiers. The 8-year-old boy made the hat as part of an assignment when they were to meet their pen-pals. He decided it would be a good idea to decorate it to be patriotic. The school disagreed.

A 7-year-old was expelled for over a year after a teacher found a toy gun in his backpack. The toy never left his bag, and wasn’t used in any threatening manor. The school board determined that the young boy should have to risk repeating the second grade as a just punishment for bringing a toy with him to school.

If that wasn’t crazy enough, a student was nearly expelled over a 2-inch Lego gun made for a policeman figure. The Staten Island student was playing with Legos during his lunch period when a teacher spotted a tiny toy gun no bigger than a quarter. This landed him in big trouble resulting in threatened suspension and even expulsion.

Are teachers, principals, and school board members taking their zero-tolerance policies just a little too far? While there is no denying that bringing a live firearm on school property should be strictly forbidden, instilling fear of retaliation by public employees for even possessing a toy leaves a lasting and potentially harmful mark on a child’s psyche. This is an early conditioning that teaches students to fear their own actions, and with notes like the one above banning writing utensils, to possibly submit to restrictions on creativity and expression. Keeping a journal or writing about your experiences was also banned in Orwellian 1984.

Note from Alex Jones: This is a form of mind control to teach children that the image of a gun in a slave’s hand is evil, while the same weapon in the hands of a swat team is good."

Canadian doctor Ghislaine Lanctôt, author of the Medical Mafia, has underscored the lawsuit recently filed by Austrian journalist Jane Bürgermeister against the WHO, the UN, and several high ranking government and corporate officials. Bürgermeister has documented how an international corporate criminal syndicate plans to unleash a deadly flu virus and institute a forced vaccination program.

“I am emerging from a long silence on the subject of vaccination, because I feel that, this time, the stakes involved are huge. The consequences may spread much further than anticipated,” writes Lanctôt, who believes the A(H1N1) virus will be used in a pandemic concocted and orchestrated by the WHO, an international organization that serves military, political and industrial interests.

1979 CBS 60 Minutes episode concerning the 1976 swine flu “pandemic” in the U.S.

Lanctôt warns that the elite and their minions will introduce a compulsory vaccination that will contain a deadly virus and this will be used specifically as a eugenics weapon for “massive and targeted reduction of the world population.” Moreover, a pandemic will also be used to further establish martial law and a police state, according to Lanctôt, and activate concentration camps “built to accommodate the rebellious” and eventually transfer power from all nations to a single United Nations government and thus fulfill the sinister plans of the New World Order.

In her book The Medical Mafia, Lanctôt writes about the ineffectiveness and dangers of vaccination. “Because of my professional status, my words weighed significantly in the public eye. The Medical Board’s reaction was immediate and strong. Its leaders demanded that I resign as a physician. I answered that I would do so as long as they could prove that what I had written was false. The Medical Board replied with a call for my expulsion,” she writes. “As I witnessed the disproportionate reaction of the Medical Board, I realized that, for the health establishment, the subject of vaccination was taboo. Unknowingly, I had opened a Pandora’s box. I discovered that, despite official claims, vaccines have nothing to do with public health. Underneath the governmental stamp of approval, there are deep military, political and industrial interests.”

During her trial in 1995, Lanctôt used an episode from the March 11th, 1979, 60 Minutes TV show covering the massive vaccination program foisted on the American public supposedly in response to the 1976 swine flu outbreak. It was later established by the CDC that the virus originated out of Fort Dix in New Jersey. “The Fort Dix outbreak may have been a zoonotic anomaly caused by introduction of an animal virus into a stressed population in close contact in crowded facilities during a cold winter,” note Joel C. Gaydos, Franklin H. Top, Jr, Richard A. Hodder, and Philip K. Russell.

It was also characterized “a rare example of an influenza virus with documented human to human transmission,” according to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. The virus is “thought to be a direct descendant of the virus that caused the pandemic of 1918,” explained Richard Krause, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the time.

[efoods]”Public health experts, fearing a possible replay of the 1918 pandemic, engaged in an intense debate about how to respond. Eventually they launched a nationwide vaccination campaign, which was announced by President Gerald Ford in March. By the end of the year, 48 million people had been vaccinated,” write Robert Roos and Lisa Schnirring of the Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy. “But the feared pandemic never materialized.”

Instead, numerous people came down with Guillian-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing neurologic illness, after receiving the government-hyped vaccination.

More than 33 years later, according to Dr. Russell Blaylock, a board certified neurosurgeon, “we are hearing the same cries of alarm from a similar lineup of virology experts. The pharmaceutical companies are busy designing a vaccine for the swine flu in hope that this administration will make the vaccine mandatory before another vaccine-related disaster can ruin their party…. Like SARS and bird flu before it, this swine flu scare is a lot of nonsense. Just take your high dose vitamin D3 (5000 IU a day), eat a healthy diet and take a few immune boosting supplements (such as beta-1, 3/1, 6 glucan) and you will not have to worry about this flu.”

According to a source known to former NSA official Wayne Madsen, “A top scientist for the United Nations, who has examined the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa, as well as HIV/AIDS victims, concluded that H1N1 possesses certain transmission “vectors” that suggest that the new flu strain has been genetically-manufactured as a military biological warfare weapon.

In April, Army criminal investigators were looking into the possibility that disease samples went missing from biolabs at Fort Detrick. “Chad Jones, spokesman for Fort Meade, said CID is investigating the possibility of missing virus samples from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases,” the Frederick News Post reported. “Obviously, in light of the current swine flu scare, and the new strain’s possible synthetic origin, the fact that virus samples may have gone missing from the same Army research lab from which the 2001 anthrax strain was released is extremely disturbing,” Paul Joseph Watson wrote at the time.

Jane Bürgermeister “charges that the entire ‘swine flu’ pandemic business is premised on a massive lie that there is no natural virus out there that poses a threat to the population,” writes Barbara Minton for Natural Health News. “She presents evidence leading to the belief that the bird flu and swine flu viruses have, in fact, been bioengineered in laboratories using funding supplied by the WHO and other government agencies, among others. This ‘swine flu’ is a hybrid of part swine flu, part human flu and part bird flu, something that can only come from laboratories according to many experts.”

Minton continues:

Using the “swine flu” as a pretext, the defendants [in Bürgermeister’s lawsuit] have preplanned the mass murder of the U.S. population by means of forced vaccination. They have installed an extensive network of FEMA concentration camps and identified mass grave sites, and they have been involved in devising and implementing a scheme to hand power over the U.S. to an international crime syndicate that uses the UN and WHO as a front for illegal racketeering influenced organized crime activities, in violation of the laws that govern treason.

Note the language in this clip: Americans will be “required” to get multiple vaccinations.

Obama’s Bilderberg Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius — and Bilderberg member — wants to make it easy for kids to get their toxin-laden eugenicist “swine flu” vaccine this fall. “Schoolchildren may be first in line for swine flu vaccine this fall — and might even be able to get the shot right at school,” the Associated Press reported on June 16.

As we noted last month, the government appears to be planning a mandatory flu vaccination program. In a recent article on the unfolding economic collapse, Rep. Ron Paul warns that the hysterically hyped H1N1 flu “pandemic” may result in the government requiring mandatory flu vaccinations. “Nearly $8 billion will be spent to address a ‘potential pandemic flu’ which could result in mandatory vaccinations for no discernible reason other than to enrich the pharmaceutical companies that make the vaccine,” writes Paul.

Considering the track record of the global elite, the government-mandated vaccination program now in the works — as Ghislaine Lanctôt and Jane Bürgermeister warn — will serve the eugenicist plan to depopulate the planet. A contrived pandemic will also set the final stage for the implementation of martial law and a high-tech surveillance and police state grid."

Earlier this week, a Spanish newspaper quoted Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez as saying the U.S. Navy caused the Haiti earthquake with a tectonic weapon. The Venezuelan media reported that the earthquake “may be associated with the project called HAARP, a system that can generate violent and unexpected changes in climate,” Press TV reported on January 21.

Chavez cited a report from Russia’s Northern Fleet. According to the report, the U.S. Navy made a mistake with a secret “earthquake weapon” and the result was the Haitian earthquake. The Russians believe the intended target was Iran. “Though Russian Northern Fleets’ report was not confirmed by official sources, the comments attracted special attention in some US and Russian media outlets including Fox news and Russia Today,” writes Pragmatic Witness blog. “Russia Today’s report said that Moscow has also been accused of possessing and utilizing such weapons.”

“Speaking on his weekly television show, Chavez opined that the U.S. mission in Haiti was a ruse to initiate military occupation,” the New York Daily News said.

Venezuelan media “added that the U.S. government’s HAARP program, an atmospheric research facility in Alaska (and frequent subject of conspiracy theories), was also to blame for a Jan. 9 quake in Eureka, Calif., and may have been behind the 7.8-magnitude quake in China that killed nearly 90,000 people in 2008,” Fox News reported on Thursday.

In 1997, former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen made the following statement:

Others [terrorists] are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves… So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations…It’s real, and that’s the reason why we have to intensify our [counterterrorism] efforts.

Cohen was talking about longitudinal EM wave interferometers (LWI) technology (also known as “Tesla howitzers”). LWI waves can effortlessly pass through the ocean and earth. Experts claim LWI waves can in fact pass through the earth and emerge on the other side. The United States and Russia have possessed this technology for decades.

Cohen would have you believe it is a technology that only terrorists would use. It depends on who you would call a terrorist.

In 1966, Professor Gordon J. F. MacDonald, associate director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Los Angeles, was a member of the President’s Science Advisory Committee. MacDonald published papers on the use of environmental-control technologies for military purposes, including “earthquake engineering” (he also wrote about weather manipulation, climate modification, polar ice cap melting or destabilization, ozone depletion techniques).

“The revealed secrets surprised legislators,” writes Dr. Nick Begich. “Would an inquiry into the state of the art of electromagnetic manipulation surprise lawmakers today? They may find out that technologies developed out of the HAARP experiments in Alaska could deliver on Gordon MacDonald’s vision because leading-edge scientists are describing global weather as not only air pressure and thermal systems, but also as an electrical system.”

Jesse Ventura detailed the HAARP program on his popular truTV show Conspiracy Theory:

Of course, we have no direct evidence the Pentagon used HAARP to touch off a massive earthquake in Haiti.

[efoods]The U.S., however, has exploited the earthquake to send the military to the stricken island nation. “They brazenly occupied Haiti without consulting the UN or the OAS (Organization of American States),” said Chavez earlier in the week. Bolivian President Evo Morales said Wednesday he would request an emergency UN meeting “to repudiate and reject this military occupation of the United States in Haiti.”

“It’s not right the United States should use this natural disaster to invade and militarily occupy Haiti,” he told a press conference.

“The unspoken mission of US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) with headquarters in Miami and US military installations throughout Latin America is to ensure the maintenance of subservient national regimes, namely US proxy governments, committed to the Washington Consensus and the neoliberal policy agenda,” writes Michel Chossudovsky. “While US military personnel will at the outset be actively involved in emergency and disaster relief, this renewed US military presence in Haiti will be used to establish a foothold in the country as well pursue America’s strategic and geopolitical objectives in the Caribbean basin, which are largely directed against Cuba and Venezuela.”

The objective is not to work towards the rehabilitation of the national government, the presidency, the parliament, all of which has been decimated by the earthquake. Since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship, America’s design has been to gradually dismantle the Haitian State, restore colonial patterns and obstruct the functioning of a democratic government. In the present context, the objective is not only to do away with the government but also to revamp the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), of which the headquarters have been destroyed… Prior to the earthquake, there were, according to US military sources, some 60 US military personnel in Haiti. From one day to the next, an outright military surge has occurred: 10,000 troops, marines, special forces, intelligence operatives, etc., not to mention private mercenary forces on contract to the Pentagon. In all likelihood the humanitarian operation will be used as a pretext and justification to establish a more permanent US military presence in Haiti.

Is it possible the Pentagon would kill 100,000 or more Haitians to realize such a project?

The U.S. killed well over a million Iraqis, why not a 100,000 or so Haitians?"

March 12, 2014

Over a dozen nations have now mobilized search teams for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The mysterious disappearance has left investigators all over the world wondering what could have happened. This is a huge investigation, as evidenced by the fact that China has re-tasked ten satellites to search for the wreckage, suggesting that the People’s Republic really wants to get to the bottom of what happened here.

There is no debris to be found. The black box, which is supposed to be indestructible in a large explosion and should broadcast a homing signal for up to 30 days, has gone dark. Moreover, INTERPOL is looking into several passengers who boarded the plane using false passports, and whose tickets were reportedly purchased by an unknown Iranian benefactor.

Several theories have emerged as to what could have caused the flight to “vanish” out of thin air. None of them are, as of yet, conclusive.

We can probably rule out a mid-air explosion, because something like that would likely have left instruments operational for long enough that readings would have been transmitted back to flight controllers. Likewise, there would be a fairly wide debris field had such an explosion occurred at such a high altitude.

Terrorism has not been ruled out, but traditional methods, including a hi-jacking, seem unlikely (remember those reinforced cockpit doors?).

It is certainly possible that search teams are just looking in the wrong place and the plane could be found in coming hours or days.

However, as noted by Mike Adams, the idea of an advanced military weapon of some sort is certainly within the realm of possibility. We know our Defense Department, as well as the militaries of other countries, are always hard at work developing new war-making technologies.

One such advanced weapons system has come to public light in recent years and as recently as two days prior to the disappearance of flight 370 Senator Ted Cruz mentioned it in a followup to his CPAC speech:

“When Iran describes Israel as the Little Satan, and America as the Great Satan, we have every interest to make sure they don’t acquire the weaponry to kill millions of Americans.” Cruz imagined a nightmare scenario in which Iran detonated a bomb over “Tel Aviv or New York or Los Angeles.” Detonated here, the effects of an EMP attack could kill “tens of millions of Americans.”

We know for a fact that China, North Korea, Russia and the United States have developed what are dubbed Super-EMP Weapons. These types of weapons require nuclear fuel and must be detonated over or near the target area. The secondary effect of this nuclear detonation is an electro-magnetic pulse. Deployed properly, for example 200 miles over the state of Kansas, such a weapon could literally wipe out every electronic system from coast to coast.

It is this possibility that prompted investigators to contact the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation yesterday, so they understand that this could well be the type of weapons used.

Experts at Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty have been asked to see if they detected an explosion at high altitude of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. Lassina Zerbo, executive director of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) told a news conference the organisation used “infrasound” – or infrasonic sensors – to monitor the earth mainly for atmospheric nuclear explosions. (source)

More than likely, the infrasound tests won’t yield any result. For starters, it would be quite difficult to sneak a suit-case nuclear weapon onto an airplane. Second, a space or air explosion would have quickly been detected by military monitoring systems operated by the U.S., China and Russia.

The other possibility is one that is often not discussed, yet has emerged as a highly effective military system in recent years. This involves the use of a non-nuclear electro magentic pulse weapon.

Weapons designers specializing in high-energy physics can now create electromagnetic pulses without going into outer space. One approach involves harnessing the force of a conventional explosion. Others are simply just modifications of radar, which bounces pulses of energy off aircraft in flight, vehicles on the ground, and other objects. Crank up the power and you have an EMP weapon, ready to point at the computers of your favorite enemy.This knowledge has set off a new arms race. Whether fitted into cruise missiles or parked at the side of the road in a van, non-nuclear EMP weapons have the potential to devastate the electronic systems of areas as large as a city or as small as a selected building, all without being seen, heard, or felt by a single soul. It is a dream come true for any and all terrorists. Sound far-fetched? It did not in 1993 to the owners of automobiles parked about 300 meters from a U.S. Defense Contractor’s EMP generator test site at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Their alternators and electronic engine controls were accidentally fried by a pulse during classified field trials. Source: Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin

The following provides an explanation for how these weapons work. What we know about the Flight 370 disaster suggests that if this was an act of terrorism it could have been executed using a NNEMP:

NNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs, cruise missiles (such as the CHAMP missile) and drones, with diminished mechanical, thermal and ionizing radiation effects, but without the political consequences of deploying nuclear weapons. … The electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect. These facts limit the range of NNEMP weapons, but allow finer target discrimination. The effect of small e-bombs has proven to be sufficient for certain terrorist or military operations. Examples of such operations include the destruction of electronic control systems critical to the operation of many ground vehicles and aircraft.

We know for a fact that these e-bombs have been built and tested by our own military. Unlike nuclear-based EMP weapons, these devices can be small and compact versions can actually be created with basic Do-It-Yourself kits. They can be deployed on drones, planes and missiles. They can be specifically targeted at cities, buildings or even vehicles. Thus, it is possible that such a device was used to take down Flight 370.

For the skeptics out there, watch the following video of a do-it-yourself homemade e-bomb being used to short-circuit a cell phone:

In this video, another homemade e-bomb is used to disable various electronics. Note that the rudimentary device looks to have an effective range of roughly 10 – 15 yards:

Now consider what a rogue terror organization or black ops team could do with a multi-million dollar budget.

Harping back to the Iranian connection, is it possible that a small capacity non-nuclear EMP weapon was smuggled on board the airplane, perhaps in common electronic devices, and triggered mid-flight?

That an unknown man named “Ali” purchased tickets for his friends at the last minute to the cheapest destination available, is highly suspect and is indicative of terrorism. An incident involving a man with a similar profile occurred at Amsterdam airport when the Christmas underwear bomber was allowed onto the plane – without a passport.

We’re not necessarily suggesting Iran is behind this, but it sure is an easy story to sell.

Insofar as the effects themselves, a non-nuclear EMP could well explain how a plane, from one second to the next, simply vanishes without a trace.

There would be no large debris field because the plane would have fallen right out of the sky, so instead of a search area of square miles, we’d be looking at mere yards, a difficult find in a huge ocean.

The homing device on the black box, which as far as we can tell is not shielded against an EMP blast, would, just as the planes instrumentation and communications equipment, short circuit and become inoperable.

No explosions or missile signature would have been detected by monitoring systems

While this theory is far from conclusive, it makes as much sense as any being proposed.

If this was the kind of weapon used, then it could have been a “dry run” for something much bigger, like a coordinated attack involving many more planes in the future.

Or, as highlighted by American Everyman, we can just go with the official story per the mainstream media:

So, right on cue, in the absence of a logical thesis, the mainstream media along with “high ranking unnamed sources” are starting to float ridiculousness as the solution. Officials investigating the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board suspect it may have disintegrated in mid-flight, a senior source said on Sunday, as Vietnam reported a possible sighting of wreckage from the plane. Reuters Yes, there you have it, it may have just vaporized itself in mid-air for no apparent reason.

Vaporized? Gone? Nothing remained of this 600,000 pound jumbo jet?

The notion that an e-bomb was responsible is much more likely than vaporization.

And that is a much more terrifying thought to consider."

In retaliation the jets were targeted by Syrian anti-aircraft missiles with one of the Israeli fight planes shot down.

According to a statement by the Syrian Army, a total of four Israeli jets breached Syrian airspace on Friday morning, Reuters reports. Syria’s air defenses shot down one of the Israeli jets over “occupied ground” and damaged another.

The Israeli Army confirmed it had conducted airstrikes on several targets in Syria, Israel National News reported. However, as usual the IDF insists that none of the jets was harmed. “At no point was the safety of Israeli civilians or the IAF [Israeli Air Force] aircraft compromised,” an Israeli military spokesman said.

Following the breach of the country’s airspace, the Syrian Army warned Israel of “direct” retaliation “with all means at its disposal,” Haaretz reports. Earlier, a spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that Israeli military jets were targeted by anti-aircraft missiles after they struck several targets in Syria.

“I can say that the sirens were the result of the incident,” an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson told Sputnik, referring to the launch of missiles at Israeli planes that carried out attacks on targets in Syria.

As Reuters further adds, after Israeli Air Force planes struck several targets in Syria on Thursday night, Damascus retaliated by activating its air defense systems and firing a number of missiles at Israeli jets, according to Haaretz.

None of the missiles struck the jets, but one was intercepted by a missile defense system north of Jerusalem, Haaretz reports, adding there were no Israeli casualties in the incident.

“Overnight IAF (Israeli Air Force) aircraft targeted several targets in Syria. Several anti-aircraft missiles were launched from Syria following the mission and IDF (Israel Defence Force) Aerial Defence Systems intercepted one of the missiles,” the military said in its statement, as cited by Reuters.

A rocket siren was heard at around 3:00am Friday morning in the Jordan Valley area, after which witnesses heard an explosion. The IDF later confirmed that the sirens were a result of Israeli airstrikes on several targets in Syria, Israel National News reports.

Friday’s incident is the third time that Israel has bombed targets on Syrian territory.

Recent, in mid-January, Israeli forces hit the Mezzeh Military Airport west of Damascus, with the facility rocked by several explosions according to RT.

On December 7, the state agency SANA reported that multiple surface-to-surface missiles had been fired by the IDF from the Golan Heights.

Syrian authorities have repeatedly accused Israel of endorsing terrorism by carrying out the attacks. Regarding the strikes, Israeli authorities previously said they were targeting positions of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group inside Syria. Israel views the organization as enemy militants."

Israel confirms through its IDF spokesperson that it has carried out “a large scale attack” consisting of at least a dozen strikes on Syrian and Iranian military targets inside Syria, in what Reuters dubbed a “major escalation of tension”.

What we previously described as Assad’s strategic “waiting game” and reluctance to respond to repeat Israeli violations of Syrian airspace while launching unprovoked attacks appears to be over as Syrian air defense has shot down an Israeli F-16 fighter jet near the Golan border region in what is a major escalation in the conflict.

Though details remain murky and are still developing, Israel has confirmed that its F-16 jet has crashed in Israeli territory after it was struck carrying out operations targeting locations in Syria. The IDF spokesman quickly stated in a tweet confirming the shoot down that “Iran is responsible for this severe violation of Israeli sovereignty.”

The two Israeli pilots ejected, landing inside Israel in the northern countryside of Galilee and were rushed to a hospital, according to local media reports. Israeli military statements have indicated that one of the pilots suffered severe injuries as a result of the emergency ejection from the aircraft.

Video first posted on social media captured by onlookers in the area appears to show a pilot parachuting into the northern Israeli countryside of Galilee.

Early unconfirmed footage of the F-16 crash and subsequent rescue have emerged on social media. The following shows multiple scenes currently circulating from the early morning incident:

This is the first time in the 7-year long Syrian war that an Israel jet has been shot down, and after promising a swift response, Israel has launched multiple retaliatory strikes against Syrian military bases in the southwest countryside of Damascus.

Beirut-based Al Masdar News reports that the incident occurred at approximately 6:30 A.M. Saturday morning (local time) and that the Israeli F-16 fighter was hit while flying within Syrian airspace near Damascus.

Official Israeli statements claim multiple of its jets were scrambled in response to an Iranian drone launch into Israeli airspace, which the IDF says was intercepted amidst “massive Syrian anti-air fire”. The F-16 was engaged in an operation to destroy the Syrian ground base from which the UAV was launched.

According to the Israeli version of events issued in real time by IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus:

Accurate hits of Iranian UAV control facility confirmed. — Jonathan Conricus (@LTCJonathan) February 10, 2018

Breaking news: IDF intercepted an Iranian UAV launched from Syria over Israeli airspace, and is now engaging Iranian targets in Syria in response. More details to follow. — Jonathan Conricus (@LTCJonathan) February 10, 2018

The Syrian military has stated that its air defense missile system further struck an Israeli drone shortly after the F-16 was downed, which had been launched from the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. There’s not been immediate Israeli confirmation of this second aircraft downing.

In response to the F-16 downing, after 8:00 A.M. local time the Israeli Air Force fired several missiles targeting the Al-Kiswah area near what is said to be an Iranian base outside of Damascus. And shortly after this initial Israeli retaliation strike, a more massive wave of missiles hit a mountaintop Syrian Army base in the same area. Regional sources are reporting that multiple Israeli missiles struck the base, while others were intercepted by Syrian air defense.

It appears that Israel launched missiles on locations in central Syria as well, with casualties reported among Syrian Army forces and their allies. The Associated Press cites a Syrian opposition monitoring group to report the following:

A Syria war monitor says Israel has struck targets in central Syria and the southwestern suburbs of the capital Damascus in two separate and successive waves of airstrikes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the first round targeted in the central desert area where Syrian troops and their Iranian-backed allies including Hezbollah are known to maintain bases. It cited unconfirmed reports of casualties among Syrian government forces and allied militiamen. The Britain-based Observatory, which monitors the Syria war through a network of activists on the ground, says the second round targeted outposts in the southwestern suburbs of Damascus

Syrian government media reported multiple missile intercepts, likely through its sophisticated Russian-supplied anti-air defense system, and confirmed the large-scale Israeli attack on Syrian military locations in central Syria.

According to Syrian state-run SANA:

The army air defense confronted a new Israeli aggression on one of the military positions in the central area and hit more than one aircraft… Moreover, the Army air defense confronted another Israeli aggression on Damascus Countryside on Saturday morning… Meanwhile, media of the Israeli enemy admitted that the Syrian air defense shot down an F-16 jet over Galilee in occupied Palestine and that its pilots were injured, confirming the closure of parts the Israeli airspace for aviation after downing the warplane.

As a result of escalating events airspace closures have been reported over northern Israel, as well as multiple Israeli air defense warning sirens sounding at the Golan Heights and throughout lower and upper Galilee.

Israel’s Ben Gurion international airport outside of Tel Aviv was also reportedly on lockdown for some period of time after the exchange of fire between Syrian and Israeli forces.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military has blamed close Syrian ally Iran for today’s F-16 shoot down and escalation. The IDF issued a threatening statement which reads: “The IDF will act determinately against such severe violations of Israeli sovereignty by Iran and Syria and will continue to act as necessary. The IDF is ready for various scenarios and will continue to act according to situation assessments.”

And according to a statement issued to the AFP, Israel says Iran and Syria are “playing with fire” but that Israel does not want escalation. However, regional media reports indicate Israel has continued to pound the Damascus countryside throughout the morning. The Syrian government has condemned Israel’s actions as unwarranted “aggression”.

It must be remembered that the Israeli Air Force has acknowledged striking targets inside Syria at least 100 times over the past few years of the conflict, with the last attack prior to today’s events happening just earlier this week. Syria has frequently taken its case before the U.N., calling for official condemnation of the unprovoked attacks, but has been just as frequently rebuffed.

In its now ‘open secret’ of a years-long pursuit of regime change in Syria, Israel has given covert support to al-Qaeda linked groups in Syria’s south – near the vicinity of today’s F-16 shoot down – which has involved weapons transfers and treatment of wounded jihadists in Israeli hospitals, according to The Wall Street Journal. As former Acting Director of the CIA Michael Morell once directly told the Israeli public, Israel’s “dangerous game” in Syria has involved getting in bed with al-Qaeda in order to fight Shia Iran.

And as Israel has long sought ways to justify attacks on Iranian assets in Syria while at the same time undermining and destabilizing the Syrian government, the downing of an F-16 may have given Israel’s hawkish leadership the excuse they’ve been looking for all along to escalate toward a final confrontation.

Middle East based journalist and analyst Elijah Magnier says we could be witnessing the tipping point that will ignite the entire region. Magnier reports that according to a “private source, all Syrian military and intelligence and their allies’ (Hezbollah) positions in Syrian and Lebanon are on full alert.”

Michael Wright, a lawyer representing the family of 22-year-old John Crawford III, who was shot and killed by police inside the Beavercreek Walmart earlier this month after being spotted wielding one of the store’s Crosman MK-177 pellet guns, commented at a news conference yesterday on bits of surveillance footage shown to him and the family by the Ohio Attorney General.

Wright said that, based on what he’d been shown, it did not appear Crawford made any threatening gestures, as suggested by a 9-1-1 caller, but was instead leaning on the butt of the air rifle when police arrived.

“The tape we saw saw several shoppers walk by John, look at merchandise in the same aisle with John, including Angela Williams and her children and they were completely indifferent as to John’s presence. No shopper showed any concern about John’s presence that we were shown on tape by the attorney general,” Wright stated.

On August 5, Beavercreek police used lethal force when they responded to a call regarding a man walking around the store menacingly pointing a weapon at other shoppers.

The 9-1-1 caller stated he witnessed Crawford “walking around with a gun in the store,” and that he was “loading it right now,” and pointing it at customers and children.

He “was just waving it at children and people. Items…. I couldn’t hear anything that he was saying. I’m thinking that he is either going to rob the place or he’s there to shoot somebody else,” the concerned shopper told police.

“We have no idea what this 9-1-1 caller viewed,” Wright stated. “The video that we were shown shows John doing absolutely nothing menacing, not pointing the gun, doing none of the things that the 9-1-1 caller indicated,” asserted Wright, adding that he had not yet been able to question the caller. “You just saw [Crawford] standing talking on the phone, and the next frame he’s laying on the ground.”

“From what we’ve seen, John had no opportunity to put the gun down,” Wright said. He was “doing nothing more, nothing less than shopping”

Lee Cee Johnson, the mother of Crawford’s children, said she was speaking with him on the phone right before police shot him. She said she heard Crawford tell someone the gun was “not real,” then heard screaming.

“We was just talking. He said he was at the video games playing videos and he went over there by the toy section where the toy guns were. And the next thing I know, he said ‘It’s not real,’ and the police start shooting and they said ‘Get on the ground,’ but he was already on the ground because they had shot him,” Johnson said. “And I could hear him just crying and screaming. I feel like they shot him down like he was not even human.”

Wright said he’s still waiting to view the footage in its entirety, as he’d only been shown select parts, but said what police have released so far is extremely “one-sided” in favor of police accounts.

“Everything released is one-sided. There is nothing favorable to John Crawford. You can’t show different pieces. Show it all. Don’t trickle pieces to gain favor of the public,” said Wright.

Ohio Attorney General Mike Dewine says they haven’t released the footage because it “is not the right thing to do,” and because it might affect the opinions of jurors presiding over the case.

The Beavercreek police chief, Dennis Evers, has already weighed in defending the officers, stating, “Preliminary indications are the officers acted appropriately under the circumstances.”

“The officers gave verbal commands to the subject to drop the weapon,” Evers stated at a press conference the day after the shooting. “The subject … was shot after failing to comply with the officers’ commands. The quick response of officers was instrumental in containing this situation and minimizing the risk to customers.”

An innocent bystander also died following the confrontation. The Greene County Coroner indicated Angela Williams, 37, of Fairborn, was “apparently running from a dangerous situation inside the Walmart store when she collapsed. She was taken to Soin Medical Center where she died at 9:14 p.m.” In a sad twist, the mother of two was due to be wed that weekend.

Ohio’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation predicted it could be months before the investigation wraps up, a sluggish pace Crawford’s father, John Crawford II, perceives as “stall tactics.”

The state has handed the case over to a special prosecutor, and a grand jury will convene on September 22 to ultimately decide what repercussive actions to take, if any.

One of the officers involved in the altercation, David Darkow, is back on duty, while officer Sean Williams remains on paid administrative leave, according to the Huffington Post."

October 25, 2013

The shooting death of a 13-year-old California boy believed to be carrying an assault rifle unfolded in no more than 10 seconds, police said. Andy Lopez Cruz, who was later found to be carrying a plastic replica, was struck by seven bullets.

In that time, a total of eight rounds were fired by one of the two sheriff’s deputies who confronted the teen, with two of the wounds – one in the right side of his chest and the second in his right hip – proving fatal.

Lt. Paul Henry, of the Santa Rosa Police Department, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Cruz was also shot in his right wrist, left biceps, right forearm, right buttocks and right hip.

It took another 16 seconds for the deputies to call for medical assistance, according to a timeline of events released by police investigating the fatal shooting in Santa Rosa on Tuesday, Reuters reports.

At approximately 3pm Tuesday, a 24-year-old deputy of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office and a rookie deputy he was training spotted Andy, donning a blue hoodie and shorts, walking on Moorland Avenue with what they believed was an assault rifle in his left hand.

Police say the deputies – who have not yet been officially identified – got out of their squad car and took cover behind the open doors. The senior deputy twice shouted, “Put the gun down,” before Cruz turned to his right, the Sheriff’s Office said.

Police said the boy ignored two calls to put down the weapon, instead turning toward the senior deputy with the rifle barrel “rising up and turning in his direction.” The deputy is then said to have opened fire out of fear for his life, being unable to tell whether his target was a child from where he was standing.

The eighth grader died at the scene. A toy handgun was also was found tucked in his pants.

The rookie deputy, who was hired last month, did not fire any shots, the Chronicle cites Assistant Sheriff Lorenzo Duenas as saying. That deputy had served 11 years with another police agency, said Duenas, who declined to identify that agency.

Four seconds after the shooting, the two officers radioed for assistance from other deputies. Another six seconds elapsed before they notified dispatchers that shots had been fired. Police had previously said the deputies called for backup the moment they noticed what appeared to be a military-style rifle.

The officers involved in the shooting have both been placed on administrative leave, in accordance in usual procedure in such cases. The incident is being investigated by the Santa Rosa Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.

The shooting has sparked outrage in the community and beyond, with Andy’s family and friends accusing the deputy who opened fire of overreacting to a situation which did not require the use of deadly force.

The death has prompted calls in Santa Rosa for the creation of civilian review boards to examine such incidents.

“People have to do something,” Elbert Howard, a founding member of the Police Accountability Clinic and Helpline of Sonoma County, told Reuters. “He’s a child, and he had a toy. I see that as an overreaction to shoot him down.”

An advisory panel of the US Civil Rights Commission urged Sonoma County to create civilian-review boards in 2000 in the wake of eight fatal officer-involved shootings in less than three years. The panel’s recommendation, however, was disregarded.

Up to 200 mourners gathered Thursday around a makeshift memorial consisting of flowers, balloons, teddy bears and pictures of the boy at the site of the shooting.

Some held candles and signs that said: “What a tragedy, what a travesty.”

Friends and family have described Cruz as personable and well-liked in the neighborhood.

Residents say the diverse neighborhood does not have a particularly high rate of crime, with people feeling safe allowing their children to play in the streets.

“A lot of people say this is not a great neighborhood, but we’ve never had any problems,” Sam Hin, a mother who works in human resources at a skilled nursing facility, told the Press Democrat. “It’s our home. It’s what we’re used to.”

But Shannon Peavler, an in-home support provider whose mother lives on Moorland Avenue, told the daily deputies “come into the neighborhood thinking it’s a bad neighborhood, so they treat people that way.”"

Describing how California’s SB-880 will re-define “assault weapons,” Jacob Belemjian of The Firing Line shooting range in Clovis points out exactly what parts of the rifle will make the gun illegal at the start of the new year, and what can be modified on the gun to make it legal.

Despite the AR-15 he uses as an example requiring a special tool in order to detach the magazine, Belemjian says the feature, which in the past allowed the gun to bypass detachable gun magazine restrictions, means the gun would be in violation of the new laws.

Under the new law, a “fixed magazine” is now defined as “an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.”

Belemjian also described other features on his example centerfire, semi-automatic rifle that would make it illegal, such as the aforementioned detachable magazine and any of the following features: a collapsible, or adjustable, or foldable stock; a pistol grip that protrudes below the trigger guard; a forward pistol grip; and a flash hider.

But, “if I remove the flash hider, remove the forward pistol grip, put a fixed stock on it and change out this [pistol] grip, guess what? It’s not an ‘assault weapon’ anymore; now it does not meet the definition.”

CBS Fresno reports that Wednesday will be the last day Californians can legally buy the gun in its current form:

“The Department of Justice says buyers must actually take possession of their rifle before January 1st. It has to be purchased in time to allow for the 10-day waiting period before the buyer can pick up their new rifle. if someone purchases a soon-to-be-banned rifle by the Dec. 21 deadline, but fails to pick it up in time on Dec. 31, they will not get their rifle. Legally gun dealers may not deliver one, even if it’s been paid for.”"

“We know this is going to happen again!” Scarborough said. “Donald Trump knew this day was coming. Donald Trump knows another school shooting is coming. Donald Trump snows another church shooting is coming. More Christians will be gunned down in churches in middle America. More country music fans will be gunned down at concerts across America.”

Scarborough’s guest Donny Deutsche openly suggested that Trump could be manipulated into acting on gun control.

“If you think about what drives him, what motivates him more than anything is to be the ultimate hero, to be the ultimate contrarian.” Deutsche stated.

“Donald Trump has proven to be a coward.” Scarborough replied.

“He’s proven to be a small man. Why would Donald Trump stop being a coward now? Why would he stop being a frightened little man now?!”

“My hope is that his ego is bigger than his cowardice,” Deutsche responded, adding “we would forgive Russia!”

Breaking down in tears at one point, the Jimmy Kimmel Live host said Republican lawmakers, “should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.”

The video is YouTube’s number one trending video and has received well over a million views overnight.

Kimmel went on to slam politicians who “won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip,” adding that their “thoughts and your prayers are insufficient.”

He then turned the monologue into an anti-Trump rant, declaring, “There are a lot of things we could do about it. But we don’t, which is interesting because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls, we take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that.”

Breitbart’s Ian Mason debunks most of Kimmel’s claims, almost all of which had nothing to do with the weapons used by killer Stephen Paddock during Sunday night’s massacre.

But for Kimmel, it’s very much a case of do as I say, not do as I do.

A 2015 clip from his show uploaded to YouTube features one of the security guard’s whose job it is to protect Kimmel and his production staff.

When his shirt lifts up for a brief moment, the man is seen to be carrying a Glock pistol in a holster.

In other words – Kimmel is against gun rights, unless it applies to his own personal security.

Recent reports also confirm that Kimmel has beefed up his security due to the increasingly polarized and political nature of his rants.

According to the Mercury News, “Ever since the late-night show host began crusading against the effort by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, there have been “incidents with Trump supporters” that have forced him to increase security at his show tapings.”

In response, “the show has increased personnel at both the front and back entrances. This personnel consists of highly-trained, off-duty police officers.”

Judging by the video clip of the security guard above, these security guards are almost certain to be packing.

Kimmel’s hypocrisy is a reminder of the fact that many liberals rely on men carrying guns to protect them but want to deny that right to the rest of the American people.

Michael Moore, who built part of his career on tearing down the second amendment, admitted in a 2008 Larry King interview that he owns a gun and also relies on armed security.

Organizers say they had a record number of people attend the event on Saturday, Feb. 24, almost 7,000, and expected more Sunday.

The manager for the Florida Gun Show, George Fernandez, says they’ve never seen such a big crowd.

The company canceled the show in Fort Lauderdale next month after the mayor asked them to show respect to the victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting earlier this month.

With the heated debate over gun control staying front and center, Fernandez expressed concerns over proposed gun laws possibly restricting gun owners.

They also tell me they do not support a ban on assault rifles but more laws for mental health. @10NewsWTSP pic.twitter.com/95YGMKGl3E — Shannon Valladolid (@ShannonMarieTV) February 25, 2018

inforwars185,['Kit Daniels'],2018-01-18 12:14:16-06:00,https://www.infowars.com/remember-cias-heart-attack-gun-cnn-predicts-trump-will-die-from-heart-attack/,"CNN keeps predicting Trump will die of a heart attack, which brings to mind the CIA poison dart gun that can trigger one.

Revealed by the Church Committee in 1975, the “heart attack gun” is a modified 1911 that can shoot a dart with a deadly poison that’s nearly undetectable – which is perfect for political assassinations.

“The poison was frozen into some sort of dart and then it was shot at very high speed into the person,” said CIA whistleblower Mary Embree. “When it reached the person it would melt inside them, and there would be a tiny red dot on their body, which was hard to detect.”

“There wouldn’t be a needle or anything like that left in the person.”

Then-CIA Director William Colby confirmed the gun could fire a special dart which “potentially would be able to enter the target without perception,” adding that an autopsy would fail to detect the dart’s poison.

Of course, the heart attack gun is 40-year-old technology, so it’s theoretically possible to now deliver heart attack-inducing toxins to someone without needing a dart.

But for Trump to suddenly die of a heart attack from “natural causes,” the public must be conditioned to believe he was at risk for one.

Conveniently enough, CNN now has this weird obsession with Trump’s “risk” of a heart attack:

According to the American Mirror:

Because of Trump’s calcium score, CNN predicted the president will have a “heart attack or heart disease” in “3-5 years.”

But [CNN medical analyst Sanji] Gupta was more aggressive.

“So the president has heart disease,” he declared.

Yesterday, CNN host Brian Stelter didn’t accept Dr. Ronny Jackson’s findings [Trump’s examiner], either.

Why is the network making an armchair diagnosis that Trump suffers from “heart disease,” despite his recent physical indicating excellent health?

inforwars186,['Mikael Thalen'],2017-12-08 09:58:27-06:00,https://www.infowars.com/watch-researchers-hack-popular-bluetooth-gun-safe/,"Security researchers this week revealed three vulnerabilities that allowed one of the most popular Bluetooth gun safes to be exploited and opened remotely.

In a blog post published Wednesday, researchers with Two Six Labs announced “BlueSteal” – a set of attacks that bypassed the Vaultek VT20i gun safe’s security features.

The Bluetooth-enabled safe, said to be one of the most popular on Amazon, is designed to only allow access to users with the correct pin code or paired cellphone utilizing the company’s application.

The first exploit, detailed in a video published by Two Six Labs, shows how a simple computer script was able to unlock the safe without the attacker knowing the pin code.

The researchers first discovered that unlimited attempts could be made to pair an Android phone to the safe without being rate-limited for giving incorrect pairing codes. Upon finding the code, Two Six Labs was not only able to open the safe from within the app as intended but also found that the same code was used to unlock the safe by hand as well.

In an attempt to see, if once paired, a brute force attack could be made against the safe, the team then crafted a python script that resulted in the safe quickly popping open.

“This vulnerability could have been prevented or mitigated if the application or safe had timeouts for incorrect retries, or enforced some maximum retry limit,” the researchers note.

The second vulnerability exploited the Android app’s failure to use encryption when communicating with the safe. Despite the company claiming to use strong encryption, the team says it was able to simply sniff the pin code out of the air.

“There is no encryption between the Android phone app and the safe,” the researchers added. “The application transmits the safe’s pin code in clear text after successfully pairing.”

Two Six Labs says the company even advertised the use of AES256 bit encryption, despite it being unsupported in the specific type of Bluetooth implemented.

“AES256 bit encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth LE standard and we have not seen evidence of its usage in higher layers. AES-128 is supported in Bluetooth LE, but the manufacturer is not using that either,” the researchers say. “This lack of encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping on the communications between the application and the safe.”

The final vulnerability involved using specifically formatted Bluetooth messages to unlock the safe, also without knowing the pin code. The team found that the safe failed to verify whether the pin code it had been provided was legitimate so long as it came from the Android app.

“The phone application requires the valid pin to operate the safe, and there is a field to supply the pin code in an authorization request,” the blog post notes. “However the safe does not verify the pin code, so an attacker can obtain authorization and unlock the safe using any arbitrary value as the pin code.”

Although such exploits would require an attacker to be within close proximity of the gun safe, Two Six Labs concluded by stating that BlueSteal should serve as a “stark reminder” to companies developing smart products on the importance of security audits.

“In this case an audit before the product came to market would have revealed all of these vulnerabilities, which then could have been fixed in production,” the researchers add. “It is next to impossible for a manufacturer to fix these sorts of issues after sales begin. Thus, care needs to be taken to carefully engineer the security of the platform and its update mechanisms.”

Two Six Labs notes that it waited 60 days to release their findings after informing Vaultek of the issues in October, allowing the manufacturer time to patch the vulnerabilities and release an update to customers.

Vaultek says its update has “improved Bluetooth security with the option for disabling the Bluetooth unlock or the entire connection altogether” and that a “time out feature designed for brute force attacks and additional encryption for the communication between the app and safe” has been added.
