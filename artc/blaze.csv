Here’s what they passed.

The legislation passed 20-18 and included new gun restrictions, but also made allowances for teachers to carry guns on school premises.

The bill places an age restriction of 21 years from 18 on the purchase of rifles, and also implements a waiting period for the same weapons. While gun rights advocates didn’t like that provision, gun control advocates didn’t like that teachers would be allowed to carry guns in schools, even though that part of the bill was weakened for passage.

“Do I think this bill goes far enough? No! No, I don’t!” said Democratic Senator Lauren Book, who advocated for a ban on AR-15 rifles.

“My community was rocked. My school children were murdered in their classrooms,” she said. “I cannot live with a choice to put party politics above an opportunity to get something done that inches us closer to the place I believe we should be as a state. This is the first step in saying never again.”

CBS News listed other provisions in the bill the Florida Senate passed:

In addition to the gun restrictions and arming some school personnel, it would create new mental health programs for schools, improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies, create a task force to look at mistakes made during mass shootings nationally and then make recommendations on how to continue to improve law, and establish an anonymous tip line where students and others can report threats to schools.

The bill now goes to the Florida state House of Representatives for consideration.

Dick’s announced Wednesday it was ending the sale of “assault-style weapons” in all its stores nationwide. In addition, the company said it would end the sale of high-capacity magazines and stop selling long guns to anyone under 21.

What happened?

Palmetto State Armory, which is based in Columbia, South Carolina, issued a statement to WCBD-TV on Thursday condemning Dick’s for its decision, while injecting truth into the conversation about firearms and “assault rifles.”

What the firearms company really took issue with was Dick’s apparent firearms ignorance. The sporting good’s retain chain said it was banning the sale of “assault-style weapons.” In reality, the firearms the company plans to stop selling are AR-15 rifles and other similar firearms, which are not “assault weapons.”

AR-15 rifles and firearms like them are semi-automatic — meaning only one bullet is fired with each pull of the trigger — while actual assault rifles, which are used in the military, are fully-automatic, meaning it will continue to fire with just one depress of the trigger.

Still, Palmetto State said they support Dick’s right via capitalism to make the decision it did. In the end, the company hopes politicians and business leaders can come together in civil discussion to find a solution to America’s gun violence problem.

Whatever your religious beliefs may be, that much is without dispute. In time, humans formed complex societies to take advantage of the benefits of living in groups. With larger populations, it’s easier to hunt, domesticate animals, and farm. As competing groups began fighting with one another over access to resources, including land and animals, it became necessary to form what we think of today as fortified towns and cities, along with armies to wage wars. This, of course, required people appointing rulers and investing them with tremendous amounts of power and wealth. And over time, very few people could call themselves truly free.

It is natural and in keeping with much of human history for people to trade their liberties for security, so it’s quite understandable why so many today are clamoring to bargain away their Second Amendment rights in the hope of preventing another school shooting like the tragic one that recently occurred in Parkland, Florida.

In a post-modern world, where truth is deemed to be subjective and concepts like “right” and wrong” are taboo, it’s not surprising that in a time of crisis, people are running toward those who are promising they can make the horror, death, and devastation go away. People are so thirsty for answers, they’d drink the sand if the all-powerful government told them it was water. And while pundits of all political persuasions, myself included, debate the importance (or dangers, depending on your views) of firearms, the larger, more obvious problem remains curiously out of reach: The reason hundreds of people are being murdered in the streets of Chicago, 17 children were murdered in Parkland, and thousands of others are killed each year (mostly by people who illegally possess guns) is that our souls are desperately corrupt, sick, immoral and, as Christians often say, “fallen.”

It’s not surprising to see non-Christians roll their eyes when such an observation is made. The popular, widely available view in today’s America is that people are generally good, kind, and interested in helping one another, and if greedy, self-serving, gun-toting hicks were to get out of the way of the government, we could finally solve all the world’s problems with universal health care schemes and far-reaching gun bans. Put your faith in the government, they say, and all will be well.

This view makes sense if one believes government is his or her highest authority, but an increasing number of Christians are beginning to put their faith in government, too, always believing we’re just one more law away from a near-perfect society. At best, this is a sign of Christian ignorance. At worst, it’s heresy.

The Bible couldn’t be clearer when it comes to the state of man: “None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one. … Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known.” (Romans 3:10-12, 3:15-17)

Elsewhere, Paul the Apostle refers to humans as “slaves to sin,” and describes in heart-wrenching detail how “nothing good lives” in him, “for I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep on doing the evil I do not want to do. And if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.” (Romans 7:18-20)

Paul’s remedy for a sick, utterly hopeless heart isn’t gun control, taxes, another welfare program, or anything of the kind; it’s faith. Through faith, hearts are born anew, the lame walk and the dead live forever. Or, as Jesus put plainly, “with God, all things are possible.” (Matthew 19:26)

If you think Christianity is rubbish, then all this sounds like utter nonsense. But if your heart has been transformed by the power of God, then there’s no excuse for believing man can solve the ills of the world apart from God, because God has plainly said it’s impossible.

I don’t think it’s an accident that the birth of the American nation followed shortly after the Great Awakening of the early to mid-18th century. It was then that pastors such as George Whitefield traveled some 5,000 miles preaching on more than 350 occasions to crowds of thousands about the necessity of God and humans’ broken nature. Some estimate Whitefield delivered his message to almost one-quarter of all Americans in less than two years.

Following such a massive revival, the colonists were readier than ever to tell the monarchs of Europe that a free, independent, and Godly people don’t need a centralized authority to keep them safe or to solve their problems. In fact, they would have been better equipped than ever to make the case that no authority save God alone could achieve such a feat.

Contrast that generation with our own. Without God, who can we turn to for “salvation,” the definition of which shifts from day to day, hour to hour? No one except the only authority in our lives powerful enough to promise peace: government.

The more I study history, the more convinced I’ve become that there is no long-term hope for freedom in a Godless country. In the end, people will always choose to trade away their liberty for the illusion of security. How quickly we’d drink the sand for the momentary peace that comes with believing that, despite all reason, it might quench our thirst.

We don’t need government to stop mass shootings. We don’t need Democrats or Republicans. We don’t need bump-stock bans or age restrictions. How completely foolish we are for believing people like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer or even Donald Trump can fix what the Scriptures say are a fundamentally spiritual problem.

No, we don’t need more government. We need new hearts. We need a new Great Awakening. We need God."
blaze3,blaze,"['Chris Enloe', 'Weekend Editor']",2018-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/03/new-analysis-on-gun-control-shows-increased-gun-restrictions-have-very-minimal-desirable-effects,"A new analysis of thousands of gun control studies found that firearm restrictions had minimal, in any, effects on decreasing violent crime, homicides, suicides and unintentional deaths.

Democrats routinely argue that strict gun control regulations would lower rates of gun violence.

What did the study find?

The RAND corporation, which conducted the extensive study, found that only 63 percent of gun control studies testing specific firearm restrictions found a desirable outcome, such as reductions in homicides, suicides and other violent crime.

RAND analyzed thousands of gun control studies over the course of two years and spent more than $1 million on the study. They sought to determine how gun policies “affect outcomes, such as suicide rates and hunting participation” — and the results couldn’t have been more unequivocal.

“Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn’t find any evidence,” Andrew Morral, a behavioral scantiest who lead the study, told NPR.

For example, the analysis found that policies targeting mass shootings, hunting and recreation, defensive gun use and officer-involved shootings were “inconclusive, at best.”

Meanwhile, the study found relatively strong evidence that “child-access prevention laws” — such as laws that force gun owners to store firearms under lock and key in a household with minors — likely decreased suicides, unintentional deaths and violent crime. In addition, the study found relatively minor evidence to correlate stand-your-ground and concealed carry laws with increased deaths and violent crime.

In addition to analyzing thousands of studies, RAND interviewed 95 firearm policy experts, both Republican and Democratic. In general, the experts agreed that reducing suicides, homicides and deaths should be the primary factor when considering gun restrictions, while privacy concerns, preventing mass shootings and recreational use are secondary.

Morral said the expert reaction was a surprise.

“I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values — or that it’s a values problem, in any case. But that’s not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order,” he told NPR. “Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts. And the facts are sparse.”

Are increased firearm restrictions on the horizon?

Maybe. In the wake of the Parkland school shooting, millions are rallying for tighter restrictions on firearms, arguing more restrictions will thwart the next mass shooting.

And while the science proves that isn’t true, some restrictions, such as a bump-stock ban or raising the minimum age for long gun purchases, seem almost inevitable."
blaze4,blaze,"['Sarah Taylor', 'Staff Writer']",2018-03-05 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/05/membership-interest-in-gun-rights-groups-soar-in-the-weeks-after-the-florida-high-school-shooting,"Membership, as well as interest in learning information about joining gun organizations — such as the National Rifle Association and other grassroots organizations — has increased dramatically in the weeks after the deadly Parkland, Florida school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

What are the details?

According a Friday Time article, many pro-gun and pro-Second Amendment groups saw surges in membership in and interest after the school shooting, which left at least 17 dead and injured many more.

Patrick Parsons, head of Georgia Gun Owners — which is a local independent gun rights org — said, “As soon as anti-gun attacks started coming in on Twitter, Facebook, and in the media, we began to hear from people who didn’t even own guns who wanted to join up or contribute out of solidarity in defense of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.”

Parsons told Time that the group’s membership — which hovered around 13,000 — gained 1,000 new members in just two weeks following the deadly shooting.

Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights, said that the association, which reportedly has over 4 million members and supporters, may have grown over 30 percent over the last week alone.

The outlet also reported that the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, an org which boasts a membership of approximately 29,000, received nearly 200 applications in the last seven days. According to Time, this is atypical, as the Connecticut Citizens Defense League generally receives approximately 15-20 applications for week.

What else?

Cleta Mitchell, a former Oklahoma state lawmaker who was on the NRA’s board from 2002 to 2013, addressed the companies who opted to sever ties with the NRA following the Florida school shooting in an email to Time.

“There is no one. NO ONE. Who joins the NRA for a discount on a rental car,” Mitchell told Time. “You can rest assured that the NRA will not lose a single member as a result of this.”

“If anything,” she added, “it should spur people to join the NRA as a means of demonstrating that we who believe in the Second Amendment will not be bullied by these left wing multi-billion dollar corporations.”

The Daily Mail on Sunday also reported that despite calls from both Democrats and Republicans to tighten gun laws, as well as the many boycotts of the NRA, searches for NRA membership on the Internet increased dramatically since the shooting.

According to the outlet, the search term “NRA memberships” is reportedly up 4,900 percent since Feb. 14, the day of the Marjory Stoneman shooting.

The NRA has at least 5 million members, but has yet to release any current membership numbers at the time of this writing.

TheBlaze reached out to the NRA for comment on whether they, too, received a large uptick in memberships in the weeks following the deadly school shooting, but the organization did not immediately return a request for comment."

Most Americans blame the shooting on failures by the local, state and federal governments, according to a Rasmussen Reports study. The study was done in response to the Valentine’s Day shooting that left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Fifty-four percent of Americans surveyed believe the shooting could have been avoided if government agencies responded to reports of warning signs from the killer. Additionally, 33 percent blamed a lack of adequate gun control and 11 percent cited other factors, according to the survey.

On the issue of gun control, 41 percent of those surveyed said stricter gun control laws would be the most effective approach to reduce mass murders. Just as many — 40 percent — said treating mental health issues would be the most effective approach.

What about Republicans vs. Democrats?

Results were also broken down along party lines. The survey showed Republicans were more likely than Democrats to blame the government.

Seventy-five percent of Republicans and 55 percent of adults not affiliated with either major political party believe that government failure is more likely to have led to the shooting than not enough gun control.

In contrast, just 36 percent of Democrats said the government is culpable. Fifty percent of Democrats said insufficient gun control is the primary problem.

What did parents say?

Interestingly, 61 percent of parents with school-age children believe the government is more responsible for the shooting than guns. Just 23 percent blamed a lack of adequate gun control.

Of those surveyed, 90 percent said they have been watching news reports about the Florida shooting “somewhat closely,” while 53 percent reported watching the reports “very closely.”

Other findings:

Thirty-two percent believe FBI Director Christopher Wray should resign or be fired because the agency failed to pursue tips prior to the shooter opening fire at the school.

Middle-aged voters are the most likely to view the government as more to blame.

That is also true of married adults and those with children in the home, compared to those who are not married and have no children living with them.

Only 26 percent said the federal government can be trusted to do the right thing at least most of the time.

Rasmussen Reports conducted the survey of 1,000 American adults on Feb. 25 through 26. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points, along with a 95 percent level of confidence, the firm stated. The study was completed via national telephone and online surveys."
blaze6,blaze,['Justin Haskins'],2018-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/26/commentary-on-gun-control-trump-sounds-more-like-obama-every-day,"In the wake of the tragic school shooting in Florida, President Donald Trump met with victims of school shootings and their family members. To say the “listening session” was emotional and captivating is a gross understatement. Something clearly has to be done about school shootings and gun violence in general, but the question of what policy provisions will help to solve these problems remains a serious and important point of contention.

Pro-liberty conservatives have long argued heaping additional regulations on legal gun owners, who, statistically speaking, very rarely harm other people, is a violation of their liberty and Second Amendment rights. Liberals, never letting a good crisis go to waste, have called for many weapons to be banned, enhanced background checks, and other gun-limiting provisions, which they say are necessary to keep people from harm. Many moderates fall somewhere in the middle.

Perhaps the most interesting and disturbing — at least, from the perspective of someone who supports gun rights — development in the debate is President Trump’s sudden transformation from being a defender of the Second Amendment to calling for harsh restrictions reminiscent of past policy proposals by former President Barack Obama, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and other left-wing politicians. On Feb. 22, Trump tweeted, “I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue — I hope!”

Coming from a Republican president who received significant backing from the National Rifle Association, this is truly remarkable and shocking — especially when one considers that Obama called for some of these same restrictions in the past. In other cases, not even Obama was willing to go as far as Trump is suggesting now.

Comprehensive background checks

Let’s begin with “Comprehensive Background Checks, with an emphasis on Mental Health.” Although Trump didn’t elaborate on exactly what constitutes a “Comprehensive Background Check,” gun advocacy groups have argued for decades such a program would present grave risks to gun owners.

For starters, who decides what factors will make someone ineligible to own a weapon? Obviously, we don’t want people who are truly mentally deranged to purchase weapons, but when Democrats inevitably come into power again, what would stop them from establishing far-reaching “risk factors” that make it exceptionally difficult to purchase a firearm? Or making the background-check system so burdensome and expensive that most Americans won’t have the time or money to fulfill every requirement?

And what “Mental Health” problems would prohibit a person from purchasing a gun? If someone sees a psychiatrist once in his or her life, would that be enough to prevent the purchase of a weapon? If an individual suffered from depression a decade ago, would that prevent him or her from passing a background check?

Many women who have been victims of sexual assault or domestic violence buy guns to protect themselves, but many of them have also had to seek help from mental health care providers because of the trauma they have endured. Would they be able to purchase a gun? What about soldiers returning home from war, many of whom see mental health specialists to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder?

It’s worth remembering that in 2016 President Obama called for expanding background checks, a move congressional Republicans vigorously opposed. Now that a Republican president is seeking to undermine gun owners’ rights, will Congress suddenly change its tune?

Background checks are important for helping to prevent future gun-related violence, but a federal background check system could easily be politicized and abused. It would be far too easy for future left-wing Congresses or bureaucratic agencies to implement regulations that would make background checks a tool for effectively eliminating Second Amendment rights. For that reason alone, Trump’s proposal should be rejected.

A much better model would be for states to voluntarily share background information with one another, creating a state-controlled network that could be used by gun shops when selling weapons.

Raising the age limit to 21

Now consider Trump’s call to raise the limit for purchasing a weapon to 21 years old. (Trump would later clarify that his ban would only apply to certain kinds of rifles.) This outrageous proposal seeks to tell American adults, who are guaranteed the “right to bear arms,” that they can’t buy many kinds of weapons until they are 21. How can this be construed in any other way than an infringement on their inalienable right to purchase a weapon? This is an overtly unconstitutional act — unless we are to understand that citizens under the age of 21 are not adults. And if that’s the case, then there is a rather large list of other activities we allow 20-year-olds to engage in because they are treated as adults.

For instance, under Trump’s proposal, American citizens would be able to vote, consume tobacco, amass huge amounts of debt, be tried as an adult in criminal courts, purchase a home, serve in war, or get married years before they could buy many kinds of weapons. This is totally absurd. Trump’s plan would mean some Americans could buy a home but not be able to protect it. Similarly, a person could vote for candidates in elections who have the power to send the country to war and destroy the world with nuclear weapons but not be deemed responsible enough to own a gun. A person could kill terrorists in Afghanistan with high-grade assault weapons, but not own a less powerful rifle at home.

As far as I can tell, Obama never called for increasing the legal age limit required to purchase semi-automatic weapons, or any other guns, for that matter. His administration did, however, defend in court existing federal law that prohibits gun shops from selling handguns to citizens under the age of 21.

Bump stocks

President Trump also called for a ban on the sale of bump stocks, a gun add-on that helps shooters fire weapons more rapidly. While a reasonable argument could be made that bump stocks effectively turn some weapons into machine guns, which are illegal in most circumstances, and thus should be banned, there is virtually no evidence at all that bump stocks are causing significant problems in the United States. This is a solution in search of a problem. And, most importantly, the logic used to ban bump stocks is virtually the same logic one could use to ban any semi-automatic weapon, or weapons in general: They’re too dangerous.

Interestingly, the Obama administration actually approved the sale of bump stocks, which means if Trump’s bump stock ban is implemented, it would go even further than the Obama administration did on this issue.

Yes, guns can be dangerous, but so are many other activities. There are more than 88,000 alcohol-related deaths every year, and alcohol doesn’t save any lives at all, making it far more dangerous than guns. More than 2.6 million Americans are killed, injured, or disabled from road crashes annually, including 8,000 Americans aged 16 to 20. Should we change the driving limit to 21 as well?

The solution

The answer to our mass shooting problem isn’t to punish gun owners who are following the law and forcing Americans everywhere to hide in locked classrooms, completely unprotected, in the hopes that law enforcement will soon arrive and do its job properly. The solution is to empower citizens to have greater access to guns so that they can defend themselves when law enforcement is present or refuses to act as it should, which is precisely what happened recently in Florida.

Some argue arming citizens is dangerous and that it won’t save any lives, but the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming. As I noted in an article in November, “Some researchers estimate there are more than 2 million defensive gun uses in the United States every year. On the lowest end of the spectrum, the National Crime Victimization Survey claims there are more than 67,000 instances in which guns are used to defend life or property annually.”

This means at the very least, tens of thousands of people (or their property) are defended every single year. Why not add public schools to the list?"

Democrats mostly argue for increased gun control measures, while Second Amendment advocates mostly oppose any new restrictions.

The debate usually dies quickly after a shooting, but it has remained strong over the last week. Now, even President Donald Trump is reportedly considering new restrictions on firearms.

No. 1: Raising the purchase age for certain firearms

Axios reported Wednesday that Trump has privately discussed supporting a measure that would raise the purchase age for semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21.

Currently, any 18-year-old who is lawfully able to purchase and possess a firearm can purchase a rifle or shotgun, including the controversial AR-15. Federal law requires a citizen to be 21 before purchasing a handgun.

According to the Washington Post, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Tuesday the option is “on the table for us to discuss.”

What’s not clear is if Trump would advocate for new age restrictions at the federal level or if he would encourage state legislators to make the change.

No. 2: Increased background checks

On Tuesday, Trump tweeted his support for “strengthening” the background check system.

Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2018

Currently, federal law stipulates that any person purchasing a weapon from a federally licensed firearms dealer must have their background checked through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which takes just minutes. The system merely checks a person’s legal eligibility to purchase a firearm and no mental health evaluation occurs.

However, for private transactions in most states, which are a small share of all gun sales, no background check is required for long guns or handguns. Still, many states like North Carolina require a pistol permit or concealed carry license for private handgun transactions.

It’s not clear what improvements would be made to the NICS system.

No. 3: Ban bump stocks

A bump stock is an inexpensive device that helps a shooter fire a standard semi-automatic rifle more rapidly, which makes the firearm behave more like a fully-automatic weapon. A bump stock was reportedly used in the Las Vegas massacre last year. The devices don’t actually make semi-automatic rifles fully-automatic, but they use recoil to increase the rate at which the trigger is pulled.

Trump said at the White House on Tuesday that he has instructed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pursue legislation that outlaws the devices.

“We cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make a difference,” Trump said, according to the New York Times.

Why is this time different?

America has seen more than a dozen tragic mass shootings over the last few years and little has been done to prevent the next one. But this time appears to be different.

Most people are split over what to actually do and whether or not increased gun restrictions would prevent the next mass shooting remains to be seen. But the difference this time appears to lie with the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, who have been very outspoken about the need for gun control since the shooting.

Their dialogue has even sparked a CNN town hall, which will include the Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch.

Even Trump, seems to agree with the kids’ sentiment. “We have to do something. We’ve got kids dying,” he reportedly said during a private meeting on guns, according to Axios."

blaze10,blaze,"['Beth Baumann', 'Being A Law-Abiding Gun Owner In California Is Nothing Shy Of A Nightmare.', 'Want A New Firearm', 'You Can Pay For It', 'Pass The Background Check In A Day But You Have To Wait Days To']",2016-03-28 11:49:44-04:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/here-is-some-good-news-for-california-gun-owners,"Being a law-abiding gun owner in California is nothing shy of a nightmare.

Want a new firearm? You can pay for it and pass the background check in a day but you have to wait 10 days to physically obtain the weapon. Looking at a new pistol? Better make sure it has a safety on it, otherwise it isn’t “California legal.”

California Assemblywoman Shannon Grove (R-Bakersfield) recently introduced AB 2229, which would allow law-abiding citizens with a concealed carry permit, a valid certificate of eligibility or those who already own a registered firearm to pick up their newly purchased gun without having to wait the customary 10 days. Currently, the only time a firearm does not have to go through the 10-day waiting period is if the firearm is being transferred from one family member to another, like when my dad transferred a pistol to me.

And yes, even the private sale of a firearm requires a 10-day waiting period. As it is, most private sales have to be completed at a gun store. The paperwork is filled out at the gun store and the store holds onto the firearm for the 10-day period before the new owner is able to possess it. It doesn’t matter if they already own and operate a firearm or if they have a concealed carry weapons permit. They are treated as though they have never purchased a firearm before.

According to the Firearms Policy Coalition, “AB 2229 stems from a decision made by the U.S. District Court in Silvester v. Harris, a case litigated by The Calguns Foundation.” The case was heard in Fresno in late 2011, where the plaintiff claimed – and successfully argued – the 10-day waiting period violates the Second Amendment. Although the State of California acknowledges this, they continue to deny law-abiding citizens their Constitutionally protected rights by demanding they wait the 10 days.

Assemblywoman Grove’s proposed legislation, if passed, would be a huge victory for gun owners across the nation.

If California, one of the strictest states on gun possession and concealed carry, passed AB 2229, it would mean other states would have to reevaluate their stance on firearms. If those states with strict gun laws fail to reevaluate their take on the Second Amendment, chances are, gun owners – and the National Rifle Association – will challenge them in a court of law. By precedent, gun owners would win.

Although gun control advocates will argue the 10-day waiting period makes little difference in the grand scheme of things, their attitude is misguided. Think about it. Yes, the 10-day waiting period makes sense if you’re purchasing a firearm for the first time. You should be heavily vetted. You should undergo scrutiny because a weapon has the power to harm and even kill someone. You shouldn’t have to undergo the same stipulation time and time again if you already possess a firearm and have a clean background.

Assemblywoman Grove’s proposed legislation makes sense from a logical point of view. Why should we, the law-abiding citizen, have to jump through hoops? It has been statistically proven that those who break the law, especially gun laws, are criminals. If they want to possess a weapon, they’re going to find a way to get their hands on one. Chances are, they aren’t going through the legal channels to obtain the weapon. Why place scrutiny on the average person instead of the criminal?

It’s refreshing to know a legislator from my home state is working to protect the rights of its citizens, although those rights are Constitutionally guaranteed. I truly hope this piece of legislation makes its way through the legislative process without being squashed by gun control advocates.

blaze11,blaze,"['Chris Enloe', 'Weekend Editor']",2017-10-08 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/08/watch-firearms-instructor-destroys-gun-control-narrative-and-proves-why-leftists-are-wrong,"Just as quickly as news broke last week of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, Democrats, progressives and those opposed to the Second Amendment were talking gun control.

The debate rages after any publicized gun crime, and almost always circles back to two talking points. Gun control advocates say people shouldn’t be able to have “military-grade” weapons, while Second Amendment supporters say a gun didn’t kill the victims — a person did.

One Illinois firearms instructor sought to prove his point in a video that’s now gone viral. That instructor, Mike Brown, also a former criminal justice professor in Chicago, in just four minutes completely dismantles the theory that guns should be banned or heavily restricted because someone uses them to commit mass murder.

Brown placed two handguns — one semi-automatic and one revolver — and a Sig MPX, which is technically a pistol, but he had the stock pulled back for shoulder use, in front of him on a table, loaded each gun, chambered a bullet and then he waited.

“Here you have all three loaded firearms … here we go,” he says in the video. For the next 10 seconds, Brown stares at the firearms and looks back at the camera several times, then he shakes his head because the guns didn’t fire.

“Maybe if we try the drill instructor approach, maybe we might get a different outcome,” he says next, before yelling at the firearms like a Marine Corps drill instructor screams at new recruits. However, the guns still didn’t fire.

Finally, Brown tried the “humoristic approach,” where he whispered to the firearms and instructed them to discharge. Still, the firearms didn’t discharge any rounds.

He ended the video with a short monologue:"
blaze12,blaze,['Cole Ellenbogen'],2014-06-25 10:00:53-04:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/scouts-in-control-youth-and-firearm-safety,"A group of Boy Scouts was rescued early Father’s Day from a Canyon in Arizona, largely because they were prepared with all the necessary supplies and survival training.

As an Eagle Scout, this success story makes me proud of my brothers in scouting who were able to save others– and themselves– by using skills learned from the Boy Scouts.

But I’m not surprised. The Boy Scouts of America estimates that one in every 100 scouts will use his training to save his own life– and another one in 100 to save someone else’s. There have been over 100 million scouts since the program started here in the United States in 1910, so that’s two million lives saved because of Boy Scout training.

But this training goes beyond first aid and emergency preparedness. The BSA also offers and encourages firearm safety training.

When I was 12, I took up rifle shooting under the close supervision of a BSA shooting sports instructor. Before I even saw a gun for the first time, I went through rigorous safety training. I learned to always point the gun down-range and never at another person. Before I even pulled the trigger, I ha” a healthy respect for how powerful a rifle was and knew how to use it safely.

According to his classmates, the young gunman in the recent Reynolds High School shooting in Oregon was obsessed with firearms. Though what this young man did was unfathomable to many, it does not make him a “right wing extremist,” or “pro-gun radical.” This kind of unhealthy behavior comes from lackof proper exposure to firearms, not the respectful use of them.

While there are exceptions to every rule, learning about shooting sports didn’t cause my brothers in scouting and me to obsess over guns, quite the opposite: The more I practiced with a rifle in a responsible environment, the less fascinating the rifle itself became. To a safety-conscious marksman, a firearm is no more unusual or frightening than a kitchen knife or a drill, which are all useful tools that can hurt you if you use them improperly.

By training young men in gun safety, the BSA isn’t doing anything radical either; young students had been educated about gun use for decades up until the mid 1970’s. It wasn’t uncommon for high schools to have gun clubs, with shooting teams often meeting — and practicing — on school property.

During this time, in New York City, students rode the subway with rifles slung across their backs, leaving their firearms in their lockers once they arrived at school. New York State hosted a statewide annual riflery championship for the 80 or so school districts that had competitive rifle teams.

Yet regular student firearm use did not lead to increased gun violence. In the entire decade of the 1960’s, when shooting sports for young men and women reached their height of popularity, there were but 17 total school gun-related incidents. Three of those incidents were accidents, and another entailed police firing on student protestors. That’s 17 out of every school and university in America, over the span of 10 years. Compare that to 31 gun-related incidents in the first six months of 2014.

Statistically, schools were actually safer when there were more guns around. Again, I’m not surprised because after the BSA safety training, pointing a firearm at another person is almost unthinkable to me. That’s exactly the state of mind that you want to instill in young men and women, and the Boy Scouts are one of the few groups that have maintained their high standards of gun safety and education.

And education is key, because guns aren’t going anywhere. Even if there were an outright ban, firearms would still be smuggled into the country, of course, by those who want to make money and those who care little about gun safety — or the law, for that matter.

Just look at the United Kingdom, which enforces a near total ban on guns: there are still gun related deaths in the country, meaning that people are ignoring the laws and or smuggling guns through the UK’s easily enforceable borders. If smugglers can get across the English Channel, then they can certainly get across our border.

For more than 40 years, we’ve been trying to reduce gun violence by regulating firearms sales and ownership, yet gun-related incidents have not declined. Is it so extreme to suggest, then, that regulation isn’t working? Treating guns as taboo objects only piques the interest of the kind of person considering violence against their peers. That’s exactly what we should be trying to avoid. Schools had the right idea with gun clubs, because they treated guns like another piece of equipment that you use with caution.

Alas, I seriously doubt that high school gun clubs and shooting sports teams will ever regain popularity, let alone public approval. But it is important for us to recognize that those groups actually did a huge public service by educating young Americans about gun safety, something the BSA did from the outset. That’s why it’s even more important that we support the efforts of groups like the BSA who continue to do so.

I admit, my situation is rare: The first time I was ever exposed to guns was in a safe, realistic setting. I shot a rifle before I even played a video game involving shooting. That’s exactly my point: BSA style rifle training should be encouraged, because it promotes a safe attitude, and a stable mindset.

It’s not about legislation controlling our guns; it’s about us learning to control ourselves.

… and this?

One is a clip and one is a magazine. Yes, they are different, non-interchangeable terms. Although, do a quick search of recent news covering the gun control debate and you’ll see how often the term “clip” specifically is used incorrectly. Like here, here and here just to point out a few instances.

TheBlaze spoke with Brandon Webb, the president of SOFREP media and a former Navy SEAL, about the difference between these two firearm components and why it’s important to be clear with your terminology.

“It’s common for people to get the two mixed up,” Webb said. “If you hear someone talking about clips … you know they don’t know the difference.

“No one uses clips anymore.”

A clip describes cartridges held together with a strip until they are loaded into a firearm.

A magazine on the other hand is is a container that holds the cartridges. Sometimes magazines themselves are loaded with cartridges by clips. On most firearms a magazine is detachable and replaceable.

Or as Jan Libourel for Montgomery Citizens for a Safer Maryland explained in the “Handgunner’s Glossary“:

A [clip is a] device for holding cartridges together, usually to facilitate loading. Widely used as a synonym for “magazine” (although most firearm authorities consider this substandard usage). Technically, a magazine has a feeding spring, a clip does not.

This video is also very helpful showing off clips vs. magazines (and showing how magazines can be loaded by clips or a firearm directly loaded by a clip:

Even with the subtle differences though, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a clip as “a device to hold cartridges for charging the magazines of some rifles” and “also : a magazine from which ammunition is fed into the chamber of a firearm.”

Still, Webb said it is like comparing apples to oranges. Although most people would know what you’re talking about if you use the term interchangeably, as this YouTube user put it,”many will judge you as someone who doesn’t know much about firearms if you call them ‘clips.'”

As Webb said, “if you are going to talk about guns, let’s know what we’re talking about.”

blaze17,blaze,"['Sarah Taylor', 'Staff Writer']",2018-01-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/01/03/pennsylvania-state-police-urge-gun-owners-to-give-up-firearms-to-get-medical-marijuana,"If you’re a gun-owning Pennsylvania resident, the Pennsylvania State Police are urging you to turn in your firearms if you are seeking medical marijuana cards.

Sorry, what?

A statement from the Pennsylvania State Police’s website is receiving a lot of local attention over what appears to be an erroneous statement concerning state and federal law.

The statement reads:

“It is unlawful for you to keep possession of any firearms which you owned or had in your possession prior to obtaining a medical marijuana card, and you should consult an attorney about the best way to dispose of your firearms.”

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, state police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski suggested seeking legal counsel if a citizen possesses firearms before seeking and receiving medical marijuana.

“It’s unlawful to keep possession of firearms obtained prior to registering,” Tarkowski said.

“The Pennsylvania State Police is not in the business of offering legal advice, but it might be a good idea to contact an attorney about how best to dispose of their firearms,” Tarkowski suggested.

Criminal defense attorney Patrick Nightingale told KDKA-TV on Monday that the suggestions being pushed by the state police disturb him.

“It disturbs me greatly to see the Pennsylvania State Police put on their website references to federal law while ignoring the fact that it is legal under Pennsylvania law,” Nightingale said.

“Firearms are woven into the fabric of our country,” Nightingale added. “It’s the second most important right in the Bill of Rights.”

Here’s the catch

According to Pennsylvania state law, the use of medical marijuana is legal, and not a hindrance to owning a firearm. However, according to the state police website, Pennsylvania’s legalization of medical marijuana is not federally recognized.

According to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) and 27 C.F.R. § 478.32(a)(3), possession of a medical marijuana card and the use of medical marijuana determines that a citizen is an “unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.”

Federal law prohibits an “unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance” from purchasing, acquiring, or possessing a firearm.

In short, federal law says it is illegal for a citizen to attempt the purchase of a firearm if they are a medical marijuana cardholder.

This isn’t new information: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has held the position since 2011 that no one in possession of a medical marijuana card may also legally own a firearm.

Generally speaking, state police cannot enforce federal law unless a statute gives them express permission to do so. Pennsylvania law is somewhat ambiguous on this point, allowing the PSP make arrests “for all violations of the law,” without specifying whether this includes federal law.

If marijuana is considered a controlled substance — much like opioids — then one might wonder why are opioid users permitted to own firearms.

Attorney Andrew Sacks, co-chair of the Pennsylvania Bar Association’s Medical Marijuana and Hemp Law Committee, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette the same thing.

“It’s hypocritical,” Sacks said. “You can be an opioid addict, or buy a bottle of rum, drink it and go to a store and buy one. But a person who is registered as a medical marijuana patient in Pennsylvania, and has a very small dosage of THC, can’t own a gun to protect themselves or hunt.”"
blaze18,blaze,['Oliver Darcy'],2013-09-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/09/17/this-is-why-most-military-personnel-are-disarmed-on-military-bases-and-its-not-clintons-fault,"Monday’s deadly shooting at the Washington Navy Yard has renewed interest in why most military personnel are forbidden from carrying firearms on military bases. In the aftermath, some have pointed fingers at former President Bill Clinton, but is he really to blame?

Not according to what we found.

The question of why military members aren’t armed on base garnered attention back in November 2009 when Army Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire at Ft. Hood and killed 13 people. He was sentenced to death on August 28. Now, nearly four years later, many are asking the same question.

So what’s the answer? It appears this “gun-free zone” type policy can actually be traced back to Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5210.56, signed into effect in February 1992 by Donald J. Atwood, deputy secretary of defense under President George H.W. Bush.

The controversial directive states that “it is DoD Policy” to “limit and control the carrying of firearms by DoD military and civilian personnel.”

“The authorization to carry firearms shall be issued only to qualified personnel when there is a reasonable expectation that life or DoD assets will be jeopardized if firearms are not carried,” it says.

The policy, however, adds, “DoD personnel regularly engaged in law enforcement or security duties shall be armed.” A former member of the Air Force, with experience in base security, thus, told the Washington Post that he would guess there were “no more than a couple of dozen weapons on the Navy Yard.”

It appears DoD Directive 5210.56 was reissued in April 2011 by Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III.

Some outlets are citing Army Regulation 190-14, a policy implemented in 1993 that changed policy regarding carrying firearms on the Army’s military bases, to cast blame on Clinton.

However, that policy specifically notes part of its purpose is aimed at implementing “applicable portions of Department of Defense Directive 5210.56,” which, as previously stated, was put into effect by Bush Sr.’s deputy secretary of defense:

Further, DoD spokesman Mark Wright told TheBlaze Army Regulation 190-14 would not apply to other bases under different branches of the military, including the site of Monday’s shooting, Washington Navy Yard.

“No, it would not apply,” he said Tuesday afternoon.

Steven Bucci, a military expert for The Heritage Foundation who served 28 years in the Army and retired in 2005 with the rank of colonel, also told TheBlaze Tuesday afternoon that Clinton is not to blame.

“I think you are barking up the wrong tree if you are looking to put blame on someone for disarming the military,” said Bucci, when asked if Clinton was responsible. “I think that’s kind of a bogus story.”

“We have never had our soldiers walking around with weapons all the time, other than in combat zones,” he added, noting only Military Police have had that authority.

TheBlaze reached out to members of both the Senate and House Armed Services Committee to see if the policy will be revisited in light of Monday’s shooting. At the time of publication, no one was available for comment.

“We’re looking up different guns,” said Khloe. “Different what?” replied Kim.

“Different guns. She [Kendall] just feels like really unsafe. Like, she says she has like literally a different stalker outside of her house every few days. And like, she’s a single girl who lives alone and she just wants a way — like someone’s already broken into her home and what if she was there …” asserted Khloe.

—

In making its case that the popular AR-15 is a “common element in mass shootings,” the New York Times, citing the owner of a gun engineering company, reported the semi-automatic rifle can fire eight rounds per second.

Because the rifle is semi-automatic, meaning each round requires a single pull of the trigger, the claim was immediately called into question. The claim was attributed to Sam Andrews, the owner of Tier One Weapons Systems.

A message left seeking clarification from Andrews was not immediately returned.

“The reason it’s so popular…is that if you bring a handgun to a fight where there’s an AR-15 you’re going to lose. And it doesn’t matter if you’re a 240-pound man like me or a 90-pound girl,” Andrews said, according to the Times.

Olympian shooter Amanda Furrer estimated she could only fire at a rate of roughly three rounds per second with “any accuracy” — and she shoots guns for a living.

She told TheBlaze she has “never seen” any shooter fire at a rate of 8 rounds per second.

When we asked Casey Betzold, president of Snake River Shooting Products, to respond to the assertion an AR-15 can fire eight rounds per second, he responded “Yeah… it doesn’t.”

“Not even with Jerry Miculek finger speed,” he added.

He’s right about that.

As Business Insider’s Oliver Darcy, who was first to fact-check the claim, pointed out, famous competition shooter Jerry Miculek Jr. was only about to fire off five rounds in one second using the AR-15 — and he’s considered by many to be the world’s fastest shooter.

Kuntzman claimed he wanted to “better understand the firepower of military-style assault weapons and, hopefully, explain their appeal to gun lovers” in the aftermath of the deadly Orlando terrorist attack that left 49 people dead and dozens injured.

The writer recalled shooting the popular firearm being “horrifying, menacing and very very loud.”

Kuntzman said he has shot “pistols” before, but he was horrified of the AR-15’s “explosion of firepower,” which he called “humbling and deafening (even with ear protection).”

“The recoil bruised my shoulder,” he added. “The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary case of PTSD. For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.”

Watch below:

Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old terrorist who opened fire at a popular gay nightclub in Orlando, didn’t use an AR-15 in the shooting, despite what has been widely reported. Police said Mateen used a different semi-automatic rifle, a Sig Sauer MCX carbine.

Reactions to the video, uploaded on Dec. 10, so far have run the gamut, with some supporting the activist and others criticizing him due to the perceived spike in threats to police officers recently.

The men behind the JacksonCopBlock and TacticalPatriot YouTube channels are apparently seen entering the Jackson Police Department with intentions of interacting with law enforcement. One of the men is seen openly carrying an AR-15 rifle and wearing an apparent bulletproof vest with “Jackson Cop Block” printed on the back.

“I’d like to file a FOIA request,” one of the men says in the video.

A woman at the front desk is seen asking the men where they came from, suggesting police had received calls about individuals carrying rifles. She appeared to want to determine if the calls were about them so officers weren’t dispatched for no reason.

The man behind the camera refused to reveal his previous location, telling her, “We came from our place of origin to here.”

Police officials informed the men that the FOIA office would not open until 12:30 in the afternoon. So, the activists left and planned to return then. Watch part one of the video:

After looking for some “witnesses” to the police-involved shooting of the pit bull, the men returned to the police station to file a FOIA request.

An officer is seen on video asking one of the men, “I don’t know who you are — do you have ID on you, sir?”

“I don’t answer questions,” he is heard responding.

After an officer snaps a photo of them the activists then travel upstairs to the FOIA office and file their request without incident. Officers did not attempt to detain or disarm either of the men, according to what’s seen in the video footage.

Due to the content of the video, one would assume the FOIA request had to do with the shooting of the dog. Watch part two of the video below:

You can read some of the reactions to the video in the video’s comments section here.

The Nov. 28 police-involved shooting of the pit bull by Jackson police is currently under investigation, MLive.com reports.

Jackson Police Lt. Christopher Simpson said two officers “found themselves inside an apartment” during their search for a suspect and a dog “aggressively” approached them, causing them to open fire and kill the animal. The officers will remain on active duty during the investigation, he added.

Note: We’ve updated the city to reflect that the incident occurred in Jackson, Michigan."
blaze24,blaze,['Becket Adams'],2013-06-24 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/06/24/the-reason-you-may-regret-having-bought-that-ar-15-earlier-this-year,"Gun enthusiasts who rushed to purchase AR-15s at the height of Congress’s recent debate over gun control may soon regret having spent so much money.

It appears that the market for the popular rifle has bottomed out.

The average price of an AR-15 has in recent weeks returned to the $800-$1,050 range, down from its all-time high of $2,500 (averaged), according to the gun blog The Truth About Guns.

“After the gun control scare earlier this year, demand for AR-15 rifles went through the roof. People were maxing out their credit cards on fears that America’s favorite firearm was about to be banned by the powers that be,” writes Nick Leghorn, the testing and reviews editor for the blog.

“This cleared the entire available stock of guns, and made manufacturers ramp up to meet demand.

“It was good times for manufacturers, but now the AR-15 bubble has burst and things are looking downright depressing for manufacturers,” he adds.

And it appears the supply of AR-15s, once feared by many to have run dry, is flowing again. Below is a photo Leghorn snapped recently while in a Cabela’s sporting goods store:

“By now, everyone who ‘needed’ an AR-15 has found one. Even if they emptied their bank accounts to do it, they have their rifle,” the report continues.

“But with sales slowing down, the price of an AR-15 is cratering. People are no longer willing to buy at the inflated panic-level prices, and dealers are starting to discount the guns in order to clear their shelves,” it adds.

And although this news may come as a bit of a headache for those who maxed out their credit cards a few months ago, those who held out for lower prices are in luck. Coupled with increased manufacturing and dwindling demand, now is a great time to buy an AR-15.

“[Y]ou have the pick of the litter when it comes to guns,” Legorn writes.

However, there is still a problem: ammo.

“[A]mmunition is still scarce,” he adds. “It’s on the shelves, but stores haven’t lifted their ‘one box per person’ limit yet. So while you can buy a gun, you still can’t feed it. And God help you if you need some .22lr.”

Features that make Black Rain Ordnance’s new rifles compliant with New York’s guns laws include: No pistol grip, a non-threaded muzzle fixed stock, 10-round low capacity approved magazine and a Lo-Pro gas block “without the evil bayonet lug.”

“We are proud to be an all American Company that produces true Made in the U.S.A. products,” the company told TheBlaze in an email.

And if Black Rain’s move to create rifles that comply with New York’s new guns laws, which have been described as some of the “nation’s toughest,” sounds familiar, it should: They’re not the only company to move in this direction, and stories of such guns have been popping up since May 2013.

In fact, several New York-based gun shops have, for example, offered to replace the grip on non-complaint rifles so that they’re square with state’s laws.

“The modified gun still fires at the same rate and with the same power; the shooter just holds it slightly differently,” the Guardian reported. “These modified weapons do not have to be registered with the state.”

One gun maker in Rochester, N.Y., Just Right Carbines, manufactures modified semi-automatic rifles that comply with the New York’s Safe Act, which was signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in January 2013.

Just Right Carbines’ general manger, Anthony Testa, told the Guardian that they were given verbal opinions by New York authorities indicating that their products complied with the law.

The Safe Act, which was the result of the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., that claimed the life of 27 people, bans the sale of so-called “assault weapons” and requires that everyone who already owns a rifle categorized as such to register them with the state by 15 April 2014.

The Safe Act singles out add-on features, including bayonet mounts, grenade launchers and, of course, “protruding pistol grips.”

Another New York company, H&H Firearms, has been working on modifying its semi-automatic rifles to meet state law.

“It’s basically an AR-15 without the features,” a lawyer representing H&H Firearms told the Times Union.

“People are champing at the bit” for a legal version of the popular rifle, said the company’s manager Justin Reickart, adding that the modified rifles look “like a paintball gun.”

But rather than shrink back, the NRA tapped retired Navy SEAL Dom Raso to offer a different perspective on the mega-popular AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. (Despite initial reports, Mateen used a Sig Sauer MCX, another semi-automatic rifle, in the attack.)

In a video released just three days after the attack, Raso declared that liberal politicians like presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton continually minimize the threat of radical Islam after terror attacks like Orlando and instead use the carnage to bring up gun control and gun bans (all while under the protection of guards armed with AR-15s and other firearms).

And Raso came out swinging, directing his ire to “every political hack pretending you know an AR-15 from a double-barreled shotgun in the wake of the Orlando terror attack: Stop talking.”

“Every word not only exposes your ignorance but your utter contempt for ordinary Americans trying to survive in an age of terror you won’t fully recognize,” he continued.

Having served as a SEAL for 12 years, Raso lauded the AR-15 as a “commonsense choice” for gun buyers to keep families and neighborhoods safer.

“I guarantee if the Founding Fathers had known this gun would have been invented, they wouldn’t have rewritten the Second Amendment, they would have fortified it in stone,” Raso noted. “Because they knew the only way for us to stay free was by having whatever guns the bad guys have. This firearm gives average people the advantage they so desperately need and deserve to protect their life, liberty and happiness.”

Raso also took to task Fox News’ Gretchen Carlson, who wondered on air after the Orlando terror attack if we need AR-15s to “hunt and kill deer” and to “protect our families.”

Noting Carlson’s support for most Second Amendment issues, on this matter Raso said she “does not understand what she’s talking about. The Second Amendment has nothing to do with hunting.”

Raso wrapped up his argument by saying law enforcement officials armed with AR-15s ended the recent terror attacks on U.S. soil, as well as in France and Belgium. Which prompted him to wonder why Clinton believes the answer “is to ban the very gun that stops terror attacks.”

“Why would you want to ban the gun that you pray for police to show up with?” Raso asked.

That’s what Glenn Beck said on his morning radio show Thursday as he discussed AR-15s. But why? Is an AR-15 not an assault rifle? Does the “AR” in AR-15 not stand for “assault rifle”?

It doesn’t. In fact, it doesn’t mean “automatic rifle” either, as many might think. AR actually stands for ArmaLite rifle, which is the company that first developed it in the 1950s.

It seems that there is a lot of confusion as to the difference between military rifles and those designed for civilian ownership, especially because of the language often used to describe the latter. The most popular terms to describe the weapons at the center of the recent gun control debate are “military-style” and “assault.” These words have long been used to to describe civilian firearms like the AR-15, but some consider it an inappropriate association that is deliberately being made to “demonize” the guns.

As Beck radio producer Stu Burguiere put it on the show Thursday, “they are targeting these weapons because they think the public is confused enough that they can get away with it — and they are.”

With what seems to be little understanding or agreement on the definition of what constitutes an assault rifle and the difference between civilian and military arms, TheBlaze went searching.

Military vs. Civilian Rifles — What’s the Difference?

For the purpose of this article, we’ll focus on AR-15s since it is what CBS calls “the most popular rifle in America” and one often designated an “assault” rifle. An AR-15 is the civilian equivalent to the military’s M-16. So what’s the difference?

Kelly Alwood, a firearms trainer and consultant, told TheBlaze the only difference is that one is fully automatic and the other is semi-automatic. It’s a small yet simultaneously big distinction. Firearms for use by the military are able to shoot continuously with one pull of the trigger, machine-gun style. Civilian firearms, on the other hand, only allow one shot per trigger pull.

Chris Parrett, a firearms enthusiast, pointed out that modifying a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic one is not only highly illegal with extreme penalties but also no easy feat.

What Constitutes an ‘Assault’ Rifle?

Merriam-Webster Dictonary defines “assault rifle” as “any of various automatic or semiautomatic rifles with large capacity magazines designed for military use.” The keywords here are “designed for military use.”

If that definition doesn’t quite cut it for you, here’s how David Kopel (via the Washington Examiner) describes it in an article in the “Journal of Contemporary Law” based on a definition from the Department of Defense (emphasis added):

As the United States Defense Department’s Defense Intelligence Agency book Small Arms Identification and Operation Guide explains, “assault rifles” are “short, compact, selective-fire weapons that fire a cartridge intermediate in power between submachine gun and rifle cartridges.”[21] In other words, assault rifles are battlefield rifles which can fire automatically.[22] Weapons capable of fully automatic fire, including assault rifles, have been regulated heavily in the United States since the National Firearms Act of 1934.[23] Taking possession of such weapons requires paying a $200 federal transfer tax and submitting to an FBI background check, including ten-print fingerprints.[24] Many civilians have purchased semiautomatic-only rifles that look like military assault rifles. These civilian rifles are, unlike actual assault rifles, incapable of automatic fire.

Based on these two definitions, since AR-15 is designed for civilian use, it therefore doesn’t fit with the definition of an “assault” weapon. This then begs the question why the association is being made in the first place.

“It was the Left who needed a term to call them,” Beck said on radio Thursday. “They are trying to make you think …’an AR-15, nobody needs that.’ An AR-15 is just a rifle, unless it has a fully automatic switch on it and then it becomes a machine gun — and you can’t buy that.”

(Editor’s note: machine guns, or automatic weapons, are reserved for the military but they can be purchased for a relatively high cost after a very lengthy background check and licensing procedure. See David Kopel’s definition we included above.)

“It’s a way to demonize something for a political agenda and misconstrue [the guns] and the public on the Second Amendment,” Alwood said.

Alwood, who the day he spoke with TheBlaze was traveling around helping police departments with their rifles, pointed out that all arguments for further gun control regulations or bans seem to go back the question “what would you possibly need this for?” Or rather, why would someone need the civilian equivalent to a military firearm?

Alwood said many gun control advocates would tie this question to hunting. In other words, why would a hunter need such a firearm? As the governor of New York Andrew Coumo said his State of the State address this week, “no one hunts with an assault rifle.” To which Alwood would respond, 1) there are practical applications in hunting with a so-called assault rifle and, 2) “the Second Amendment wasn’t designed for hunting,” an association which he thinks started being made in the 1980s.

“We need these rifles because the government has them,” Alwood explained.

He stopped there to say he realizes this is where gun enthusiasts and riflemen are made out to seem like anti-government “whack jobs” by the media, but that’s just not true.

“I don’t want people to think of me as anti-government. Most gun owners are not anti-government,” Alwood said.

He added that the Founding Fathers drafted the Second Amendment with protection of the citizens and their freedoms in mind.

“[Without the Second Amendment] there is no way to resist the government, voiding all other amendments,” Alwood said. “Why should [the government] continue to give you your freedom of speech if there is no one to stop them. It’s the only safeguard we have to protect us from a tyrannical government. …Look at all countries in trouble with dictators, they have absolute gun bans.”

The conservative publication Townhall recently called out two countries with a similar sentiment to this in mind:

Neither the Venezuelan nor Chinese governments have particularly good track records when it comes to human rights. By maintaining a government monopoly on guns, both can ensure that further abuses are carried out with less protests from the citizenry. Overall, it is sad to see two dictatorial governments making it easier to abuse their citizens as they please while also squelching the possibility for resistance.

(AP) — A suburban Portland pastor who won an AR-15 rifle in a raffle and then said he gave it a gun-owning friend for safekeeping will not be prosecuted for transferring the weapon without conducting a background check, authorities said.

Officials were investigating whether Rev. Jeremy Lucas may have violated a recent state law that makes transferring a gun without a background check illegal, even if the arrangement is between private parties and no money changes hands.

But investigators uncovered no evidence that Lucas, 45, actually transferred the gun and never determined the name of the gun-owning friend, Clackamas County District Attorney John S. Foote said in a letter to the Oregon State Police.

The letter was written on Sept. 9 and made public Thursday by state police.

Lucas declined to speak with investigators, state police said in a statement.

“Without the transferee in this case, I don’t think we could ever have a prosecutable case,” Foote wrote.

Lucas, a pastor at Christ Church Episcopal Parish in the affluent suburb of Lake Oswego about 10 miles south of Portland, said in interviews this summer that he spent about $3,000 in discretionary church funds to buy as many rifle raffle tickets as he could for a softball league fundraiser.

When he won, he passed a background check to take possession of the weapon.

He told The Washington Post in July that after he won the rifle, he gave it to a friend for temporary safe-keeping.

But a state law passed last year makes transferring a gun without a background check illegal, even if the arrangement is between private parties and no money changes hands.

The Oregon Firearms Federation, which lobbied against passage of the law, pointed out Lucas’s potential law violation to the Oregon State Police, the Lake Oswego Police Department and 30 state lawmakers.

Kevin Starrett, the group’s executive director, said Friday he was not surprised that authorities did not charge Lucas.

“Of course they would not prosecute, because it would illuminate the lunacy of this law,” he said. “It’s theater. It’s farce.”

Comments Lucas made to the newspaper about the transfer of the gun were “insufficient to prove that it happened,” Foote wrote.

Lucas could not be reached to comment Friday at the parish offices, which were closed for the day.

There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment sent to a general parish account."
blaze29,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2016-06-14 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/06/14/despite-what-youve-heard-the-orlando-terrorist-did-not-use-an-ar-15-in-attack,"Several news outlets have identified the weapon used in the Orlando terrorist attack as an AR-15 rifle.

“AR-15 Rifle Used in Orlando Massacre Has Bloody Pedigree,” an NBC News headline reads.

“Orlando Shooting Puts Spotlight on AR-15 Rifle,” Newsweek declared.

The Washington Post offered the headline: “The history of the AR-15, the weapon that had a hand in the United States’ worst mass shooting.”

However, it turns out the Islamic State-supporting killer didn’t actually use an AR-15 to carry out the insidious at a gay nightclub that left 49 people dead and dozens more injured.

The terrorist was actually armed with a Sig Sauer MCX carbine. Bearing Arms’ Bob Owens has more details about the firearm and how it relates to an AR-15:

The rifle used by the Islamist terrorist in Orlando was instead a Sig Sauer MCX carbine, a modular, multi-caliber (able to swap to different calibers, including 5.56 NATO, 300 BLK, and 7.62×39) rifle system that sometimes utilizes STANAG magazines common to more than 60 different firearms, but otherwise has no major parts that interface with AR-15s in any way, shape or form.

So how did the weapon become erroneously classified as an AR-15?

It appears that Orlando Police Chief John Mina initially described the weapon as an “AR-15-style assault rifle” and media outlets ran with the classification, several dropping “style” from the description.

The AR-15 is one of the most popular rifles in the U.S. and is regularly demonized by gun control advocates as a “weapon of war.” The semi-automatic rifle is also routinely confused as being a “machine gun” or fully automatic.

blaze30,blaze,"['Sarah Taylor', 'Staff Writer']",2018-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/26/del-governor-wants-to-stop-assault-weapons-sales-hes-not-the-only-official-calling-for-the-ban,"Delaware Gov. John Carney (D) said Friday that he is proposing a statewide ban on the sale of “assault weapons” in the wake of the deadly Florida high school shooting, which killed 17 people and injured many more on Feb. 14.

What did Carney say?

Carney explained that, in addition to other statewide gun safety measures in the works, his team will “work closely with lawmakers to craft legislation that would prohibit the sale of assault-style rifles” in the state.

“As we have seen in Las Vegas, Parkland, and in many other horrific incidents across our country, military-style weapons can be used to carry out catastrophic acts of violence,” Carney noted. “They have no place on the streets of our neighborhoods.”

According to spokesman Jonathan Starkey, Carney is not aiming to ban “military-style” guns that have already been legally purchased, but instead has aims to prevent any more of these weapons from being purchased from local gun shops, according to Delaware Online.

“President [Donald] Trump and members of Congress have the authority to take responsible action nationally to reduce the toll of gun violence across our country,” Starkey added, according to the Washington Post. “Governor Carney believes they should act but won’t wait to do what is within our power here in Delaware to make our state safer.”

Delaware Online reported that Carney’s definitions of the terms “assault-style rifles” and “military-style weapons” — terms that were used interchangeably in his statement — were not clear.

In response to Carney’s announcement, House Republican Leader Danny Short released the following statement:

Whenever there is a horrendous event involving firearms and a large loss of life, there is a knee-jerk reaction to do something, anything, to fight the horror and pain. That is an understandable human response, but it is a poor way to make meaningful public policy. We had a federal ban on assault weapons between 1994 and 2004. It proved ineffective. One of the problems then, as now, is defining an “assault weapon.” True assault weapons — rifles capable of fully automatic fire — are already illegal for most Americans to own and have been for decades. What the governor apparently means by the provocative term is any semi-automatic rifle resembling a military weapon, like the AR-15 rifle used in the recent Florida tragedy. According to the National Rifle Association, Americans own about five million AR-15s alone. Millions more semi-automatic rifles of other types are also owned by Americans — the vast majority of which will never be employed in any crime. Such rifles are ubiquitous. It also needs to be stressed that violent crime in our nation has dropped dramatically. According to the Pew Research Center (using FBI data) the violent crime rate in the U.S. has fallen by 48% between 1993 and 2016. Passing laws to restrict the basic firearms ownership rights, guaranteed by both our federal and state constitutions, is not the answer to reducing the anomalous incidents of mass violence perpetrated by a few deranged individuals. I, and my caucus colleagues, generally support a ban on the sale and use of so-called bump-stocks and trigger-crank devices. And, in lieu of HB 302 (the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act), we support enactment of House Bill 285, which will create procedures for making sure firearms do not find their way into the hands of dangerous people, while protecting due process and avoiding the creation of barriers to treat those suffering from mental illnesses. In contrast to HB 302, HB 285 has bipartisan support and is far more comprehensive in its approach. The proposed assault weapon sales ban is a misguided effort that will only serve to further politically polarize Delawareans with no hope of making any real impact on the desired goal of reducing isolated incidents of mass violence. I instead urge the governor to work in a non-partisan fashion with all the members of the 149th General Assembly to create rational laws that will actually make a difference.

Are there any other state officials looking into doing something similar?"
blaze31,blaze,['Wayne Allyn Root'],2015-07-27 09:59:44-04:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/donald-trumps-mouth-is-a-nuclear-weapon,"The biased, clueless liberal mainstream media are in shock and awe. They have no idea why so many Americans love Donald Trump. But the answer is so simple and clear. Just ask any conservative.

Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air. Donald Trump is the answer to what ails America – simply because he kills two birds with one stone.

America has two big problems. America is under attack by a vicious one-two combination. America has been ruined by two parties. And Donald Trump’s mouth solves both problems. Donald Trump’s mouth is a nuclear weapon.

[sharequote align=”center”]America is being lost because the GOP is bringing knives to a gunfight.[/sharequote]

Democrats clearly hate American exceptionalism, capitalism, entrepreneurship, and Judeo-Christian values. They hate business owners (see “You didn’t build that”) and appear to blame American patriotism, white people, business owners and Christians for every problem in the world today.

The Democrat Party is riddled with socialists, Marxists and communists hell bent on “fundamentally changing America.”

The Democrat Party is filled with frauds (see President Barack Obama, Jonathan Gruber and the lies used to sell Obamacare); traitors (see Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry and the new Iran nuclear treaty); thieves and conmen (see the scandal involving $2 billion donated to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state); reckless wasters of taxpayer money (see Obama’s Kenya trip that cost us over $50 million dollars for one day in a country that offers America NOTHING ); and outright criminals (see Hillary’s upcoming criminal investigation and Obama’s use of the IRS to target, persecute and even attempt to imprison political opponents and critics).

But the GOP may be worse.

If there’s anything worse than evil, it’s cowardice in the face of evil. The GOP leadership is riddled with cowards, wimps and naïve, feckless, country club powder puffs who have no clue how to fight back against the Democrats ruining America and destroying our children’s future with debt. Yes, Democrats are the bad guys. But Republicans are standing by helplessly, scared and petrified, allowing it to happen.

I suspect many of the Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. are either being bribed or blackmailed. Exhibit A is Supreme Court Justice Roberts, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. These guys are all either bought and paid for; or someone is holding a gun to their heads (along with a photo of them in bed doing something shocking). Don’t believe me? See the criminal case against former Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert. They are all doing something morally wrong, or breaking some law. And Obama’s partners in the National Security Administration and IRS are always watching. America is being lost because the GOP is bringing knives to a gunfight.

The only way to save America is to bring a nuclear weapon to a gun fight. And Donald Trump’s mouth is a nuclear weapon.

It’s time to stop being “nice.” “Nice” is okay for playing golf with Muffy at the country club. But “nice” doesn’t work in politics. “Nice” guys finish last in politics. “Nice” is getting our country ruined. “Nice” is killing middle class jobs. “Nice” is wiping out middle class incomes. “Nice” has led to negative GDP growth. “Nice” has led to more businesses closing than opening each day for the first time in America’s history. “Nice” has left the border wide open to an illegal alien invasion, the bankruptcy of America and a terrorist attack like Sept. 11, 2001.

“Nice” has led to disaster and disgrace all over the globe. The world no longer has any respect for, or fear of America. We are in decline and disarray. We are headed for collapse and disaster.

Into this crisis steps “the nuclear mouth” Donald Trump. He isn’t afraid to put America first. He isn’t afraid to tell the truth. He isn’t afraid of what the media thinks. He isn’t afraid of being called a “racist” for pointing out how Obama has damaged and destroyed America. He isn’t afraid to question Obama’s very mysterious, questionable and troubling past – much of it sealed away in darkness.

Trump isn’t afraid to fight like our future is on the line because he understands it is. He isn’t afraid to offend. He isn’t afraid to expose the cowards and frauds in his own GOP leadership for what they are. He refuses to be “politically correct” when he sees corruption and idiocy. He won’t back down or apologize for telling the truth.

Of course the evil Democrats, corrupt and cowardly GOP leadership, and biased mainstream media hate him. They are all rooting for another Mitt Romney. Let’s compare Mitt to Donald Trump:

They are both rich white guys. Both famous successful businessmen. Both Republican presidential candidates past and present. That’s where the similarity ends.

Mitt Romney is a very nice guy. Mitt has manners. Mitt would never offend anyone. Mitt let the media run roughshod over him. Mitt would never say something rude or offensive about Obama or Hillary. Mitt would never accuse them of crimes against the American people. Mitt would never prosecute Obama or Hillary if he was elected.

And one other difference: Mitt lost.

It’s no coincidence that Mitt lost. The last thing we need now is “nice.” It’s also no coincidence that the people in power (evil Democrats, the corrupt GOP leadership, and the mainstream media) all want another Mitt Romney. They want the status quo. They want to keep the bribes and blackmail coming. They don’t want anyone to upset the apple cart.

They are scared to death of Donald Trump, who doesn’t play by traditional rules or etiquette. They are scared to death of a guy who can’t be bribed. They are scared to death of a guy who speaks about the hopes, dreams and fears of middle class Americans. They are scared to death of a street fighter. They are scared to death of a candidate who is as relentless for saving America…as Obama is for destroying America. Donald Trump understands what I call, “The Power of Relentless.”

Mostly, they are scared to death of Trump’s mouth. The kind of mouth that could stir up a citizen revolution and topple “business as usual” in Washington, D.C.

Yes Donald Trump’s mouth is a nuclear weapon. And that’s precisely why we love him.

Bombs away!

The court stated that 81 weapons, as well as semi-automatics that use detachable magazines, and can sport two or more features such as a flash suppressor, or a folding stock as “dangerous and unusual” and being “exceptionally lethal weapons of war,” by majority opinion writer Judge Robert B. King.

The majority is of the opinion that such weapons that look like rifles used by our military in wartime should not be accessible by civilians.

Our ruling on Second Amendment protection is limited and clear: Because the FSA-banned assault weapons and large capacity magazines are like M16s, in that they are most useful in military service, they are not protected by the Second Amendment.

Later…

Rather, the issue is whether the banned assault weapons and large-capacity magazines possess an amalgam of features that render those weapons and magazines like M16s and most useful in military service.

The M16 is a fully automatic rifle, seeing use in our military since the Vietnam war. However, none of the banned guns are capable of firing like the M16. A popular rifle civilians tend to use is the AR-15, a semi-automatic. While unable to fire automatically, the Ar-15’s high modifiability has arisen concerns amongst lawmakers unfamiliar with how the rifle works.

Regardless, by calling the banned weapons “dangerous and unusual” the 4th Circuit court has utilized Supreme Court language from the District of Columbia v. Heller case to support their ruling. However, as Reason’s Jacob Sullum notes, this description of the weapons doesn’t add up, and flies in the face of Heller.

The majority’s judgment that folding stocks, flare launchers, and flash suppressors make rifles “exceptionally lethal” is dubious. It is also irrelevant, because the Supreme Court did not say the Second Amendment allows bans on exceptionally lethal weapons. It said the Second Amendment allows bans on “dangerous and unusual” weapons that are not “in common use for lawful purposes,” and that description plainly does not apply to rifles that are among the most popular in the country. The argument that magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds are more lethal than smaller magazines is more logical but still irrelevant, since “large-capacity magazines” are very common, sold standard with many handguns and rifles.

This was also seemingly the view of the dissenting judges. Judge William B. Traxler Jr. — joined by Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Dennis W. Shedd and G. Steven Agee — stated that the majority have “gone to greater lengths than any other court to eviscerate the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.”

“As long as the weapon chosen is one commonly possessed by the American people for lawful purposes — and the rifles at issue here most certainly are. The state has very little say about whether its citizens should keep it in their homes for protection.”

Heller is quite clear that rifles in lawful common use are protected under the 2nd Amendment, however the 4th circuit seems to have ignored this, along with the 75 million magazines that hold ten or more bullets common among the American populace. As National Review Online Editor Charles C. Cooke notes, “…the majority doesn’t care about that, choosing to apply only the “military” standard that it has invented.”"

Merriam-Webster Dictonary defines “assault rifle” as “any of various automatic or semiautomatic rifles with large capacity magazines designed for military use.” The keywords here are “designed for military use.”

If that definition doesn’t quite cut it for you, here’s how David Kopel (via the Washington Examiner) describes it in an article in the “Journal of Contemporary Law” based on a definition from the Department of Defense (emphasis added):

As the United States Defense Department’s Defense Intelligence Agency book Small Arms Identification and Operation Guide explains, “assault rifles” are “short, compact, selective-fire weapons that fire a cartridge intermediate in power between submachine gun and rifle cartridges.”[21] In other words, assault rifles are battlefield rifles which can fire automatically.[22] Weapons capable of fully automatic fire, including assault rifles, have been regulated heavily in the United States since the National Firearms Act of 1934.[23] Taking possession of such weapons requires paying a $200 federal transfer tax and submitting to an FBI background check, including ten-print fingerprints.[24] Many civilians have purchased semiautomatic-only rifles that look like military assault rifles. These civilian rifles are, unlike actual assault rifles, incapable of automatic fire.

Based on these two definitions, since AR-15 is designed for civilian use, it therefore doesn’t fit with the definition of an “assault” weapon. This then begs the question why the association is being made in the first place.

(Editor’s note: machine guns, or automatic weapons, are reserved for the military but they can be purchased for a relatively high cost after a very lengthy background check and licensing procedure. See David Kopel’s definition we included above.)

“It’s a way to demonize something for a political agenda and misconstrue [the guns] and the public on the Second Amendment,” Alwood said.

Alwood, who the day he spoke with TheBlaze was traveling around helping police departments with their rifles, pointed out that all arguments for further gun control regulations or bans seem to go back the question “what would you possibly need this for?” Or rather, why would someone need the civilian equivalent to a military firearm?

Alwood said many gun control advocates would tie this question to hunting. In other words, why would a hunter need such a firearm? As the governor of New York Andrew Coumo said his State of the State address this week, “no one hunts with an assault rifle.” To which Alwood would respond, 1) there are practical applications in hunting with a so-called assault rifle and, 2) “the Second Amendment wasn’t designed for hunting,” an association which he thinks started being made in the 1980s.

“We need these rifles because the government has them,” Alwood explained.

He stopped there to say he realizes this is where gun enthusiasts and riflemen are made out to seem like anti-government “whack jobs” by the media, but that’s just not true.

“I don’t want people to think of me as anti-government. Most gun owners are not anti-government,” Alwood said.

He added that the Founding Fathers drafted the Second Amendment with protection of the citizens and their freedoms in mind.

“[Without the Second Amendment] there is no way to resist the government, voiding all other amendments,” Alwood said. “Why should [the government] continue to give you your freedom of speech if there is no one to stop them. It’s the only safeguard we have to protect us from a tyrannical government. …Look at all countries in trouble with dictators, they have absolute gun bans.”

The conservative publication Townhall recently called out two countries with a similar sentiment to this in mind:

Neither the Venezuelan nor Chinese governments have particularly good track records when it comes to human rights. By maintaining a government monopoly on guns, both can ensure that further abuses are carried out with less protests from the citizenry. Overall, it is sad to see two dictatorial governments making it easier to abuse their citizens as they please while also squelching the possibility for resistance.

Florida resident Ivette Ros, a former bank manager at Wells Fargo, claims she feels “naked” without her gun and says because she had a concealed carry permit it was unlawful for her employer to terminate her for carrying, the Tampa Tribune reported.

“I am within my constitutional right,” Ros reportedly said. “The bank is one of the places that I am able to carry a weapon to. My weapon was concealed. I have a certified license.”

Last year someone noticed Ros was carrying a firearm and reported her to bank officials, according to the Tribune. She was later fired.

“I’m a manager of a bank,” she added. “We have a lot of robberies that happen in our banks. I feel safer having that weapon if I ever needed to protect my employees.”

[sharequote align=”center”]”I feel safer having that weapon if I ever needed to protect my employees.”[/sharequote]

However, while Wells Fargo wouldn’t comment on a specific ongoing case, the bank told the Tribune that they have a strict policy forbidding firearms.

“Team members are strictly prohibited from possession of firearms and weapons on company premises,” spokeswoman Kathy Harrison reportedly said.

Ros’ lawyer disagrees.

“Employers can’t discriminate against their employees nor can they discriminate against their customers if they are … law-abiding, licensed concealed weapons permit owners,” Noel Flasterstein told the Tribune.

“Just because it’s in their handbook doesn’t mean it is correct or it will withstand a legal scrutiny or a legal investigation, which is what we’re doing in this case,” he reportedly added.

Another legal expert, however, said Ros was outside her legal rights, noting that Wells Fargo is a private institution.

“There is nothing in the state statute that says the employer has to let her bring it into the building,” reportedly said Jason Bent, an assistant professor of law at Stetson University College of Law.

The bank does offer some exceptions in certain areas, though, that would allow team members to store their firearm in their vehicle while they work at the bank, the Tribune reported.

Ponce. The Navy spent $40 million developing the Laser Weapons System, or LaWS, which only costs about a $1 each time it’s fired. The beam travels at the speed of light and doesn’t need to take wind speed or range into account.

Naval officers tout the advantages and benefits of the system, saying, “Operationally it works just like a laser pointer.” The weapon is silent, so enemy combatants cannot anticipate the strike. It is so accurate, it can pick drones out of the sky or specifically target an enemy ship’s engine.

This type of targeting could reduce the lethality of engaging the enemy, disabling their vehicles and weaponry while reducing casualties. Mike Opelka remarked on today’s “Pure Opelka” that the weapon’s use of photons reminds him of “Star Trek,” the 1960s science fiction show based on a naval military structure that used “photon torpedoes” and “phasers.”

blaze36,blaze,['Buck Sexton'],2012-01-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/01/13/here-are-five-of-the-most-expensive-military-weapons-on-earth,"Earlier this month, The Blaze brought you the single most expensive piece of military hardware ever — the new Ford Class USS Gerald Ford Aircraft Carrier.

But military spending in 2010 was $693 billion — nearly half of all military spending on earth. So other than aircraft carriers, where is all that money going?

Take a look below to get a good idea. With an eye to the dollars and cents of major U.S. military programs, the website 24/7 Wall Street has put together a list of the most expensive U.S. military weapons. Cost figures come from documents published by the Department of Defense and the Government Accountability Office.

Check them out. All are amazing pieces of hardware, but you’ll have to determine for yourself if any of them could be considered a bargain:

1) F-22 Raptor

> Type: stealth fighter jet

> Total Cost: $79.2 billion

> R&D: $40.5 billion

> Procurement Cost: $37.9 billion

> Total Units: 188

> Price per Unit: $211.6 million

Many people say the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is the best fighter jet in the world, hands down. One thing is for sure — it’s the most expensive at $211 million per unit. The DOD budget has 188 on its current budget. Other countries want them, but so far Congress has banned the sale of Raptors to any country.

The Raptor is a hyper-maneuverable, stealth-enabled fighter and can eliminate targets long before they even know it’s in the sky. Equipped with two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, six medium-range air-to-air missiles, a 20 mm gatling gun, two 1,000 pound bombs and eight 250 pound bombs, it gives the U.S. complete air dominance capabilities.

2) Virginia Class Submarine

> Type: nuclear submarine

> Total Cost: $83.7 billion

> R&D: $7.2 billion

> Procurement Cost: $76.6 billion

> Total Units: 30

> Price per Unit: $2,552.6 million

The Virginia Class subs are among the most useful strategic tools in the DOD arsenal. These nuclear submarines can carry 38 different weapons, including Tomahawk Cruise Missiles, mines and torpedoes. While eight are currently in operation, the Department of Defense has 30 of these $2.5 billion mobile undersea missile platforms budgeted.

Here is a video overview of the Virginia Class Sub, courtesy of the Military Channel:



3 ) Trident II Missile

> Type: ballistic missile

> Total Cost: $53.2 billion

> R&D: $16.8 billion

> Procurement Cost: $35 billion

> Total Units: 561

> Price per Unit: $65.7 million

The Trident II is the most advanced U.S. Navy ballistic missile. Equipped with a thermonuclear warhead, the Trident II is carried by most Ohio-class submarines. According to 24/7:

“The missile is 44 feet long and weighs 80 tons. Equipped with a three-stage rocket, the missile is capable of traveling at more than 13,000 miles per hour, and has a range of 4,600 miles. The Department of Defense currently has 561 Tridents on the budget, each worth more than $65 million, not counting research and development costs.”

4) V-22 Osprey

> Type: tiltrotor transport plane

> Total Cost: $57.8 billion

> R&D: $13.6 billion

> Procurement Cost: $43.5 billion

> Total Units: 459

> Price per Unit: $95.2 million

The V-22 Osprey is a hybrid plane/helicopter design — called a “tiltrotor aircraft” — which means it can engage in extremely short take-offs and landings, as well as hover in place.

But when the rotors come forward, it has much longer range than a helicopter. The Osprey is a transport craft that can travel up to 390 nautical miles without refueling at speeds surpassing 260 miles per hour. The 459 Ospreys include in the Pentagon budget cost a cool $95.2 million dollars each.

5) Arleigh Burke-class Destroyer

> Type: destroyer

> Total Cost: $101.8 billion

> R&D: $5.1

> Procurement Cost: $96.6 billion

> Total Units: 75

> Price per Unit: $1,299.3 million

The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, also known as the DDG 5, has been part of the U.S. Navy’s fleet since 1995. These days there are about 60 in active service, with 15 more in the DOD budget. At more than 500 feet long, stem to stern, the larger generation of Arleigh Burkes displace roughly 9,200 tons, with 350 servicemen on each vessel.

The newest generation is equipped with two vertical launching systems for tomahawk missiles, a 5″ gun, torpedoes and an advanced mine-detection system.

blaze37,blaze,['Tré Goins-Phillips'],2017-02-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/03/mattis-promises-overwhelming-response-if-north-korea-uses-nuclear-weapons,"Secretary of Defense James Mattis is taking a hardline stance against North Korea over its saber-rattling, promising an “effective and overwhelming” response should the country ever use nuclear weapons.

“Any attack on the United States — or our allies — will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming,” the retired four-star Marine general said Friday during an appearance with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-Koo, Reuters reported.

Mattis’ comments follow continued concerns that North Korea could be preparing to test a new ballistic missile — a move that could prove to be an early challenge for the Trump White House. In his New Year’s address, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un said his country is in the “final stage” of preparation to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, NPR reported.

An intercontinental ballistic missile is a land-based, nuclear-armed ballistic weapon with a trajectory of more than 3,500 miles.

North Korea, which frequently vows to destroy both South Korea and the U.S., conducted more than 20 missile tests in 2016, as well as five nuclear tests over the last decade, defying United Nations sanctions against them.

Former President Barack Obama received criticism last year from both Republicans and then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for not taking a stronger position against North Korea after it conducted its fifth nuclear test, according to Politico.

Obama’s opponents and allies alike distanced themselves from the White House for being too soft on Chinese companies, banks and individuals doing business with North Korea. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, China is North Korea’s “most important ally, biggest trading partner, and main source of food, arms, and energy.”

Beijing, while it has sought a denuclearized North Korea, has long opposed strong sanctions against Pyongyang, citing concerns that a regime collapse in the North could lead to an intense influx of refugees across their 870-mile border.

Obama “should immediately make full use of the sanctions authorities Congress gave him earlier this year,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said at the time.

“He should join me in urging China, as Pyongyang’s chief sponsor, to fully enforce the international sanctions on the Kim regime,” Ryan added, referring to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

Clinton, for her part, called for a “rethinking” of the U.S.’s strategy against North Korea. She called the nuclear and missile tests “outrageous and unacceptable” and described the country’s “determination to develop a deliverable nuclear weapon” as a “direct threat to the United States.”

According to Reuters, North Korea has also apparently restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility, which produces plutonium to be used for the country’s nuclear weapons program.

According to new data from South Korea, the Kim regime has stockpiled enough plutonium to develop 10 nuclear warheads, Time reported last month.

“North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior,” Mattis said.

In response to the continued missile and nuclear tests from the Kim regime, the U.S. and South Korea have developed the U.S. missile defense system, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), which is expected to be deployed in South Korea later this year.

THAAD is a land-based, vehicle-mounted system developed by Lockheed Martin with a “globally-transportable, rapidly-deployable capability to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles inside or outside the atmosphere during their final, or terminal, phase of flight,” according to the Defense Department’s Missile Defense Agency.

While the Chinese Foreign Ministry, through spokesman Lu Kang, said it does “not believe [THAAD] will be conducive” to resolving the North’s nuclear proliferation, the South Korean defense minister said Mattis’ remarks send a clear message.

“Faced with a current severe security situation, Secretary Mattis’ visit to Korea … also communicates the strongest warning to North Korea,” Han said."

From the Daily Mail:

It was created by crossing three of the hottest varieties of chilli pods known to man. The result is a record breaking chilli that will make your eyes stream, throat burn, nose run and much, much worse. The Naga Viper chilli packs an astonishing 1,359,000 on the Scoville scale, which measures heat by the presence of the chemical compound capsaicin. Experts at Warwick University carried out tests on the chilli and officially declared it the hottest. It beat competition from the ferocious Bhut Jolokia pod – the previous holder – to take the title of the world’s hottest chilli in the Guinness Book of World Records.

The pepper is the creation of British chili pepper farmer Gerald Fowler.

“It numbs your tongue, then burns all the way down,” he told the Daily Mail. “It can last an hour, and you just don’t want to talk to anyone or do anything.”

The pepper is so hot Fowler, who owns a local pub, makes customers sign a disclaimer stating they are “of sound body and mind” before sampling a curry cooked with Naga Viper. Only two have managed to finish the whole dish."

But right when you thought his homemade artillery couldn’t get anymore intense, he shows off one that he has kept secret for a while.

It’s a sophisticated thrower of circular saw blades.

Why was this “rotational saw blade shooter”, which Sprave compares to a traditional clay pigeon thrower that’s fired like a rifle, kept secret? Sprave said he designed for a television show and couldn’t publicly showcase it until now.

Although Sprave made some adjustments to account for the disc shape and spin of the ammo to improve accuracy, he said it is “in no ways a sniper rifle.”

The rational saw blade shooter doesn’t make its appearance in Sprave’s video until after he shows off a nail shooter, so skip to 2:46 if you only want to watch the circular blades fly:

An ABC News reporter said he found one of those heroes, Mike Cronk, sitting on a curb “with his head in his hands.” Cronk was shirtless at the time — having used the article of clothing to put pressure on bullet wounds — and gave a short interview describing the terrifying scene.

In a second interview with ABC News, Cronk offered more details about what happened after his best friend was shot in the chest three times.

He told the reporter that after the shots rang out “my buddy is like, ‘I got hit.'”

“It seemed like forever,” he recalled, noting that many people were “selfless” and stayed with the wounded.

When the reporter added that Cronk is a retired teacher who came to Las Vegas for his 48th birthday — and that his seriously wounded friend Rob was standing just inches away when the shooting started — Cronk paused and teared up.

“It was hard,” he said.

“Everybody pretty much dove on top of each other,” he continued, adding that it was “chaos” and that there were “people trampling each other, trying to get away.”

Cronk, who’s a hunter, told ABC News he realized the gunfire was “fully automatic.”

But Cronk’s face brightened when he noted an EMT and trained, ex-military people jumped right in to help compress his friend’s wounds — and they actually had their fingers in the bullet holes to help stop the bleeding, Cronk recalled.

Even his wounded friend Rob had his own finger in one of the holes: “He was like, ‘Don’t take it out … leave your finger there, we’ll compress over the top of it.”

He said that he and three other men hauled his friend over a fence and then they all got under the stage for protection — and that’s where “another awesome lady came over and helped compress,” Cronk said.

“I’m no hero,” he said before praising the “tons of heroes” who helped.

But once they got his friend out from under the stage and into a pickup truck — along with other wounded people — they got turned right back around because it was an active shooter situation. Eventually, they found an ambulance and helped get the wounded inside.

And that’s when another tragedy struck Cronk: Another shooting victim whom he did not know but was helping died in his arms.

Describing that moment, Cronk teared up again and paused for several moments before saying, “It’s been a tough night … So many people died and are wounded. It’s very sad. … It’s a terrible tragedy. I don’t know what other words you can use for it.”

But there was happy news for Cronk — he learned that his seriously wounded friend was going to be OK.

Still, Cronk acknowledged, “it could have been me. I was right next to my buddy.”

And it could have been Cronk’s girlfriend, too — but he told ABC News that she got sick after about an hour in the heat and returned to their hotel.

When the reporter praised Cronk’s for his actions, he replied that “you try to keep your head and do what you can. But like I said, there’s tons of people who were true heroes tonight.”"

WJW-TV reported that Plesec was holding his Bible and reading Scripture to the suspect in the moments leading up to his death early Saturday.

According to the WKYC report, local law enforcement revealed that Jones, after allegedly killing Plesec, reportedly went on a carjacking spree that ended in nearby Lakewood.

What are the details?

Plesec, a Bible study teacher for the Salvation Army, was reportedly wearing his uniform, holding his Bible, and proselytizing to his alleged murderer when he was shot in the head and killed.

WKYC noted that Plesec was on his way to collect money for the organization’s annual Red Kettle campaign.

According to WKYC, police are charging Jones with aggravated murder, grand theft auto, and fleeing and eluding.

The incident remains under investigation.

Is there more?

The Salvation Army on Sunday released the following statement to WKYC:

It is with a heavy heart that I confirm your email. Jared was an employee (youth worker) and church member of The Salvation Army Temple Corps Community Center in Collinwood. Jared died as he lived, sharing God’s love. Jared passed away in full Salvation Army uniform with his Bible in hand leaving home on his day off to volunteer at The Salvation Army’s Red Kettle. In the past two days, hundreds of individuals, mostly youth, have flocked to The Salvation Army in Collinwood to pay tribute to Jared’s life. They all had one thing in common, Jared loved them, he cared for them and he changed their lives. Today our we feel great loss that Jared was taken from us too soon. Yet we rejoice that he is in heaven with the loving Heavenly Father he told so many people about. Well done, good and faithful servant.

Maj. Daniel Alverio of the Salvation Army told WJW that Plesec simply wanted to “teach people who God was” and to “love and care for people.”

“I would talk to Jared often and he would say that he was not afraid,” Alverio revealed. “I would say ‘Jared, be careful in the streets.’ He said, ‘I’m not afraid. I know where I’m going,’ and for him he would tell you to die is gain. Like he had no problem with the idea of being persecuted for the gospel.”

Alverio added, “He knew what he believed and he was assured that if anything ever happened to him he was going to be alright [sic].”

WJW reported on Monday that the city of Cleveland named a street after Plesec in his honor. According to the report, the portion of Cleveland’s Grovewood Avenue near the Salvation Army facility will be named after Plesec."

blaze43,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-07-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/07/17/questions-swirl-after-australian-woman-is-fatally-shot-by-minneapolis-police-bodycams-were-off,"Questions are swirling after a 40-year-old woman from Australia — a yoga and meditation teacher set to be married next month — was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer after family members said she called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night, the Star-Tribune reported.

Primary among those questions is why police bodycams weren’t on when 40-year-old Justine Damond was shot.

The Star-Tribune reported that three sources with knowledge of the incident said two officers in a squad car pulled into the alley in response to the 911 call. Damond — who was in her pajamas — went to the driver’s side door and was talking to the driver when the officer in the passenger seat pulled his gun and shot Damond through the driver’s side door, sources told the paper. No weapon was found at the scene, the Star-Tribune added.

“Two Minneapolis police officers responded to a 911 call of a possible assault just north of the 5100 block of Washburn Avenue S. just before 11:30 p.m. Saturday,” the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said in a news release, the paper said. “At one point, an officer fired their weapon, fatally striking a woman.”

The bureau’s release said that the “officers’ body cameras were not turned on at the time and the squad camera did not capture the incident. Investigators are attempting to determine whether any video of the incident exists.”

Minneapolis police told the paper the two officers are on paid administrative leave.

More from the Star-Tribune:

Zach Damond, 22, whose father, Don, 50, was to be married to Justine in August, arrived at the scene with a close family friend about 11:30 a.m. Sunday. While the couple were not yet married, Justine referred to herself as Damond on her personal website. Her maiden name was Justine Ruszczyk.

“Basically, my mom is dead because a police officer shot her for reasons I don’t know, and I demand answers,” Zach Damond said on a video, referring to the victim. “And If anybody can help, just call the police and demand answers. I’m so done with all this violence. It’s so much bulls**t. America sucks. These cops need to get trained differently. I need to move out of here.”

Here’s the clip. (Content warning: Profanity):

Zach Damond also said on the video that his stepmother-to-be — a native of Sydney, Australia — called police after she “heard a sound in the alley.” He added on the clip, “F*** the police.”

A woman named Hannah — who told the Star-Tribune she didn’t want to give her last name for safety reasons and is a close friend of the Damond family — came to the scene with Zach Damond and called Justine Damond a “spiritual healer.”

“I don’t know what she was doing out,” Hannah told the paper.

From her home in the middle of the block she shared with her fiance, Justine Damond would have had to walk just over 100 yards to get to the end of the alley, the Star-Tribune said.

“She’s such a kind woman,” Hannah told the paper. “She took me in when I was in a tough situation and helped me with whatever I needed.”

A Sunday night community vigil at the spot Justine Damond was shot drew about 50 friends and neighbors who held hands in a semicircle, the Star-Tribune reported, while another 200 or more watched from the sidewalk and the street.

Dustin Johnson and his wife, Roz, live across the street from where Justine Damond lived and told the paper they saw the flashing lights and walked over to see police trying to resuscitate her while she lay on the ground. Johnson told the Star-Tribune he heard no gunshots.

The shooting comes on the heels of a Minneapolis-area police officer’s controversial acquittal a year after he shot a black man, Philando Castile, during a traffic stop.

Hannah told the paper there’s no way Justine Damond would have had a gun and that she often noted how much better it was in Australia where people aren’t allowed to have guns.

Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges on Sunday said, “I am heartsick and deeply disturbed by the fatal officer-involved shooting that happened last night,” the Star-Tribune reported, adding that she said she has “questions about why the bodycams weren’t on.”"

The story began on New Year’s Day in 2016 when Smith was dispatched to an attempted robbery at a convenience store. The suspect was said to be wearing camouflage and a red bandanna.

When Smith arrived on scene, he confronted the suspect, Orr, 29, who continued to walk away from him despite being ordered to halt. Smith noticed the man had his hands in his pockets and drew his taser. The officer was wearing glasses with an attached camera and recorded the event on video.

“If you don’t stop sir, I’m going to tase you,” Smith said. “Take your hands out your pocket, take your hands out your pocket.”

“I didn’t draw my firearm because at the time I didn’t think it was warranted,” he told WJCL. “He was just walking away. But unfortunately I made a mistake and I drew my taser, and he got the upper hand on me.”

Orr quickly drew a handgun and fired at Smith, hitting him in the arm, neck, and torso. Smith panicked, and ran back to his unit. The video showed Smith’s bloody hand grabbing his radio and calling for help.

“Dispatch please tell my family I love them,” Smith said in the video.

According to WJCL, Smith is still recovering both physically and emotionally.

“I had nightmares sometimes about the incident. I’m still trying to heal up injuries to my arm,” Smith said.

WJCL reported that Smith’s neck and arm injuries have almost fully healed, and his physical therapy is nearly complete.

“I take it day by day with the support of friends and family and everybody else,” Smith said.

Despite his injuries, Smith said he has forgiven Orr.

WJCL reported that Orr was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 35 years in prison Wednesday. Smith said he prays for Orr and his family.

“Both our families are the ones really suffering the most. Violence and guns aren’t the answer, that’s why I became a police officer,” Smith said.

According to WJCL, Smith is still on medical leave, but he hopes to return to active duty with the Estill Police Department in 2018."

John Henry Barrett, 77, died in May from an infection and complications from the gunshot wound decades ago, and the Palm Beach County medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide.

Barrett was shot in the neck in 1958 at age 19 after a tense confrontation with a friend resulted in gunfire. The bullet, which damaged his spinal cord, left him partially paralyzed for the remainder of his life.

According to the Palm Beach Post, the shooter served time in prison for the crime, but the medical examiner’s report did not identify the shooter or indicate how long he had served time. Officials said they could not locate any information about the suspect in court records.

Barrett was a pastor for more than 30 years and became the first black executive director of the Pahokee Housing Authority. Although doctors told him he would probably never walk again, he eventually learned to walk using a cane. The Post recalled a 1974 interview he did with the Miami Herald when he told them he felt the incident was a blessing to his life.

“I don’t believe I’ll ever completely recover,” Barrett said in the interview. “But if the accident hadn’t happened, I would have spent all of my life as a farm worker.”

Family members said he tried to use his situation to inspire others around him. “He never wanted to be looked upon as [being disabled],” Terrance Lee, Barrett’s great-nephew, said. “He wanted to be looked up to as a normal person in society. That’s the way he lived his life.”"

According to the Jerusalem Post, the police are investigating how exactly the man made it through various security checkpoints, but believe that he did so by posing as a journalist.

“When the other officers saw the stabbing, they opened fire that led to him being incapacitated. When the troops approached the terrorist, they identified an explosive belt, which led to additional fire to prevent him from triggering it,” the police said in a statement.

The belt did not explode and Israeli police have opened an investigation into whether the man “had an explosive device on him or a fake explosive device on him.”

According to the Jerusalem Post, the Red Crescent took the wounded Israeli officer to Shaarei Tzedek hospital in Jerusalem, where he is in “moderate condition with two stab wounds in the upper body.”

In the eight-minute [GRAPHIC] video, the stabbing takes place out-of-frame. Amid screams and commotion, followed by several gunshots, and then the cameraman quickly rotates the camera as the man, backing up with his jacket open, shouts. The police shoot one shot into his left leg — he continues to step back — then one into his right leg — he falls backward, still looking toward the police — then once in his abdomen, sending the man backward into the ground.

The incident is the latest incident in a week of violence following President Donald Trump’s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Muslims throughout the world have protested the decision with violence and threats.

During a visit to European Union headquarters Monday in Brussels, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged EU members to follow Trump’s lead.

“For 3,000 years, Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people [and for 70 years] it has been the capital of Israel,” Netanyahu said. “I think what President Trump has down is put facts squarely on the table.”"
blaze47,blaze,['William Avitt'],2015-12-16 09:13:43-05:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/star-wars-why-han-shot-first-debate-is-still-important,"With the newest chapter of the “Star Wars” saga being released this weekend, we thought the time was right to revisit one of the franchise’s most prominent controversies: Han shot first.

For those not in the know, the controversy surrounds a change George Lucas made to the first film – Episode IV, ironically – when Han Solo was cornered in a seedy cantina by a bounty hunter named Greedo. In the original version, while Greedo has a blaster leveled at Han and is talking about how much he wants to shoot him, Han sneakily gets his own blaster out under the table and shoots the bounty hunter before his green-skinned adversary could get off a shot.

In 1997, in anticipation for the release of Episode “The Phantom Menace,” George Lucas re-released the original films in theaters with all new special effects and some deleted scenes put back in. Lucas dubbed these new cuts “Star Wars: The Special Edition.” It was in this “Special Edition” that he also made the change of having Greedo shoot first and miss, and then Han Solo shoot back.

For almost 20 years, this has been a hot button topic for fans. But it really is an important topic, and here’s why.

Back in 2012 Bill Whittle looked at this subject – which he called “this geek story” – from a real world point of view. To Whittle, it was a no-brainer that Han shot first. Why wouldn’t he shoot first? If someone who wants to kill you has a gun trained right on you, are you going to wait for them to shoot before you feel vindicated in “shooting back?”

To liberals, like George Lucas, that would seem to be the prudent thing. Let the bad guy shoot at you, and then you can shoot back and claim self-defense. If you shoot first, however – regardless of circumstances – you are a murderer. They would certainly have police live by this rule. The problem is, 10 times out of 10 if the bad guy gets the chance to shoot first, the good guy won’t have the opportunity to shoot back at all. He will be dead.

Writing for “Vulture,” attorney Josh Gilliand even explains step-by-step why Han Solo was perfectly justified under the law – albeit our own human law – for taking the first shot at Greedo.

According to George Lucas, however, Greedo always shot first. The original cut just had a bad camera angle.

“The controversy over who shot first, Greedo or Han Solo, in ‘Episode IV,'” Lucas told The Hollywood Reporter, “what I did was try to clean up the confusion, but obviously it upset people because they wanted Solo to be a cold-blooded killer, but he actually isn’t. It had been done in all close-ups and it was confusing about who did what to whom. I put a little wider shot in there that made it clear that Greedo is the one who shot first, but everyone wanted to think that Han shot first, because they wanted to think that he actually just gunned him down.”

So to George Lucas, and presumably all of his liberal friends, fans who argue with the change just wanted Han Solo to be a cold-blooded killer. You know what, though? He’s correct. Even though, in a real world scenario, Bill Whittle is completely right and the moment that Greedo pulled his gun on Han Solo, Han was justified in killing him in self-defense, the fans do want Han to be a cold-blooded killer.

You see, that gives Han Solo a character arc. It shows how the character changed through the course of the film.

When we first meet Han Solo, it’s in a seedy bar, negotiating a price for doing a highly illegal thing. Han Solo is a smuggler; a pirate. Han Solo is not a good person, nor is he a heroic character. He kills another man in cold blood – for the sake of argument – and he spends the rest of the film reminding everyone that he’s not doing this for the Rebellion, or any idealistic crusade, he’s in it for the money. That’s it, he wants his reward and then he’s hitting the bricks.

Han Solo does, in fact, get his reward and then leave just as Luke Skywalker and the rebel pilots are going on a dangerous mission to blow up the Death Star. He doesn’t care because their mission isn’t his.

It’s Han Solo, however, at the climax of the film, who returns to help and saves Luke from being blasted out of the metaphorical sky and clears the way for him to destroy the Death Star. While Luke fires the fatal shot, that shot never would have been fired had Han Solo not decided to come back and help his friend.

You see, Han Solo has an arc. He goes from a not-so-nice character in a seedy bar, to a reluctant hero, and finally to the heroic character we remember him as through the course of that film. Forcing Han into the anti-gun left’s idea of morality and heroism causes that arc to become much less drastic, less meaningful, and therefore less important to the story.

What George Lucas knew in 1977 and seems to have forgotten – mostly due to his Hollywood liberal programming – is that developing your characters is important. Yes, George, we do want Han Solo to be a cold-blooded killer, but not because we’re blood thirsty. It’s because we want his character to be important to the story, and for that his arc must remain intact.

Why do police think it was suicide?

Kentucky state Rep. Dan Johnson was found on a bridge dead from a gunshot wound. Police discovered the body after being contacted by someone who was concerned over a post the lawmaker made on his Facebook account.

“The accusations from NPR are false GOD and only GOD knows the truth, nothing is the way they make it out to be,” he wrote. “AMERICA will not survive this type of judge and jury fake news . Conservatives take a stand.”

“I LOVE GOD and I LOVE MY WIFE, who is the best WIFE in the world,My Love Forever ! My Mom and Dad my FAMILY and all five of my kids and Nine grandchildren two in tummies and many more to come each of you or a total gift from GOD stay strong, REBECCA needs YOU,” he continued.

“9-11-2001 NYC/WTC, PTSD 24/7 16 years is a sickness that will take my life, I cannot handle it any longer. IT Has Won This Life . BUT HEAVEN IS MY HOME. “PLEASE LISTEN CLOSELY, Only Three things I ask of you to do,if you love me is (1)blame no person,Satan is the accuser, so blame the Devil himself. (2) Forgive and Love everyone especially yourself .(3)most importantly LOVE GOD. P.S. I LOVE MY FRIENDS YOU ARE FAMILY ! GOD LOVES ALL PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT !” the post concluded.

What were the molestation allegations?

Johnson was under investigation over accusations that he kissed and fondled a 17-year-old in 2012 while he was a pastor at Heart of Fire City Church. The incident allegedly happened on New Year’s Eve after Johnson had drank too much alcohol.

He had vehemently denied the allegations, but had not been charged criminally.

Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin tweeted about the apparent suicide Wednesday.

Saddened to hear of tonight’s death of KY Representative Dan Johnson…My heart breaks for his family tonight…These are heavy days in Frankfort and in America…May God indeed shed His grace on us all…We sure need it… — Governor Matt Bevin (@GovMattBevin) December 14, 2017

blaze49,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-06-01 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/01/teen-shot-dead-after-allegedly-pointing-gun-at-off-duty-customs-agent-but-lawyer-calls-it-a-murder,"A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot by an off-duty U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent after the teen allegedly attacked the agent on a southern California sidewalk and then pointed a gun at him and demanded his property, authorities told KABC-TV.

The fatally shot teen, identified as Darius Smith, was with a pair of 14-year-old accomplices when they allegedly attacked the agent from behind just after 8 p.m. Friday in Arcadia, authorities told the station.

The agent said he had exited a train — and so did the teens, law enforcement officials told KCBS-TV.

At a street corner, one of the teens allegedly came at the agent from behind while one struck him in the head and another pointed a gun at him and demanded his property, officials told KABC.

“The victim thought the subjects were going to rob and shoot him so he retrieved his department-issued handgun,” Caroline Rodriguez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy told the station. “The victim shot at the subjects in an effort to defend himself.”

The teen with the gun and one of his accomplices were hit by the agent’s gunfire, investigators told KABC. Arcadia police recovered a handgun at the scene that Smith allegedly held, deputies said in a statement to the station.

Smith was pronounced dead at a hospital Saturday morning, the sheriff’s department told KABC.

But the lawyer for Smith’s family said the teen was murdered.

“Darius Smith was executed,” attorney Lee Merritt told KABC in a follow-up story. “He was not in the midst of a robbery. He was shot twice in the legs first. [He fell] and his shooter got over him and shot him three times in the chest. That’s a murder. That’s not subduing the robbery.”

Smith’s family wants the agent to face criminal charges, KABC reported, adding that Merritt and members of Black Lives Matter said young black men often are falsely portrayed as criminals — and that Smith was anything but.

Jasmine Abdullah of Black Lives Matter told the station that Smith was “a child of God, he was a good kid, he was an aspiring football player and we’re asking that justice be served.”

The second suspect in the incident remained hospitalized with gunshot wounds that weren’t life-threatening. The third teen fled on foot unharmed but was later found at a nearby home, taken into custody and booked at a juvenile facility on suspicion of robbery, the station said.

The two teens still face robbery charges, but Smith’s family and their attorney said those charges should be dropped.

“Them boys didn’t do that,” Smith’s mother Reshawna Myricks told KCBS. “They aren’t those type of boys to do that.”

The gun found at the scene turned out to be a replica, KCBS reported.

The agent — whose name wasn’t released — suffered facial bruises in the incident but required no medical attention, KABC said."

A Facebook post describing the reason why has gone viral.

What happened?

The day after the shooting, Ben Dickmann vowed to surrender his AR-57 rifle, the same style of firearm used by the Florida shooter just of a different caliber. The AR-15 shoots a 5.56 mm round, while the AR-57 shoots a 5.7 mm round.

On Friday, he did just that, surrendering the firearm to his local Broward County Sheriff precinct.

“I’m putting my money where my mouth is,” Dickmann wrote. “This is an AR-FiveSeven, I own this rifle. It’s a caliber variant of the AR-15. I am a responsible, highly trained gun owner.”

“However, I do not need this rifle. No one without a law enforcement badge needs this rifle,” he explained. “I have surrendered this rifle to the Broward Sheriff at the Tamarac Post. I could have easily sold this rifle, but no person needs this. I will be the change I want to see in this world. If our lawmakers will continue to close their eyes and open their wallets, I will lead by example.”

Dickmann posted pictures of his rifle and a Broward County Sheriff’s deputy filling out paperwork to accept the surrendered firearm along with his message.

In his Thursday Facebook post, Dickmann vowed to not sit idly by and not act while more massacres take place. In that post, he offered three suggestions of steps to take to come to a reasonable solution to the problem.

First, he said the development and importation of “new military style semi-automatic weapons and replacement parts” needs to end. Second, he said the Second Amendment should be limited to “militias,” and finally, he said urged better “control and training requirements” for firearm ownership.

“We need to start, we need to act. We need to be the generation that says enough is enough and we are going to start the wheels to stop this,” Dickmann wrote. “I know this is not going to stop overnight, but, if we don’t start to actually DO SOMETHING it will NEVER STOP.”

The post of Dickmann’s rifle surrender has gone viral, receiving more than 550,000 reactions and nearly one-quarter million shares."

The Blaze brings you the SSK industries .950 JDJ. It’s the biggest centerfire rifle ever made.

With a 2400 grain bullet, propelled by 240 grains of powder, the JDJ is comparable to a World War I-era tank round or a 20mm cannon in terms of kinetic energy.

Estimates are that one of these rounds would easily pass through several human targets– even if each were equipped with full body armor.

It was almost classified as a “destructive device” but a special “sportsman exception” was made for the JDJ.

The guys from Knight Rifles headed out to the range to give this monster a try. Very few people have ever shot the .950 JDJ as a rifle, as only 3 have been made.

This model was the first and the lightest coming in at a robust 50 lbs. The custom bullets cost about $40 each.

So what’s it like to shoot a bullet that nearly an inch wide and four inches tall? Well, it has been described as having “significant recoil” and in the video below, one of the shooters say “it’s like firing ten .30-06’s at once.”

Another shooter, after getting a taste of that vicious recoil, turned to his buddies and yelled “you lied to me. it kicks like a mule.”

But to custom rifle-maker George Gardner, a couple of scenes mean the world.

Gardner founded a rifle-making outfit in North Kansas City, Missouri, that Kyle mentioned in a very significant way in his autobiography on which the film is based:

“Since I’m talking about guns, I’ll mention that my current favorites are the weapons systems made by GA Precision, a very small company started in 1999 by George Gardner. He and his staff pay close attention to every detail, and his weapons are just awesome. I didn’t get a chance to try one until I got out of the service, but now they’re what I use.” (pp. 103-104, kindle version)

The post-active duty weapon to which Kyle referred in his book is the GA Precision Gladius model, Gardner told TheBlaze. In fact, the Gladius figures prominently in many later — and iconic — photos of Kyle.

So when it came time for Clint Eastwood to make the silver screen version of “American Sniper,” a cash-strapped production team came calling for Gardner in regard to Kyle’s favorite civilian-life long-distance shooter.

“They didn’t get enough money to be buying all the rifles,” Gardner told WDAF-TV in Kansas City. “So they asked us if I would loan them one for the movie and I said ‘Of course,’ which for me was great because I got it back with a letter stating it was in the movie, there’s pictures of Clint Eastwood holding it, pictures of Bradley Cooper holding it and so it’s cool to have it.”

Kyle never made spec requests for the Gladius — he simply used the standard model. “He didn’t ask for any changes,” Gardner told TheBlaze. But since each time the small outfit gets a rifle order, the weapon is built by hand — and that’s exactly what GA Precision did for “American Sniper.”

“It was in two good scenes,” Gardner told TheBlaze of the scenes in which the Gladius appears. “When he’s training four wounded vets at the range, and one where he and his son are hunting.”

As you can imagine, Gardner has received numerous offers from buyers interested in procuring the Gladius used in “American Sniper,” but he’s nixed them all, WDAF-TV reported. And you won’t find Kyle’s glowing endorsement of GA Precision in any of the company’s advertising, either.

Gardner just feels fortunate that his handiwork has become part of movie history — and that he got a final chance to see Kyle at the annual SHOT show before he was killed two years ago.

“I enjoyed talking to Chris when I got the chance,” Gardner told TheBlaze.

Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) is being mocked by gun rights advocates after he made a number of inaccurate statements while promoting a bill that would require individuals who manufacturer homemade firearms to undergo background checks.

“This is a ghost gun,” de Leon begins, holding an unloaded rifle in his hands. “This right here has the ability with a .30-caliber clip to disperse with 30 bullets within half a second. Thirty magazine clip in half a second.”

A “ghost gun” generally refers to a firearm that doesn’t have a serial number or a homemade gun, like one created using a 3D printer.

For those not familiar with firearms or gun-related terminology, there are a number of issues with de Leon’s argument.

Firstly, there is no such thing as a “30-caliber clip” in the context of which he is speaking. He clearly is referring to a 30-round magazine. An ammunition magazine is different than a “clip,” but the two are often confused by those not familiar with guns. And though it’s obvious, there is also no such thing as a “30 magazine clip.”

Secondly, caliber refers the measurement of the width of a bullet or internal diameter of a gun barrel, not magazine capacity.

According to the Associated Press, the rifle on display in the video is indeed a homemade fully automatic rifle. Still, a rate of fire of 60 rounds per second — or 3,600 rounds per minute — is unlikely with a “homemade” rifle. Fully automatic weapons are also essentially banned already, even if they are homemade. The average rate of fire for a semi-automatic rifle is roughly 120 rounds per minute, depending on the shooter and reload time.

Now, it’s entirely possible that de Leon got nervous during his public address and mixed up his words and numbers. But it’s also possible that he needs to brush up on his gun knowledge.

YouTube user David West put together a video pointing out the flaws in de Leon’s remarks. The video, featured below, already has nearly 500,000 views.

“He’s got an older-model shotgun or rifle,” the caller said on Thursday’s 911 recording, WTVT-TV reported. “He’s got a bag that looked like ammunition.”

“And where are the weapons now?” the dispatcher inquired, the station said.

“He was walking right into the school with it,” the caller answered, according to WTVT.

That prompted a lockdown at the Bradenton school, the station said.

And indeed it turns out the object was a rifle — and more than that, it was being carried by a teacher at the middle school.

Problem was, however, that the rifle is a Civil War-era replica the history teacher brought in to show students that day, the Bradenton Herald reported. The rifle can’t be fired, the station said.

The teacher previously informed a school resource officer about the rifle, the paper reported, but the officer wasn’t aware the teacher was bringing it in Thursday. Michael Barber, spokesperson for Manatee County Schools, told the Herald that administrators and office staff should have been informed about the rifle. WTVT said that the teacher has been bringing the rifle to school for several years.

The lockdown was lifted before 9 a.m. — and before the the first bell, Barber told the paper.

“If somebody sees something, they’re going to pick up the phone and call, and they should,” Barber told WTVT. “We have to handle these things in such a way that the school administration, the school staff, and the school resource officers are involved, and it’s done in such a way that would not cause any alarm to anyone.”

Barber told the Herald that the teacher should’ve placed the rifle in a case so no one would mistake it for a working weapon. District administrators are going to review the incident and determine if there should be a policy prohibiting faculty from bringing to school anything resembling a weapon, WTVT reported.

“It very much looks like a real rifle, especially if you saw an adult walking around on campus with it. It would be pretty scary,” parent Wendy Buckner told the station after looking at a photo of the rife. “I was very nervous especially for all the kids that I know that go here and that I knew were probably already at school and my daughter, fortunately, wasn’t there yet. But you think about something like that and especially with everything that’s happened — terrorist bombings and shootings in schools — it’s terrifying some days.”

Buckner told WTVT she dropped off her daughter only after learning the campus was safe.

It was the first time he’s ever told the story publicly.

Richard Kim rushed to his parents’ store in Koreatown when he heard that his mother had been shot on the second day of the riots. Arriving on the scene, he said the streets were in chaos with the police seemingly abandoning the area. He had a legally obtained Ruger semi-automatic rifle and shot at cars near what he believed were the shooters. They drove away quickly.

Kim’s mother was taken to the hospital, and he stayed to protect the store. Kim was relieved when he spotted police, but they quickly handcuffed him and confiscated his gun. They had heard reports that Korean Americans were indiscriminately shooting into crowds.

His wife, who was his fiancée at the time, recalled seeing his detainment on television.

“He was on his knees. He was being handcuffed along with some of his employees,” she said. “My heart just dropped to the pit of my stomach, and I couldn’t make sense of any of what I was seeing on TV.”

Police let Kim go when they couldn’t find anyone who was shot, but they told him they were under strict orders to confiscate any guns. When he asked if they would be protecting the shop, they said no.

“Then you can’t take our weapons,” Kim told the policeman. “You’ll leave us sitting ducks.”

After looking him in the eye for a long time, Kim says the policeman handed him back his rifle without saying a word .

Although he was unable to save one of the two stores his parents owned, he took to a spot on the rooftop with his rifle to defend the second store. Kim says he stood guard without sleep for three days, watching other stores go up in flames. He was able to save the second shop.

Residents held events to mark the 25th anniversary of the riots that broke out in the wake of the verdict exonerating four Los Angeles policemen who were caught on videotape beating a black motorist, Rodney King.

Introducing the .700 Caliber, “Dinosaur Hunting WTF” rifle.

A member of the Cast Boolits firearms forums posted photos and video of this weapon and cartridges he built from scratch.

Everything you see below is customized craftsmanship, except the barrel.

The cartridge is named the .700 WTF (“What The F…”) and was made by “fire-forming a .50 BMG brass case, trimming it to 3 inches in length and then sizing it. The round is loaded with a 1132 grain paper patched .700 lead cast bullet.”

According to Firearm Blog, the rifle has a “16.25” barrel, can push the 1132 grain of lead up to 2300 fps. Thats 13,000 ft/lbs of energy, right up there with the .50 BMG and far exceeding the .700 Nitro Express. The cast lead bullet has enough energy to pass clean through a 1/4″ steel plate.

When a Tyrannosaurs Rex rampages through your neighborhood, this would seem to be the perfect tool for the job.

You can watch video of the .700 “WTF” put some rounds down range here, via Youtube:

blaze57,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2013-11-21 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/11/21/dashcam-video-released-of-vets-viral-arrest-for-rudely-displaying-rifle-on-hike-with-son-and-it-reveals-the-context-everyones-been-waiting-for,"Officials in Bell County, Texas, have released the dashcam footage of a police officer in Temple, Texas, disarming and arresting decorated veteran C.J. Grisham while he was on a hike with his son in March. The officer is seen grabbing the dad’s gun and then seemingly attempting to unlatch it from the man’s sling without telling him why or asking for permission.

Video recorded by Grisham and his son went viral earlier this year, but it did not show the moment the dad was approached and disarmed by the officer. He was later charged with “interference with duties of a public servant,” though the officer is heard in the video from March telling Grisham he was stopped for “rudely displaying” his rifle.

On Nov. 19, Grisham was found guilty by a jury of three men and three women of “interference with duties of a public servant” and ordered to pay a $2,000 fine. In an email to TheBlaze, the veteran said he plans to appeal the decision.

In the newly released dashcam video, officer Steven Ernis can be seen flagging down Grisham and asking him, “What are we doing?”

“We’re hiking,” Grisham replies.

Ernis, without warning, grabs Grisham’s AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and examines it.

“Some reason why you have this?” the officer asks in the video.

“Because I can,” Grisham shoots back.

“Well, OK,” Ernis says as he seems to attempt to unlatch the firearm from its sling.

That’s where things spun out of control.

“Hey, don’t disarm me man!” Grisham says, grabbing the butt of the rifle.

The officer immediately drew his pistol and yelled, “Get your hand off the gun!” Grisham removed his hand from his gun and protested before Ernis slammed him on his squad car, his pistol still in hand.

“You’re trying to disarm me illegally!” Grisham says.

“I am gonna disarm you,” Ernis replies. “Once I find out there’s no issue…you’re going to be on your way.”

Except he wasn’t allowed to go on his way after it was determined that Grisham’s firearms were legal and he wasn’t breaking any laws when he was approached by law enforcement. He was first charged with resisting arrest, but the charges were later downgraded.

In Texas, it is legal to open carry long guns, such as a rifle. Grisham has maintained from the beginning that he was illegally detained and disarmed without consent or notification.

But as the system is now on sale the manufacturer said demand has been so high there’s a wait list for interested customers.

The TrackingPoint rifle with its “Xact System” is classified as a “precision guided firearm,” and claims to be “the most accurate shooting system in the world.”

“It delivers five times the first-shot success rate of traditional systems, at targets up to 1,200 yards, regardless of shooter skill level,” TrackingPoint’s website states.

The system includes a custom rifle, ammunition, a tracking scope with “heads up display” and a guided trigger. The system adjusts for various factors including range, temperature, barometric pressure, wind and more.

Here’s all the shooter has to do:

Paints the target with the tag to lock on Watches as the tag persists, regardless of relative movement Aligns the reticle with the tag to produce the firing solution Squeezes and holds the trigger to arm the system

Watch this demo to see how the system works:

After being featured at the Shot Show earlier this year, TrackingPoint’s system is now for sale and demand is “overwhelming,” the company’s President Jason Schauble told NPR. He also noted that Remington Arms is interested in the technology for its rifles.

But not everyone is happy about the system that allows the potentially inexperienced to achieve an easy on-target shot. NPR provides more on this perspective:

One hunter who doesn’t want one is Chris Wilbratte. He says the TrackingPoint system undermines what he calls hunting’s “fair chase.” “It’s the traditional shooting fish in a barrel or the sitting duck. I mean, there’s no skill in it, right? It’s just you point, you let the weapons system do its thing and you pull the trigger and now you’ve killed a deer. There’s no skill,” Wilbratte says. […] Chris Frandsen, a West Point graduate who fought in Vietnam, doesn’t believe the TrackingPoint technology should be allowed in the civilian world. The gun makes it too easy for a criminal or a terrorist to shoot people from a distance without being detected, he says. “Where we have mental health issues, where we have children that are disassociated from society early on, when we have terrorists who have political cards to play, we have to restrict weapons that make them more efficient in terrorizing the population,” Frandsen says.

For these concerns, Schauble told NPR the company sells the firearm directly, not through gun dealers, so it can make sure customers are vetted. He also said there is password protection on the gun’s scope, which without being inputted would take the precision shooting capability out of the picture. It would still fire without a password but wouldn’t have “the tag/track/exact” capabilities.

Ars Technica reported in January that the cost for the TrackingPoint system starts around $17,000.

The system also comes with an app that can stream real-time video from the heads up display.

“This kind of technology, in addition to making shooting more fun for [the younger generation], also allows shooting to be something that they share with others,” Schauble told NPR.

blaze59,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2018-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/26/gun-show-in-florida-attracts-most-attendees-ever-after-deadly-mass-shooting-at-parkland-high-school,"A Florida Gun Show event attracted a record-breaking number of attendees over the weekend, organizers told WTSP-TV — almost 7,000 came to the show at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa on Saturday. More were expected Sunday, the station said.

While the gun show’s manager, George Fernandez, told the station he’s never witnessed such a large crowd, he concerned about the recent push for addition gun-control legislation in the wake of the recent deadly mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school.

“Some of persons that are attending are afraid that further legislation might impact their gun ownership rights,” Fernandez told WTSP.

What gun-control measures are being considered?

Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson (Fla.) told the station he wants to close the so-called “gun-show loophole,” which allows purchases at gun shows without background checks — as well as an assault weapons ban.

“When the NRA killed the law in 2004, the number of deaths as a result of assault weapons has grown up like a rocket taking off,” Nelson told WTSP.

Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s “action plan” to keep kids safe includes raising the legal age to buy a gun from 18 to 21, banning “bump stocks” and helping people who suffer from mental health issues, the station reported.

What does Fernandez have to say about possible legislation?

Fernandez told WTSP that about 95 percent of the vendors at the Tampa gun show are licensed dealers legally required to run background checks on buyers — and the remaining 5 percent of vendors are private citizens.

Several Florida counties have passed ordinances requiring private citizens to run background checks on gun buyers also, the station said.

But Fernandez added to WTSP that tightening the gun-show loophole wouldn’t have stopped the recent deadly mass shooting at Parkland, as 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz passed a background check before buying an AR-15.

“This was a mental health issue,” Fernandez also told the station. “This is someone that should have been identified from the beginning by law enforcement.”

What did a dad protesting the gun show have to say?

“If you want to protect yourself, get yourself a revolver or how about learning how to fight,” Sergio Gonzalez told WTSP.

What is the Florida Gun Show doing next?

The company canceled next month’s event in Fort Lauderdale after the mayor asked that the outfit show respect to the Parkland victims, but it will sponsor another Tampa show in late April or early June, the station said."

In the wake of the school shooting on Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made some comments about gun violence that were unintentionally ironic.

What did she say?

“When you see the effect of this extreme violence on a human body and especially the body of a child, maybe it will shock some people into understanding,” Harris told MSNBC while calling for gun control. “We cannot tolerate a society and live in a country with any level of pride when our babies are being slaughtered (emphasis added).”

Pat’s take:

Can you really say you care about “babies being slaughtered” when you have a 100 percent positive rating from pro-abortion group NARAL? In the 45 years since Roe v. Wade, there have been around 60 million abortions in the U.S.

“There is no bigger slaughter [in the U.S.] than the slaughter of American babies in the last 45 years,” Pat said on today’s show. “Biggest slaughter in American history.”

John Kennedy (R-La.) said America needs “more idiot control” as opposed to more gun control laws in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at a Florida high school earlier this month.

“I don’t think we need more gun control laws,” Kennedy told CNN Tuesday.

“Not a single one?” host John Berman asked.

“No. I think we need more idiot control,” Kennedy answered, referring to mass shooters who don’t suffer from mental illnesses. The senator added, “There’s an assumption that [Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz is] mentally ill. I don’t know that, so I will call him an idiot.”

Kennedy also said, “I happen to believe there is evil in the world.”

What is the solution?

Berman asked Kennedy that if no more gun control laws are needed, then what tool is available to keep guns out of killers’ hands?

“We have the tools in place,” Kennedy responded. “They’re not being implemented … the NICS database has holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through.”

More from CNN:

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, have proposed legislation, known as the Fix NICS bill, aimed at improving federal and states’ reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. But the bill was blocked Monday night from consideration and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said it doesn’t go far enough.

Kennedy told the network that while he supports the “spirit” of the bill, “I just don’t think it is gonna do anything.”

Why does Kennedy believe the Fix NICS bill won’t accomplish anything?

Kennedy told CNN the bill says federal employees — in order to encourage their compliance with the NICS — should be told that “if you don’t start doing your job, we’re going to take away your bonuses.”

“Why the hell are they getting bonuses to begin with?” a perturbed Kennedy asked.

He added that the bill indicates states should be told “pretty please” comply with the NICS and “we might give you more money, we’ll give you a leg up on getting grants.”

“That’s not going to accomplish anything,” he said.

Kennedy also noted that President Donald Trump should tell federal agencies to fire employees who don’t do their jobs with respect to reporting to the NICS rather than give them incentives to do their jobs.

“They already have an incentive to do their job,” Kennedy told CNN. “It’s called a job.”

He also said governors who “talk about the need to do something … can start by making sure their states are cooperating with the database.”

In the week since 17 people were killed during a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, gun control advocates have organized several national marches and other forms of protest calling for action by lawmakers.

What was in the letter?

Needville Superintendent Curtis Rhodes sent the following message to parents and students in a letter and on social media:

The Needville ISD is very sensitive to violence in schools including the recent incident in Florida. Anytime an individual deliberately chooses to harm others, we are sensitive and compassionate to those impacted. There is a “movement” attempting to stage walkouts/disruptions of the school through social media and/or other media outlets. Please be advised that the Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness!! Should students choose to do so, they will be suspended from school for 3 days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension. Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative. We will discipline no matter if it is one, fifty, or five hundred students involved. All will be suspended for 3 days and parent notes will not alleviate the discipline. A school is a place to learn and grow educationally, emotionally and morally. A disruption of school will not be tolerated. Respect yourself, your fellow students and the Needville Independent School District and please understand that we are here for an education and not a political protest.

When are the scheduled protests?

Students in Florida have planned the “March for our Lives” on March 24 in Washington, D.C.

The group that organized the Women’s March has planned a National School Walkout on March 14.

Another National School Walkout is planned for the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, April 20, organized by a student who lives near Sandy Hook Elementary, the site of a 2012 school shooting.

“Not liking guns is a millennial thing, it’s the cool thing to be against guns,” said Justin Vaughn, 17, who attends a Maryland High School. Vaughn, a Second Amendment supporter, told McClatchy News he feels like he is on the “wrong side” of the gun control debate.

How did students feel at CPAC?

Vaughn was relieved to be around other like-minded conservative students from across the nation during the CPAC meeting Friday at National Harbor, Maryland.

“This is like the only place I’ve seen where kids are on my side,” Vaughn said.

Many peers at his school view his pro-Second Amendment views as: “I’m supporting killers, when I’m really supporting people who want to protect the Constitution.”

Vaughn’s comments come as student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, have launched a very visible national campaign to support gun control. The students have become a powerful force, rallying many young people across the nation to support their cause. The Valentine’s Day shooting left 17 dead at the school.

Liberty Fuchs, 19, of Los Angeles, told McClatchy she strongly empathizes with the Florida students. But she questions if their tactics are alienating others who are sympathetic toward what the students went through. Fuchs cited social media comments that imply support for gun rights is akin to supporting school shootings.

“It’s so upsetting to hear them say you’re either for gun control or dead kids,” she said. “I don’t question their motives, of course they want to do something, and it’s been so powerful, so strong. But to turn it into an attack on the right wing? It’s like the feeling when you get bullied in high school because you believe in something different.”

What about college campuses?

Jacob Thomas, a 20-year-old student at Germanna Community College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said he feels his opinions on gun rights are being silenced.

“You can’t express that opinion, especially on college campuses,” he told McClatchy News.

The students are standing up for their beliefs, despite a growing group of peers who are planning campus walkouts and other protests against gun violence.

“The Second Amendment is what we’re protecting,” said Abby Brinkman, 22, a senior at Shawnee State University in Portsmouth, Ohio, told McClatchy News.

“People have been so quick to turn on gun owners rather than smart solutions,” she added.

Eric Folkerts, 20, a freshman University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, told McClatchy that he believes the Florida students are “victims being used as pawns in a way to advance a political agenda.”

“They’re 16, 17, 18, the reality is they really don’t know what they’re talking about,” he said. “Just because you go through a tragedy doesn’t mean you know the issues, the policy and the legislation.”"

Indeed, the homeowner spotted two suspects trying to break into his home, the station said, adding that he told police one of them — a 16-year-old male — pointed a gun at him.

But what the crooks likely didn’t know is that the homeowner holds a concealed pistol license and also was armed at the time, WDIV reported.

“There has to be a line-of-defense. It’s not something we want to do — it’s something we have to do,” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told “Fox and Friends” on Saturday.

What is the plan?

Dubbed the “Sentinel Program,” Judd explained that his department has devised and already implemented a plan that would become a “game-changer” if it was implemented on school campuses nationwide.

The plan is simple: Arm teachers with concealed weapons and train them to effectively defend students should the need ever arise. The program has already been put into action at Southeastern University in Lakeland, Florida, which is in Judd’s jurisdiction.

Judd explained that the process to choose which teachers to arm is extremely vigorous. He told the “Fox and Friends” hosts he only selects teachers with impeccable, crime-free backgrounds. Then, the teachers undergo rigorous training that includes meeting standards beyond those that Florida law enforcement must maintain. In addition, each selected teacher undergoes intense psychological evaluation.

Only after the teachers successfully complete the training are they honored as “special deputy sheriffs” and allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus.

What did Judd say?

If a program like his was in-place on Wednesday at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Judd said he believes “everything could have been different.”

“There’s no absolutes in life, but I can tell you this: At least two coaches were killed standing in front of and trying to protect kids. Don’t you believe it would be a game-changer if they had a gun to defend the children?” Judd said, adding:

Here’s the basic math: The average shooter his evil deed in two to five minutes…in fact in Broward County [where the shooting happened], it was three minutes. The average police response is plus five minutes. When 911 is called, the shooter is on the campus reeking havoc — that’s too late. We have got to wake up! Wake up and understand that we have to have more than one, that we have to have specially trained people that have concealed firearms that can run to the threat and protect our children.

Currently, the program has only been implemented in Polk County, Florida, but Judd explained he has presented it to the Florida legislature and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and has urged them to take action.

Will the plan be implemented?

Judd told the Fox hosts that he spoke with Scott on Friday about the plan, who vowed to take action, though Judd didn’t elaborate on the conversation. However, he stressed South Florida legislators would be a roadblock to a plan like his from being implemented.

Haley Leach had been vacationing in Hunter, New York, since November, the station said, but she did not possess a New York State pistol permit. She was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, WTEN-TV said.

While the 28-year-old was released on $200 cash bail, WTEN said more than a few folks are upset that New York’s failure to adopt a handgun reciprocity law is criminalizing innocent people.

What does a gun range manager have to say?

“It’s frustrating for people who don’t know the law,” Leslie McDermott, general manager of a gun range in Brunswick, told the station.

McDermott said customers with concealed carry permits from neighboring states like Vermont and Massachusetts regularly come in to his business to find out they might be breaking the law since their permits don’t count in New York, WTEN reported.

“Traveling through, see our sign, and stop in,” McDermott told the station. “They can’t shoot here because they don’t have a New York State pistol permit.”

What does a sheriff have to say?

Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple isn’t happy about the latest casualty of New York’s lack of gun reciprocity.

“We’re taking so many law-abiding citizens and basically making them criminals,” he told WTEN, adding that “doctors, pilots, lawyers, cops, firemen, whatever the case may be … they go to fly out, they get arrested.”

Apple said that until New York joins other states that have adopted the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, arrests like the one involving Leach — who has a court date in February — will continue, the station said.

“This is sad because it’s happening more and more,” Apple told WTEN.

What related incident just happened?

A Brooklyn woman shot her ex-boyfriend in the neck after he kicked open her apartment door on Dec. 30 — but the woman who defended herself was taken into custody, police sources said. Why?

She recently moved from North Carolina where her .40-caliber handgun was legal — but she didn’t have a New York gun permit.

blaze68,blaze,['Robert Rees'],2014-02-07 13:15:17-05:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/firearm-registration-bill-introduced-in-illinois,"Illinois State Rep. Kelly M. Cassidy (D-14) introduced a bill on Feb. 5 that would require gun owners to register every gun they own. According to the bill, called the Firearms Registration Act (HB4715), this would not just apply to new purchases but Illinoisans would also need to register guns they already own.

The bill’s synopsis explains [emphasis added]:

“Creates the Firearms Registration Act. Provides that every person in the State must register each firearm he or she owns or possesses in accordance with the Act.”

The bill also takes aim at ammunition ownership and purchases. Illinois residents would have to show proof of firearm registration in order to buy

ammunition [emphasis added]:

“Provides that a person shall not purchase or possess ammunition within this State without having first obtained a registration certificate identifying a firearm that is suitable for use with that ammunition, or a receipt demonstrating that the person has applied to register a suitable firearm under the Act and that the application is pending.”

Failure to comply with the bill would be a Class 2 felony. The penalty for Class 2 felonies in Illinois is three to seven years imprisonment and not more than a $200,000 fine.

In order to own a gun in Illinois, residents already have to apply for and possess a state issued “Firearm Owner’s Identification Card” (FOID). Illinois also just became the last state in the union to pass a concealed carry law. Residents must have a FOID card before they can apply for a concealed carry permit.

Since the concealed carry law passed last summer, the Illinois State Police have been bogged down by FOID card applications and concealed carry applications and even though the law went in to effect in January, the first licenses aren’t expected to be issued until March or April of this year.

blaze69,blaze,"['Jana J. Pruet', 'Sr. Staff Writer']",2017-11-28 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/28/hawaii-police-order-medical-marijuana-users-to-voluntarily-surrender-guns-and-ammo,"Hawaiian police sent medical marijuana users a letter ordering them to “voluntarily surrender” their firearms and ammunition.

According to federal law, patients who use medical marijuana are not allowed to own a gun. Federal law applies even in states that allow the medicinal or recreational use of the drug.

The letter signed by Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard says those notified have 30 days from receipt to transfer ownership or turn in weapons and ammunition to the police, Leafly reported.

What does the federal law say?

In 2011, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued an open letter to federal firearm licensees stating there are no exceptions to gun laws whether a particular state passes cannabis legalization laws or not. According to the ATF letter:

Any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms and ammunition.

Twenty-nine states have passed laws making it legal to use cannabis for medical or recreational use. California was the first to allow lawful use for medicinal purposes in 1996. In 2012, Washington and Colorado were the first to pass laws approving it for recreational use.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals upheld the federal law last year.

“It may be argued that medical marijuana users are less likely to commit violent crimes, as they often suffer from debilitating illnesses, for which marijuana may be an effective palliative,” the federal ruling stated. “But those hypotheses are not sufficient to overcome Congress’s reasonable conclusion that the use of such drugs raises the risk of irrational or unpredictable behavior with which gun use should not be associated.”

Hawaii opened its first marijuana dispensary in August, and it may be the first state to issue a notice to users regarding the surrendering of firearms, according to Leafly.

How did police know who uses medicinal cannabis?

RCMP Sergeant Patricia Neely said that “Firearms that were unsafely stored in plain sight were seized for safekeeping,” but Sgt. Brian Topham told the National Post that officers forced their way into many of the homes because of “urgent need.”

“We just want to make sure that all of those things are in a spot that we control, simply because of what they are,” Sgt. Topham said. “People have a significant amount of money invested in firearms … so we put them in a place that we control and that they’re safe.”

They will be returned to residents with proof of ownership after the evacuation order — which is now into its eighth day — is lifted, authorities say.

Business owner Brenda Lackey told the Globe and Mail: “Now what they’re doing is looking for firearms and ammunition. How do they have the right to do that? What does that have to do with the disaster? …This is martial law. What has happened to our country?”

“Absolutely incredible,” she added.

Lackey’s sentiment seemed to be pretty consistent with the rest of the frustrated crowd. Some of the members have apparently be threatening to rush the blockade in an effort to get back into their homes.

“We don’t want our town to turn into another New Orleans,” resident Jeff Langford told the National Post. “The longer that the water stays in our houses the worse it’s going to be. We’ll either be bulldozing them or burning them down because we’ve got an incompetent government.”

A woman in the crowd pointed out they can do more to repair their homes if they actually have access to them.

“We can do more there than we can out here,” she said.

When an officer attempted to calm the crowd by saying “imagine if something happens to you [if I let you in],” a member of the crowd shot back: “Are we children? We’re adults!”

Canada’s Sun News has more on the story:

The Conservative Prime Minister’s office has said in an email to the National Post that it believes the guns will be returned as soon as possible, and that “the RCMP should focus on more important tasks such as protecting lives and private property.”

Ed Burlew, a lawyer and firearms specialist in Ontario, weighed in on the legality of the RCMP’s apparent actions.

“This is without precedent, this is unreasonable search and seizure,” he said. “The entry was illegal, it’s against the charter, it was unreasonable search and seizure. There’s no judge that would uphold the evidence obtained through an illegal entry into a person’s home.”

The firearm maker announced last week that it would construct a set of extraterrestrial pistols made from a 4.5 billion-year-old meteorite that was first discovered in the sub-Saharan part of Africa in 1838.

“We wanted to raise the bar again,” Cabot founder and President Rob Bianchin said in a statement. “The pistol set will be a modern work of functional art and the ultimate set of luxury guns.”

The collectors piece is crafted from the Gibeon meteor, which is “believed to have landed on Earth during pre-historic times.”

“Not only is the age and metallurgical composition of the Gibeon meteor fantastical, it is considered the Cadillac of meteors in large part because of the aesthetic Widmanstattten pattern exhibited but the meteorites grain pattern once acid etched,” the Cabot Guns press release said.

A photo posted by cabotguns (@cabotguns) on Dec 26, 2015 at 7:34am PST

The set, which consists of a right and left handed 1911-style semi-automatic 45 pistol, has been dubbed “The Big Bang Pistol Set.”

Cabot Guns said a collector offered $250,000 alone based on the concept, but thinks the value of the “unprecedented” set could ultimately exceed $1 million.

“It’s both romantic and fascinating to imagine that this meteor traveled across the heavens for four billion years before landing on Earth and is now being transformed into Cabot pistols,” Bianchin said.

The guns will be shown in public for the first time at the NRA Annual Meeting and Convention in May.

Cheaper Than Dirt! recently announced that it was temporarily suspending online sales of firearms pending a review of its order processing and procedures. Well-known for its ability to process and ship orders within 24 hours, online sales have skyrocketed to a point where it may take up to 72 hours for firearms and other items to ship. “In light of recent events, we believe it is prudent to review our policies and procedures to ensure we can continue to provide the products and firearms our customers demand,” said Chief Operations Officer Roberta Wilson. “We will resume online sales once we update our process and continue as we have always done by shipping firearms only to FFL dealers.” Ms. Wilson closed with, “As a long-time supporter of the Second Amendment, we will continue to serve the needs of the firearms community while ensuring our unsurpassed level of quality and customer service.” Cheaper Than Dirt! prides itself on being America’s Ultimate Shooting Sports Discounter since 1993. Cheaper Than Dirt! boasts over 100,000 items available for purchase through their Web site and catalog. Articles, photos and videos appear daily on the Shooter’s Log at www.CheaperThanDirt.com/blog.

​UPDATE II ​Dec 19, 2:37 EST: Cheaper Than Dirt has changed the statement on its Facebook page. The new one notes the company has received an “overwhelming number of orders,” but still leaves in language about evaluating its process:

UPDATE 6:54 p.m. EST: Cheaper Than Dirt posted the following statement to its Facebook page at around 6 p.m. on Tuesday:

Cheaper Than Dirt! has temporarily suspended online sales of firearms. As a long time supporter of the Second Amendment, Cheaper Than Dirt! will continue to promote the safe and responsible use of firearms by law abiding customers. During this temporary suspension, we will review our policies and promotions.

No further information was provided.

–

Online gun retailer Cheaper Than Dirt announced Tuesday that it will be suspending certain firearm sales “effective immediately” pending an internal policy review. ​What exactly they are reviewing remains unclear, but the announcement has prompted swift reaction on the site’s Facebook page.

Their Facebook message reads:

“Cheaper Than Dirt! is suspending online sales of firearms effective immediately. We are reviewing our policy internally, and will continue to be the leader in the outdoor industry with our full line of gear and accessories.”

In less than 45 minutes, the message already had thousands of comments:

There are now over 8,000 comments in the two hours since the message was first put up. And because the post comes amid the fierce gun control battle after the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary last Friday– where 20 students and 6 adults were fatally shot– many are accusing the retailer of “selling out” to the gun control crowd:

It should be noted, though, that the company’s language does not specifically reference Sandy Hook or the current gun control controversy.

Dick’s Sporting Goods, however, has made it clear that it is taking action specifically because of the shooting. The retail giant announced Tuesday that it would be suspending the sale of modern rifles nationwide in light of the tragedy, declining to say exactly how long the suspension would last, or which guns would be pulled.

TheBlaze reached out to Cheaper Than Dirt for comment, but did not receive one.

​Full disclosure: Cheaper Than Dirt does advertise with TheBlaze.

That being the case, it’s important that we really examine all the facts surrounding gun violence.

So just how likely are you to be killed by a gun in the United States? The Economist has put together an interesting graphic that demonstrates your chances of getting killed by an array of things, including guns, heart disease, fire and more.

According to the Economist’s chart, your chances of dying as a result of “assault by firearm” is about 1 in 25,000. Americans also have a 1 in 514,147 chance of being killed by “firearms discharge. While still considered one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., the data certainly is at odds with the mainstream media narrative that all guns are simply mass killing machines.

The data from America’s National Safety Council suggests you are more likely to die from “intentional self harm,” an accidental injury or heart disease.

You are more likely to be killed by a gun than “walking,” choking or falling down the stairs. You are least likely to be killed by an asteroid impact (74,817,414 to 1), fireworks (50,729,141 to 1) or a bee sting (25,364,571 to 1).

Check out the graphic below (Click chart to see more):

Now, we also know that twice as many people are killed by “hands and feet” than semi-automatic rifles, which President Barack Obama and Democrats are looking to ban. There are also nearly five times more murders by knife than murders by so-called “assault weapons.”

This graph puts it in perspective, and calls into question how effective an “assault weapons” ban would actually be.

Five years before Nadir Soofi and his partner were shot to death by a responding officer after launching their failed attack, the 34-year-old reportedly visited a Phoenix gun shop.

According to the L.A. Times, Soofi wanted to purchase a 9-milimeter pistol, but knew prior misdemeanor drug and assault charges would be flagged in the federal screening process. Soofi, thus, went to Lone Wolf Trading Co., a shop known to sell firearms illegally.

The Phoenix gun shop, however, was part of the botched Fast and Furious operation, the L.A. Times reported. Federal authorities were allowing Lone Wolf to sell illegal firearms with the hope of tracing the weapons to drug cartels and smuggling networks.

Nonetheless, Soofi’s attempt raised flags and authorities put a seven-day hold on his ability to purchase a gun from the shop, the L.A. Times reported. However, for an unknown reason, that hold was lifted within 24 hours. Soofi left the shop with a 9-milimeter.

It was not clear whether that same weapon purchased five years prior to the Garland attack was used in the shooting, but federal authorities did contact Lone Wolf the following day, according to the L.A. Times.

The Garland attack left both shooters dead and a security officer wounded.

Such was recently the case for one woman, who had been in the hospital voluntarily for mental illness last year that she says was due to medication she was taking. Lynette Phillips of Upland, Calif., told TheBlaze in a phone interview Monday she had purchased a gun years ago for her husband, David, as a present. That gun, as well as two others registered to her law-abiding husband (who does not have a history of felonies or mental illness), were seized last Tuesday.

“My husband is upset that they took the right from us that should never have been taken, Phillips told TheBlaze.

But according to the state of California, that doesn’t matter.

“The prohibited person can’t have access to a firearm” regardless of who the registered owner is, Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, told to Bloomberg News.

According to the Los Angeles Times last week, budget cuts created a backlog of 19,000 people in the state with more than 40,000 guns that they are no longer legally allowed to own.

Such a Prohibited Armed Persons File is created through the Office of the Attorney General. When a person is entered into the Automated Criminal History System, the Consolidated Firearms Information System is also checked to see if they might have possession of a gun. The same check is conducted for those involuntarily admitted into the hospital for mental illness as well.

Bloomberg reported that nine police with the state’s Department of Justice wearing bulletproof vests and carrying Glocks went to homes on March 5 to retrieve the guns from people who, under this law, were no longer allowed to own. The Phillips family was one of them.

Phillips told TheBlaze the authorities arrived in unmarked cars Tuesday night around 8 p.m. Seeing as how she had never been in trouble with the law before, when they asked to enter, she said “sure,” not thinking to ask for a warrant. This gun confiscation law doesn’t go so far as to give officers warrants to enter property without permission.

Phillips explained that she and her husband were seated at their dining room table and questioned about the firearms. Phillips showed authorities where the weapons were located — a handgun in the top dresser drawer and two rifles in a safe in the garage. After Phillips unlocked the case in the garage, she said officers pulled her away from the guns and back into the house.

“They weren’t mean,” Phillips said. “I know they were just doing their job.”

But it’s a job Phillips said that never should have had to be done in the first place.

Phillips told TheBlaze she had an adjustment to her medication in December and could not stop crying. Her personal psychiatrist suggested she go to Aurora Charter Oak Hospital in Covina, Calif., where she said she was admitted voluntarily, not a threat to herself or others. Then, when she reviewed her file, Phillips said the nurse had recorded that she was involuntarily admitted and indicated she might be a suicide risk. Phillips claims the nurse had put words into her mouth.

“I kept telling her I had a grand-baby at home and had to be better for Christmas,” she said. “Does that sound like the words of someone who is a risk to themselves and others?”

Phillips believes — and noted online reviews of the center should substantiate her claims — that the process at the psychiatric hospital was a joke. Bloomberg contacted the hospital for a response regarding Phillips’ admittance but had not received a reply.

Still, the issue of patients potentially being misdiagnosed speaks of the larger implications of the laws that might apply following such a hospital admittance.

“Let’s see if we can’t prevent this from happening to someone else,” Phillips said, calling what has happened since she was in the hospital a “snowballing” effect.

“I do feel I have every right to purchase a gun,” she told Bloomberg. “I’m not a threat. We’re law-abiding citizens.”

She also pointed out the length of time it took before authorities had come to collect the firearms.

“This happened in December,” Phillips said. “I asked them at what point where they notified. They said between 24 to 48 hours after I was in the hospital.”

As Phillips pointed out, if she were truly a risk to herself or others, the authorities didn’t claim the guns in timely fashion. Timeliness could be what the state senate’s new funds for the collection of such firearms could be for. Some disagree, though, with where the new money is coming from. According to the LA Times, the $24 million would be made over three years from a fee paid for by those registering their guns in the state.

Bloomberg reported, according to state records, around 2,000 firearms, 117,000 rounds of ammunition and 11,000 magazines were collected under the law last year.

As for the Phillips family being reinstated with their firearms, she said they have to wait 30 days while an investigation is underway before she can appear in front of a judge who will determine her competency.

“What they are investigating, I have no idea.”

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives revoked the license of Riverview Gun Sales in East Windsor in December. The agency didn’t say why.

Authorities raided the store for undisclosed reasons shortly after the December school shootings in which Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He also shot to death his mother, Nancy, at their home. Authorities say he fired 154 shots with a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle inside the school, then killed himself with a Glock handgun.

Nancy Lanza purchased a Bushmaster from Riverview, according to a person close to the investigation into the school shooting who spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe is continuing. It could not be confirmed whether the Bushmaster was the one used in the shooting.

Shop owner David LaGuercia said in December that Nancy Lanza bought a gun from him years ago, but he couldn’t remember what kind. LaGuercia said at the time he was cooperating with law enforcement.

“There is nothing more devastating than the loss of a child,” LaGuercia said in a statement in December. “We are absolutely appalled that the product that we sold several years ago would be used in this type of horrendous crime. Our hearts go out to the victims and the families.”

His wife, Shelley Clemens, said Friday that she and her husband still don’t know why the ATF revoked his firearms license. She said the store remains open selling ammunition and other items while LaGuercia appeals the revocation.

“They just came in the store after Sandy Hook, raided the store and took away the license,” she said, referring further questions to her husband. LaGuercia, of Agawam, Mass., didn’t return phone messages Friday.

Clemens said in December that store records show one gun was sold to Lanza.

The weapons used in the shooting had all apparently been purchased by Nancy Lanza, prosecutor Stephen J. Sedensky III said last week when search warrants were unsealed showing the Lanzas’ home was packed with weapons and ammunition.

According to its website, Riverview Gun Sales, about 15 miles north of Hartford and about 65 miles northeast of Newtown, sells a variety of rifles and pistols, including Bushmaster and Glock.

The shop also sells high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones authorities say were used by Adam Lanza. In a law passed this week, Connecticut banned the sale or purchase of magazines holding more than 10 rounds."
blaze77,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2015-02-25 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2015/02/25/maker-of-a-machine-that-produces-ar-15-part-fedex-is-refusing-to-ship-my-product,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed, the organization that has made headlines for its 3-D printed firearms, has another product that can help gun hobbyists make their own parts. He has run into a snag, though, which he said he feels is indicative of a larger problem that leads to a “total state mentality”: FedEx won’t ship it.

Ghost Gunner by Defense Distributed is a computer numerical control mill that has software that allows users to make AR-15 lower receivers without serial numbers. Preparing to ship Ghost Gunner, Wilson was working with FedEx as a member of its FedEx Advantage/NRA Business Alliance, which provides discounts.

All was going well until last week. Wilson told TheBlaze FedEx decided not to ship his product. Wilson said his account executive, in the last few weeks, started asking more about the legality of the mill and on Friday said the company would not do business with it. Wilson still has not received a formal statement explaining why, but said his account executive said the company had issues with the machine because it was unregulated.

“Maybe they just wanted an excuse to not ship my product,” Wilson added.

Wilson told TheBlaze that he explained in conversations with his FedEx account executive that Ghost Gunner is just an industrial tool that has software allowing it to make the gun part.

“It’s just a mill people can have, a tool to make rifles in this country,” Wilson said.

According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, it is lawful for citizens to make their own firearms without a license if they are not for sale or distribution and if the person is legally allowed to own their own firearms.

Why would anyone have use for such a personal machine like Ghost Gunner though? Wilson said that earlier this year a law went into effect that makes it illegal to take an AR-15 lower receiver that’s 80 percent complete to a machine shop or gunsmith and use their machines to finish it.

“You now have to own the tool you use to make your lower receiver,” Wilson said.

Hence, why Ghost Gunner was created as a tabletop mill that gives people the ability to “legally manufacture unserialized AR-15’s in the comfort and privacy of your home.”

Gun parts aren’t the only thing that Ghost Gunner can make though. Wilson said the machine could be programed to make other items out of aluminum as well, giving bottle openers as an example.

In a statement to Wired, FedEx spokesman Scott Fiedler said that the company decided not to ship Ghost Gunner with Defense Distributed because it is “uncertain at this time whether this device is a regulated commodity by local, state or federal governments. As such, to ensure we comply with the applicable law and regulations, FedEx declined to ship this device until we know more about how it will be regulated.”

FedEx did not respond to TheBlaze’s request for comment at the time of this posting.

Watch this video from Defense Distributed showing the capabilities of Ghost Gunner:

Wilson told TheBlaze that he knew early on he would have to be prepared to answer questions about the machine’s legality.

“This is an unregulated activity,” Wilson said about the legal advice he received on the product. “There are no special implications.”

Wilson called FedEx’s position a “defacto ban on free activity.”

“I understand this is a private company and they can do business with whomever they please,” Wilson said. But he said he thinks when it comes to unregulated activities, the “default position should be a liberty perspective.”

Things like 3-D printers, drill presses and other industrial tools, Wilson said, are currently shipped by FedEx, but they too could be used to help make gun parts.

Wilson said he thinks FedEx probably felt the need to take this position on Ghost Gunner because of the fact that it can make a firearm piece, which could be seen as controversial in the current political atmosphere.

“This is the very death of the innovative, intrepid spirit of American [entrepreneurship],” Wilson said. “It’s completely antithetical to the ideas of the original American spirit.”

Defense Distributed is not stranger to legal controversy. Two years ago, the group’s forum that hosted 3-D printed gun designs went dark as the government “[claimed] control of the information.” The 3-D printer company Stratasys also pulled out of letting the group rent one of its machines a few years ago.

According to the Ghost Gunner blog, it sold out of its originally anticipated amount within 24 hours of pre-orders being made available last fall. Several hundred Ghost Gunners were being manufactured as of late January with the hope they would ship in February.

With FedEx pulling out, Wilson said he’s looking at other couriers.

“I’m pursuing all available options at this point,” he said.

blaze78,blaze,['Mike Opelka'],2013-03-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/03/26/rejected-gun-store-cancels-ar-15-purchase-by-gabby-giffords-husband,"An Arizona gun store cancelled a purchase made by former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords’s husband Mark Kelly. On March 5th, Kelly visited Diamondback Police Supply in Tucson, selected an AR-15 style rifle, a .45 caliber handgun, and some high capacity magazines, completed a background check and paid for his purchases.

Within days, the story broke nationally and Kelly claimed that his purchases were made to highlight how easy it is to get a gun. He also added that he intended to turn the AR-15 into the Tucson Police. The story sparked almost 4,000 comments to Mark Kelly’s public Facebook page, many of them not very supportive of his intentions.

The former astronaut told CNN that he intended to keep the handgun.

The store, Diamondback Police Supply in Tucson has now rejected Kelly’s March 5th purchase, and has sent him a full refund. The decision was announced on the company’s Facebook page, in a post from the Diamondback’s owner/president Douglas MacKinley:

“While I support and respect Mark Kelly’s 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use. In light of this fact, I determined that it was in my company’s best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store to complete the Federal From 4473 and NICS background check required of Mr. Kelly before he could take possession this firearm. A full refund was sent to Mr. Kelly, via express mail, on Thursday of last week.”

If you were wondering why it took so long for the transaction to be completed, the delay was due to a local regulation that requires a 20-day waiting period for private gun purchases. The rifle Kelly selected was a used weapon and that kind of transaction is treated as a private sale and the 20-day wait applied. Mark Kelly had not returned to pick up the gun.

Diamondback Police Supply has also announced that the rifle Kelly selected will be donated to the Arizona Tactical Officers Association (ATO), to be raffled off to raise funds for the group. ATO raises money to purchase much-needed equipment for SWAT teams. MacKinley also said that his company will make a $1295 (the price of the rifle) donation to the NRA’s Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program.

Mark Kelly’s representatives have not responded to requests for comments on the rejected purchase of the AR-15 style rifle."
blaze79,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2014-02-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/10/the-key-piece-of-information-that-even-some-conservative-media-are-missing-about-this-awesome-ar-15-sure-to-drive-gun-opponents-wild,"With a few cosmetic changes, gun manufacturers recently discovered a way to make the popular AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle compliant with New York’s anti-gun SAFE Act, the Times Union reports.

However, even though reports on the redesigned rifle were circulating on Monday, the Times Union report and photo cited in nearly all posts are actually both from last May. The news even made Drudge Report. Given the resurgent popularity, we’re trying to figure out what the reaction to the rifle has been since May — and more importantly, if the gun is currently being sold anywhere in New York.

On May 23, the Times Union reported: “Gun dealers, with the help of machine shops and gunsmiths, are on the cusp of offering what they call NY SAFE-compliant AR-15s and other military-style rifles.”

Because the semi-automatic rifle is no more powerful than many hunting rifles in terms of firing power, doing away with certain cosmetic features — like an adjustable stock, pistol grip and flash suppressors — transforms the “assault rifle” into a legal, somewhat odd-looking rifle in New York. Under the SAFE Act, magazines still can’t be capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

“Thanks to modifications by a Texas-based machine shop, the stripped-down rifle has an adapter that connects the spot where the grip would go to the stock, or portion of the rifle that the shooter braces against her shoulder,” the report states.

Further, an attorney representing a New York gun shop previously received an approval of sorts from a State Police lawyer, who confirmed that the AR-15-style rifles should be legal so long as they do not include any of the characteristics banned by the law. Again, that was back in May. It’s unclear if the gun shop has since moved forward with its plans to carry the redesigned rifle.

James Tresmond, an attorney representing H&H Firearms in western New York, told the Times Union that the gun is “basically an AR-15 without the features.”

We were unable to contact H&H Firearms before the shop closed on Monday. Attempts to contact the owner, Justin Reickart were unsuccessful.

The workaround is reportedly already riling up some anti-gun advocates who still see the AR-15 as a scary “assault weapon.”

According to the New York State Assembly website, the SAFE Act allows magazines to be loaded with seven rounds, however, “since very few guns are currently sold with 7 round magazines, the sale and possession of magazines with a capacity of up to 10 rounds will continue to be legal.”

The law also prohibits “military-style weapons that include one or more features that increase the lethality of the weapon.”

Pro-gun advocates will almost certainly argue the cosmetic change only reinforces that banning something based on the way it looks is ineffective.

But Long Island Democratic Assemblywoman Michelle Schimel previously argued the banned features only increase the weapon’s killing power.

“A pistol grip helps you keep firing on a target. Each characteristic has a specific battle component,” she said.

As National Review notes, “Fewer people are killed with all rifles each year (323 in 2011) than with shotguns (356), hammers and clubs (496), and hands and feet (728).”

blaze80,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-02-21 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/21/why-is-this-ar-15-being-called-the-most-terrifying-thing-on-the-internet,"Among the many subcultures on the community forum website Reddit is a lesser known “gunsforsale” subreddit where some firearms are being sold.

And there’s something on there that’s being called “the most terrifying thing on the internet.”

So what is it? Well, among the latest of the weapons to show up on the site is an AR-15 engraved with Reddit’s very own alien icon. It was posted by the Redditor x—x–x-x four days ago for $1,150. For an extra $50 the seller said he would include 200 rounds and a magazine loader with the rifle, case and magazines.

Here’s more from the seller’s description about the gun:

The deets: *Custom engraved Reddit lower purchased in initial Reddit lower buy. *PSA lower parts kit *PSA bolt carrier group *BCM 14.5″ mid upper w/ pinned flash hider *Troy battlesight affixed to rear *OD Green Magpul MOE furniture *3 OD Green windowed PMAGs *Blackhawk! soft case I’ve only put a couple hundred rounds through it since building it in, I think, August of 2011. I love it, it’s a great-looking, soft-shooting gun, but I never get to shoot the thing so it’s just oiled up sitting in my safe and I’m looking to get a nice shotgun (Citori 725 field) since I shoot that every Sunday at the trap club and I love upland game hunting.

The seller stated that he was hoping to sell it to a fellow Redditor. x—x–x-x received “heavy interest” for the Reddit-themed firearm that he decided he would only sell it to people with whom he could meet face-to-face if there was an offer by Tuesday.

There was.

The seller explained in a further update that he had tentatively accepted an offer from someone who would be able to complete the transaction in person, but if it fell through he said he would work with “one of two out-of-state purchasers using an [federal firearms license] transfer.”

This is where we get to the part where the rifle is referred to as “the most terrifying thing on the Internet,” by Gawker.

“Users of the internet culture behemoth Reddit are not famous for their level-headedness or discretion,” Gawker’s Adrian Chen explains.

“So it was a bit discomfiting to spot this AR15 assault rifle—the same kind of gun used by Newtown shooter Adam Lanza—with a cute little Reddit alien logo engraved into it for sale on the site,” he adds.

Redditors, as the gossip site notes, are relatively Libertarian, at least when it comes to the First Amendment. As for its pro-Second Amendment leanings, the site has more than 100,000 followers on the /r/guns subreddit, more than 8,000 for /r/firearms, and /r/progun has more than 6,000.

Even with these firearm-supporting subreddits, there are others who have called for administrators to take a stand against sale of guns on the site.

In a thread nearly a month ago, one Redditor said eight “assault rifles” were sold through the website.

“It is time for reddit to ask itself whether it is morally justifiable for it to continue to allow the sale of guns,” the Redditor Gabour wrote.

“Although I’m trying not to resort to hyperbole here, I think it fair to say that reddit has some blood on its hands for endorsing these transactions [emphasis added],” the post continued.

“And that is something that needs to be addressed. Although it may be questionable to some whether Reddit has a moral obligation to stop the proliferation of guns in the United States, there should be no doubt that it should not be directly participating in it.”

Many websites where individuals act as sellers and buyers, like Craigslist and eBay, have banned the sale of firearms due to strict regulations regarding their sale.

If the seller of the alien-engraved rifle is unlicensed (we aren’t told either way), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives states that if both people are unlicensed individuals within the same state, the firearm can be sold provided the seller “does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law.”

Here’s more from the AFT regarding private sales:

When a transaction takes place between private (unlicensed) persons who reside in the same State, the Gun Control Act ( GCA ) does not require any record keeping. A private person may sell a firearm to another private individual in his or her State of residence and, similarly, a private individual may buy a firearm from another private person who resides in the same State. It is not necessary under Federal law for a Federal firearms licensee ( FFL ) to assist in the sale or transfer when the buyer and seller are “same-State” residents. Of course, the transferor/seller may not knowingly transfer a firearm to someone who falls within any of the categories of prohibited persons contained in the GCA . See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and (n). However, as stated above, there are no GCA -required records to be completed by either party to the transfer.

ATF states that if the sale is between two people who reside in different states, then the firearm is shipped to a FFL in the state of the buyer.

Based on this Redditor’s post, it appears as if he were following the law regarding his transaction.

Derek Poe, 26, owns Golden Triangle Tactical at the Beaumont Parkdale Mall. KBMT-TV reports that he entered the Game Stop store in the mall before going to his own store.

Video of the aftermath of the incident has surfaced showing Poe talking with authorities:

KMBT has a picture of Poe carrying his rifle:

Beaumont Police Sgt. Rob Flores told the Houston Chronicle that Poe turned himself in on Friday after the district attorney’s office issued a warrant for his arrest. The mall incident occurred on Dec. 28.

Flores said authorities got calls from shoppers who said they were “very afraid,” “terrified” and “thought they were going to die.”

However, Poe said he was operating within the law.

“It was clearly obvious I didn’t have criminal intent. I had a drink in one hand and a bag in the other. I didn’t commit a crime. I legally carried a long arm in Texas,” Poe told KBMT-12 News.

Poe was not arrested but did have his rifle confiscated as police investigate.

The Texas open carry law allows state residents to carry rifles if it’s not done in a threatening manner. Handguns are not allowed to be carried in open, and a person must have a concealed carry handgun license.

TheBlaze has published a graphic showing the rights people have been dealing with police officers.

They say he burglarized a home twice the night before, stealing several items, including two guns.

In a statement, investigators said 19-year-old Genaro Hernandez Mendoza of West Salem, Ore. was heading to his family’s farm when he broke into a home on Independence Highway and stole several items. He then returned to the farm and hid the stolen items behind a barn.

Police say he then stole a pickup truck and returned to the same home he had already burglarized to steal more items, including a shotgun and an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.

Detective John Williams says investigators found a shotgun and the rifle Sunday morning, side by side on the passenger-side floorboard of a stolen farm truck, barrels pointed at the driver.

Williams says it appears that a lever on the shotgun got into the trigger guard of the rifle. When the truck hit a bump in the road, the rifle fired once, striking and killing Mendoza in a freak accident.

However, Sheriff Bob Wolfe said police are still investigating the incident to make sure no other parties were involved in the burglary. He added that it seemed clear that Mendoza’s death was accidental and the result of failing to safely store the weapons he stole.

The Associated Press contributed to this report. This story has been updated.

In stark contrast, a 7-year-old little girl shot an AR-15 for the first time and had a very different reaction. The noise and recoil from the semi-automatic rifle didn’t seem to bother the girl one bit.

“That was pretty good!” she exclaimed.

The video was uploaded by a dad who runs the Haus of Guns Facebook page.

As for Kuntzman, he said his experience with the “horrifying, menacing and very very loud” gun traumatized him.

“The recoil bruised my shoulder. The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary case of PTSD,” he recalled. “For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.”

Target shooting isn’t for everyone, apparently.

blaze84,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2016-06-21 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/06/21/ny-times-leaves-out-vital-context-on-gun-experts-disputed-ar-15-claim-and-he-says-pro-gun-critics-have-it-all-wrong,"The New York Times came under fire this week for reporting that the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle was capable of firing eight rounds per second. The gun expert behind the claim, who told TheBlaze he has received some “nasty calls” since the publication of the article, said the Times left out vital context behind the figure he provided.

Sam Andrews, owner of Tier One Weapons Systems, said New York Times reporter Alan Feuer asked him specifically for the highest “rate of fire” capability of an AR-15.

The Times summed up Andrews’ response like this:

Because of its gas-operated system, Mr. Andrews said, the AR-15 has a fairly gentle recoil. The weapon is also fast and accurate, he added, able to fire, under capable hands, eight rounds in a second.

There was no additional explanation.

Andrews said the Times article failed to mention that his claim centered around the technical definition of rate of fire by skilled shooters and also the common technique of “bump fire.”

He said all it takes is a quick YouTube search to find videos demonstrating how to “bump fire” an AR-15, essentially turning a semi-automatic rifle into almost fully automatic. Here’s an example:

He said even a novice shooter can be taught how to bump fire fairly quickly.

Due to the phrasing in the Times article, many readers assumed he was claiming 8 rounds per second is an average rate of fire. But without bump fire, Andrews said such a skill requires training and practice — but it is possible. For example, he claimed to know “special operators” who can fire 10 rounds per second with a “good trigger” and muzzle break on an AR-15.

Citing the video of competitive shooter Jerry Miculek used in TheBlaze’s initial report, Andrews said true definition of “rate of fire” doesn’t include reaction time. If you do the math, he claimed, Miculek is capable of firing at a rate of roughly 10 rounds per second.

In the video, Miculek fired five rounds in 1.08 seconds. His reaction time was .55 seconds. If you remove the reaction time, he was able to fire five rounds in just over half a second.

Any shooter who can fire an AR-15 with a split time, or the time between shots, of .12 seconds or less can achieve a rate of fire of eight rounds per second, according to Andrews. There are many shooters with that capability, he said. There is, of course, a question of accuracy with such a high rate of fire.

“When asked the question, ‘What is the potential rate of fire’ of a particular weapon, as an engineer, I must tell the truth,” Andrews told TheBlaze, adding that he wasn’t pleased that the piece was lacking important context. “What people do with that truth, it’s up to them; it’s not about me.”

Andrews told TheBlaze he has learned by now that 99 out of 100 reporters will report his comments out of context in some way.

“You have to make a decision to either stop talking to the press or accept that,” he added.

Andrews also addressed his critics who have insinuated that he is somehow anti-Second Amendment and helping anti-gun advocates push gun control amid calls to ban so-called “assault rifles.”

“The federal government has zero authorization under the Constitution to infringe on anyone’s right to own a gun,” he said. “So anyone who says I am anti-Second Amendment is completely insane, and that has nothing to do with the potential rate of fire of a given weapons system.”

blaze85,blaze,['Jonathon M. Seidl'],2013-08-12 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/08/12/exclusive-look-glenn-becks-new-custom-made-ar-15-rifle-and-the-inspiring-gun-manufacturer-behind-it,"She’s long, tan, and loves left-handers. She’s a little heavier than you might expect, but that just means she can’t kick you as hard. And while those on the left would like you to believe it’s conservatives who have a “war on women,” liberals hate her.

Who is she? She’s the new custom-made AR-15 rifle from Black Rain Ordnance presented to Glenn Beck last Friday.

“Beautiful,” a wide-eyed Beck said after Black Rain Ordnance President Justin Harvel and his team presented him with the gun — a left-handed model from the company’s PG-6 line — as the sun’s rays seemed to spotlight the rifle during the late morning. Beck being left-handed, the modification is crucial.

It’s that attention to detail that made the presentation even more special.

“We were at our booth [during the 2012 NRA convention in St. Louis]. Glenn came by with his security staff on the way to his speech and I remember him holding one of our rifles up…and he was holding it up left-handed,” Harvel – who has a bushy, red beard that somewhat hides his mouth – told TheBlaze while at a local gun range.

“Well, we just introduced this left-handed model and [we thought], ‘What a great idea, let’s give him a left-handed, he’ll never believe it.’”

For Harvel and his team, seeing Beck’s reaction (which Harvel described as “awe”) was payment enough.

“Obviously he’s got money and he could go buy anything he wanted to,” he said. “But I think it was more of the meaning around it.”

You may remember the Black Rain Ordnance name from earlier this year. It was the gun-maker who built a custom AR-15 for C.J. Grisham, the Texas veteran who had his rifle confiscated while “rudely displaying” it in Texas.

“We follow his progress daily,” Harvel said. “He’s still battling through court.”

“He’s fighting for what’s right, and that’s what we believe in and that’s why we supported him,” Harvel added.

When TheBlaze first told you about the company’s gesture, Grisham was leaning toward the “pink splash” version. Harvel said that’s exactly what he chose – and he gave it to his wife “in the hopes that he would get his gun back and get her more involved in the sport.”

It’s a goal becoming tougher as politicians and gun control advocates are working hard to demonize so-called “assault rifles. Given that, what does the company think of the future of the AR-15?

“The modern sporting rifle is here to stay,” Kevin Greb, the state’s regional sales manager, told Beck while sitting in his office during the presentation. “It’s truly America’s rifle. Until legislation comes down that outright bans firearms, the AR is here to say. It’s not going anywhere.”

That’s good news for a company as rugged and hard-working as its guns. The story of Black Rain Ordnance is a quintessential “American dream.” Harvel’s dad, uncles, and grandfather were all in retail sales and introduced a young Justin to guns at a young age: “I literally had a gun in my hand before I could walk.”

“In the retail business, I had two stores at the time of my prime and I was listening to the customers as they would come in — they’re not getting what they need, as a retailer I wasn’t getting what I needed,” he said.

“It was so frustrating, because it was like the manufactures didn’t care, they weren’t producing a quality product, they were going overseas to China to import some of this stuff — they were just mass producing it and not caring about quality.”

So he decided to change that.

After working as a full-time firefighter for 10 years, he brought together a close group of family and friends in the small town of Neosho, Mo. He poured money and “sweat equity” into the business, worked 70-80 hours a week, and started living by a simple mission statement: “We’ll never produce anything we wouldn’t personally own or operate.”

It’s worked.

Since starting as a small mom-and-pop manufacturer in January 2009, the company has grown from him as the first employee to now about 40 workers. The first year, they produced 12 rifles – this year they’re poised to build over 12,000. And after initially being turned down by big retailers, you can now find their guns in over 5,000 stores across the country, including giants such as Bass Pro Shop, Cabela’s, Gander Mountain, and Scheels All Sports.

And while Harvel and his team have worked hard to get the company to where it is today, he’s also quick not to downplay good old-fashioned “luck.”

“I’m not going to deny that,” he said while chuckling.

If you’re wondering about the name, Harvel said the symbol is the result of working at the fire department and walking past the biohazard symbol for so long. “Black rain” stemmed from a Google search of what the symbol really meant. He finally came across a news article describing nuclear warfare as “white cloud, black rain.”

“So I thought, ‘black rain,’ that’s pretty cool: black rifle that we’re making; raining bullets, raining brass. And so ‘Black Rain’ it was,” he said. “And so we took it from there.”

But there’s more to it than that. One of their slogans now is, “Today’s forecast: storms likely.” And it has a special meaning for Harvel’s law enforcement and military clients.

“I know when you leave the house and you kiss your kids goodnight for bed and you have to work that night shift, what is that storm waiting for you on the other side of that door? Are you going to be able to come home to your wife and kids?”

“So you need the best weapons, you need quality weapons, you need somebody making those weapons that cares about who you are and your family coming home to them. … By carrying the best weapons, [you know] they’re going to work, the quality, the accuracy, the precision behind them, they’re American-made.”

Just like Justin’s relatives did with him, Mercury One – Beck’s charity and philanthropic arm – is looking to get guns in the hands of America’s future generation at an early age. And its doing it in small and big ways.

After the presentation of Beck’s gun on Friday, Kerry took a slew of young employees and interns to local shooting range, Elm Fork, for a private safety and shooting session with the executives from Black Rain Ordnance. There, the young people got to fire some of the company’s “coolest” weapons, including fully automatic ones.

Besides outreach such as the range trip, on November 2 the charity is putting on a clay pigeon shoot to raise money and “build awareness for gun safety and gun awareness among children and teenagers,” Mercury One President Joe Kerry told TheBlaze as bullets popped in the background.

“We’re seeing in schools and in public settings that guns are disappearing,” Kerry, who earlier held up a massive .308 rifle, explained, “and because of that people are afraid of them.”

“One of our missions is to make sure kids aren’t afraid of guns,” he said. “If they’re used properly and are respected, there’s nothing to be afraid of.”

blaze86,blaze,['Tré Goins-Phillips'],2016-05-31 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/05/31/ar-15-inventor-says-hbo-distorted-his-views-on-guns-in-recent-interview,"AR-15 inventor Jim Sullivan is seeking to clarify comments he made about guns in a recent interview on HBO’s “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,” saying the network “misrepresented much of what I said.”

“They were apparently trying to make the AR-15 civilian model seem too dangerous for civilian sales,” he wrote in The Federalist Tuesday. “They didn’t lie about what I said, they just omitted key parts, which changed the meaning.”

Sullivan wrote that the moments in the interview he takes issue with are in regard to discussion about the AR-15 when he says he “appears” to say the civilian model is equally as effective as the military-grade M16. According to Sullivan, HBO omitted when he clarified, “When firing semi-auto only” and “the select fire M16 on full auto is of course more effective.”

Additionally, he objected to the discussion on military and hunting bullets, adding that, due to the Hague Convention, military-grade bullets cannot be hollow points like hunting bullets “that give up all of their energy in the target body instead of passing through with minimum wound effect.”

Sullivan wrote that Armalite, a small arms engineering company, “went the small-caliber, high-velocity route and gave the bullet the right twist of 1:14 to be stable in air but unstable in tissue,” which he said was in compliance with the Hague Convention.

“This gave us a small cartridge that was half the size, weight, and recoil of a 7.62 NATO,” he wrote, “so the soldier could carry twice the ammo, fire controllable full auto, and be far more deadly out to 300 yards, the three characteristics that determine military rifle cartridge effect.”

He also said the 5.56 “can’t compete” with hunting bullets, which can legally be expanding hollow points that are more lethal than tumbling.

There was also a point in the interview that Sullivan said was made to look as if he was unhappy with the fact that AR-15 are popular in the civilian market.

“5.56 is only half as powerful as the 7.62 NATO (.308) hunting bullet. That doesn’t mean I’m not pleased to see AR-15s sell on the civilian market,” he wrote. “It just means I didn’t realize they would 57 years ago.”

“This would be exactly as a nuclear bomb, and we can say that Lebanon today has a nuclear bomb, seeing as any rocket that might hit these tanks is capable of creating a nuclear bomb effect,” Nasrallah said, according to a translation published in the Times of Israel.

Addressing his message to Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, Nasrallah said, according to quotes posted by Ynet, “It’s simple mathematics. A few missiles on a few ammonium plants equals the same amount of death as an atomic bomb.”

Israel’s military chief Eizenkot on Wednesday responded to Nasrallah’s threat, acknowledging that among the groups surrounding Israel, Hezbollah has developed the most significant military abilities, including developing the means to hit Tel Aviv in central Israel.

Though it is a formidable adversary, Eizenkot noted that the Lebanon border has been Israel’s quietest for the past 10 years since the 2006 conflict known as the Second Lebanon War.

Ynet reported that following the 2006 conflict, the municipality of Haifa — where the ammonia facility sits — ordered a study, which concluded that in the event the plant were to be hit, it would release a 10-mile diameter cloud, an area that would cover both Haifa and Acre, a city 10 miles north along the Mediterranean coast. Both cities are home to Jewish and Arab residents.

Ynet quoted professor Amos Natua from the Technion Institute of Technology who said, “Researchers who conducted the studies in the 1990s concluded that there could be 70,000 casualties.”

“The State Comptroller released a statement in 2003 that the number will likely be much higher,” he added.

Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav pointed to Nasrallah’s threat as a reminder to the Israeli government that it must move the plant out of the city, which has a population of nearly 300,000.

“We are happy for help” in raising the issue, Yahav said, “even if it arrives from a frightened man hiding in his bunker.”

Nasrallah spoke remotely from an undisclosed location transmitted to a rally honoring former top Hezbollah leaders who were assassinated. The event is known as “The Loyalty to Martyrs and Leaders Day,” Israel’s Ynet reported."
blaze88,blaze,['Mytheos Holt'],2013-02-25 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/25/federal-court-finds-no-constitutional-right-to-carry-a-concealed-weapon-we-explain-the-decision,"While gun rights supporters might like to think the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is an absolute guarantee against government interference, according to at least one (relatively conservative) appeals court, they are severely mistaken. In fact, according to that same court, when it comes to carrying concealed weapons, the Second Amendment is basically irrelevant.

Last Friday, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down its decision in the case of Peterson v. Martinez, a case involving the question of whether a state has an obligation to provide a concealed carry license to anyone who has been granted such a license in another state. Their answer was, to put it mildly, “no.”

In fact, the court adopted a fairly novel approach in explaining why the right to keep and bear arms didn’t apply in this case: Rather than rely solely on precedent that restricted gun rights, they built most of their analysis on language from cases that expanded gun rights, but still made clear that there were limits, of which concealed carry was certainly one. As Lawyers.com’s Larry Bodine put it, “To bullet-proof the ruling against an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the 10th Circuit recounted numerous court rulings and state laws dating back to 1813, and based its ruling on prior U.S. Supreme Court cases.”

Still, given which judges ended up deciding the case, this approach may be less surprising than it first appears. While the decision was written by Judge Carlos Lucero, a Clinton appointee, all three judges voted unanimously against the right to concealed carry, which may surprise some, given that one (Judge Bobby Ray Baldock) was a Reagan appointee, and the other (Judge Harriz Hartz) was a nominee by the second President Bush, neither of whom were presidents known for nominating liberal judges.

So why did they decide the way they did? To understand that, one needs to first understand a little about the case, and about court precedent regarding the Second Amendment.

The Case

The person bringing the case was one Gray Peterson, a resident of Washington state, who possessed concealed carry permits both in Washington and in Florida. Peterson frequently visited the Denver, Colorado area, and in so doing, wished to carry a firearm with him at all times. However, the city of Denver currently bans open carry of firearms, which means Peterson would need to get a concealed carry license from the state in order to carry his weapon in most situations.

Fortunately, Colorado did have a program for recognizing the concealed carry licenses of other states. The problem for Peterson was that Colorado only recognized concealed carry licenses from states that also recognized concealed carry licenses from Colorado. In other words, if a state wouldn’t recognize Colorado’s concealed carry licenses, Colorado wouldn’t recognize theirs. Neither Florida nor Washington state recognized Colorado’s concealed carry licenses, so Peterson was out of luck.

Worse, he couldn’t apply for a license on his own merits, because Colorado would only grant new licenses to Colorado residents, not people from out of state. In other words, there was literally no way for Peterson to get a concealed carry license in Colorado unless he moved. So, claiming he needed to carry a firearm with him, Peterson sued to get the law banning out of state residents from getting Colorado-issued concealed carry licenses struck down, claiming it violated his Second Amendment rights.

The court disagreed. Why? Because when it comes to the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms is far less absolute than many people might like to think.

The Limits of the Second Amendment

As we previously covered at TheBlaze, the right to keep and bear arms is more extensive than many liberals would like to think, and more limited than many conservatives would like to think. At the time, we wrote this about the legal realities regarding the Second Amendment (emphasis added):

For now, at least, the legal reality regarding the Second Amendment is that it does guarantee a right to keep and bear arms of some kind to individual citizens. Barring a massive shift in power on the court, this is unlikely to change, as five of the sitting justices voted to hold that the right exists and protects citizens against both state and federal law in the two cases cited above. Moreover, even cases that the majority of justice disagree with are not always changed after the fact, given the varying attitudes of various jurists towards the importance of upholding precedent. For the foreseeable future, therefore, the right to keep and bear arms is a fixed reality of the American legal and constitutional landscape. However, in practice, this tells us very little about how far that right extends, which is where the current (and future) legal debate is likely to focus. A right to own a handgun is one thing, after all, but what about the right to own rocket launchers? Miniguns? Anti-tank ordinance? An actual, physical tank? Are all of these things protected by the right to keep and bear arms? They are, after all, arms. Fortunately for those worrying about their neighbors acquiring weapons grade helicopters, even the most stringent supporters of gun rights admit that the law allows for limits on what sort of weapons are protected, or on how those weapons might be obtained. For his part, Scalia would limit the amendment solely to weapons that can be carried by an individual human being, knocking such armaments as tanks and missiles out of contention, and admitted in the majority decision in Heller that regulations such as background checks and concealed carry permits almost certainly pass constitutional muster.

This, as it turns out, is precisely the reasoning that the Court ended up using in this case. From Judge Lucero’s decision [emphasis added]:

With respect to Peterson’s claims against the Denver sheriff, we conclude that the carrying of concealed firearms is not protected by the Second Amendment or the Privileges and Immunities Clause. In Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275 (1897), the Supreme Court stated in dicta that “the right of the people to keep and bear arms is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.” More recently, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Court noted that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues,” and explained that “nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions.” Id. at 626. In light of our nation’s extensive practice of restricting citizens’ freedom to carry firearms in a concealed manner, we hold that this activity does not fall within the scope of the Second Amendment’s protections.

Part of the issue at work here is that the Supreme Court’s decision to grant the right to keep and bear arms the same legal status as more longstanding rights like the right to free speech has been exceedingly recent (the two cases that established this precedent, District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, were handed down in 2008 and 2010, respectively), and thus there is much less clarity about where that “right” begins and ends. The 10th circuit court explicitly acknowledged this:

In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court held “that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.” And in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 130 S. Ct. 3020 (2010), the Court concluded that “the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States.” Nevertheless, the Court has provided precious little guidance with respect to the standard by which restrictions on the possession of firearms should be assessed. In Heller, the Court determined that the challenged statute, which completely barred possession of handguns in the home and required that any lawful firearm be kept in an inoperable condition, failed “[u]nder any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights.” The Court rejected application of rational-basis scrutiny, but declined to select another standard. However, the Court stressed that its opinion should not be read to “cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms,” which the Court identified as “presumptively lawful regulatory measures.”

However, while the Supreme Court has proposed no method by which to gauge whether a restriction runs afoul of the Second Amendment, the 10th circuit court itself apparently does have a precedent, elucidated in the case United States v. Reese. The 10th Circuit specifically applied what the decision calls a “two-pronged approach” to Second Amendment claims. In other words, when assessing such claims, the court asks two questions:

1. Does the challenged law “impose a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment’s guarantee?” If not, the law is constitutional.

2. If so, does the law pass muster under a “means-end” test, IE does it pursue a constitutionally acceptable end using means that do not fall afoul of any explicit part of the constitution?

The court in this case completely avoided the second, more complicated question. Rather, they decided right out the gate that since carrying concealed weapons was not a right the Second Amendment was designed to protect, the law was presumptively constitutional:

We agree with the Fifth Circuit that in applying the two-step approach to Second Amendment claims, we consider at the first step “whether the law harmonizes with the historical traditions associated with the Second Amendment guarantee.” As the foregoing demonstrates, concealed carry bans have a lengthy history. Given…the Supreme Court’s admonition in Heller that “nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions,” we conclude that Peterson’s Second Amendment claim fails at step one of our two-step analysis: the Second Amendment does not confer a right to carry concealed weapons.

Nor was it only Heller and McDonald that the court relied on to make its decision. Rather, they used the treatises of the British legal scholar Blackstone (a contemporary of the Founding Fathers, and one of their inspirations), as well as quotations from several cases both in the early and late 19th century to prove that carrying concealed weapons was never a right that even the Founders meant to protect. In short, they wrote a decision with a liberal outcome using conservative reasoning on the limits of the Second Amendment. However, that is unlikely to be the end of the story.

So What Happens Now?

It is at this point that many gun rights supporters must be feeling nervous. After all, if a state can set up its concealed carry laws and open carry laws such that a citizen literally cannot carry their weapon in particular circumstances, surely that means the right to keep and bear arms is something of a formality.

Fortunately for these people, there are several factors that make that problem less pressing. Firstly, this case only applies to areas where the 10th Circuit Court has jurisdiction – specifically, Colorado, Kansas, most of Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, and may not even apply there, given that an appeal will almost certainly come out of the case, given that it directly contradicts another decision by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

Secondly, the court in this case did not rule that bans on open carry are constitutional (and, in fact, noted with some bewilderment that Peterson had not challenged the open carry statute in the decision), simply that there is no “right” to carry a concealed weapon implied by the Second Amendment. Again, other Circuit Courts differ with this assessment, and the Supreme Court will almost certainly be asked to step in.

For now, however, concealed carry licenses are a privilege, not a right."

The laws, the argument goes, mostly just outlaw guns that look menacing. It seems that line of thinking got one person on eBay thinking: What would so-called “assault” weapons look like back in the time of cavemen?

We seem to have an answer — and it could be yours for $20.51 now $100 $3,050:*

“This is your chance to own the most iconic piece of history tried and true of all assault weapons!” the auction’s description says. “This rock is millions of years old and may have been the caveman’s AR15. This is not a modern AR15 or assault weapon, rather this is the caveman’s AR15 (Assault Rock). Again this is a ROCK.

“This item is intended purely for decoration and not intended to be used as a weapon. This is your chance to own a piece of history.”

The auction has nine days left and started out at $0.99. However, you might want to rush to see it: One internet thread claims that a similar auction was taken down by eBay.

No word on if Vice President Biden is expected to include such weapons in his gun control recommendations.

blaze90,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2014-06-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/06/17/hillary-clinton-endorses-ban-on-assault-weapons-and-high-capacity-magazines-seemingly-confuses-automatic-vs-semi-autoamtic-firearms,"WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) — Speaking at a CNN town hall event Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton argued a “ban” on semi-automatic rifles — or so-called “assault rifles” — as well as high-capacity magazines would help reduce gun violence in the United States.

“What’s been happening with these school shootings should cause everybody to just think hard,” she said. “I was disappointed that the Congress did not pass universal background checks after the horrors of the shooting at Sandy Hook and now we’ve had more in the time since.”

Clinton, thought to be a likely 2016 presidential candidate, then made a glaring error when making an emotional plea to promote gun control.

She said she couldn’t understand how an individual could walk into a school with an “automatic weapon” and “murder innocent children, students, teachers.” In fact, automatic weapons are highly regulated and very difficult to acquire. It is likely the former first lady was actually referring to semi-automatic weapons.

She referred to “automatic weapons” for a second time later during the town hall, saying they can do more damage than ever before. There have been two homicides committed with legally owned fully automatic weapons since 1934, according to GunCite.com.

“I will speak out no matter what role I find myself in,” Clinton added. “We cannot let a minority of people… hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people.”

The former secretary of state also personally addressed the mother of one of the Americans killed in Benghazi during a CNN town hall event on Tuesday, saying she can “totally relate to her as a mother or to any of the family members of the four Americans who were killed that night.”

“I can see why she and others are inconsolable,” she said.

Clinton was referring to Patricia Smith, the mother of slain American diplomat Sean Smith. Smith has criticized Clinton and the Obama administration for telling what she believes isn’t the whole truth. She also questioned why it took nearly two years for the administration to capture a suspect who wasn’t even in hiding.

Her appearance came hours after the Obama administration announced the capture of a Libyan militant suspected in the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton said the capture showed the U.S. has an “an unwavering commitment to bring to justice” those who commit acts of terror against the U.S.

Republicans have criticized Clinton’s handling of the Benghazi attack, which killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. GOP officials have accused the Obama administration of stonewalling congressional investigators and misleading the public about the nature of the attack in the weeks before the presidential election.

Clinton said during the forum that she was “still looking for answers because it was a confusing and difficult time.”

She also expressed caution about the United States working with Iran to combat fast-moving Islamic insurgents in Iraq, saying the U.S. needs to understand “what we’re getting ourselves into.”

The U.S. and Iran have held an initial discussion about how the longtime foes might cooperate to address the threat from the al-Qaida-linked militants that have swept through Iraq. The former secretary of state said at a CNN town hall meeting that any partnerships with third parties such as Iran would need to be “carefully thought through.”

“I am not prepared to say that we go in with Iran right now, until we have a better idea what we’re getting ourselves into,” said the former secretary of state.

Clinton spoke during an hourlong forum to promote her new book, “Hard Choices,” about her four years as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state. Clinton is the leading Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 if she decides to run for president again.

U.S. and Iranian officials have both raised concerns about the swift advance of radical Islamist forces in Iraq and officials from the two countries met here briefly Monday. The White House, however, has ruled out the possibility that Washington and Tehran might coordinate military operations in Iraq."
blaze91,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2011-11-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2011/11/17/army-has-success-with-hypersonic-weapon-traveling-8x-speed-of-sound,"On Thursday, the U.S. Army completed a successful test of an Advanced Hypersonic Weapon soaring at eight times the speed of sound. The completion perhaps restoring a little bit of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA’s) confidence since it’s last test run of the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 crashed into the Pacific Ocean this past August.

Today’s test builds upon lessons learned from the two earlier tests of Falcon HTV-2 and brings the military one step closer to having the capability to hit a target anywhere on Earth within an hour, according to Wired’s Danger Room.

Wired notes that this test was considerably easier than the one conducted with Falcon HTV-2 a few months ago though:

Darpa’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 — the one that splashed unsuccessfully in the Pacific — was supposed to fly 4,100 miles. The Army’s Advanced Hypersonic Weapon went about 60 percent as far, 2,400 miles from Hawaii to its target by the Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. Darpa’s hypersonic glider had a radical, wedge-like shape: a Mach 20 slice of deep dish pizza, basically. The Army’s vehicle relies on a decades-old, conventionally conical design. It’s designed to fly 6,100 miles per hour, or a mere eight times the speed of sound.

According to Fox News, this prototype flies flat rather than soaring upward and then coming back down.

Wired reports that the weapon is part of the Prompt Global Strike project that focuses on developing hypersonic weapons, which includes anything that goes five times faster than the speed of sound, giving military the ability to strike targets anywhere in the world in less than one hour:

Those hypersonic gliders may cut down on the geopolitical difficulties, but introduced all sorts of technical ones. We don’t know much about the fluid dynamics involved when something shoots through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. And there really aren’t any wind tunnels capable of replicating those often-strange interactions. “You have to go fly,” says retired Gen. James “Hoss” Cartwright, who helped lead the Prompt Global Strike push as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and as head of U.S. Strategic Command. “You have to open up the envelope of knowledge.”

In addition to the testing of this Advanced Hypersonic Weapon and Falcon HTV-2 in recent months, Fox News also notes the semi-successful test in June of the Air Force’s X-1A Waverider. It reached Mach 5 speeds before “it failed to switch over to its main fuel source.”"
blaze92,blaze,['Sara Carter'],2013-10-23 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/10/23/for-the-record-explores-the-weapon-that-could-shut-down-america,"What kind of weapon could wipe out food and medicine distribution, force America into a slumber for decades, make planes fall from the sky, permanently shut down the U.S. electrical grid, sever communications systems and lead to the deaths of millions?

It’s called an electromagnetic pulse weapon, or EMP. Wednesday’s new episode of TheBlaze TV’s For The Record, Blackout (8:30 p.m. ET), reveals the very real threat America faces if such a weapon were detonated above the nation’s skies.

Multiple senior U.S. officials, lawmakers, military personnel and intelligence analysts say the Obama administration needs to take this threat seriously and prepare in the event an attack that would set the U.S. back to pre-industrial times and leave us vulnerable to enemy states.

James Woolsey, who served as CIA director from 1993 to 1995, told “For The Record” that 9/11 was a wake-up call that enemies of the United States were looking to launch massive attacks.

He said senior government officials began thinking outside the box and questioned what “if the government in North Korea or in Iran really thought that the world would be so much a better place and that they themselves would be so much more likely to go to heaven if they could just kill as many Americans as possible?”

“These guys lusted after massive destruction,” Woolsey told “For the Record.”

North Korea presents that very real threat. In 2011, President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would shift the focus of its military might from the Middle East to Asia.

“There was concern that the U.S. was missing the bigger picture,” a U.S. official said. “North Korea, China presented problems that we still have not fully grasped. A rogue nation like North Korea can be very dangerous.”

Earlier this year, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency declassified parts of a report presented to Congress that emphasized the threat of North Korea’s missile program, and its rocket launch in 2012.

The DIA report stated the agency accessed with “moderate confidence that North (Korea) currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles … However, the reliability will be low.”

The Pentagon, however, quickly went into damage control, attempting to clarify the statement saying, “it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage.”

Michaela Dodge and Jessica Zuckerman, both senior defense and strategic policy analysts with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said in a 2012 report that “Congress should demand that the administration develop, test and ultimately field defenses against EMP attacks, including improved ballistic missile defenses capable of countering short-range ballistic missiles that can carry EMP warheads.”

The most effective way of delivering an EMP attack is by detonating the weapon at a high altitude so energetic particles “released during the explosion would disable, damage or destroy all unhardened electronic devices within the line of sight of the detonation,” the report said.

“A rogue state would not need a long-range ballistic missile to deliver a nuclear warhead,” their report stated. “Even short-range ballistic missiles carrying an EMP device or a nuclear warhead launched from a ship off the U.S. coast could impact millions. Today, over 30 countries, including Iran and North Korea, possess ballistic missile capabilities.”"

Over the past few years, many critics have decried perceived attempts to remove Judeo-Christian values from the ranks. A new report claiming that the Army has mandated that troops remove Bible inscriptions from their weapon scopes will likely only add to the debate.

Fox News’ Todd Starnes is reporting that soldiers were recently told to turn in their scopes so that a Biblical inscription purportedly etched into serial numbers could be removed. Active-duty members of the Army at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska, apparently reached out to let the outlet to shed light upon the situation.

Starnes has more about the lengths to which officials went to ensure that these verses were no longer visible:

The scopes were made by Trijicon and referenced New Testament passages in John 8:12 and Second Corinthians 4:6. The verses appeared at the end of the scope serial numbers – “JN8:12” and “2COR4:6.” “The biblical verse (JN8:12) must be removed utilizing a Dremel type tool and then painted black,” read instructions on how to remedy the matter. After the letters and numbers were [scraped] off, soldiers were directed to use apply black paint to ensure the verses were totally covered.

While the story seems unbelievable on the surface, Starnes reports that an Army spokesman confirmed the report in a written statement.

At issue was the notion that the military was purportedly not notified by Trijicon before the verses were placed at the end of series numbers. But the contention seems to stretch beyond that, as spokesman Matthew Bourke also told Starnes that the Bible inscriptions will be removed from all future weapons orders.

“The vendor etched those inscriptions on scopes without the Army’s approval. Consequently, the modified scopes did not meet the requirement under which the contract was executed,” wrote Bourke.

“Some of these scopes had already been fielded. Corrective measures were taken to remove inscriptions during the RESET/PRESET process in order to avoid a disruption in combat operations,” he added.

While the Obama administration pushes for a ban on so-called “assault weapons” and universal background checks, Democrats in both California and Missouri have proposed legislation that would result in possible confiscation of semi-automatic rifles.

Now, Democratic lawmakers in Olympia, Wash. last week introduced legislation that would allow county sheriffs to inspect the homes of semi-automatic rifle owners once a year. Seattle Times columnist Danny Westneat describes the move as “Orwellian.”

The proposed bill, Senate Bill 5737, would ban the sale of semi-automatic weapons that use detachable magazines and magazines that contain more than 10 rounds. It would also subject law-abiding gun owners to random searches by a county sheriff.

“In order to continue to possess an assault weapon that was legally possessed on the effective date of this section, the person possessing shall … safely and securely store the assault weapon. The sheriff of the county may, no more than once per year, conduct an inspection to ensure compliance with this subsection,” the bill states.

“They always say, we’ll never go house to house to take your guns away. But then you see this, and you have to wonder,” Seattle trial lawyer Lance Palmer told the Seattle Times.

“I’m a liberal Democrat — I’ve voted for only one Republican in my life,” Palmer added. “But now I understand why my right-wing opponents worry about having to fight a government takeover.”

He also said it’s this type of radical bill that “drives people into the arms of the NRA.”

One of the bill’s sponsors, State Sen. Adam Kline (D-Seattle), told the Seattle Times that he didn’t properly vet the bill prior to jumping on board. He claims he didn’t realize the bill authorized police searches.

“I made a mistake,” he said. “I frankly should have vetted this more closely.”

The legislation’s main sponsor, Sen. Ed Murray (D-Seattle) also blasted the search provision written in his bill, saying it is likely unconstitutional.

“I have to admit that shouldn’t be in there,” he said.

Murray also explained that an assault weapons ban isn’t likely to pass anyhow and the bill was intended to be a blueprint for gun legislation in the future. With the search provision included, the bill has very little chance of passing.

It wasn’t immediately clear which lawmaker wrote the search provision into the bill.

UPDATE: Following up on a tip from a reader, TheBlaze has discovered that Democrats in Minnesota are also pushing for a gun confiscation bill using almost identical language as the bill proposed in Missouri.

From MN H.F. No. 241, as introduced – 88th Legislative Session (2013-2014) Posted on Jan 31, 2013:

What happened?

Last Friday afternoon, an unidentified Springville police officer spotted a pair of feet dangling outside a donation bin. The officer ordered that man, Paul Douglas Anderson, out of the bin. Anderson complied, but refused to remove his hands from his pockets once outside. When he finally did, he reportedly began beating the officer.

Derek Meyer was driving in the area and spotted the alleged attack. He immediately knew he needed to help the officer.

The good Samaritan has a concealed carry license and regularly carries a firearm. He told KSTU-TV he has predetermined how he would act in a situation where he needed to use his firearm to protect life.

“I carry a gun to protect me and those around me, but primarily I carry a gun to protect my family first and foremost. Outside of that, if I were to use my gun to protect anyone it would be law enforcement or military personnel,” he said.

And that’s exactly what he did.

Meyer jumped out of his car, drew his firearm and ordered Anderson to stop assaulting the officer. Anderson complied, but ran off. He was found a half hour later hiding under a flatbed trailer and was arrested.

Anderson reportedly faces “multiple charges” and was well-known to law enforcement.

What did the department say about Meyer’s actions?

Springville Corporal Cory Waters told KSTU that if it weren’t for Meyer’s actions, the situation could have been “much worse.”

“Had he not been in the right place at the right time, who knows what would have happened. But he definitely stopped the attack from continuing and becoming much worse. He might have even saved either one of their lives. It could have gone really bad, even for the suspect,” he explained.

Meyer said he acted with instinct because it’s simply who he is.

“Not to get any extra attention or to have people talk about me or anything I did,” Meyer said.

Is the officer OK?

According to KSTU, the officer suffered a fractured eye socket and lacerations around that eye. Otherwise, he was released from the hospital and is expected to be OK."
blaze96,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-08-22 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/22/judge-shot-in-apparent-ambush-outside-courthouse-but-he-had-a-gun-too,"When an Ohio judge walked toward the Steubenville courthouse where he presides to start his day Monday morning, police said an armed man was waiting for Judge Joseph J. Bruzzese Jr. — and ran up to him and opened fire in an apparent ambush.

But Bruzzese also was armed.

While he was hit by the suspect’s gunfire, the judge — who sits on the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas — rattled off at least five rounds at the man, the Washington Post reported.

A nearby probation officer fired at the suspect as well. The attacker — identified as Nathaniel Richmond — fired five shots but was struck three times and killed, authorities told the paper.

Jefferson County Sheriff Fred J. Abdalla said since both Bruzzese and the probation officer fired their guns, it isn’t clear if any of the judge’s shots hit the suspect, the Post reported.

“This individual laid in wait for our judge,” Abdalla told reporters, the paper said. “It just hurts. First thing on Monday morning, you have a judge shot in front of his courthouse. … This was an ambush and an attempted murder on our judge.”

Bruzzese underwent surgery and was in stable condition Monday afternoon, Jefferson County Prosecutor Jane Hanlin said, according to the Post. The Herald-Star said he’s “doing fine” at a Pittsburgh hospital.

Abdalla — who described the judge as an avid hunter and sportsman, the paper noted — said he urged Bruzzese years earlier to arm himself.

“With all the nuts running around, I encouraged him to get a weapon,” Abdalla said, the Post reported. “And he did.”

Authorities said Richmond’s motives are unknown. While his teenage son was found guilty in a headline-grabbing 2013 rape case focusing on football players, Hanlin said officials don’t believe there was “any connection whatsoever” between Richmond’s son, Ma’lik, and the shooting of Bruzzese, the paper reported.

In fact, Bruzzese had “nothing at all to do with that particular case,” Hanlin said, emphasizing it was handled by a visiting judge from another area, the Post reported.

But Hanlin also said Richmond had a criminal history and cases under Bruzzese, along with other judges, the paper said.

U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson (R) represents Jefferson County and likened the shooting to one that hit a congressional Republican baseball practice in June.

“From the shootings at the congressional baseball practice, to today’s tragic shooting, public officials are increasingly under assault,” Johnson said, the Post reported. “Public service shouldn’t be a dangerous occupation, but it all too often is.”

More from the Post:

According to Abdalla, Richmond approached the courthouse early Monday morning in a car with another person before leaving and returning. When Richmond saw Bruzzese, Abdalla said, he “jumped out” of the car and ran over to begin shooting. The second person in the car is not considered an accomplice, Abdalla said, and told authorities that Richmond had only said he had to be in court Monday morning. This second person, who was not identified, did not get out of the car and was wounded by a possible bullet ricochet and taken to the hospital, the sheriff said. Abdalla said authorities have video of the shooting that they are working to have enhanced to show people what happened.

“This man shoots a judge, could’ve killed him,” Abdalla said, the paper reported, before adding “thank God he’s not that good a shot.”"

What happened?

Sanchez, as a result of his disability, didn’t obey officers’ commands, which led to the officers fatally shooting him, according to Oklahoma City Police Capt. Bo Mathews.

Mathews said that witnesses of the incident repeatedly cried, “He can’t hear you!” before officers on the scene fired and killed Sanchez.

Mathews said that officers received reports of a hit-and-run Tuesday evening when they arrived at the address listed in the report. The vehicle was no longer on the premises, but Sanchez was sitting on the porch.

It was later revealed that Sanchez’s father was the driver in the hit-and-run incident, but he had struck an object with his vehicle, and not another person.

Mathews said that when officers arrived, Sanchez had a metal pipe in his hand that measured approximately two feet in length. He said that Sanchez began making his way off the porch, toward the officers.

Witnesses overheard officers giving commands to Sanchez, but according to Mathews, officers did not hear their protests that Sanchez was deaf and could not understand the officers’ commands.

“In those situations, very volatile situations, you have a weapon out, you can get what they call tunnel vision, or you can really lock in to just the person that has the weapon that’d be the threat against you,” Matthews said. “I don’t know exactly what the officers were thinking at that point.”

Mathews added that neither officer was wearing a body cam.

Background on Sanchez

Sanchez’s neighbor, Julio Rayos, told the Oklahoman on Wednesday that not only was Sanchez deaf, but he was also unable to speak.

“He don’t speak, he don’t hear, mainly it is hand movements. That’s how he communicates,” Rayos said. “I believe he was frustrated trying to tell them what was going on.”

Another neighbor, Jolie Guebara, told The Associated Press that it was customary for Sanchez to have a stick in his hand to fend off stray dogs.

“He always had a stick that he would walk around with, because there’s a lot of stray dogs,” Guebara said.

Sanchez did not have a criminal record."

Originally, it was planned that Pompeo would be confirmed by the Senate by the time President Donald Trump took his oath of office Friday, or later that afternoon. Republicans noted that President Barack Obama had seven of his Cabinet members confirmed by the time he took office in 2009, and that it’s standard practice to have key members of the U.S. national security team in place while the transition of power takes place.

However, when Trump was sworn in last week, Pompeo had not yet been confirmed. By Friday afternoon, only Gen. James Mattis and Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s nominees for secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security, respectively, were confirmed.

The delay occurred because Senate Democrats, lead by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), failed to make good on their promise to include Pompeo in the small group of nominees who would be confirmed via a voice vote Friday afternoon, according to the Weekly Standard.

The magazine — cited six unnamed sources familiar with a confrontation between Schumer and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton that took place on the Senate floor Friday — after Schumer broke his promise to confirm Pompeo with Trump’s other top national security figures, and said he offered Republicans an “insulting excuse” for having done so.

It all began several days before when Republican leaders agreed to push back Pompeo’s Senate hearing by one day because Democratic leaders said they had too many on their plate.

“Democrats asked that the hearing be moved so that six hearings did not occur on one day,” a Democratic Senate aide told the Weekly Standard. “That many Cabinet hearings in a single day had only happened once in American history, and it was an unfair schedule to senators on both sides.”

Republicans agreed to the request, and Pompeo’s team reportedly welcomed the extra day to prepare, but Republicans had one condition: Pompeo must be confirmed on Inauguration Day with Mattis and Kelly.

More from the Weekly Standard:

But on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration, [Oregon Democratic Sen.] Ron Wyden said he’d seek to delay Pompeo’s confirmation when the Senate convened late Friday afternoon. That evening Cotton, who is close to Pompeo from their time together in the House of Representatives, began calling his colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Wyden, seeking to avoid the delay. Some of the calls were cordial. Others were testy. The Senate reconvened after the inaugural ceremonies on Friday, with Pompeo’s nomination set to come up at 4:50pm. Cotton angrily confronted Schumer about his broken promise. According to witnesses, Schumer told Cotton to lower his voice and asked him move off of the Senate floor to an adjacent hallway for a private discussion. “We need to take this out into the hallway,” Schumer said. Cotton walked with Schumer but loudly rejected his first request. “Don’t tell me to lower my voice!” he shouted, with an additional salty admonition tacked on for emphasis. Burr and Cornyn were present, as was Senator Mark Warner, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and several aides.

That’s when Schumer told Cotton, who is an Army veteran, that if he would have been around eight years prior, then he would know that Republicans didn’t confirm Obama’s CIA director nominee by or on Inauguration Day 2009.

Cotton did not take too kindly to the slight, according to the Weekly Standard.

“Eight years ago, I was getting my ass shot at in Afghanistan,” Cotton reportedly barked in reply. “So don’t talk to me about where I was 8 years ago.”

Then, according to the Weekly Standard, Schumer claimed that it wasn’t his fault that other Democrats were trying to stall Pompeo’s confirmation.

“That’s when [Schumer] started dissembling and said: ‘I don’t control my whole caucus.’ Either he’d lost control or he was trying to make excuses for an outcome he wanted,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told the Weekly Standard.

And because of the incident, top Republicans have reportedly said they now know not to trust Democratic leaders in the Senate.

“I won’t make that mistake again,” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) reportedly said afterward.

While Senate aides confirmed the version of events to the Weekly Standard, as did Cotton himself, a top Democratic aide told the publication that there had never been a deal to confirm Pompeo on Inauguration Day.

Despite the incident, Pompeo was confirmed on Monday and later sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence."

In an interview with Piers Morgan on “Good Morning Britain,” O’Neill detailed his fears that he and his SEAL team would not see home again following the mission in May 2011 to eliminate bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan — a mission 10 years in the making.

“We were honored, but we were very serious because we knew it was probably going to be a one-way mission,” O’Neill said about the group of SEALs deployed to take out bin Laden. “I personally didn’t think we were going to come back.”

O’Neill prepared heavily for the mission and told Morgan that he had written letters to his daughters in the event he didn’t make it out alive.

The former SEAL detailed a helicopter trip to bin Laden’s compound and the team’s entry of the premises. O’Neill revealed that several “threats” had to be eliminated as he and his team swept the house, but was advised by a woman in the compound that wherever they found bin Laden’s son, bin Laden would be on the floor above without question.

O’Neill was the one who found bin Laden on one of the upper levels of the structure.

“Standing there three feet in front of me with his hands on his wife was Osama bin laden,” O’Neill said. “He was pushing his wife sort of toward us.”

He revealed that his military instincts took over at that point and that he disposed of bin Laden the way you would any suicide bomber.

“I took care of him the way you would take care of a suicide bomber,” he said, and revealed that he shot at the notorious terrorist over the shoulder of bin Laden’s wife. “I shot him in the face twice and once more when he fell down because you need to make sure that threat is eliminated.”

O’Neill said that it took a moment for it to sink in that he had just killed bin Laden.

“One of my guys said, ‘Hey are you OK?’ and I said, ‘Yeah, what do we do now?’ “

The tactical team then swept the compound for intel that would give the U.S. government more insight into the terror attacks and returned to the helicopter.

“The flight back after we put bin Laden’s body in one of the helicopters,” O’Neill said about the flight, “we knew at that moment that if we can make it 90 minutes on this helicopter we have 50 more years of life.”"

The number is actually down from year ago when 62 people were shot — six fatally — over the same weekend.

To combat the violence this year, Chicago police deployed 1,300 extra patrol officers over the weekend through early Tuesday.

Those shot fatally this year include a 15-year-old boy killed about 6:30 p.m. Sunday in Lawndale during a neighborhood drive-by shooting, which also wounded a 16-year-old girl.

An unnamed 18-year-old man was shot in the head an hour earlier at 5:40 p.m. on Sunday. Police pronounced him dead on the scene and said witnesses described an unknown man who fired multiple shots at the victim.

An unidentified 17-year-old boy was shot in the head by an unknown male assailant around 9:50 p.m. on Sunday. A second 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man, both unidentified, were shot as well. The two victims have been stabilized and are expected to survive.

Oscar Clay, 52, was killed in a domestic-related shooting at 1:32 p.m. on Sunday after he got into an argument with an unidentified 27-year-old man who pulled out a handgun and shot Clay. Police have still not captured the shooter.

Tiara Goodman, 25, and an unidentified 32-year-old man were found around 10:50 a.m. on Sunday. Police said both Goodman and the man were shot in the head with a gun found on the scene, leading police to believe the deaths were a result of a murder-suicide. It was not clear which of the two was the alleged killer.

At 2:45 a.m. Tuesday, an unidentified 21-year-old man was shot multiple times while he was sitting in his vehicle, hitting his back and heart. He was taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The Chicago Tribune reported that despite the violence occurring all over the city, Chicago’s Harrison District on the West Side, one of the city’s most violent police districts, saw zero shootings occur. This was a stark difference from last Memorial Day weekend when 21 people were shot.

First Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro told the Tribune that the lack of violence was a result of police proactivity and the placement of officers “in all the areas that we knew we should have them.” He also credited officers with talking to people on the streets instead of just responding to crimes over the radio.

“I think the officers are out there doing a great job, also doing proactive stuff and interacting with the community, that’s a big thing,” Navarro said.

Chicago is often hailed as one of the U.S.’s most violent cities, with 762 homicides in 2016 alone."
blaze101,blaze,['Kate Scanlon'],2017-09-06 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/06/tiger-shot-after-attacking-dog-in-atlanta-neighborhood-and-no-one-knows-where-it-came-from,"A Bengal tiger was shot and killed early Wednesday morning after attacking a dog in an Atlanta neighborhood, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

WXIA-TV reported that Henry County police received multiple reports around 6 a.m. Wednesday that a tiger was loose near an overpass on Interstate 75.

In a statement provided to WXIA, police said, “Henry County officers responded, locating the tiger and kept visual sight of it while animal professionals were contacted. The tiger began to run toward the Meadow Brook community off of Jodeco Road, to the back of a residence and began to attack a dog.”

Police shot and killed the tiger.

“With the tiger in close proximity to a school bus route in a densely populated area, officers made the decision to put the animal down with gunfire fearing that occupants of the home could be in danger as well as others in the area,” the statement said.

Brittney Speck, the owner of the dog attacked by the tiger, told the Journal-Constitution she was woken up by flashing police lights and the sound of her dog “going crazy in the backyard.”

She looked out her window to check on her Dachshund, Journey, and saw a tiger in her neighbor’s yard. She called 911, but officers were already nearby. Soon, the tiger jumped on her dog.

“And the officers I guess just started firing rounds and took it down, and then gave me my dog back,” Speck said.

She said that her dog is OK, and she was thankful her three young children were inside at the time.

“It was like a full-grown zoo tiger,” Speck said of the incident.

The tiger’s origin remains unclear.

Zoo Atlanta officials as well as staff at the Noah’s Ark Animal Sanctuary, a local animal shelter, both said that all of their tigers are accounted for. The Noah’s Ark Animal Sanctuary posted on Facebook that police had contacted them about bringing them the tiger before they determined that it was a risk to human life.

Gerri Yoder, Henry County’s animal control director, told the Journal-Constitution that she has “no idea where [the tiger] belonged.”

“There are a lot of theories, but who knows?” Yoder said, adding that the tiger could have been “a victim of the exotic pet trade” and “born and bred for the purpose of resale.”

Yoder noted that tigers “are not illegal to own with the proper permitting.”

The Journal-Constitution reported that the incident is under investigation by Henry County Police, Henry County Animal Control, and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources."

In a recent interview with ABC’s David Muir, Trump hammered on his opinion that Chicago needs to fix its high murder rate before he sends in federal assistance. While doing so, he made an erroneous claim about people dying while former President Barack Obama delivered his farewell address on Jan. 10.

If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017

According to the ABC transcript of the interview, Trump said:

It can’t be a great city. Excuse me. It can’t be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread. Can’t be a great city. […] So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can’t have that. They weren’t shot at the speech. But they were shot in the city of Chicago during his speech. What — what’s going on?

But according to police records reviewed by the Chicago Tribune, that claim is untrue.

Not only was no one killed during Obama’s Chicago address, no shootings at all took place during that time frame, according to the police records as well as the Tribune’s own crime database.

The Tribune discovered of the shootings on Jan. 10:

Five people were wounded that day in separate shootings on the South and West sides, but none of them died, according to Tribune data and the Police Department. The first three shootings occurred hours before the president even landed in Chicago. At 9:10 p.m., about 20 minutes after Obama’s speech concluded, a 22-year-old man was shot in the back in the 1500 block of South Kolin Avenue before being transported to a local hospital in fair condition, records show. The final shooting took place about 10:30 p.m. when another man, also 22, was shot in the right leg in the 1800 block of South Drake Avenue, records show.

As the Tribune reported, Trump’s claim did not air but was included in the transcript of his interview with Muir.

In the interview, Trump continued to describe the gun violence in Chicago as “carnage,” “a war zone” and “a catastrophe.”

“People are being shot left and right. Thousands of people over a period — over a short period of time,” Trump said, according to the transcript.

In Chicago, 2016 was the deadliest year in almost two decades as 762 people were murdered. That number is significantly increased from 496 in 2015 and 423 in 2014.

“Can I ask you for a flat-out judgement?” the “Varney and Co.” host asked O’Neill. “Do you think that women should be part of special ops teams that go in and shoot down Osama bin Laden?”

O’Neill went on to tell Varney that he has “operated with women” in the past, adding that they have accompanied him on special operations. He said the military frequently uses women when searching for other women and children and for “cultural sensitivity type stuff.”

He then addressed one asset to using women in combat that many might not consider. According to the former Navy SEAL, if Islamic fighters are killed by women, “they go to Hell as far as they know.”

“Also, I know these Islamic fighters, they don’t fear death, but they do fear Hell, and if they are killed by women, they go to Hell as far as they know,” he told Varney. “So, I like to say, lock and load, ladies. If they don’t lower the standards and they pass them, I think they should get a shot.”

Varney, who admitted to having never been in combat, seemed to have a difficult time understanding how O’Neill could feel safe with a female SEAL by his side.

“Are you telling me you are perfectly okay going into a life and death situation with a woman by your side?” Varney asked astonishingly. “I’m told that it changes the dynamics of the group that you’re operating with.”

O’Neill did concede that there is potential for a “change in dynamic,” but insisted that he is 100 percent OK with women in combat as long as “the standards stay the same,” chalking his argument up to “equal opportunity.”

“Women and men working together is better,” he added, but Varney still pushed back.

“I think men have a sort of hunter-gatherer mentality. They go out and break things and kill people,” Varney said.

Ultimately, though, the Fox Business host seemed to concede that it is “fair” if a woman can make it through the Navy SEAL’s rigorous training, which O’Neill described as “the hardest military training in the world.”

The suspect, 19-year-old Terrion Pouncy, was hospitalized after the incident and missed his bond hearing Thursday. The judge ordered him held without bail pending a hearing next week, the Chicago Tribune reported.

What’s the story?

Pouncy, whose face was concealed with a dark scarf, pulled a gun on two employees, 39 and 45, at a Far South Side hot dog stand. He demanded they hand over their cash, pressing his gun to the head of one of the employees, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The victim, 39, who was passing a bucket of grease across the counter, called for the other worker to hand over cash from the register.

The bucket fell over while they were handing a stack of bills and their wallets to Pouncy. Bills flew all over, the Sun-Times reported.

Pouncy still pointing the gun at the workers bent over to grab the cash, the Sun-Times said. Then he stuck the gun in his waistband and started to run away.

But as he ran off, according to the Sun-Times, he shifted the gun and accidentally pulled the trigger firing the weapon in his pants.

He was struck in the right leg and penis, the Tribune reported. The robbery was captured on surveillance video.

Did he get away?

Sort of.

The restaurant workers called the police to report the robbery. At about the same time, someone made a 911 call to report a person found with gunshot wounds to the leg and penis, the Tribune story said.

Pouncy was transported to a local hospital where he was later arrested.

Police recovered the wallets that Pouncy had allegedly stolen from the two employees, as well as the .38 caliber pistol.

Pouncy faces two felony counts of robbery while armed with a firearm, according to Chicago police."

The department said it let officer Roy Oliver, a six-year veteran of the force, go for violating “several department policies” after it was discovered that he fired shots into a car as it was driving away.

Initial reports of the shooting said that the vehicle was driving in an “aggressive manner” toward the police officers, but the report was later corrected to reflect that the vehicle carrying teens was, in fact, driving away from police officers.

The Dallas County medical examiner ruled Edwards’ death a homicide, and though no charges have been brought against Oliver, the Dallas County DA’s office is investigating the case in conjunction with the local sheriff’s office.

HEAR what Balch Springs Police Chief Johnathan Haber has to say. @CBSDFW pic.twitter.com/o7DPfhFUv6 — Andrea Lucia (@CBS11Andrea) May 2, 2017

The slain teen’s family said that they are anticipating Oliver’s arrest and revealed that Edwards’ two brothers were also in the vehicle at the time of the shooting. According to the family, the brothers not only witnessed their brother’s death but were “manhandled, intimidated and arrested.”

In a statement, the Edwards family said:

We are grateful the decision has been made to terminate the officer responsible for Jordan’s murder. Over the past 24 hours Chief Haber has made commendable strides toward justice. However, there remains a long road ahead. We anxiously await this officer’s identification and arrest for the crime of murder. The magnitude of his horrible actions cannot be overstated. We fully expect an equivalent response from those responsible for investigating and punishing the crime. We also know that although his actions were the most wicked and consequential, he was not the only officer responsible for dreadful behavior that evening. After Jordan’s two brothers, Vidal and Kevon, along with their two friends, were forced to experience this tragedy up close as occupants of the car, they were immediately treated as common criminals by other officers; manhandled, intimidated and arrested, while their brother lay dying in the front seat. The officers who extended this nightmare for those children ought to be properly reprimanded as well. Our family is working hard to deal with both the loss of our beloved Jordan and the lingering trauma it has caused our boys.

Lee Merritt, attorney for the Edwards family, reported that one of Edwards’ brothers was handcuffed and detained overnight.

“After seeing his brother get shot,” Merritt said, “Jordan’s older brother was handcuffed and taken by police for no particular reason.”

Merritt noted that Edwards’ older brother was not a suspect and that there were no charges filed against him.

On Wednesday morning, Merritt revealed via Twitter that Oliver is appealing his dismissal."
blaze106,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/03/27/the-awesome-adapter-for-your-12-gauge-shotgun-that-turns-your-gun-into-an-ultimate-survival-rifle,"In an extreme survival situation where the appropriate amount of ammunition for the type of firearm you’re carrying can’t necessarily be guaranteed, what would you do? Carry multiple types of firearms to increase your chances of coming across ammo you can use? You could do that, or you could have an adapter system that comes in a handy pouch that allows one 12-gauge shotgun to take 11 different types of ammunition.

The creator of Gear Up’s X Caliber Shotgun Gauge Adapter System, Tim Ralston, told TheBlaze it’s like carrying 11 guns in one.

“It’s my version of the ultimate survival rifle,” Ralston said, pointing out how useful an adapter system that couples with a single shot, break action shotgun would be as ammunition might become harder to purchase or in a desperate situation.

The X Caliber adapter system was recently unveiled in late November 2012 and the first shipment of pre-orders is coming in now, Ralston said. Showing it off as a drawing at a show, Ralston said he got 300 pre-orders just from there.

“I said, ‘I don’t even know how much it costs yet’ and they said ‘I don’t care,'” Ralston recounted to us. “With this system, you can pick the right ammo for the right time.”

It is composed of eight adapters that allow the 12-gauge to shoot 11 different caliber rounds. The adapters are each 7-inches long and made from chromoly steel.

Watch Ralston’s reveal on the Gear Up YouTube channel:

The system itself costs $449.99, but as Ralston pointed out, a 12-gauge shotgun with which the system is fitted to work, can cost as little as a couple hundred dollars. All in all, the system plus shotgun would be more cost effective than purchasing several different types of guns.

Calibers of ammo that the X Caliber allows a singe-shot shotgun to fire are .22lr, 38 special, .357, 9mm, 45 acp, 45 lc, .410 shotgun, 12 ga. shotgun, .223, 7.62×39 and 308.

But what about accuracy? Ralston said the adapters have been tested for this. Although they might not be as on target as shooting with the actual firearm for which the ammo was designed, the adapters are rifled to increase accuracy.

Here are a couple videos showing you how they perform in field tests:

After the gun control debate truly came to a head with the mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in December, stores have been reporting ammo shortages and even police departments have been having a hard time getting their hands on ammunition needed for the job.

Ralston said he envisions ammunition being treated as currency in a bartering system in the near future. In fact, he told us that he recently had an exchange where he himself was paid with 1,000 rounds of AK-47 ammunition.

And Ralston believes the X Caliber system will only allow people to easily adjust to situations where they might want to barter for any type of ammunition.

“The key to survival is the ability to adapt,” one of the X Caliber promotional flyers reads.

But Gear Up isn’t stopping with X Caliber when it comes to creating an adaptable firearm. Although still in the works and patent pending, Ralston teased a new firearm, which he believes will be ready for showcasing at the 2014 Shot Show, that he said will “set the gun world on fire.”

“We’re keeping an eye on what’s coming down as for regulations and already adapting,” Ralston said. “We’re going to be proactive instead of reactive.”

And that’s about all he would reveal to us on that front.

Check out more about the X Caliber here.

Update: Some people were asking about the possibility of adapters sold as single units instead of a set. X Caliber Adapters are sold individually for $50 each. See those here.

blaze107,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-09-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/09/13/check-out-the-semi-automatic-rifle-with-machine-gun-like-rapid-fire-and-its-legal,"Machine guns, those requiring only one trigger pull to unleash countless loads of ammo, are illegal for civilian ownership with the exception of special licenses. But a Texas-based firearm manufacturer has created a semi-automatic weapon that delivers machine gun-like rapid fire.

Slide Fire Solutions is set to release a new rifle, said to sell for $6,000, using a technique called bumping. The belt-fed rifle, which could also be fed with a traditional magazine, according to KTVT-TV, could fire hundreds of rounds.

“It sprays like a fire hose,” Brandon Renner, sales and marketing manager for Slide Fire, told CNN Money. “We recommend no more than 30 rounds on the belt, but one person could make it as big as they want.”

The product is legal under Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulations because it still requires a single pull for each bullet, although the trigger pull is facilitated by the momentum of the gun’s recoil moving the user’s finger.

Here’s how it fits within the law, according to CNN:

The key is that of the pieces that make up a gun, the ATF regulates only the “receiver.” It’s the only piece that has a serial number and the only one that requires a background check to purchase. Slide Fire modifies the trigger and the stock — the butt of the gun that sits against the shooter’s shoulder. Slide Fire’s technology uses the recoil of the rifle shot to “bump” the gun, speeding up the rate of fire without changing the gun’s classification as a semiautomatic, which requires that only one round is fired each time the trigger is pulled.

Slide Fire states on its website that it “has not been notified by any individual state that our products conflict with any state laws.” CNN confirmed with ATF Spokesman Christopher Amon that the device is legal.

Still, some won’t carry the new Slide Fire rifle, it’s other products or allow it to be used on their ranges.

Tom Mannewitz, who owns TargetMaster store and indoor gun ranges, told KTVT they don’t allow weapons using bumping technology at the range.

“…one of our range rules is no uncontrolled rapid fire,” Mannewitz said. “When you’re bump’ firing a gun it is not under control.”

Mannewitz though acknowledged an understanding for some gun enthusiasts wanting to see how fast they could shoot. Still, he said for those licensed to own and fire machine guns, it can get old.

“I’m a class-3 dealer and most people that buy machine guns – once they’ve shot a couple or three thousand rounds through it, realize how expensive it is, then don’t shoot it anymore,” he told KTVT.

CNN reported James Hill, owner of Abilene Indoor Gun Range in Texas, saying he carries Slide Fire products but won’t carry the new rifle because he thinks there will be too much demand.

From a safety standpoint, Hill said the “poor man’s machine gun” is a little harder to shoot than a traditional automatic weapon, but with practice “it’s fairly idiot proof.”

In addition to the SFS BFR, Slide Fire already carries magazine-fed rifles for less than $2,000 and bump-stocks to modify existing rifles about $370.

Watch this footage with Guns & Ammo magazine showing how the Slide Fire product works:

“Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the firearm. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward,” Slide Fire describes of its product.

CNN Money reported the SFS BFR should be available this fall.

Laura Shackelford, Chief Executive Manager of Slide Fire Solutions, in the spring during the heat of the gun control debate published a piece on TheBlaze’s Contributors section regarding the constitutional issues of proposed gun legislation.

TheBlaze reached out to Slide Fire for comment but has not heard back at the time of this posting.

Coffey posted a slow motion video from the event to her Instagram account with the caption, “We’re not in Australia anymore, Toto.”

In the video, the 22-year-old Coffey is seen wearing black jeans and cowboy boots, seated at a bench with her eye down the scope of a suppressed rifle. The video shows Coffey firing the gun, which recoils quickly, causing the surfer to wear a look of shock for a brief moment.

Her shock is quickly replaced with a large smile. “Wow!” she said, shaking her hands.

We’re not in Australia anymore, Toto. #laruetactical #texas A post shared by Ellie-Jean Coffey (@elliejeancoffey) on May 30, 2017 at 8:04am PDT

Australia passed a gun-ban in 1996, which instituted a gun buyback program that saw some 650,000 guns purchased by the Australian government with funds raised through a special tax.

Owning a gun in Australia is still possible, according to Time. Acquiring a firearm first means obtaining a license. In order to get a license, you must first have a reason for needing one, such as being a member of a hunting or shooting club. All requests for handgun ownership require background checks by police. Handgun and long-gun firearm purchases require a 30-day “cooling off period” after applications for purchase have been submitted. Safety training courses are mandatory as well.

Additional requirements for owning firearms are based on the varying licenses available. For example, competitive shooters are required to compete in at least eight shooting competitions a year to keep their handguns. Failing to compete would mean the loss of their “category H” licenses. And collectors who want to keep their “category G” licenses must attend at least one meeting of an approved historical society a year.

Australian police are also required to inspect firearm owners’ home gun storage to confirm that they are obeying all the laws. This includes checking that ammunition and firearms are kept in locked containers separate from one another and making sure that firearms are in a locked and secure area where it cannot be stolen or lost."

Balch Springs Police Officer Roy Oliver was indicted Monday on one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant for the shooting death of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards after Oliver shot a rifle at a car driving away from a house party, striking Edwards in the head and killing him.

Oliver, 31, and several other officers were called to the scene in late April after neighbors called police about a loud house party in the neighborhood, stating that they were worried about underage drinking because of the teens they could see coming in and out of the residence.

After Oliver and the other officers approached the scene and began to investigate, a group of teens began to flee the area. Edwards, a high school freshman, and some of his friends all piled into a car being driven by Edwards’ older brother and began to drive away when Oliver shot at the vehicle, killing Edwards.

Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber originally told reporters in May that the car drove “aggressively” toward Oliver and another officer, but later said he misspoke. Body camera footage showed the car driving away from the scene and away from the officers when Oliver fired the shots into the vehicle. Oliver was later terminated from the force.

Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson told reporters justice would continue to be served throughout the upcoming trial.

“It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA’s Office,” she said, according to KDFW-TV. “This is the very first time we have issued an arrest warrant for a police officer before the case was presented to a grand jury.

What did he say?

Trump has nominated Dr. Dean Winslow, a professor at Stanford University, to be the Department of Defense’s assistant secretary for health affairs. While fielding questions during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Winslow made the controversial remarks.

He was specifically responding to a question about the Texas church shooter and whether or not he should have been given a “dishonorable discharge” from the military instead of a bad conduct discharge. The former would have prevented the shooter from purchasing firearms.

According to Vox, Winslow first said the Air Force failed by not reporting the shooter’s record to civilian authorities, a mistake that allowed the shooter to buy the gun he used to massacre more than two dozen people. Then he added:

I’d also like to, and I may get in trouble with other members of the committee, just say how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used.

After making the remark, Winslow was immediately rebuked by the committee’s chairman for diving into an area that is not in his “field of expertise.” The Texas shooter used an AR-15 rifle made by Ruger.

Why are his comments significant?

Trump, and the leaders in his administration, maintain a conservative view of the Second Amendment: that no restrictions, outside of those allowed by the Supreme Court, should be placed on Americans’ right to bear arms.

It’s also surprising that Winslow chose to voice his personal views in such a public way, especially since it may hurt his chances of being confirmed to his post.

Were there any other questionable answers?

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chairman of the committee, grilled Winslow over his views on abortion. According to the Washington Examiner, Winslow stated in a presubmitted questionnaire that he believes “therapeutic abortion services should be provided by the military.”

McCain questioned exactly what therapeutic abortions are, and Winslow explained they are abortions needed to save the life of the mother.

“You better clean it up doctor or you are going to have trouble getting it through the Senate,” McCain told Winslow."

Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) said on CNN that the popular AR-15 rifle is capable of firing 700 rounds per minute. He was not challenged on the claim by CNN anchor Erin Burnett.

Police said Sunday that the shooter, identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, entered a popular gay club in Orlando and opened fire, killing 49 people and injuring over 50 others. He was armed with multiple firearms, including a semi-automatic Sig Sauer MCX carbine rifle, not an AR-15. The gunman was killed in a shootout with SWAT officers.

“If he was not able to buy a weapon that shoots off 700 rounds in a minute, a lot of those people would still be alive,” he said. “If somebody like him had nothing worse to deal with than a Glock pistol…he might have killed three or four people and not 50. It’s way too easy to kill people in America today and we have to think long and hard about what to do about that.”

Burnett responded, “You’re right about that. Thank you very much.”

Multiple viewers were quick to question the claim. However, one conservative journalist went one step further and offered to pay $50,000 to the charity of Grayson’s choice if he can fire an AR-15 700 times or more in one minute. Conrad Close, editor in chief of American Crossroads, made the offer.

I'll donate $50,000 to the charity of @AlanGrayson's choice if he can fire an AR-15 700 times in one minute. https://t.co/7imRIGiwjV — Conrad Close (@conradclose) June 13, 2016

So far, no word from Grayson on the offer. TheBlaze has reached out to Grayson’s office about his AR-15 claim.

It wasn’t immediately clear where Grayson got the 700 rounds per minute number, but he is likely referring to the capability of a fully automatic rifle. A semi-automatic rifle requires one pull of the trigger for every shot fired. Automatic weapons are heavily restricted at the federal level.

However, several YouTube videos showing gun owners using a “slide fire stock” on AR-15 rifles appear to increase the fire rate dramatically. There was no evidence Monday that the Orlando shooter used any such modifications during the attack that left 49 people dead.

A falling steel beam had broken his ankle, so Bennion understandably didn’t much like getting kicked and told Knowles he’d fight him if it happened again, the Post Register reported.

The bartender promptly kicked Knowles out of the saloon, the paper reported, citing court records, and told him not to come back.

But Knowles, 58, came back less than an hour later — armed with an AM-15 .223-caliber rifle and a .40-caliber pistol, the paper said.

“He flung the door open and jacked in a shell and started pointing this rifle at my buddy’s wife and then swung it at another friend,” Michael Martinez, a friend of Bennion, told the Post Register.

Police reviewed the Saloon surveillance video, which reportedly shows Knowles pointing the rifle at patrons, the paper said.

Bennion had a “fight-or-flight” response, he told the Post Register, grabbing a beer mug and chucking it at Knowles. Bennion said that allowed him time to rush Knowles and disarm him.

“He was distracted long enough that he didn’t get a round off, thank God,” Bennion told the paper.

It was all over for Knowles at that point, as other patrons began punching him.

More from the Post Register:

Police arrived shortly after and found Knowles lying near the front door of the bar with blood all over his face. Court records show Knowles was taken to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where he received six stitches and was diagnosed with a broken nose. Responding officers wrote in their reports that the crowd at the bar was screaming and several people were being held back from further attacking Knowles. Officers got Knowles away from the crowd so he could be treated for his injuries. He later told officers he had been drinking and left after the confrontation with Bennion. He told officers when he returned he never pointed the gun at the patrons, contrary to video evidence. Knowles told officers he didn’t think he stepped on Bennion’s foot.

Knowles also told police he came back to the saloon to talk to Bennion and armed himself for protection, the paper said, adding that court records indicate the handgun had a round in the chamber.

Bennion told the Post Register he’s glad no one was shot: “I mean I’ve got a 3-year-old little girl and a wife, and I’d hate to leave them and be shot over some drunk idiot.”

He toldo the paper that police didn’t confront him or his friends about punching Knowles.

“You know, cops can get a bad rap,” Bennion told the Post Register, “but they were really good and handled the business last night very professionally.”

Knowles is charged with aggravated assault, unlawful possession of a weapon by a convicted felon and an enhancement for use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony, the paper said, adding that he faces up to 15 years in prison over the charges.

Knowles was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in 2002, the Post Register reported, adding that court records indicate the conviction barred him from owning a firearm."

Provides Statement to TheBlaze on Vet Arrested After ‘Rudely Displaying’ Rifle (Plus, a Texas Firearms Attorney Weighs In)

–

Army Master Sgt. C.J. Grisham was on a ten-mile Boy Scout hike with his son in Texas when he was arrested and accused of “rudely displaying” his firearm. Knowing there are wild boars, coyotes, and cougars in the area, he had an AR-15 rifle slung over his shoulder and was also carrying a .45 caliber pistol, according to Fox News’ Todd Starnes.

A “huge Constitutionalist” and prominent military blogger, Grisham has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan throughout his 18 years in the military. He was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor for his service.

But on the day he was arrested in mid-March, Grisham says he was treated like a “street thug.”

He described how it all happened:

At about the 5 mile mark of our hike, a voice behind us asked us to stop and the officer motioned for us to approach him. He got out of his car and met us a few feet later. He asked us what we were doing and I explained that we were hiking for my son’s merit badge. He then asked me what I’m doing with the rifle, to which I responded in a calm manner, “Does it matter, officer? Am I breaking the law?” At that point, the officer grabbed my rifle without warning or indication. He didn’t ask for my rifle and he didn’t suggest he would take it from me. He simply grabbed it. This startled me and I instantly pulled back – the rifle was attached to me – and I asked what he thought he was doing because he’s not taking my rifle. He then pulled his service pistol on me and told me to take my hands off the weapon and move to his car, which I complied with. He then slammed me into the hood of his car and I remembered I had a camera on me (one of the requirements of the hiking merit badge is to document your hikes)…Up to this point, I am not told why I am being stopped, why he tried to disarm me, or even that I’m under arrest. […] The arresting officer is Officer Steve Ermis and the supervisor is Sergeant Minnicks of the Temple Police Department.

Grisham’s 15-year-old son recorded the entire incident, and the video is posted on YouTube.

In it, you can see a handcuffed Grisham repeatedly asking what he is being detained for. TheBlaze spoke with attorney Michele Byington of Texas Law Shield who confirmed that, while Texas does have open carry laws, they don’t apply to “long guns,” like Grisham’s AR-15. He would only be in trouble if he had been carrying the rifle in a way “calculated to cause alarm,” like waving it in the air — not strapped to his chest and pointed towards the ground.

“In this day and age people are alarmed when they see someone with what you have [a rifle],” one of the officers explains, noting that someone had called the police. “They don’t care what the law is.”

“Do ​you​ care what the law is?” Grisham shot back.

Video shows the veteran continuing to elicit clarification as his hands are handcuffed behind his back, asking why the officers didn’t ask him to drop the weapon instead of resorting to such drastic action.

“I will not be in the habit of doing that for anybody with a firearm, because it’s dangerous,” one of the officers replies.

“So just because a guy’s got a firearm he’s dangerous?” Grisham responds.

“Yes sir,” the officer says.

The video has even more stunning dialogue, but Grisham says he is the most upset about how his son was treated, and how the incident will shape his view of the police.

“What a bad excuse you guys are showing for [the] police force,” Grisham says at one point.

“Actually, it’s a bad excuse as a dad,” one of the officers replies.

Todd Starnes at Fox News has more:

As the officers put Grisham in the back of the car, the video picked up sounds of [Grisham’s son] Chris crying. The officers told Grisham they would take the boy home. “I told him not to answer any questions,” Grisham said. “I told him not to answer a single question until his mother was there — and she would answer the questions for him.” But that’s not what happened. Chris told Fox News that the police officer refused to let him out of the car until he answered a series of questions. The boy had not been arrested. “The officer told me that I wasn’t getting out of the patrol car until I answered his questions,” Chris said. “He said I didn’t have a choice. I was scared.” Grisham said his boy was traumatized by the incident. “Every time he sees a police officer he has a panic attack,” he said. “That’s unfortunate because we always taught our kids to respect police officers. My wife and I are angry about it.” [Emphasis added]

Chris told Fox News that he wants to be like his dad when he grows up. “He inspires me,” he said, adding that his father “didn’t do anything wrong at all.”

At this point, roughly a month later, Grisham says is still “100 percent confused” about why he was arrested. His charges were downgraded from resisting arrest to interfering with a peace officer while performing a duty, but he still thinks the situation is absurd and inexcusable.

“For me, it’s a difficult turning point,” the decorated veteran said. “I wonder what it is that I’m fighting for. If our basic rights are being violated this way — what is my purpose?”

TheBlaze has reached out to the Temple Police Department, but did not receive an immediate response.

“Where this case goes now is really up to a jury,” Grisham’s attorney Kurt Glass told TheBlaze. “It’s up to the citizens of the state of Texas.”

The entire, unedited video from the scene is worth watching:

UPDATE #2:

TheBlaze is aware of accusations that Army Master Sgt. C.J. Grisham has a controversial past, but the video is — at the least — curious, and deserves to be fairly debated. TheBlaze is working on getting more information on all facets of the story, including Grisham’s past, and will keep you posted.

Editor’s note: An editing error in the headline originally suggested the father claimed multiple Boy Scouts were present. It has been corrected to reflect that he was on a Boy Scout-related hike, but that his son was the only Scout present.

Here’s what they announced:

“In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales,” read a statement from the Walmart website. “Going forward, we are raising the age restriction for purchase of firearms and ammunition to 21 years of age. We will update our processes as quickly as possible to implement this change.”

“In 2015, Walmart ended sales of modern sporting rifles, including the AR-15,” it continued. “We also do not sell handguns, except in Alaska where we feel we should continue to offer them to our customers.”

“Additionally, we do not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories,” the statement said. “We have a process to monitor our eCommerce marketplace and ensure our policies are applied.”

“We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms and go beyond Federal law by requiring customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm,” it added. “The law would allow the sale of a firearm if no response to a background check request has been received within three business days, but our policy prohibits the sale until an approval is given.”

The statement concluded by adding that they would be removing items from the Walmart website “resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys.”

The move came after Dick’s Sporting Goods announced that they would end the sale of “assault-style” rifles in its stores nationwide."
blaze115,blaze,"['Sarah Taylor', 'Staff Writer']",2018-02-19 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/19/florida-high-school-student-says-media-is-politicizing-massacre-to-push-gun-control,"A high school student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — the school where Nikolas Cruz allegedly killed 17 people and injured many more — has openly condemned the media for politicizing the tragedy in the days after the Wednesday shooting.

What are the details?

Speaking with The Daily Wire‘s Ryan Saavedra, high school student Brandon Minoff accused the media of taking the focus off of those killed in the mass shooting and using the massacre for an opportunity to push for gun control.

“I think it’s the media,” Minoff told Saavedra, pointing to the media, who the outlet reports Minoff believes is pushing gun control as a response to the shooting. “They exploit everything to make it political. They’re more concerned about gun control at this moment rather than the fact that there were 17 people that were killed.”

The Daily Wire reported that while Minoff does believe that restrictions and limitations should be imposed on firearms, he is greatly disappointed by the media coverage in the days following the deadly attack.

“It pains me to see that knowing that 17 of my classmates are dead and they just want to talk about gun control,” Minoff added. “Students have opinions, they say stuff that they’re against guns, and that gun control is necessary, but they’re making it bigger than it needs to be at this moment.”

While Minoff said that passing some sort of legislation to reduce tragedies of this type would be “helpful,” he also seems to have doubts about any gun control laws’ efficacy.

“You can’t drink until you’re 21, but that doesn’t stop kids from drinking,” he explained. “I don’t know if there is a way to stop it. There is a way around anything.”

The outlet reported that Minoff does, however, feel that schools should have armed guards, and said that if assistant football coach Aaron Feis — who died a hero for shielding students from gunfire with his body — had a weapon, the fatalities may have been reduced.

“If Coach Feis would have had a gun or any of the other security guards would have had a gun it definitely would have been less fatal,” Minoff reasoned. “[The shooter] and coach Feis were face-to-face and he just shielded kids instead of having the ability to kill the shooter.”"

What happened?

According to law enforcement officials, a local Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident confronted 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley after he opened fire on parishioners in the town’s First Baptist Church.

CNN reports that when Kelly opened fire on the church with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, a local resident grabbed his own rifle and engaged Kelly, causing him to stop firing on the church, get into a vehicle and run. From there, a chase ensued and Kelly ended up dead. It’s not clear if the resident shot Kelly or if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot.

The resident who engaged Kelly ran into a man’s truck to chase him. That man, Johnnie Langendorff, told his story to local news stations.

What did Langendorff say?

Langendorff told local news station KSAT-TV that he saw the unnamed resident engaging in fire with Kelly. That’s when the resident ran to his truck and they began chasing Kelly. All the while, they were communicating with dispatchers.

Langendorff said the chase reached speeds of up to 95 mph before Kelly lost control of his vehicle and crashed. Langendorff said the unnamed resident then held Kelly at gunpoint. Sometime after the crash is when Kelly died, though it’s not clear when.

“[I was] just trying to get him, to get him apprehended or whatever needed to happened. I mean it was just strictly acting on what the right thing to do was,” Langendorff said.

According to Fox News, the latest updates says that 26 people lost their lives in the church. Dozens of others were injured.

Authorities say the two men saved “countless” lives."

The unfortunate incident took place on the morning of February 14, just hours before the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

According to witnesses, the actual shooter entered the Faith City Mission chapel in Amarillo, Texas, and threatened to hold everyone there hostage. While some people, including a security guard, managed to flee the scene, reformed ex-con Tony Garces saw an opportunity and decided to step up. The attacker had ordered a woman from the church to secure Garces with zip ties, but she purposely left one of them loose. Along with some other churchgoers, Garces confronted the attacker, and managed to take the gun away from him after a struggle.

Soon after that, the cops arrived to the scene of what they had been told was an armed hostage situation and saw a man holding a gun. But that man was Garces, not the recently-disarmed culprit.

“I got the gun,” Garces told the local ABC 7 affiliate in Amarillo. “I thought it was over. but they the cops shot me. The good guys shot me.”

According to Garces’s own account to ABC 7: “I said ‘hey, hey I got the gun. I took the gun away from him.’ … They [the police] said throw it down. I wasn’t going to throw it down because it could have fired. It had bullets in it, you know. I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt. … Then pop, pop they shot me. … I went down, then a puddle of blood. … I thought I was a goner.”

Garces was hit by two bullets: one hitting him in the back, and the other above his collar bone. One of those bullets punctured one of his lungs. NBC reports that the department is investigating the incident.

Garces and his lawyer are asking the city to pay his medical expenses, and to give police officers more training in the use of deadly force. According to NBC News, as of February 27 Garces’s lawyer said that city authorities have not yet reached out to him."

Now, it appears the dialogue has significantly shifted the public’s view of increased gun regulations. A new CNN poll found public support for more gun control has reached its highest levels in 25 years.

What did the poll find?

The poll, conducted Feb. 20-23 among a sample of 1,016 respondents, found that 70 percent of American adults favor stricter gun control laws while just 27 are opposed.

The numbers mark a significant shift in public opinion on the issue, even after mass shootings. The same poll found that after the Las Vegas massacre last October, just 52 percent of American adults favored stricter gun control laws, while 44 percent didn’t.

And after the Pulse Nightclub shooting in June 2016, only 55 percent of adults told CNN they were in favor of increased gun regulations while 42 percent said they opposed them.

The last time CNN’s poll registered such high support for stricter gun control laws was in December 1993, when 70 percent of Americans said then they supported increased gun regulations.

It came at a time when Americans had recently experienced three tragic mass shootings, the first coming at a California school in 1989, the second being at a Texas restaurant in 1991 — which is still the sixth deadliest U.S. mass shooting in history — and the third coming in 1993 in San Francisco.

At the time, the frequency of mass shootings and public opinion on guns led Congress to act. Just nine months after the CNN poll in December 1993, Congress passed the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban and then-President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law.

The ban lasted 10 years and mostly addressed cosmetic features of firearms, not differences that make some firearms more lethal than others, such as caliber and velocity variances.

Will Congress act again?

Possibly. President Donald Trump and many Republicans have signaled they are willing to give way on strengthening some firearm regulations. Trump said last week that he is looking into raising the age for long gun purchases to 21, in addition to directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ban bump stocks and seeking ways to improve the federal background check system.

But it’s the outspoken students who were victims of the tragic shooting who are likely making the biggest inroads on gun control. For more than a week now, a handful of Stoneman Douglas students have taken their anti-NRA message to TV and radio stations and it’s making a difference.

Meanwhile, many Americans are likely just plain tired of school shootings and want a solution — any solution — to prevent the next one.

No matter which way you slice it, it appears the gun control debate will rage on for the next few weeks. Whether anything actually comes of it remains to be seen."

CNN announced Wednesday morning that the NRA accepted the network’s invitation to take part in Wednesday’s town hall and revealed that Dana Loesch, national spokeswoman for the NRA and former host on TheBlaze TV, will represent the gun rights group.

Those set to appear at the town hall include students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed and many more were injured during a shooting at the school on Feb. 14, as well as parents and other members of the Parkland community.

The outlet reported that Florida Sens. Bill Nelson (D) and Marco Rubio (R) will also be in attendance, as well as Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.

According to CNN, President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott declined the network’s invitation to attend the town hall.

A spokesperson for Scott said, “With only two weeks left of our annual legislative session, Governor Rick Scott will be in Tallahassee meeting with state leaders to work on ways to keep Florida students safe, including school safety improvements and keeping guns away from individuals struggling with mental illness.”

A White House representative has yet to comment on Wednesday’s town hall at the time of this writing.

The sign — which well-known charismatic senior pastor Rodney Howard-Browne noted is on every door at the Florida church — has been up for about a year, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

But it got greater attention when Browne posted an image of the sign on his Instagram page following the deadly Texas church shooting that took 26 lives.

Welcome to the River at Tampa Bay Church – our sign at every door of our church #welcomesign #theriverattampabaychurch A post shared by drrmhb (@rodneyhowardbrowne) on Nov 7, 2017 at 12:56am PST

“It is a deterrent,” associate pastor Allen Hawes told the paper. “Look at what is going on. In the past two months, look at what happened in Texas. Look at what happened in Las Vegas. Because we are a church that is on television, we are very involved in the community. We want people to know that this is a safe zone.”

Hawes himself has a concealed weapons permit and a Springfield Armory 1911 handgun, the Times reported, adding that he’s far from alone in the 21-year-old church.

“If you walk through the door with the intention to harm, that sign serves as a deterrent to you,” he told the paper. “We are not a soft target. People here will defend their families.”

River at Tampa Bay Church also has hosted concealed weapons permit classes, the Times said.

Reactions to Browne’s Instagram post of the ominous church sign have run the gamut from starkly opposed to fully supportive:"

He made his comments on “Fox News Sunday,” and even criticized host Chris Wallace for focusing on gun control during a preceding interview with Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R).

What did he say?

“You’re talking about gun control. I just had to listen to you and Gov. Scott talk about gun control. Gun control is a big issue, no one in America is going to come together on gun control,” Pollack said.

“You didn’t say one thing about fixing it. The American people, we could get together on school safety,” he added. “But when you polarize it and every other media…we don’t care about gun control right now…you’re not gonna get everyone together on it. But, we are gonna get everyone together on fixing our schools.”

Pollack continued, tearing into the media and Wallace for not asking important questions on how school safety nationwide should be improved to ensure the kids’ safety. He said the media is focusing on gun control because it drives ratings.

“Today, it’s not about guns. It’s about the safety in our schools, and that’s what you ask Gov. Scott about. My kid’s not here, because the schools weren’t safe. That’s the main thing,” Pollack explained.

Pollack suggested that security at schools should be similar to security at airports and courthouses, two places that almost never see any type of violence.

Throughout the rest of the interview, Wallace tried to ask Pollack questions about other topics, such as the school resource officer who didn’t engage the shooter and took cover outside, but Pollack didn’t want to talk about extraneous issues. He sought to keep the dialogue focused on improving school safety, so his daughter’s death wasn’t in “vain.”

That phrase? “Son a Nutcracker That’s a Good Deal!!!”

But Ferrell and Hollywood suits weren’t laughing.

Ferrell’s views on guns are no secret; he appeared along with other celebrities in a 2012 video called “Demand a Plan” urging gun control. And as you might expect, Family Firearms received a cease-and-desist order over the ad from lawyers representing the movie’s production company, TMZ reported.

With that the Valrico store removed Ferrell’s “Elf” image from the ad and instead employed a new character: just your plain ol’ everyday elf.

But Family Firearms didn’t delete Ferrell’s “Son of a Nutcracker” exclamation:

TheBlaze on Thursday reached out to Family Firearms regarding the ad but a representative had no comment other than they complied with the order.

Either way, do you think we’d leave you without this brief blast from the past?

blaze123,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2017-10-04 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/04/woman-charged-for-cop-murder-attempt-i-shot-him-in-the-freakin-arm-i-wasnt-trying-to-kill-him,"Karisa Daniels — an admitted convicted felon — said she was “extremely high” when a Virginia state trooper tried pulling her over for speeding last month, WRIC-TV reported. After a vehicle chase, Daniels told the station she shot the trooper “one time and one time only.”

But speaking to a WRIC reporter from jail, the 23-year-old mother of two said what she’s accused of is “ridiculous.”

“They got me with this ridiculous charge … attempted capital murder,” Daniels told the station, “and I shot him in the freakin’ arm, you know? Like, I wasn’t trying to kill him.”

What happened?

Senior Trooper C.A. Putnam tried to pull over Daniels for driving 87 mph on Chippenham Parkway on the night of Sept. 19, authorities told WRIC.

She told WRIC she’s a convicted felon and was illegally carrying a gun, driving with a suspended license and didn’t want to go to jail.

Daniels told the station she stopped but “as soon as he got out of the car I took off. And … then next thing I know he’s right behind me again.”

She said she was “under the influence” and “extremely high” at the time, WRIC reported.

The pursuit ended miles later in a Henrico cul-de-sac — a dead end, the station said, adding that the trooper rammed her car.

“The next thing I know, I heard, ‘Put your hands up! Put your hands up where I can see ’em!’ and then I heard ‘pop,’ and I’m like, ‘OK, so he’s going to shoot me if I run,’ so I turned around and I shot him,” Daniels told WRIC.

Trooper Putnam never fired his weapon, state police told the station. Neighbors said they heard only one shot, WRIC added.

Daniels tried to run away, the station said, but Henrico police arrested her at a nearby home.

Putnam was expected to recover, WRIC reported.

Now what?

Daniels was charged with attempted capital murder of a police officer and using a gun to commit a felony, the station said, adding that she was in Henrico County Jail with no bond. Her next court date is Dec. 6, Richmond.com reported.

Is Daniels suspected of other crimes?

Richmond police said they plan to charge Daniels with two Sept. 12 payday loan robberies on Midlothian Turnpike, Richmond.com noted, adding that in both instances the robber was said to have pulled a firearm on employees and demanded money.

Daniels also was scheduled to face nine charges in Wake County, North Carolina — her home state — in connection with alleged offenses on May 25, the outlet reported, citing court records.

They include possession of a firearm by a felon, carrying a concealed weapon and a charge of “go armed to terror of people,” as well as three charges of assault by pointing a gun, Richmond.com reported, citing court records.

She also faces misdemeanor charges of simple assault, disorderly conduct and being intoxicated and disruptive, the outlet added, citing online court records.

Daniels also is a suspect in two early September armed robberies in South Carolina, Myrtle Beach police Capt. Joey Crosby told Richmond.com.

Daniels is charged with two counts of kidnapping, two counts of armed robbery and two counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime in connection with those robberies, Crosby added to the outlet.

She also has three pending weapons charges in Granville County District Court in North Carolina, Richmond.com said, citing court records.

Daniels also has convictions from 2012 and 2013 for larceny, shoplifting and resisting an officer, the outlet reported, citing records from the North Carolina Department of Corrections.

What else did Daniels have to say for herself?

Daniels told the station that shooting the trooper was “the worst mistake I’ve ever made in my life. I can’t believe I did something like that, but I can’t take it back.”

She told the station, “Just sitting in here today I’m like, ‘What have I done?’”

But she still maintained to WRIC that what happened to her isn’t right: “It’s so unfair that, like, you can be taken away from everything in a matter of minutes. Everything. Your job, your family, your house, your kids. Everything.”

Warren Drouin and Steven Boyce, both 22, were spotted walking around a Portland neighborhood around 2 p.m., their weapons in full view, KATU-TV reported. Police were called, but because Oregon state law permits the open carrying of firearms, the men weren’t breaking any laws.

Drouin and Boyce said they were just trying to normalize the image of legally carrying weapons in public.

“I just want to educate people that it’s OK however you want to carry or not at all,” Boyce told KATU.

But parents and others in the neighborhood were disturbed and upset by the display, which came less than a month after a gunman used a semiautomatic rifle to massacre 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

“That’s not the purpose of the Second Amendment, to frighten citizens, to frighten women and children,” Susan Anglada Bartley, the mother of a 9-month-old girl, told the station. “And I don’t think there’s anyone who can argue, especially after the tragedy where so many children were killed – nobody can argue that it’s not scary to have people marauding around Sellwood with guns.”

It also happened the same day Vice President Joe Biden suggested President Barack Obama could take “executive action” to crack down on guns.

“It’s completely ridiculous,” Bob Cronk said of Drouin and Boyce’s actions. “I think our right to a peaceful quiet school day comes before their right to brandish their rifles in a family-oriented neighborhood.”

Drouin’s YouTube account, under the username “Markedguardian,” contains dozens of videos of him walking around with his AR-15 strapped to his back and his encounters with law enforcement. He describes himself as a “constitutional guardian and activist…trying to normalize firearms in public.”

“I believe that carry [sic] a rifle daily will bring a strong culture in my area,” he says.

But what about gun rights other countries?

Last weekend, Fareed Zakaria’s “Global Public Square” on CNN spent an entire hour sharing “lessons” about guns that America can learn from the rest of the world.

Zakaria opened the segment on gun ownership in Japan by stating, “If you want to own a gun, good luck.”

How easy or difficult is it for law-abiding citizens to own guns in a place like Japan? The country’s Firearm and Swords Control law simply states, “No person shall possess a firearm.”

There are a few exceptions to the law, typically made for hunters. However, there is also a strict set of bureaucratic hurdles to get past before even a hunter can purchase a firearm.

CNN spoke with an American who navigated the stringent rules Japan imposes on would-be gun owners.

Retired U.S. Marine Rick Sacca lives in Japan and managed to successfully complete the lengthy process. He shared with CNN the details of what it took to acquire and maintain a firearm permit in Japan.

The Marine kept several binders filled with the information and forms he needed to complete the requirements.

In addition to the paperwork me must maintain, Sacca also had to deal with the following:

● 20 hours of classes

● Written test

● Shooting range test

● Complete background check

● Complete medical exam

● Complete psychological evaluation

● At least five interviews with police in an interrogation room

● Police questioned family members, co-workers and neighbors

● Detailed map of the home where the gun will be stored, including photos of the locks on the storage cabinet

Once you are granted permission to own a gun in Japan, Sacca noted that the permit needs to updated and renewed “regularly.”

He added, “The intrusion that occurs with the process regularly would never, ever be tolerated in the U.S.”

blaze126,blaze,['Justin Haskins'],2017-10-05 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/05/commentary-three-facts-that-destroy-the-lefts-anti-gun-narrative,"Since the mass shooting in Las Vegas that ended with at least 58 people dead and close to 500 injured, anti-gun progressives have been working overtime to convince the American people that gun owners’ rights should be greatly restricted, a move they say will make the United States a much safer place to live.

The left attempts to achieve its vision for a gun-free America by appealing to the emotions of a hurting nation, but if people look beyond the worn-out progressive slogans to the facts, they’ll see that passing restrictive gun laws does not create the promised reductions in crime. In fact, statistics show thousands of lives are saved every year because of legal gun ownership.

Below are three facts that completely dismantle the left’s anti-gun narrative.

No. 1: More guns do not equal more crime.

Progressives’ entire argument about gun ownership hinges on the idea that societies that have more guns are more likely to have greater problems with crime. It has always amazed me how easily so many Americans have bought into such an obviously false claim.

According to researchers at Boston University and Columbia University, there are only six states in which at least 50 percent of the households are believed to own a gun: Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming. If liberals’ arguments about guns were true, we should expect these six states to have extremely high crime rates, with an emphasis on murder and other violent crimes. The evidence reveals the opposite.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported four of the six states — Idaho, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming — ranked in the top half of all states for having the lowest homicide rates in 2015, with Idaho and Wyoming ranking in the top six. Further, although Arkansas has both a high gun-ownership rate and high homicide rate, it had a lower homicide rate than four of its six neighboring states (Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma), even though it had a higher gun-ownership rate than all of those states. And a review of other forms of crime statistics will reveal similar results.

So, if more guns don’t equate to their being more crime, what does? Generally speaking, poverty. In states where income disparities are lower, you tend to see fewer violent crimes. In states with higher disparities (and thus more extreme poverty), there’s more crime.

What about all of the statistics showing high gun-related deaths? Progressives love to show charts, graphs and tables supposedly establishing a connection between gun-related deaths and gun laws. What they almost never do, however, is tell people that gun-related death statistics include suicides, which greatly skew the results, especially since many rural states (where gun ownership is high) often have high suicide rates.

No. 2: Stricter gun laws don’t prevent violent crimes.

Progressives often argue that the only way to stop gun-related crime is to restrict gun ownership for everyone. People living in cities like Chicago, where the gun laws are very strict but there’s also lots of gun crimes, know this isn’t true. But when liberals are faced with examples such as Chicago, they will quickly say that the problem is guns are flooding into the city from other places. If gun laws were strict everywhere, they argue, gun crimes would be reduced.

If this were true, we should see lots of crime in states with lax gun laws. After all, if criminals are buying guns legally in the hopes of hurting other people, wouldn’t they be more likely to do this in states where it’s easier to buy guns?

Here, as we saw before, progressives are totally wrong. Many states with extremely lax gun laws have very low crime rates as well. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates for gun control, gave in its recent gun-control report card “F” grades to five out of the six states with the lowest homicide rates. The sixth state, New Hampshire, received a “D” grade. And these states also have very low crime rates in virtually every other category.

What about mass shootings like the one that happened in Las Vegas? Surely those would be prevented with stricter gun laws, right? Again, the research says otherwise. In an op-ed published Wednesday in the Washington Post, statistician Leah Libresco, a person who said she used to support gun-control laws (until she examined the evidence for herself), said the data show Australia and Britain have not experienced fewer mass shootings following their efforts to tighten gun laws.

“I researched the strictly tightened gun laws in Britain and Australia and concluded that they didn’t prove much about what America’s policy should be,” Libresco wrote. “Neither nation experienced drops in mass shootings or other gun related-crime that could be attributed to their buybacks and bans. Mass shootings were too rare in Australia for their absence after the buyback program to be clear evidence of progress. And in both Australia and Britain, the gun restrictions had an ambiguous effect on other gun-related crimes or deaths.”

Further, gun-control advocates ignore the fact that guns save lives every year. Numerous surveys have been conducted on defensive gun uses, and they report there are hundreds of thousands of defensive gun uses every single year. Some report more than 2 million. Even on the lowest end of the spectrum — the National Crime Victimization Survey — more than 67,000 people used guns to defend themselves or their property. (About 33,000 people are killed every year from guns nationwide, and two-thirds of those deaths are suicides.)

No. 3: Ridding America of its guns would be virtually impossible and conflicts with other progressive beliefs.

The United States has a gun culture unlike any other in the world. No one knows exactly how many guns exist across the country, but most estimates show around 270 million. Some show nearly as many guns as people. And guns aren’t just a hobby; for many Americans, gun ownership is considered an essential liberty. Even if the U.S. Congress were to pass laws severely restricting all forms of gun ownership, what would happen to the hundreds of millions of guns currently in existence? What would the government do to the millions of people who would refuse to give up their guns?

Progressives know passing restrictive gun laws anytime in the near future is an impossibility, but it remains one of their primary long-term goals, despite being in complete opposition to other progressive beliefs. For instance, progressives routinely demand strict gun control limits while at the same advocating for open borders. Even if the federal government could destroy every gun now in America, without closing our massive borders, guns would come flooding back in! True gun control without massive border-security improvements is not feasible, and of the two policies (open borders or gun control), it seems unlikely progressives would choose taking guns away over allowing illegal immigrants to enter the United States—at least for now.

Further, what is the logical end of strict gun control? No or very little private gun ownership. That would leave only the military and police officers with guns, and progressives are constantly arguing racism is rampant in U.S. police departments. Why, then, would the left want the police to be the only ones in our society armed?

Tragedies like the one that occurred Sunday night in Las Vegas are indisputably horrific, and Americans should do whatever they can, within reason and without destroying liberty, to prevent such events from happening again. But isolated tragedies should never be an excuse for limiting personal freedoms, and even if the case could be made that gun-control laws would reduce murders (it can’t), Americans need to consider the long-term ramifications of that decision. The Second Amendment wasn’t primarily passed so people would have guns to hunt and protect their homes; it was created and approved by the American people through their elected representatives to protect the people from a tyrannical government. As some unknown American writer once said, “When the people fear the government, there’s tyranny. When the government fears the people, there’s liberty.”"

Since the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, one of the major responses has been to increase restrictions on gun rights, presumably to reduce the probability that a mass shooting will take place.

But what if their proposed methods for doing so are unconstitutional? That’s the argument advanced by some experts on constitutional law, who argue that the landmark cases of District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago protect against the most controversial ideas being proposed, such as an assault weapons ban. Moreover, even some renowned liberal experts on the same law law admit that the tools available to the government are limited.

Key questions in the debate are: Can the government ban assault weapons without violating the Constitution? If so, why? To answer these questions, TheBlaze spoke to legal authorities on both sides of the ideological divide, including some truly famous names within the realm of constitutional law. What we found may surprise you.

I. Background: Heller, McDonald and the Limits of the Second Amendment

When it comes to the regulation of gun rights, two Supreme Court cases stand out as definitive: The 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, and the 2010 case McDonald v. Chicago. Both cases conclusively established that the individual right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Constitution, and that this right is in force whether one is talking about state-level gun law or federal gun law.

One might think this is the end of almost every gun law. After all, if there’s a constitutional right involved, the assumption is that the government can’t do anything to infringe on that right, right? Wrong. Every constitutional right has exceptions, or place where a right doesn’t apply. For instance, the Supreme Court has found exceptions to the First Amendment to include things like fighting words, obscenity and words that present a “clear and present danger” (such as yelling “fire” in a crowded theater when no fire exists). That is, the government can regulate, and even ban, such exercises of “speech” without running afoul of the First Amendment.

Similarly, both Heller and McDonald set limits on the right to keep and bear arms, even as they affirm that that right exists. TheBlaze has covered some of those limits already, but for now, it’s enough to quote from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion in Heller, which sets up the current controversy:

Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.

Some of this might strike the reader as obvious. However, there is one point of vagueness, which is where most of the controversy in the current climate comes in. Scalia writes that “dangerous and unusual weapons” are not protected by the Second Amendment. This raises a very simple question: What counts as “dangerous and unusual?” In fact, what counts as “dangerous”? What counts as “unusual?” If a weapon is only dangerous, but not unusual, or only unusual, but not dangerous, is it protected by the Second Amendment? The answers to these questions aren’t obvious, and they have real, non-academic implications for the government’s power.

II. Can the government ban assault weapons?

The original Heller case involved a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia, which the court struck down. The reasoning, in its briefest form, was as follows:

The District’s total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of “arms” that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition—in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute—would fail constitutional muster.[…] It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is per­missible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed. It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the Americanpeople have considered the handgun to be the quintessen­tial self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emer­gency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upperbody strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.

In other words, the problem with the ban on handguns was simple: Handguns are a class of weapons that are commonly used. This would seem to suggest that the reference to “dangerous and unusual weapons” really should have emphasized the “unusual” part, given that all weapons are (relatively) dangerous.

On these grounds, at least one expert would toss out assault weapons bans entirely. That expert, Randy Barnett of Georgetown Law Center, explained his reasoning to theBlaze via phone:

“When you get down to specifics, I think some of the easier cases for finding unconstitutionality is the assault weapons ban, which bans a weapon in common use, which is the phrase that Heller used to describe the weapons that are protected by the Second Amendment,” Barnett told TheBlaze. “There’s hardly a weapon that’s in more common use than the AR-15 so-called assault weapon. I say so-called, because we all know this is a made-up category. They don’t fire any faster than a constitutionally protected handgun fires, and it’s typically less lethal than a handgun.”

Barnett continued, “Because these weapons are in common use, it seems like it would be unconstitutional to ban them, especially given the irrationality of the statute in which cosmetic features are used to distinguish the bad guns from the good guns.”

However, Barnett’s opinion is not held by everyone. Laurence Tribe, of Harvard Law School, declined to comment directly on this story, but forwarded TheBlaze an unedited version of his own testimony before Congress on this topic via email. Tribe takes a much more generous view of the question of assault weapons bans.

“Heller recognized that dangerous or unusual weapons may be and have historically been heavily regulated or banned,” Tribe’s testimony runs. “It is not inconceivable – indeed, it seems quite likely – that the court‘s pause to distinguish unusually dangerous weapons from widely possessed handguns had precisely the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which included a prohibition on high-capacity magazines, in mind. At the very least, the Heller majority recognized that the government could keep machine guns —M-16 rifles and the like—out of the hands of civilians. The Supreme Court thus emphatically rejected the extravagant, or as Justice Scalia characterized it, startling notion, still promoted by some, that the Second Amendment could fulfill its original purposes only if citizens were guaranteed a right to arm themselves to the teeth, matching in their private armories essentially the full array of weapons possessed by the United States Military.”

Tribe continues:

Even if the characterization of these features as cosmetic were accurate, it would make little difference as a constitutional matter. In a recent televised interview, Justice Scalia explained the basis in history for exempting certain types of regulations from Second Amendment review. Certain limitations on gun ownership are constitutionally permissible, he contended, because there were some regulations that were acknowledged at the time [of the Founding. For example, there was a tort called affrighting . . . if you carried around a really horrible weapon just to scare people, like a head ax or something. . . . What the justice evidently meant was that regulating weapons because they are chosen specifically for their intimidating appearance is constitutionally unproblematic because the very use of intimidation is unnecessarily disruptive to organized society. Even more important to the constitutionality of the assault weapons ban is the absence of any connection to the core Second Amendment right to defend oneself with a firearm. At this committee‘s hearing on January 30, several witnesses criticized the assault weapons ban on policy grounds, but in my role as a constitutional lawyer listening intently for arguments relevant to the proposal‘s Second Amendment propriety, I was struck by the failure of anyone‘s testimony to support these features as essential to self-defense. In fact, I have searched in vain for any reasoned arguments that pistol grips, forward grips, telescoping stocks, grenade or rocket launchers, and barrel shrouds are indispensable or even contribute to self-defense.

Interestingly, in the same testimony, Tribe does not dispute Barnett’s characterization of the AR-15 magazine-fed semiautomatic rifle as a common weapon. In fact, he describes it as “America‘s most popular rifle.” Nevertheless, for Tribe, the relevant point is not the fact that the weapon is common, but rather that it is unusually dangerous, an idea that Barnett disputes, arguing that handguns actually fire more damaging rounds than the AR-15.

Another interesting difference between the more liberal line taken by Tribe and the more conservative one taken by Barnett is in their perception of lower court decisions since Heller and McDonald were handed down. Tribe cites a recent decision by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals upholding Washington, DC’s assault weapons to prove his points, whereas Barnett takes a much dimmer view of such cases.

“Many of the lower courts are engaged in what you might call civil disobedience against Heller and McDonald,” Barnett told TheBlaze. “I would not rely on courts to protect the Second Amendment. The courts did not protect the right to keep and bear arms until 2006, and yet nevertheless we had such a right, and that right we had as a result of political action.”

However, there is a compromise position between these two arguments, advanced by none other than Robert Levy of the Cato Institute, who was actually one of the co-counsels in favor of gun rights in the Heller case itself. In an interview this January, Levy told the Washington Post:

We had an assault weapons ban from 1994 to 2004. The New York Times, after the ban expired, reported that despite dire predictions that the streets would be awash in military-style guns, expiration of the assault weapons ban has not set off a sustained surge in sales or caused any noticeable increase in gun crime. There are, of course, millions of these so-called assault weapons, and they’re used by millions of Americans for all sorts of things, including hunting, self-defense, target shooting, even the Olympics. Criminals use handguns because assault weapons are expensive and they’re difficult to conceal. Now, [the Supreme Court] said that the Second Amendment would likely pose no barrier to outlawing weapons that are not in common use and are especially dangerous. And we have proof of that because fully automated weapons, like machine guns, have been essentially banned since 1934. I don’t consider myself an expert on the technical features of firearms, and so I’m not prepared to say exactly which weapons would go on the list and which shouldn’t, but I think experts should be able to come up with a pretty good list — obviously not needed for self-defense, obviously dangerous, not in common use. And that would be the new assault weapons ban.

In other words, Levy argues, the idea of creating a category of uncommonly used weapons that are less dangerous than fully automatic weapons, but still dangerous relative to handguns, and banning that category of weapons from civilian use, is not unconstitutional. Whether that aim has been achieved in the current case is an issue that probably only courts can answer.

Abate, who also operates Tocco restaurant in Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood, visits the prison daily to supervise the program which teaches inmates how to make delicious personal pizzas. The individual pies are sold to other prisoners in the facility, a skill Abate says will translate to a better life once they are outside of the prison walls.

Thursday on “Pure Opelka,” Mike interviewed Chef Abate. “I use food as a weapon to change people’s lives,” Abate explained.

The Italian immigrant talked about the origin of the program and his strong belief that teaching inmates how to make pizza offers the prisoners a better chance at succeeding once they integrate back into society. And, Abate has the statistics to back it up his belief. According to the chef, 200 inmates have completed his program and only one has returned to prison.

“I hope other people understand how beautiful it is to help others,” Chef Abate told Opelka.

Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, it was revealed that the gun used in the rampage had been checked by baggage claim on the shooter’s flight into what would be the scene of the deadly crime.

Esteban Ruiz Santiago, a 26-year-old veteran, took five lives in his rampage and wounded eight others using a semi-automatic handgun he checked at the Anchorage airport using proper Transportation Safety Administration protocol. After a layover in Minneapolis, Santiago arrived in Florida and reportedly retrieved the handgun, loaded it in the bathroom and began shooting in the baggage claim of Terminal 2.

The ease with which Santiago carried out his attack — which authorities are still open to calling terrorism — has many questioning the TSA’s rules allowing firearms to be checked. According to The New York Times, before Friday, guns checked with luggage raised few alarms:

According to the TSA, passengers at the nation’s airports are allowed to transport unloaded guns in their checked baggage. The firearms must be kept in a locked “hard-sided” container, and gun owners must declare firearms and any ammunition to airline representatives when checking the bags at ticket counters, according to the agency’s firearm regulations. Guns, real ones as well as replicas and toys, are allowed to be transported only in checked baggage, not in carry-on luggage. The same is true for clips, firing pins and other firearm parts.

But now, in light of Santiago’s vicious act of murder, the federal regulation allowing checked firearms is being scrutinized for several reasons, notably the lack of a requirement proving registration or paperwork for the firearm. Travelers in many cases need merely to sign a document proving the firearm is not loaded and nothing more.

There is also the matter of differences between cities’ gun laws. Many have faced fines when retrieving checked firearms in cities where they are technically not allowed to possess a firearm at all.

Checked firearms were once an obscure part of airline travel. The shooting in the Ft. Lauderdale airport Friday has ensured it will be likely be discussed as part of any firearm safety legislation going forward."

There are 44 companies on our list, with more being added as we receive notification. Here are the additions since Wednesday:

Here’s a sample of statements from some of the recent additions to the list as well as the positions of the companies that have reached out to TheBlaze directly to declare their policy shift:

Steve Adelmann of Citizen Arms shared the following from his company’s statement, made the day after New York changed its laws:

“Due to legal, ethical and moral concerns, Citizen Arms offers only those custom firearms that are legal for all lawful citizens of a given state to possess, regardless of law enforcement status. LE personnel living in states where citizens must have restrictive features will only receive like product support from Citizen Arms. We’re very appreciative of the sacrifices made by the law enforcement community but we’re even more appreciative of the right guaranteed to all law-abiding US citizens by the Second Amendment to the US Constitution: A well regulated militia, necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”.

On February 20th, as our story was hitting the web, Ronnie Barrett, the Chairman and CEO of Barrett Firearms posted his company’s position statement on their Facebook page:

Barrett’s Position Regarding the Assault on Liberty Barrett opposes those who are illegally disarming the American public from their efficient arms and creating superior armed elitist government agencies. Elected state officials of New York, having been sworn to protect our Constitution, have instead committed an offense against it and their citizens by stripping inalienable rights duly protected and guaranteed under th…e Second Amendment. By their deliberate and sinister actions, these officials now cause their state and local policing agencies to enforce these unconstitutional and illegal so called “laws”. By current law, Barrett cannot be an accomplice with any lawbreaker, therefore, cannot and will not service or sell to New York government agencies. Barrett also applies this stance to the individual elected official who, as a matter of public record, has voted for or created regulation that violates the constitutional rights of their citizens. This is an expansion of our 2002 ban against the California government due to their second amendment infringements, and shall apply to any future violators. In the course of world history there have been officials that strip inalienable rights from the people that were given to all by our Creator. Most of these officials inevitably come to trial, some do not. Intentionally violating constitutional rights by officials that have sworn to uphold them should have severe prison sentences. With the clear vision of horrible events in history repeating itself, all manufacturers of firearms or related equipment remaining in partnership with such violators should have a respectable fear of being found with the guilty on their day of trial. During this era of assault on liberty, Barrett will remain steadfast in our efforts to serve law-abiding citizens of all fifty states, and stands together with you in the struggles we will fight and win.

Jeffrey Norton of Norton Firearms not only sends a message about the Second Amendment, but also reminds folks that our rights come to us from “our US Constitution and our Creator.”

Norton Firearms, Inc. is a strong defender of the US Constitution, not only the 2nd amendment. We believe that a government that restricts it Citizens from executing their Constitutional Rights is no longer a government for the people or by the people. It is our policy not to sell our products or services to any organization that tries to diminish the rights given to us by our US Constitution and our Creator. If you are a government agency with a policy of restricting our Constitutional Rights we ask that you take our tax dollars and spend it somewhere else. I am sure there is some profiteering communist foreign company that will be glad to take our dollars for their gain. We will only sell to law abiding, Citizens and those agencies that truly support and will defend The US Constitution.

Doug Prince of Evolution Weaponry told TheBlaze, “Evolution Weaponry is proud to say you can add us to that list.”

I am a US Army veteran. I received a medical discharge due to combat related injuries after 6 years of service. I am a strong believer in American veterans, the US Constitution and individual liberty. My service to this country is among my greatest accomplishments in my life to this point and I carry what I have learned from that into every endeavor I undertake.

Arizona’s Kiss Tactical’s Facebook page also carries a story about denying a California police officer’s request to purchase an AR-15.

On Saturday I refused to sell a AR-15 rifle to a police officer from California. He came into my shop and wanted to buy his duty gun in AZ because the same gun in his home state would cost him more. I told him that I would not sell him the gun even though he had his department letter saying he was able to buy it. I told him that if the gun was not legal for law abiding men and women in CA, I would not sell it to him. after he told me that “civilians don’t need them type of guns” I asked to leave my shop. as he stomped out mad.

Doublestar Corporation (which includes J&T Distributing, DoubleStar Corp., Ace Limited, and the DoubleStar Training Academy) will also be unavailable to law enforcement and government agencies in states suppressing citizen’s rights.

Effective immediately, the J&T Family of Companies will be joining other manufacturers and distributors by ceasing sales of regulated items in states that have altered the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms.

There are also a host of smaller outlets taking a stand.

Witness the recent news from Old Grouch’s Military Surplus in North Carolina:

In support of our customers in the state of New York, effective today we are cancelling all orders to any state or municipal government agency customers in the New York and will accept no more. While we can’t stop the trampling of rights that is occurring there, we certainly can make sure we don’t assist in it in any way going forward.

We hope to keep this list as accurate as possible and will update it with news and additions as we receive them and can confirm their accuracy. Please forward any information directly to mopelka@theblaze.com.

You can also follow the efforts to encourage other companies to join this group here."

This is an editorially independent series sponsored by Tactical Firearms Training Secrets.

A 19-year-old sailor stationed in Annapolis, Md., in 1968 was arrested for getting into a fight with an alleged member of a street gang.

Now, more than four decades later, the 64-year-old U.S. Navy veteran has been stripped of his right to own a gun.

Jefferson Wayne Schrader of Cleveland, Ga., has been fighting a losing battle in the courts since 2008 to get his name off the fed’s firearm ban list. In fact, just last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a lower-court ruling barring him from owning a firearm.

“It’s a depressing thing. A depressing thing,” he told TheBlaze in a phone interview, “to have the government treat you like that. It’s not, well, it’s not a good thing.”

The ban list is meant to prevent people of questionable standing, including illegal aliens, drug addicts, people dishonorably discharged from the U.S. military, and fugitives, from buying or selling guns.

And although Schrader — a certified expert with a handgun — served in Vietnam from Jan. 1, 1968, until being honorably discharged in September 1970, the U.S. government believes he is unfit to own a gun because of his teenage misdemeanor.

“Due to a conviction some forty years ago for common-law misdemeanor assault and battery for which he served no jail time, plaintiff Jefferson Wayne Schrader, now a sixty-four-year-old veteran, is, by virtue of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), barred for life from ever possessing a firearm,” U.S. Circuit Judge David Tatel wrote in the court’s January opinion.

“In rejecting plaintiffs’ constitutional claim, the district court relied on the Supreme Court’s observation in District of Columbia v. Heller … that ‘the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,’ as well as the Court’s inclusion of ‘longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons’ within a list of ‘presumptively lawful regulatory measures,’” Judge Tatel added.

In its ruling against Schrader, the fed appeals court cited the Gun Control Act of 1968 signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson, which makes it more difficult for questionable characters to engage in interstate commerce involving firearms.

But we’ll come back to that later.

The other gun law that led to Schrader’s odd set of circumstances is the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. This bill laid the groundwork for the FBI’s 1998 National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

So when Schrader tried to buy a handgun in 2008, the NICS flagged his 45-year-old misdemeanor – which only now qualifies in Maryland for a sentence of two or more years in prison – and he was disqualified from making the purchasing.

But here’s the weird thing: Schrader has been selling and trading guns for a long time.

“I’ve bought and sold probably, oh, a dozen … maybe 15 guns over a 42 year time period” he said. “I never had a problem with it. I was just surprised it happened at all. The ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] agent said I wasn’t allowed to have any guns.”

“But he said I could keep my black powder rifle. Thank you very much,” he added sarcastically.

TROUBLE

As mentioned in the above, it all started in 2008 when an NICS check flagged Schrader’s name for his 1968 misdemeanor.

The FBI blocked Schrader’s wife, Harriet, from buying him a shotgun for his birthday and then blocked him on two different occasions from buying a handgun.

But let’s back up for a second and revisit his 1968 misdemeanor.

As Schrader told TheBlaze, one evening in Annapolis he and his Navy buddies were attacked by a street gang while walking back to base. A few weeks later, Schrader saw one of his attackers hanging out on a street corner.

“I told the guy driving to stop and let me out,” Schrader said, “and I walked over to him and was going to tell him, ‘You need to come with me, we’re going to talk you over to the police station.’ And he said, ‘Oh, you want some more?’ and stood up.”

As official court documents show, “a dispute broke out between the two, in the course of which Schrader punched his assailant.”

Unfortunately for Schrader, he didn’t see the two police officers “sitting at the red light.”

The sailor was arrested and convicted of common-law assault and battery. He was told he could pay a $109 fine, which included court costs, or spend thirty days in the hole.

He chose the former.

After paying the fine, Schrader went on to serve a 21-month tour of duty in Vietnam and was honorably discharged upon his return.

From that time forward, according to the complaint, he had no scrapes with the law (except for one traffic violation).

REASON FOR THE BAN



After going more than five decades without any serious trouble with the law, the 2008 background check came as a shock to Schrader.

“I don’t know why they’re coming after me,” Schrader said. “All I did was punch someone in the nose.”

So what’s the court’s reasoning?

The Gun Control Act (remember we said we’d come back to this?) specifically includes a ban on anyone convicted of a crime “punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.”

Okay, but Schrader never had to serve a prison sentence.

This is where it gets interesting. At the time of his arrest, the state of Maryland did not set any maximum sentence for common-law assault and battery convictions.

However, the DOJ reasons that because Maryland would have imprisoned Schrader for more than a year if it had the laws it has today, well, that’s good enough to keep him on the banned list.

TODAY

Two years after having his name flagged for the Annapolis fight, Schrader sued to challenge the ban and he has been fighting it ever since. Unfortunately, things haven’t gone his way.

“All I can do now is wait and see what my attorney can do,” Schrader told TheBlaze.

His lawyer, Alan Gura, a prominent civil rights attorney, says there are still a few options left.

“Today is our deadline for filing a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc in the Schrader case,” Gura told TheBlaze in an email on Monday.

“Some misdemeanors are very serious and Congress can address those specifically,” he added later in a phone interview, “but to broadly disarm anyone who has ever been involved in even a minor scuffle, 45 years later, seems to be excessive.”

“We hope that the court rehears the case. We think it’s worthy of that. It raises the types of questions that courts often find they need to rehear. If the court does not decide to reconsider the case then, of course, we will consider the next step, which will be a petition to the Supreme Court.”

A spokeswoman with the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to TheBlaze’s request for comment.

Here’s the full case: Schrader v. Holder, 11-cv-5352, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia:

blaze133,blaze,['Mike Opelka'],2013-03-19 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/03/19/dad-this-picture-of-my-son-holding-a-gun-triggered-a-visit-from-nj-police-family-services,"Did this photograph spark a police action that tried to enter a New Jersey home without a warrant? That’s the story being told on a website dedicated to “Open Carry” in the state of Delaware. The title of the story, “The fight has officially been brought to my front door.”

The young man in the photo is the 11-yr-old son of Shawn Moore. The gun is a .22 rifle, a copy of the AR-15, but a 22 caliber. The photo was posted on Facebook by a proud father. That Facebook posting apparently triggered an anonymous call to New Jersey’s Department of Youth and Family Services (DYFS). On Friday night, March 15th, two representatives from the state’s social services office (along with four local police officers) came to the Moore home and demanded to see the family’s firearms.

According to Moore’s lawyer, Evan Nappen (an attorney with considerable expertise in NJ’s very strict gun laws), the situation was “outrageous.”

Here’s what Moore alleges on the Delaware open carry forum:

NJ’s Department of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) came to his home, accompanied by police officers. They claimed to be responding to a call about a photo of a young boy holding a firearm. (photo above)

Without a search warrant, DYFS demanded entry into Moore’s home and access to all of his firearms. Moore was not initially there, but his wife called him.

With his lawyer listening to the exchange on the phone with police and DFYS, Moore denied entry to his home and access to his safe where he stores his guns.

When Moore requested the name of the DFYS representative, she refused to give it to him.

After threatening to “take my kids,” the police and Family Services worker left — “empty handed and seeing nothing.”

In an exclusive interview with TheBlaze, Mr. Nappen — the attorney who was listening to the entire incident via Moore’s speaker phone — added more details:

The DYFS worker repeatedly demanded access to the house and for Moore to open his safe where the firearms were stored. She said that the guns should be catalogued and checked to make certain they were “properly registered.” (NJ does not require registration, it is voluntary.)

The four police officers acted professionally, they were there at the request of DYFS.

The worker refused to identify herself. Mr. Moore demanded that she giver her name. She refused and ran away.

As of Tuesday morning, Mr. Nappen believes that DYFS is still pushing for an inspection, “which is not happening.”

Mr. Nappen also shared few very important facts about this case. For instance, Shawn Moore holds three very significant firearms designations:

NRA Certified Firearms Instructor – One of the toughest certifications to attain, requiring skills with the weapons as well as teaching.

NRA Certified Range Safety Instructor

NJ State Certified Firearms Hunting Instructor

Shawn’s son is also someone who has been certified by the state of New Jersey. In order for a person under the age of 18 to go hunting in New Jersey, they must be accompanied by a parent or adult supervisor, and they must also pass a state firearms hunter safety test. The young Mr. Moore passed the test and his father was NOT his instructor.

Editor’s note — the author of this post, Mike Opelka talked about the story during Tuesday’s live BlazeCast:

TheBlaze first learned about this story via a tip from reader who spotted Shawn Moore’s post on a pro-Second Amendment website. “ShawnMoore81” is a member of Delaware Open Carry, an online community dedicated to supporting open-carry in the state of Delaware. His account of the above incident at his home might give any law-abiding gun owner chills.

We present the un-edited post in Mr. Moore’s own words: Last night I was out with a buddy of mine. I got a text from my wife that the cops and dyfs are at the house and they wanna check out my guns and needed me to open my safe. I’m instantly on my way. I get in contact with evan Nappen on the way. I explain the situation. I walk in my house and hand the phone to the first cop I see. Then direct all of em outside. Dyfs got a call because of a pic on my son holding a gun. They wanted to look around and check all my guns out, make sure they were all registered. Obviously that didn’t go well because I refused. I had Nappen on speaker phone the entire time so they had to deal with both of us. They kept trying to pressure me to open my safe. They had no warrant, no charges, nothing. I didn’t budge. I was told I was being “unreasonable” and that I was acting suspicious because I wouldn’t open my safe. Told me they were gonna get a search warrant. Told em go ahead. Nappen (my lawyer) asked me for the dyfs workers name. she wouldnt give it. i asked for credentials and she wouldnt show em. i tried to take a pic of her and she turned around real fast and walked away. After a while of them threatening to take my kids, get warrants and intimidation they left. Empty handed and seeing nothing. People it can happen that fast. Most people wouldn’t have stood up to them like I did.

Mr. Moore also took photographs of the incident. One shows four police officers (wearing bullet-proof vests) from the Carneys Point, NJ police department were on the scene Saturday night. TheBlaze contacted Chief Robert DiGregorio of the Carneys Point PD to get the department’s account of what happened. The chief did not answer or calls or return our messages.

As you might imagine, the very tight community of Second Amendment supporters has posted this story on Facebook pages and various pro-gun websites. TheBlaze reached out to Mr. Moore in hopes of confirming all of the details he shared as well as asking why he thinks DYFS was called, and where the story stands now.

Moore has not spoken with us, but as mentioned we talked with his attorney and he has answered a few of our questions via e-mail. Late Monday night he wrote to TheBlaze saying, “I have dyfs still insisting to see the inside of my safe.”

Does the DYFS have a right to look inside Moore’s safe? Can they demand that he show his firearms to them? The agency and local law enforcement may be looking to see if Moore violated New Jersey’s Code of Criminal Justice, specifically, 2C:58-6.1 Possession of firearms by minors; exceptions.

b.No person under the age of 18 years shall possess, carry, fire or use a firearm except as provided under paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this subsection; and, unless authorized in connection with the performance of official duties under the provisions of N.J.S.2C:39-6, no person under the age of 21 years shall possess, carry, fire or use a handgunexcept under the following circumstances: (1)In the actual presence or under the direct supervision of his father, mother or guardian, or some other person who holds a permit to carry a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card, as the case may be; or (2)For the purpose of military drill under the auspices of a legally recognized military organization and under competent supervision; or (3)For the purpose of competition or target practice in and upon a firing range approved by the governing body of the municipality in which the range is located or the National Rifle Association and which is under competent supervision at the time of such supervision or target practice or instruction and training at any location; or (4)For the purpose of hunting during the regularly designated hunting season, provided that he possesses a valid hunting license and has successfully completed a hunter’s safety course taught by a qualified instructor or conservation officer and possesses a certificate indicating the successful completion of such a course. c. A person who violates this section shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. For purposes of this section the fact that the act would not constitute a crime if committed by an adult shall not be deemed to prohibit or require waiver of family court jurisdiction pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-11 or to preclude a finding of delinquency under the “New Jersey Code of Juvenile Justice,” P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-20 et seq.), P.L.1982, c.79 (C.2A:4A-60 et seq.), P.L.1982, c.80 (C.2A:4A-76 et seq.) and P.L.1982, c.81 (C.2A:4A-70 et seq.).

TheBlaze reached out to DYFS to confirm Moore’s account of the incident. The local office that covered the Carneys Point, NJ, area where Shawn Moore and his family live, would not respond to any questions from us. In fact, after our call was transferred to a “supervisor” named Lynette we were directed to the Trenton offices. When we requested a correct spelling of Lynette’s last name, she started to spell it and then suddenly stopped, saying, “I’m not comfortable giving you my name.” When we asked for a phone number to the Trenton office, Lynette told us “Google it. Goodbye.”

Calls to the Trenton office of DYFS (now known as “The Division of Child Protection and Permanency”) have not yet been returned.

The boy’s identity has been revealed and he’s now speaking out. See what he has to say about the whole ordeal here."
blaze134,blaze,['Erica Ritz'],2012-11-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/11/10/violence-tax-illinois-county-approves-new-25-fee-on-each-firearm-purchased,"Cook County in Illinois approved a slew of new taxes Friday, including an extra $1 tax on each packet of cigarettes sold, a $1,000 tax per year on certain slot machines, a 1.2% tax on items costing more than $3,500 purchased outside the county, and a $25 tax on each firearm sold in suburban gun shops, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

The hope is that the new taxes will chip away at the roughly $240 million budget deficit by raising roughly $40 million in new revenue, NBC Chicago adds.

The board approved the changes by a vote of 16-1, and though a number of local business owners are concerned the new taxes will push customers into neighboring counties, legislators appear pleased with their work.

“Of the three budgets we have worked on, this has been the easiest. It has come together very well in a very bipartisan spirit,” Commissioner John Fritchey told ABC Chicago.

Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle contributed: “This is a fiscally responsible budget that reflects the values and priorities of my administration. It makes key investments in our public health and public safety systems that will advance a regional health care model and further criminal justice reform.”

Though Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, it is also one of the most dangerous cities.

The proposal originally included a five-cent tax on each bullet, as well, but the nickel-a-bullet tax has been dropped for the time being.

For now, NBC Chicago explains how the $25 “violence tax” is being justified:

“Gun violence is a real problem for us,” she said. “It’s a problem for us in our criminal justice system and it’s a problem for us in our health care system, and I make no apologies for the proposal.” Preckwinkle said acute care for the average shooting victim cost taxpayers $52,000 because nearly 70 percent of the victims don’t have health insurance. The move follows a violent Chicago summer, when some weekends left multiple people killed and dozens others injured in shootings. The city’s murder rate is up 25 percent, and the Cook County Jail is near capacity with 9,000-plus inmates. [Emphasis added]

“I think it is a good thing, especially in this economy right now,” Cook County resident James Fabbrini weighed in.

Shaneen Allen, a single mother to two young boys, is a legal concealed carry permit holder. She reportedly obtained her permit to protect herself and her kids after she was robbed twice. Allen has no prior criminal record and everything about her gun and concealed carry permit is legal.

However, her nightmare began when she traveled to New Jersey from Philadelphia.

Allen was reportedly pulled over by a New Jersey cop for an “unsafe lane change” back in October 2013. Doing what she had been trained to do, the mother informed the officer that she is a concealed carry permit holder and armed at the time.

What she didn’t know was that her permit and firearm became instantly illegal once she crossed into New Jersey, a state with extremely strict gun laws. As TheBlaze previously reported, the mother was arrested and at first faced about 3 years in prison.

Allen reportedly appeared in court this week and, to many people’s surprise, the case wasn’t dismissed by the judge. In fact, she now reportedly faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for possession a concealed weapon and another potential 18 months for possession of hollow-point bullets — more than 11.5 years in total.

My9NJ.com reports that the prosecutor wouldn’t even allow Allen to accept a pretrial deal in order to avoid jail time. Instead, the prosecutor reportedly offered her a plea bargain that includes five years in prison with no option of parole for 3.5 years.

Evan Nappen, Allen’s attorney, told the website that “New Jersey’s gun law is as unforgiving as a prosecutor or judge wants to make it.”

“Either of those two, the judge or the prosecutor could have taken steps to relieve Shaneen from this situation, but it didn’t happen,” he added.

blaze136,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-05-07 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/05/07/guns-and-crime-what-the-statistics-really-say-and-how-theyre-interpreted-in-the-debate,"The reason the recent gun control debate is even occurring is because of crimes committed with firearms. There are those who believe that increased regulation on guns might prevent some crimes and fatalities. Others believe just the opposite — that fewer crimes, or at least fatalities, would result if more people were armed.

But what is the truth about the use of firearms in crimes? What types of crimes are they used to help commit? How often do fatalities result? How often are crimes prevented because of the presence a gun?

There is no shortage of data to answer these questions. But what this data says means different things to different people.

Take Burke Strunsky, the senior district attorney specializing in homicide cases in Riverside County, California. His perspective is, the more guns there are available, the more likely homicides and suicides are going to occur because of them.

“What we do know is we have more guns in circulation than ever before in our history. You know you look at that number compared to U.S. gun violence …it’s 20 times more than other advanced, industrial countries have,” Strunsky said. “To say that’s not related to the proliferation of guns, I think that’s just disingenuous.”

Then there’s the perspective of Steve Siebold, author of “Sex, Politics and Religion: How Delusional Thinking is Destroying America.”

“I don’t think violence will go away. That’s just delusional thinking,” Siebold said.

“A lot of stats go back and forth,” he continued later in a phone interview with TheBlaze. But, when it comes to guns, they are “a proven deterrent.”

The stats

Not only are the statistics interpreted to defend different conclusions, but there are a lot of different sources collecting the information related to firearm use in crimes.

Here’s a look at just a few:

Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey (2009):

22 percent of all violent crimes were committed by an offender wielding a weapon — gun, knife or other object.

8 percent involved a firearm.

28 percent of crimes committed using a firearm were robberies, 5 percent were “simple/aggravated assault” and less than 0.5 percent were rapes or aggravated assaults. To compare, 8 percent of sexual crimes committed with a weapon used knives. In simple/aggravated assaults, knives had an equal percentage of use compared to firearms — 5 percent — and “other” weapons comprised 7 percent.

What does this survey say about firearms used in violent crimes historically? In 1992, handguns accounted for 13 percent of all violent crimes. This shows that between 1992 and 2009, the use of firearms to commit violent crimes dropped.

FBI Violent Crime in the United States (2011):

67.7 percent of all murders, 41.3 percent of robberies and 21.2 percent of aggravated assaults were conducted with guns.

More than 128,900 cases of robbery involved firearms, compared to 24,300 with knives and more than 27,000 with other weapons. More than 130,000 cases were “strong arms.”

More than 137,200 cases of aggravated assault involved firearms, while more than 126,800 involved knives, more than 222,100 involved “other ” weapons and more than 154,100 “hands, fists, feet, etc.”

Strunsky points out though that much of the data regarding guns and crime is based on voluntary reporting. To Strunsky, surveys have the potential to be limited by small sample sizes that are then expounded upon to make assumptions about trends representing the whole country. This is why he believes the most reliable numbers come from homicide data.

So here’s some homicide data from the FBI from the more than 12,600 murders that were committed in 2011:

67.8 percent of murders committed involved firearms.

72.5 percent of these were committed using a handgun.

Looking at the last four years of this data though, one can see that the number of murders caused by firearm use has dropped.

What about people defending themselves with a firearm resulting in a homicide on the part of the attacker?

The FBI reported 8,775 homicides as a result of firearms in 2010. Of these, 665 were reported as “justifiable homicides” — those where self-defence was enacted and resulted in the death of another — 387 by law enforcement and 278 by private citizens.

“Had they not had access to a gun, most murders, most suicides, would not have been a fatal incident,” Burke said, including that a life-time prison sentence might not be issue sans a firearm as well.

Then there is Siebold’s viewpoint.

“It is going to continue to be violent. In the mean time, at least give me the chance to protect my life,” he said.

The perspectives

Where do these stats bring us in the current gun control debate? Contrary to what many pro-Second Amendment advocates might think, Burke said, gun control is “not the first step to disarm the population.”

To Burke, stepping up gun control with background checks, like those that were shot down in the Senate recently, would have been “no more of an imposition than the TSA line.” He said he believes those seeing it as the first step to disarmament do not truly understand the Second Amendment.

“We just need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” he said.

“The ability of a criminal to get their hands on guns is directly related to the proliferation and number of guns we have,” Burke said. “Sure, they’ll get guns. Let’s not make it easy though.”

But Burke also acknowledged that many firearm owners never purchased the weapon with the intent of committing a crime.

“The reality is, most people don’t leave their house that morning and say I’m going to commit a murder,” he said, noting an argument or being under the influence of another substance are often escalating factors toward gun use.

Still, Burke said these situations, absent a gun in the first place, would be less likely to lead to a murder and a hefty prison sentence.

The gun control debate to Siebold is clouded by emotion.

Siebold said that because “the government can’t be there to protect us,” the right of the people to bear arms must be protected.

Burke acknowledges there are other measures to reduce violent crimes, at least homicides. He, like many others, think a more holistic approach needs to be taken. He said exposure to violence in childhood greatly increases the likelihood of someone committing a violent crime in their teenage or adult years."
blaze137,blaze,['Fred Lucas'],2014-02-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/17/blue-states-firearm-rule-is-so-onerous-it-restricts-self-defense-even-when-its-not-a-gun,"It’s probably not wholly surprising that Massachusetts, one of the bluest states in the country, has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation.

But what might come as a surprise is that the Bay State also strictly controls sales of pepper spray and mace.

Currently, a Massachusetts resident looking to buy pepper spray or mace must have a state-issued firearms identification card, the same as someone who is buying a gun.

But state legislators from both parties want to change that. At least five bills have been introduced to block some of the onerous red tape currently required, including the background checks and ID requirements.

Massachusetts is the only state in the country that imposes the firearms ID card restriction for the non-lethal, eye burning defense sprays, according to the Gun Owners Action League, an NRA affiliate in Massachusetts.

Democratic state Rep. Colleen Garry sponsored one of the bills, recalling a personal experience she had, the Fitchburg, Mass., Sentinel & Enterprise reported. She got a license, but didn’t think it’s necessary.

“I had a situation in my own life that I thought my family members were at risk,” she said. “I did not want to get a gun, but I wanted to be able to protect them.”

The newspaper reported that the string of bills comes amid other efforts to strengthen background checks for guns.

Another bill in the legislature, filed by Republican state Rep. Kimberly Ferguson has more than two dozen co-sponsors.

Thus far, there hasn’t been much vocal opposition to lifting the restrictions. However, according to the Gun Owners Action League, such legislation was introduced last year and the legislature continues to “drag their feet on legalizing pepper spray” this year.

The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association backs the idea of making mace and pepper spray easier to obtain.

Reports also say that the post Thanksgiving shopping extravaganza also spiked background checks for firearms to record numbers.

This year the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed 185,713 transactions the day after Thanksgiving, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer Jr. told NBC News. That breaks the FBI’s forecast of approximately 180,000 and the previous record of 185,345, an increase of .2 percent, set during last year’s Black Friday.

It should be noted that a background check does not necessarily mean a firearm was sold. Of course, this also doesn’t mean just one firearm was sold when the background check was completed either. With discounts on guns, it’s possible that multiples were purchased as gifts, as well as those sold to collectors attempting to take advantage of the deals.

An even more interesting tidbit of information comes from Kathy at the blog Pesky Truth, however.

The number breaks down to slightly more than two background checks per second, or enough firearms to arm each of the 182,000 active duty members of the United States Marine Corps. Semper Fi!

That’s right. It’s likely that in one day, Americans bought enough guns to match that of one of our most deadly branches in the military. This further lends to the idea that despite all the scare tactics, and misinformation by gun control enthusiasts, Americans are more concerned with defending and educating themselves about firearms than relying on authorities to do so."

In San Francisco, California, a shooting at a UPS facility left 4 dead, including the shooter. More were injured.

Cody Wilson of Ghost Gunner talked to Chris Salcedo today about abuse of Second Amendment rights, ways to enjoy them as a law abiding citizen, and historically how much easier it was exercise them on “The Chris Salcedo Show” today.

Wilson has created a technology that legally allows people to manufacture their own gun at home to protect themselves in these terrifying situations. It utilizes plug and play software for your computer that directs a machine to manufacture mil-spec parts for the AR-15 and AR-308. They will soon create technology to build common and popular handguns.

He explained that before the commercial regulation of guns, the government didn’t know who owned a gun, nor what kind of gun or how many. He said this information is “not their business, and it’s often inappropriate to insist that it is.”

blaze140,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2013-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/26/law-abiding-taxpaying-gun-owner-defends-ownership-of-ar-15-rifle-in-common-sense-filled-letter-to-the-editor,"Joe Minney, of Chillicothe, Ohio, is a self-described law-abiding, taxpaying American citizen who owns an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He selected the weapon for a number of reasons, including home defense, hunting and even pest control.

Unfortunately, he says many Americans get their “knowledge” about guns from “movies and TV shows.” This leaves many people uninformed and easily deceived amid the ongoing gun control debate. In a focused letter to the editor of the Chillicothe Gazette, Minney explains why he chose to purchase an AR-15, making the case for responsible gun owners.

“I am a law abiding, taxpaying citizen that selected an AR-15 rifle to own. I considered the activities I like to do with weapons and knowing my limited money I could spend, the AR-15 was the best choice,” he began.

Minney selected to use an AR-15 for home defense for the weapon’s quality design, accuracy and ease of use. Here he implements some common sense:

I selected the AR-15 as my Home Defense weapon. My rifle has a collapsible stock, in other words, I can shorten it up by about eight inches. This allows for greater maneuvering around my furniture and house in case I have an intruder. Unfortunately, most Americans gain their “knowledge” of weapons from movies and TV shows. The action hero or TV cop superstar fires one or two shots and the bad guy crumbles. This is not reality. Ask any combat veteran or police officer gunfight survivor. Better still, go online to YouTube and watch real life dash cam videos of law enforcement gunfights. Many times, the bad guy is shot multiple times before being stopped. Last year, a highly skilled and trained Columbus Police officer was attacked by a knife-wielding crazed man. The officer shot this guy seven times and still had to have multiple officers assist in subduing him. A famous picture of a mad man is in nearly every law enforcement textbook. It shows the body of a drug-crazed man who was shot 33 times with 9mm bullets by police officers. The complete story is the man walked two city blocks and climbed a flight of stairs before succumbing to his gunshot wounds. This is the real world! Recently, four gun-carrying people invaded a home in a high class neighborhood of Gahanna during the day time. All four participated in beating and robbing the home owners. If I, as a legal gun owner, faced this kind of threat, I would have to fire at least two or three shots per bad guy to stop the threat on my family. This is eight to [sic] bullets. Obviously, this exceeds both the seven and 10-round magazine capacity that others are promoting to legislate over [U.S.] law abiding citizens.

Minney explained that the AR-15 can actually use three different types of shells. He bought a 22-caliber conversation kit so he can use the rifle to go squirrel hunting. He said he prefers the .22 bullet at times because he eats what he kills.

He continued: “Using the .223-caliber or 5.56-mm shells I can assist farmers in controlling very costly pests on their farms. Groundhogs cause millions of dollars of damage each year throughout the country. Farmland and crops are heavily damaged from these rodents.”

[..]

“The airport in Columbus had to hire sharpshooters to solve their groundhog problem. It was reported that their runways, taxiways and buildings were being ruined by these burrowing, disease-carrying rodents. One can do a net search and find hundreds of news articles about the costly damage to golf courses, and local, state and federal highways and bridges. Groundhogs are very elusive and must be hunted from a distance. The sights on the AR-15 provide for these 100 to 200-yard shots.”

Additionally, Minney said he uses his AR-15 to help control the coyote population in his area, which are at “epidemic condition” in many states.

“These predators have invaded city and urban areas. The news media in all areas have reported dog and cat owners that have had their family pets attacked and killed by coyotes,” he added. “Shockingly, there have been people attacked and killed by coyotes in the U.S. and Canada in recent years.”

Finally, he said one of his hobbies is “target practicing in safe areas.”

“By using the 22 caliber shell at three cents per piece I can shoot many times for a relative low cost. Then, I can convert the rifle over and fire a few 5.56mm shells at 46 cents per piece to practice my accuracy,” he wrote.

“These are the main five reasons I selected to own an AR-15 rifle. I share this because I want to assist in finding true and workable solutions to the gun violence. I would welcome open dialogue in discussing gun ownership and the expectation of a safe society,” the gun owner concluded.

Police in Medford, Ore., say the incident occurred at around 11:30 p.m. on Sunday. Officers responded to an apartment complex in the area after receiving a disturbance call. During their investigation, cops heard a gun shot and a man running away toward the complex’s parking lot.

Authorities say 40-year-old Jonathon Kinsella, a wanted felon, was attempting to flee the scene when he was arrested on outstanding warrants, including for burglary and assault.

Military veteran Corey Thompson, 36, told KDRV-TV that the wanted felon was trying to beak into his home via the back door. Defending his property, Thompson said he warned the criminal that he was armed and he was giving him his one and only warning shot.

“This is the end result. You break into someone’s house, there’s consequences,” Thompson said.

Wielding his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, the veteran made good on his threat and fired one warning shot. The bullet did not strike the suspect or anyone else.

“When I’m dealt with a stressful situation, being a veteran from Iraq and the Afghanistan war, it’s natural. I just jump into combat mode. I told him, ‘I’m going to give you a warning shot’,” Thompson explained.

However, police later determined he wasn’t justified in firing his weapon. Medford Police Lt. Mike Budreau said “there was nothing that the suspect was doing that was aggressive enough to justify the shooting.”

Apparently, for police in Medford, a wanted felon trying to break into a law-abiding citizen’s home isn’t enough to justify a warning shot.

Thompson was charged with unlawful use of a weapon, menacing and reckless endangering. The veteran’s AR-15 was seized by police because they claim it was used in the commission of a crime.

Thompson said he doesn’t agree with the police’s decision in this case.

“I can see where they’re coming from, with those kinds of ordinances and stuff. I understand yes, I did discharge my weapon but I was careful not to fire it at any body’s residence. It was at the ground specifically,” he added.

Attempts by TheBlaze to contact Thompson were unsuccessful.

Up until this week, Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms published the name of the winner of its AR-15 giveaway Facebook campaign, but it is now revising its policy after one such winner said they were being harassed to the point where they had to shut down their Facebook page.

“So here is something that really pisses us off. Our winner of the [AR] package called us about five minutes ago to tell us this. ‘Thanks for what you guys are doing. Over the past few days people have been harassing me and my family on Facebook. I am closing my account because of this.’ That are not his exact words as he was swearing up and down about the liberal media and how they won’t leave him alone.

We might reconsider how we announce winners from now on. We want to keep your privacy as much as you do,” the firearms store wrote on its Facebook page Thursday.

In another post shortly thereafter, the business wrote that it would be allowing contest winners to have the choice of whether they would want their name publicly announced or not.

Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms has been receiving local attention for its contest and more recently is making national news. In a radio interview with 1020 KDKA the owner, Eric Lowry, said the giveaway was conceived to drive up business, which it did along with the concern some have over gun regulations. Within 12 hours two days after the December shooting, Lowry said on the radio his store sold out of 95 percent of its inventory. He had to call in friends to help with background checks for those wishing to purchase firearms.

The radio host asked why anyone needs that type of a weapon?

“The number one thing is that it’s your right. It’s your right to own a firearm no matter what type of firearm it is,” Lowry said on the show. “It’s clearly stated that the right to bear arms will not be infringed […] I don’t think it extends out to tanks and nuclear weapons like a lot of of people are suggesting, but citizens should be armed well enough to defend themselves against a tyrannical government, in which case they should be able to own the same exact firearms that any type of military soldier should be able to own.”

A recent letter signed by 1,100 green berets for the protection of the Second Amendment supported the same sentiment Lowry and others have regarding firearm ownership.

The Huffington Post reported Lowry saying that the contest was not meant to be a form of protest against President Barack Obama’s proposed gun control laws. He added that his store will do another giveaway soon when things quiet down.

TheBlaze contacted Lowry and will be speaking with him. Stay tuned for more information from Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms’ owner."

Following up on his 14-minute video, Campbell is back for a second installment. This time, he addresses claims that “weapons of war have no place on our streets” — a common claim coming from gun control proponents in favor of banning certain semi-automatic rifles like the popular AR-15.

The video opens with text explaining that this quote is faulty, mainly because it ignores the fact that all guns were initially designed for war. If true and applied across the board, it would render all firearms illegal.

After the clip addresses this issue, Campbell asks a question that’s been frequently posed since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting: What is an assault rifle?

The sheriff then lists the similarities between Mini-14s and AR-15s, noting that the two really only differ in terms of their cosmetic differences. Yet legislation that’s been advanced and proposed has taken aim at the latter and not the former.

Once again, Campbell went on to test out different magazine sizes to show that there is a very minuscule impact on the number of seconds that it takes to simply reload smaller-sized magazines. His point? Cracking down on higher-capacity units will do little in terms of opening up larger windows of time between shots being fired.

Using volunteers named Jim and Christy, he showed viewers how these policies and restrictions would look in practical terms.

“Jim firing one thirty round magazine was 17.11 seconds, three 10 round magazines was 18.55 seconds,” Campbell said. “Christy’s time on the 30-round magazine was 17.25 seconds and with the three 10-round magazines was 25.31 seconds.”

Clearly, there were relatively short windows of time when these individuals changed magazines.

Watch this and plenty more in the clip, below:

In a previous interview with TheBlaze, Campbell made his views about capping high-capacity magazines known (i.e. he’s not a fan).

“By limiting the access to standard magazines…I think you are restricting a good American’s opportunity to protect himself and his family,” the sheriff said.

blaze145,blaze,['Jonathon M. Seidl'],2014-02-09 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/09/blaze-review-drd-tactical-ar-15-rifle,"You know those days when you’re working hard, 12-hour days seem like a break, and you start forgetting simple things like the name of your kids when you’re yelling at them to stop throwing the pizza slice across the room (Jeremy-Jess-Jenny-Josh-Jonny stop!)? This fall I had the opposite of one of those days. I spent a quiet morning at the range siting in my hunting rifle (a 7mm magnum, if you’d like to know).

I figured that was as good a time as any to try out the AR-15 the team over at DRD Tactical sent me to review. How’d it do? It is what made the day so enjoyable.(My 7mm mag groupings, on the other hand, didn’t.)

But let me take a different approach to reviewing this item. Instead of pretending I’m a seasoned gun reviewer, let me assess it as if I’m a new AR-15 buyer; like I’ve never owned one and as if I’m a regular guy from the Midwest who doesn’t have an arsenal of 23 different ARs and I’m looking to buy one and only one and not waste my money.

Wait, that’s all true of me — so this should work fine.

I was sent the company’s CDR-15-556, or in other words, their AR-15 model chambered in .556 NATO. Let’s start by breaking it down into: first impressions, feel, ease of use, accuracy, price.

First Impressions

When you receive your rifle, it comes in a lockable, heavy-duty, custom foam box. Instead of being rectangular, it’s square. That’s because the company’s major selling point is that the gun is made to be assembled and disassembled very quickly. That’s perfect for the military cliental it caters to, but it’s also nice for overall transport and concealment.

But if you’re expecting anything beyond the rifle when you first buy, don’t. It comes with one 30-round magazine. That’s not a knock — when you buy a hunting rifle it’s not like the manufacturer automatically gives you a scope.

The website picture shows slots for a foregrip, silencer, and extra magazines. Mine, however, did not come with foregrip slot, which means I have to take that off when I want to store it in the case. Others who have received DRD rifled told me they got extra rails to attach to theirs so they can buy and attach extra accessories such as a light and foregrip. When I didn’t, I simply called the company and they sent me some. A very harmless process.

The rifle has a matte finish and comes well-oiled. For someone like me that cleans his gun after EVERY use, that’s a big plus. You definitely get the sense that you’re looking at something well-made when you open the case. But that said, the instructions that come with the gun are on regular computer paper and stapled in the corner. Some may view that as a little cheap. But that’s actually a plus for me: it makes it feel more like a custom rifle from a small manufacturer that really takes the time with each weapon instead of a large conglomerate pumping out a rifle a minute.

Overall first impression? I like it.

Feel

My first thought when picking up the rifle was, “Wow, this is heavy. I can’t imagine being a soldier and carrying this around all day.” But I also haven’t handled many ARs in my life and I certainly haven’t carried any military rifles around all day. So I could see a Navy SEAL coming to me and saying, “Jon, you have no idea, this is actually light!” And I would tip my cap. This type of weight may just be standard, as well as another reminder of why I could never pretend to be cut out for the service of some of our country’s greatest heroes.

That said, it was heavy enough (about nine pounds with a full magazine and accesories) that it made me buy a foregrip. I couldn’t imagine holding it up for any period of time without one. I bought a cheap one off of Amazon for about $8 and it was worth it.

The rifle comes standard with a Magpul pistol grip. I have small hands and so it fits me perfect. I’ve heard of others swapping it out, but it’s more than fine for me.

There’s also a telescoping butt that can lock in place. I can’t say how wonderful this is, especially since I had my wife handle the rifle a little bit to get her thoughts. She was able to instantly fit the rifle to her “size.” Still, the rifle’s weight did get to her. But that weight has a great side effect: the gun kicks like a fetal mule, which is to say not at all.

Ease of use

One of the selling points of DRD rifles is that they are easy to assemble, easy to disassemble, and easy to morph into other calibers. This is true. While I initially had trouble putting the rifle together when I first got it out of the box, I know that was because of my lack of familiarity with ARs and breakdown rifles in general. After the second time, it started to become muscle memory.

A video on YouTube demonstrates how easy it is to assemble and shoot:

However, it’s worth noting that since the rifle doesn’t come with any optics or steel sights, taking it out of the box and immediately firing is not quite possible. That’s not a knock — it’s just reality. I bought a red dot/green dot sight off Amazon that came within a couple days. I guess technically you could fire the rifle right out of the box and do more of a bore sighting, but that’s not as much fun!

Accuracy

Sighting in the rifle was my chance to see how the gun performed. And did it ever. Even though my first groupings were well left, they were still good groupings at about 30 yards. As I dialed-in the optics, the gun’s accuracy became apparent, as you can see in the target below:

As mentioned earlier, the gun barely kicks, making it easier to stay on target throughout multi-round shot groupings. My only trouble was with the gases that seeped back into my eyes. But again, I chalk that up to a normal occurrence that I’m just not used to because I don’t shoot ARs often.

Price

Now we get to one of the most important parts. And there’s no way to sugar coat this: the rifle retails for $2,091.00. That may be steep for a lot of people. But you could also say that this could be the only AR-15 you ever buy, and just like a good shotgun, investing in a good AR-15 can be a cost that produces a firearm that you keep a lifetime.

Bottom Line

The DRD CDR-15-556 is a top-of-the line rifle that shoots great, is built well, Sure, it’s a little pricey. But considering that the DRD concept is that you can buy other components and switch them out, thereby creating a new rifle of sorts, you may find it worth it.

I told you I wanted to review this as a regular “Jon” getting my first AR. With that in mind, I’d say this rifle is worth adding to your arsenal. And with the scarcity of ammo starting to dissipate, it can make for a lot of fun at the range.

blaze146,blaze,['Madeleine Morgenstern'],2013-09-17 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/09/17/cnn-ar-15-may-not-have-been-used-in-navy-yard-shooting-after-all,"The FBI said there is no indication that an AR-15 was used in the shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, despite wide initial reports that gunman Aaron Alexis was armed with one when he murdered 12 people Monday.

“At this time we believe that Mr. Alexis entered Building 197 at the Navy Yard with a shotgun. We do not have any information at this time that he had an AR-15 in his possession,” Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said at a news conference Tuesday. Officials said Alexis also took at least one handgun from a law officer.

The FBI’s confirmation came after CNN reported Tuesday morning that the initial reports that the shooter used an AR-15 may have been incorrect:

[F]ederal law enforcement sources told CNN Tuesday that authorities have recovered three weapons from the scene of the mass shooting, including one — a shotgun — that investigators believe Alexis brought in to the compound. The other two weapons, which sources say were handguns, may have been taken from guards at the Navy complex. The sources, who have detailed knowledge of the investigation, cautioned that initial information that an AR-15 was used in the shootings may have been incorrect. It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday morning’s shootings. Authorities are still investigating precisely how many weapons Alexis had access to and when.

The New York Daily News devoted its front page Tuesday to the supposed use of an AR-15, with the blaring headline “Same Gun Different Slay”:

Calls for bans on AR-15s skyrocketed after the mass slayings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut and an Aurora, Colo. movie theater last year. A new ban on “assault weapons” proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) specifically named AR-15-style rifles but was never brought up for a vote.

The Empire State’s Senate passed a bill, S.3199A, by a 54-5 vote margin Tuesday classifying a machete as a “deadly weapon,” making it a crime to possess one with the penalty of up to one year in prison.

Many of the legislation’s co-sponsors have long advocated the criminalization of machetes, and it will now head to the state Assembly, where the fate of the bill will be decided.

“Despite the obvious serious injury that can be caused by the use of a machete,” state Sen. Tony Avella (D) wrote in a memo, “such weapons have not been included in the penal law’s definition of ‘deadly weapon.'”

He went on to say it is “surprising” that the knife had not previously been marked as a “deadly weapon,” “given the common knowledge that machetes have often been used as weapons and are actually defined as such in Webster’s dictionary.”

A machete is defined as a “large, heavy knife that is used for cutting plants and as a weapon,” according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.

Should the bill become law, machetes will join a lot list of items classified as “deadly weapons,” including switchblades, daggers, metal or plastic knuckles, gravity and ballistic knives, billy clubs and blackjacks. Possession of any of these items is a misdemeanor and can result in as much as one year in jail.

The Senate’s passage of the legislation comes on the heels of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledging a drop in the city’s murders and shootings, but noting that slashings and stabbings are increasing.

According to Guns.com, the number of knife attacks in the Big Apple for the first quarter of 2016 increased by more than 20 percent to 899, up from 746 such attacks at the same time last year.

Similar legislation introduced last year by Avella after a fatal machete attack in Long Island, New York, failed to gain much traction due to multiple challenges.

Legal defense for possession charges requires the possessor to show they did not intend to use the weapon unlawfully, which can present some difficulties. For example, in 2015, an electrician in possession of what police determined a gravity knife won a $57,000 settlement when the court found the blade to be a utility knife used for work.

However, state leaders are determined to do something to curb the violent attacks occurring with knives.

“Stabbings and slashings aren’t going away,” NYC Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said at a press conference, adding that such crimes are a “reality” for those living in New York City.

Neither Bratton nor de Blasio have directly mentioned concerns over machetes.

One item in the memo that was not declassified though is just what weapon the National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 7 was allowed to load up on.

The Federation of American Scientists is bringing attention to this document called “Production of [Deleted] Weapons, 1981,” which was partially declassified in 2008, and even offers some speculation as to what would fit into the brackets.

The document itself states:

“The production and stockpiling of [deleted] weapons is authorized with stockpiling being restricted to the United States [deleted].”

Hans Kristensen with FAS is reported as speculating the redacted term is “enhanced radiation.” Why? Not only does FAS point out that two enhanced radiation weapons began production in 1981 — the W70 (Lance warhead) and the W79 (artillery shell) — but it also notes when former President George Bush declassified the title of the NSDD7 in 1996, “enhanced radiation weapons” was left unredacted.

If this stockpile does in fact indicate enhanced radiation weapons, what does this mean? This is another term for the weapon of mass destruction known as a neutron bomb. According to Global Security, a neutron bomb would have a total energy that was 30 percent blast, 20 percent thermal and 50 percent nuclear radiation. “Thus, a 3-kiloton ER weapon will produce the nuclear radiation of a 10-kiloton fission weapon and the blast and thermal radiation of a 1-kiloton fission device,” Global Security writes.

A study published by the National Institute of Health a couple years ago stated that the purpose of a neutron bomb, compared to other nuclear weapons, is to “enhance radiation casualties while reducing blast and thermal damage to the infrastructure.”

The study states that since the Cold War, there have been no threats for use of such a weapon. Still, given that five nations were reported to have developed enhanced radiation weapons at the time, the report recommends medical personnel know the difference in health implications compared to a fission weapon.

Here is a look at the one-page document:

Magazine stands. Restaurants. All these venues past airport security offer a wealth of options for “‘MacGyver-esque’ attackers” to develop weapons, as demonstrated by a security researcher.

“Can common items that are sold in airports after the security screening be used to build lethal weapons?” Terminal Cornucopia, a new YouTube channel, asks.

Researcher Evan “Treefort” Booth created a channel full of demonstrations answering this question with a resounding “yes.”

“As it turns out, even a marginally ‘MacGyver-esque’ attacker can breeze through terminal gift shops, restaurants, magazine stands and duty-free shops to find everything needed to wage war on an airplane,” the YouTube channel’s description read.

[blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/evanbooth/status/400745386295304192″]

These are the rules Booth follows for his project:

Only materials that can be sourced inside the terminal after the security screening can be used.

Only cash and a small, travel-approved multitool can be carried into the terminal.

Anything in the airport you’d get yelled at for taking or messing with is off limits.

How easy are these weapons to build with airport-only resources? Terminal Cornucopia’s demos can show you.

A spiked club made with magazines, tape, dental floss, a rolled up Constitution souvenir and pencil sharpener shaped like the Washington Monument:

A blowgun made with a double-walled, plastic Starbucks’ cup and straw, AR-Parrot Drone 2.0, Zippo lighters and tape:

A solid, pewter slug made from collectible spoons, tape and aluminum soda cans:

A break-action shotgun made from batteries, a magnetic refrigerator clip, hair dryer, hair band, dental floss, tape, magazines, Axe body spray, a condom, water aluminum cans and ammunition (a.k.a. Red Bull):

A fragmentation grenade made with a stainless steel coffee mug, AA battery, Axe body spray, condom, magazine, dental floss and water:

A crossbow made with a robot grabber toy, magazines, an umbrella, tape, dental floss, double-walled, plastic Starbucks’ cup and straw, and a luggage handle:

You might be wondering about the purpose of posting these videos. A natural question would be “what if terrorists see this?”

“That’s a great question. An even better question is: What if they already know all this?” Booth stated on the Terminal Cornucopia website. “All of these findings have been reported to the Department of Homeland Security (TSA) to help them better detect these types of threats. Furthermore, the next time you fly, you’ll be flying as a more informed consumer (and taxpayer, possibly) — one who is more equipped to demand better, more appropriate airport security.”

Also, in case you are wondering, Booth’s constructions and demonstrations were done in a lab, not an airport.

With this information, Booth offers some advice: “Don’t break the law. Don’t build weapons if you don’t know how to do it safely. Don’t be stupid.”

blaze150,blaze,"['Chris Enloe', 'Weekend Editor']",2015-12-07 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2015/12/07/supreme-court-turns-away-challenge-to-illinois-assault-weapon-ban,"WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) — The United States Supreme Court Monday decided not to take up a challenge to an Illinois “assault weapon” ban, a law that prevents certain residents in the state from buying a number of firearms and large-capacity magazines.

Two conservative justices said they would have heard the case and struck down the ban. The Illinois State Rifle Association, one of the plaintiffs, indicated that it would keep challenging local gun restrictions.

The court left in place a lower court ruling that found that local governments have leeway in deciding how to regulate firearms. The federal appeals court in Chicago had upheld the city of Highland Park’s 2013 law that bans several semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines.

In October, the federal appeals court in New York largely upheld similar laws in Connecticut and New York, among a handful of states that ban semi-automatic weapons.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly turned away challenges to gun restrictions since two landmark decisions that spelled out the right to a handgun to defend one’s own home.

Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Chicago appeals court ruling “flouts two of our Second Amendment precedents.” Without mentioning any mass shootings in California and elsewhere that involved semi-automatic guns, Thomas said the weapons ban “is highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes” by roughly 5 million Americans.

“The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting,” Thomas wrote.

The case had been under consideration at the high court for two months, but the delay in dealing with it now appears mainly due to waiting for Thomas to finish his opinion.

The appeal filed by Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argues that Highland Park has violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the United States, as well as ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds.

Richard Pearson, the director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, was disappointed the Supreme Court did not hear the case but said that his organization is still waiting for the conclusion of a state-court case challenging a similar ban in Illinois’ largest county, Cook County. He said the group will also keep looking for new plaintiffs in areas that have enacted assault-weapons prohibitions.

“We are not going to give up, and we’re not going to go away,” Pearson said.

Steven Elrod, an attorney who has represented Highland Park, did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press.

Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arises out of a decision by the federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois.

In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities around the state 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault weapons, or forfeit their right to do so.

Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association.

The city’s assault weapons ban was upheld by the appeals court in a 2-1 decision.

Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the court that there is a “substantial benefit” to the Highland Park ordinance if it makes the public feel less at risk from a mass shooting. Variations of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the guns specifically banned by Highland Park, were used in the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado.

The gun control laws that the appeals court in New York upheld in October were passed after the 2012 massacre in Newtown.

Seven states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning assault weapons. The others are California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. In addition, Minnesota and Virginia regulate assault weapons, the center said.

The case is Friedman v. Highland, 15-133."
blaze151,blaze,['Dave Urbanski'],2014-11-20 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/11/20/10-year-old-boy-used-finger-as-imaginary-ray-gun-in-school-cafeteria-and-made-laser-sounds-want-to-guess-how-that-ended-up,"After 10-year-old Nickolas Taylor used his finger as an imaginary ray gun near two female students in their Massachusetts school cafeteria last Friday, they reported Taylor, telling staff they felt threatened.

Then Noah Collins, assistant principal at Stacy Middle School in Milford, wrote a conduct slip that listed Taylor’s actions — which included mouthing laser sounds — as a threat. With that, the fifth-grader was suspended for two days this week, WFXT-TV in Boston reported.

“I think this is very slanderous toward Nickolas and his character,” his father Brian Taylor told the Milford Daily News. “It was non-threatening. He’s just a typical boy with an imagination.”

Saying the suspension represents abuse of the rules and a “complete disconnect” between policy and reality, Taylor is withdrawing his son from the school and has filed paperwork to have him homeschooled, the Daily News reported.

The school’s position is that because students told staff they felt threatened by Taylor, he was dealt with more severely.

“It’s the difference between intent of the action and what the person feels receiving it,” Superintendent Robert Tremblay told the Daily News. “It’s just the same way you can’t yell fire in a crowded movie theater. There are things you can and can’t do.”

Taylor reportedly hadn’t undergone formal discipline beyond detentions for incomplete school work, although he’s been diagnosed with ADHD and sometimes was disciplined when hyperactivity made it hard for him to focus.

[sharequote align=”center”]“It’s just the same way you can’t yell fire in a crowded movie theater.”[/sharequote]

Tremblay added to the paper that there’s room for the school to be “not so caught up in the handbook,” which lists threats as punishable by detention, suspension or expulsion, based on their severity.

“It’s almost as if society has forced us into behaving a certain way and unfortunately, we’re the victims of circumstance,” Tremblay told the Daily News, adding that common gestures such as using a finger like a gun can’t be taken lightly anymore.

Nickolas’ grandfather had a different take.

“It’s totally ridiculous,” Rory O’Brien told WFXT, “it’s not right at all.”

Brian Taylor told the Daily News his son is “confused as to why he got suspended. He doesn’t realize he did something wrong.”

A video of the police officer was taken because a person receiving a citation was fighting for his right to film law enforcement. But the officer asked him for the phone saying they can be “converted into weapons.” The officer later explained more specifically that they can be “converted into firearms and Tasers.”

“Look it up online,” he challenged.

That’s just what we did. What we found was not so much conversions of cellphones into weapons but more weapons being disguised as cellphones.

Snopes, the Web resource that seeks to debunk misinformation, confirms that guns disguised as cellphones are a real threat. It reported spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms John D’Angelo saying disguising a firearms as something else is not a new idea.

“We’ve seen guns in the form of canes, pens, beepers,” D’Angelo said. “As technology progresses and becomes more prevalent, disguised weapons will change to mirror that.”

In our previous article regarding the San Diego cop’s comments, we included this video as an example:

Here’s a video showing a “beeper gun”:

The Daily Telegraph in 2008 reported Italian police finding a similarly concealed gun while raiding a group related to the mafia.

“This is the first time such a weapon has been seized and shows the sophistication that the crime syndicates are turning to,” a spokesperson for the police was reported saying at the time.

Stun guns seem to be far more prevalent in Internet searches than actual firearms.

Here’s the Guard Dog Cell Phone Stun Gun, a device that can deliver 2.7 million volts for about $45.

The MTW-095 “cellphone-shaped supervoltage” stun gun retails for about $17 but it only delivers 1.6 million volts.

The Home Security Superstore has 10 different stun guns that look like cellphones. There’s even the 3.8 million volt iStun, shaped to look like a iPhone.

Check out this video about the Guard Dog iStun:

In the fall of 2012, stun guns disguised as cellphones were found by screeners at the Newark airport in New Jersey and Washington, D.C.’s, Reagan National Airport.

Given the prevalence of weapons being disguised as cellphones, the San Diego police officer’s request to review the gun, which was refused by its owner leading to his arrest, seems to have some merit. But what we don’t know is if he was expressing genuine concern or using the idea as an excuse to be a bully."

Only 36 percent of Americans polled favor banning assault-style weapons, a drop from 44 percent in 2012 and 57 percent in 1996. Sixty-one percent of Americans now oppose an assault weapons ban, according to Gallup’s 2016 Crime poll, conducted Oct. 5-9. Gallup polled a random sample of 1,017 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older, in every state.

Beginning in 2006, more Americans opposed the ban than favored it — and opposition to the ban has been mostly increasing since then. Gallup starting asking about the assault weapons ban in 1996, two years after President Bill Clinton signed a federal assault weapons ban in 1994.

This year, 50 percent of Democrats and 25 percent of Republicans favor the ban.

It’s worth noting that support for the ban has fallen so dramatically among Democrats — since Democratic politicians are often the biggest legislative supporters of banning the weapons.

blaze154,blaze,"['Lt. Col. Jim Zumwalt', 'Ret.']",2016-09-30 12:00:56-04:00,https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/islams-time-tested-weapon-testosterone,"The U.S. Department of Defense announced this month it will undertake an unusual study. It seeks to determine if boosting a warrior’s testosterone will translate into enhanced muscle and mental performance over extended periods of combat.

DOD need not waste its money. The answer is yes, evidenced by the fact we now are fighting our longest war against a testosterone-driven enemy.

Our warriors can attest to it. During the past 15 years, while concluding one war in Iraq, they have continuously had to fight another in Afghanistan—both wars against an enemy with a 1,400-year track record substantiating the answer.

To understand this, one first need understand how Prophet Muhammad enticed Muslim warriors to join Islam’s cause.

It all began in the 7th century after Muhammad experienced his Kodak moment with Archangel Gabriel—who became the conduit by which he and Allah supposedly communicated.

Muhammad definitely understood the male human psyche. He knew it was driven by desires of wealth, power and sex. As Allah “shared” various revelations with Muhammad, the Prophet gained followers by playing up all three vices. Unfortunately, these rewards came at the expense of non-believers. Among the three, importantly for most Muslims, undoubtedly, was libido.

Muhammad knew libido cut both ways. While it temporarily served to satisfy a male’s biological urges, its intimacy ran the risk of fostering a more familial relationship with a sexual partner. This, Muhammad feared, for it distracted the warrior from the ultimate sacrifice jihad might necessitate.

Muhammad could not allow a female’s allure to distract males from their role as warriors for Islam. The solution involved sought to prevent it while still satisfying the warrior’s testosteronic needs.

This demanded Muslim males not view Muslim women as equals. For this reason, women were made subservient to them. The wife’s obligation was to meet the husband’s sexual demands, as well as to field a future warrior army. To diffuse any one female’s allure, Allah allowed males multiple wives.

Undoubtedly, the rationale for multiple wives was a belief the more mares available in the husband’s marital stable, the less clingy he would become to one in particular. Enjoying each, husbands, unburdened by familial ties, were less likely to be distracted from their warrior role. This prompted Muhammad to equate Muslim wives to domestic animals. As the highly revered 13th century Islamic scholar al-Qurtubi noted, Muhammad’s teachings likened a woman “to a sheep—even a cow or a camel—for all are ridden.”

To further diminish the familial bond, Muslim warriors were empowered to satisfy their sexual needs in other ways. These too evolved to keep the warrior’s eyes upon the perpetual fight—still pursued today—for Islam’s global domination.

Islam prohibits premarital sex, but unmarried males were not to be denied their sexual satisfaction. Here, too, Islam made special provisions. Males were and are permitted to engage in “nikah mut’ah”—a temporary marriage for a limited time period.

While “mut’ah” means a contract between a man and a woman, the arrangement is clearly one allowing males to have sex while “on the go”, i.e., pre-occupied elsewhere imposing Islam upon others. And, since males are permitted multiple wives, such temporary marriages benefitted them as well.

While Muslim females lack equality with Muslim males, non-Muslim females fail to register on Islam’s totem pole of humanity. Captured non-Muslim women and children became sex slaves—a Muslim warrior’s spoils of war. As such, they were and are still used, abused and/or put up for sale—treated as chattel. Most recently, Islamic State has claimed this right as one handed down through the centuries.

And, as for those Muslim warriors slain trying to fulfill their Islamic duty, no pity party need be held. Here, too, the testosterone card was smartly played by Muhammad. Followers inspired to give their all on the battlefield were assured even greater sexual pleasures awaited them in Paradise.

Most religions focus on the afterlife’s spirituality; Islam does not. For Muslim warriors willing to die in furtherance of jihad, the focus overwhelmingly is on sensual pleasures. One need only listen to imams today assuring male flocks that, once in Paradise, “They will be busy tearing hymens” of virgins there. Interestingly, the Paradise Allah created provides its residents with the same material rewards they sought while in their earthly bodies.

Unsurprisingly, Islam’s Paradise caters primarily to men in what is best described as a heavenly brothel.

Earthly taboos against sex and alcohol no longer are enforced. Wine runs freely but is not intoxicating. Males enjoy sex with an endless supply of compliant, “eternal virgins” endowed with “large breasts…free from menstruation, menopause, urinal and other discharges, child bearing…” Such virgins seem to undergo a re-virginization process for, after intercourse, they return later, virgins once again.

Overwhelmed with virgins and sexual desire in Paradise, Muslim males need not worry about sexual performance—for Allah imbues them with the virility of a hundred men.

Interestingly, while Islam may ban homosexuality on earth, even that ban appears lifted in Paradise. Thus, the afterlife is made to appeal to Muslim warriors of all sexual persuasions.

Additionally, as few Muslim women are granted entry to Paradise, hen-pecked husbands (should any exist) need not worry about encountering wives.

Curiously unforeseen by “the Prophet” in his time, Muslim warriors today suffer consequences of the sex trade in which they engage. In those areas under Islamic State control, unprotected intercourse with sex slaves, exchanged among multiple partners, has sidelined many fighters due to an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases.

As one critic describes it, “Islam is Freudian libido unleashed…(it) glorifies the most naked, destructive passions of human nature…” Sadly, Muhammad successfully channeled this passion into a weapon of war that, for at least 1,400 years, has withstood the test of time.

Will a testosterone boost enhance a warrior’s battlefield performance? Muhammad has shown it does. This, unfortunately, has been demonstrated at tremendous cost to the non-Muslim world.

Well the joke is on America. Obama and his socialist cabal are in on the joke. Illegal aliens are in on the joke. The only ones left out are the rest of us- law-abiding American-born citizens and taxpayers. We are the joke. And everyone knows it…but us.

Do you see the picture above? It was taken yesterday by my friend- a U.S. border agent. He texted it to me- direct from the processing center. It shows an illegal alien he just caught wearing a shirt with his hero’s name on the back- OBAMA.

This is an every day occurrence my border agent friend tells me. Obama is the secret password that goes with the secret handshake. Obama is the secret sauce that guarantees entry to the U.S. Obama is the friend, hero, messiah and savior to every poverty stricken foreigner illegally sneaking over the border. Everyone, everywhere in the world knows this…but the American people. The joke is on us.

I am Barack Obama’s classmate at Columbia University, Class of ’83. We were taught a plan back then to collapse the U.S. economy and destroy this country. It was called “Cloward-Piven” (named after a husband and wife professor team at Columbia). The Cloward-Piven plan involved using spending, entitlements, debt and crisis after crisis to overwhelm the system, distract and overwhelm the citizens, and cause the collapse of America. At that point the people would be on their knees begging for big government to save them from drowning. They’d willingly accept a socialist Nanny State without argument or debate under duress.

People agree to all kinds of terrible things while their lives and survival hangs in the balance. Panic causes bad decision-making. That’s the key- panic and duress. With your job gone, income gone, or facing a massive 9-11-like terrorist attack, or devastating Ebola pandemic, the country is in a panic. “Cloward-Piven” counted on the citizenry making a very bad decision under duress- choosing the very group that destroyed your life (government) as your savior.

Don’t look now but it’s happening. America is crumbling- and it all comes back to the border and those illegal aliens celebrating Obama. This is no mistake. This is no coincidence. This is a plan.

Obama only has two years left to completely destroy America. He knows as of days from now he’ll probably be dealing with a Republican Senate, as well as an expanded GOP House. He knows there is a good chance he’ll face impeachment hearings. He knows that his presidency is effectively over as of November 4th- he will never pass another bill.

So things have to be accelerated. He must spend his last two years bypassing the Congress. He must find a way to collapse our economy without the need for any laws, bills or cooperation.

The answer is…THE BORDER.

Every single thing that could overwhelm the economy, incite panic and bring Americans to our knees emanates from the border. I call this triumvirate of disaster B.E.T.- Bankruptcy, Ebola and Terrorism. Those are the 3 wild cards that change everything…the 3 “Black Swans” that overwhelm the system…that have the potential to bring our economy down- just as Cloward-Piven intended.

The key is Congress is powerless to stop these tragic events from spiraling out of control. The wide open border is Obama’s “Cloward Piven” ticket to destroy America without any need for cooperation from Congress. This is the ultimate WMD- Weapon of Mass Destruction.

Anyone can walk across Obama’s wide open border. Thousands of illegal immigrants are walking across every day. This is fact. They are uneducated, desperately poor and speak no English. Obama assigns them lawyers with taxpayer money. We spend billions on legal fees and court appearances. They get myriad forms of handouts from taxpayers- food stamps, housing allowances, aid to dependent children, free meals at school, free education, free healthcare…and don’t forget prison and police costs for their crimes. This is the bankruptcy of America. This is how you overwhelm the system. This is how you bypass Congress. This is why illegals wear Obama shirts and shorts and sneakers.

But that’s only the start of what a wide open border brings to America. Terrorist cells from ISIS are free to walk across that border. One massive terrorist attack like 9-11, with our economy in such terrible shape at the moment, could overwhelm the economy and trigger the collapse of our country literally overnight. Isn’t that a fast-track to achieve Cloward-Piven’s dream?

Then there’s the third wild card that comes from an open border. Foreigners sick with Ebola are free to walk across that border. One single Ebola case costs over a million dollars. One. Can you imagine the cost of thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of Ebola cases? It’s unimaginable, unaffordable and unsustainable for the U.S. economy.

The government just announced a second case of Ebola in a healthcare worker this morning. But this is only the start. ISIS could be sending Ebola-infected victims over the border right now- to disperse throughout our communities and cause pandemic, panic and death.

Or an Ebola pandemic could explode in Mexico, Central and South America. Sick and frightened citizens of those countries could invade our border by the millions looking to escape the pandemic, or use the U.S. healthcare system to save themselves. Isn’t this Cloward-Piven’s dream?

Why would any sane leader leave our border wide open for attack, invasion, or pandemic? Only a madman would gamble with our lives…our children’s lives…and the entire American economy. Only a madman refuse to guard us against a possible WMD attack that could overwhelm the U.S. economy. Why would President Obama play “Russian Roulette” with the future of our country? Is he unstable? Or is this a purposeful plan?

Any American who isn’t blind can see something is very wrong. It’s time for patriots, political and military leaders to speak up. Our President is clearly reckless, irresponsible, incompetent, unstable, or evil. Regardless of the reason, for the sake of our families, and our physical and economic survival, it’s time to remove Obama from office.

Now…before it’s too late. Before he gets us all killed by a “Cloward Piven” Weapon of Mass Destruction.

It is possible that during the rally, Trump will announce a pardon of controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has been convicted of criminal contempt of court. It is also possible that Trump will announce an endorsement for one of the expected primary challengers to Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.

However, the day began with an ominous sign of the congressional Republican leadership’s growing public frustration with Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has chosen this day to send a not-very-subtle shot across Trump’s bow by releasing a brutal ad attacking Dr. Kelli Ward, who Trump recently praised as a possible primary challenger for Flake.

The background: Trump fires the first warning shots

Of all the things Trump has done to rankle Republican members of Congress, none has chafed the incumbency-obsessed Senate leadership worse than his public attacks on incumbent Republican senators such as Dean Heller (Nev.) and Flake.

Trump first raised eyebrows — and blood pressure readings — during an extraordinarily uncomfortable public exchange with Heller in July. Heller, who is up for re-election in swing state Nevada in 2018, had expressed public reticence over supporting the Better Care Reconciliation Act, a version of an Obamacare “repeal and replace” bill.

During a White House lunch with the GOP Senate caucus, Trump — who was seated next to Heller — predicted that Heller would get with the program because “he wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?” Already, a pro-Trump Super PAC had run attack ads against Heller, which were pulled after McConnell complained to the White House.

With Flake, Trump was even more explicit. Trump tweeted that he was glad that Flake was being subjected to a primary, and even offered an informal endorsement of sorts for one of his likely challengers, Dr. Kelli Ward:

Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017

What’s at stake in Arizona for Trump today

As Trump heads to Arizona, he is desperate for a change of subject after a tumultuous week that saw the departure of strategist Steve Bannon, widespread and bipartisan condemnation of the president’s response to Charlottesville, Virginia, and sagging approval numbers in the Midwestern states that carried him to victory.

Trump and his supporters clearly believe that a major source of trouble for Trump has been insufficient loyalty from Republicans on Capitol Hill, and he may wish to send a strong message by rewarding someone (Arpaio) who has shown him loyalty since the beginning of his campaign and attacking a Republican (Flake) who has been perceived as disloyal.

It cannot be a coincidence then, that McConnell chose this day to release this ad attacking “Chemtrail Kelli” — a moniker that was widely credited with torpedoing her failed 2016 primary challenge to Sen. John McCain.

Oh man. A McConnell-allied super PAC is out with an ad dubbing Flake challenger Kelli Ward ""Chemtrail Kelli"" https://t.co/kFXWGJIuy6 — Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) August 22, 2017

Senate Republicans are itching for a fight with Trump, and that’s bad news

McConnell’s ad is just the latest indication that Senate Republicans are not exactly cowering in fear of political reprisals from Trump and his most loyal supporters.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is also up for re-election in 2018 in a state that Donald Trump won by 21 points, and he publicly broadsided Trump last week without provocation, suggesting that Trump was unstable and incompetent.

Flake and Heller have likewise been defiant about Trump’s attacks, treating them as non-serious threats to their re-election chances.

Heller reportedly joked about the inefficacy of the Trump PAC’s ads to Trump’s face during a capitol luncheon, while Flake made the rounds on television this weekend to publicly declare himself unimpressed with Trump’s threats. The entire scene is already reminiscent of the nadir of George W. Bush’s presidency, when Republicans in Congress seemed actually eager to distance themselves from their Republican president during the 2006 and 2008 elections.

Bush accepted his status as political pariah with good grace and never sought public reprisal against Republicans who attacked him for the sake of their political careers.

Trump, on the other hand, is not George W. Bush. In fact, he is the polar opposite of Bush, at least in terms of temperament. Republicans who attempt to create distance from Trump can expect to find themselves on the receiving end of attempted retribution in spades.

However, this is where Trump’s anemic approval ratings do, in fact, matter to his agenda. Trump often dismisses these polls as irrelevant, and in a certain sense, they are. After all, Trump is going to be president for another 3 1/2 years regardless of what happens.

But in another sense, they matter quite a lot, because they are exactly what has emboldened red state Republicans who are up for re-election next year to defy him. Worse, not only are these red state Republicans willing to defy Trump, they actually seem to be itching for a public fight with him.

Democrats have already proven that they will not work with Trump on anything. Republicans only have an effective three-seat majority in the Senate. In order for Trump to accomplish literally anything on his agenda — including tax reform, infrastructure spending, or trade reform — he needs a totally unified Republican caucus behind him.

And it looks increasingly like any hopes for that are fading into the ether, perhaps forever."

Now, the school’s booster club has ousted the 74-year-old board member who stormed out on the court to confront the player for disrespecting the flag.

Jim Howard is a native of Garden City, Kansas, and has donated to the college for 32 years. He said he was voted out of his position as a Broncbuster Athletic Association board member after the confrontation.

When the player, Rasool Samir, came out of the locker room to shoot around while the national anthem played, Howard entered the court after the song to chastise Samir.

“I told him if you don’t respect the flag, get out of this gym. Get off the floor and get out of the gym and he proceeded to tell me he didn’t have to,” Howard told the Todd Starnes Show. “At least respect the people that paid for your scholarship to get you on this campus – like myself and everyone else in that gym.”

According to a letter written by Garden City Community College’s attorney, the school even considered filing battery, assault or disorderly conduct charges against Howard.

“Like I told campus police, [Samir] did not physically attack me. I did not physically attack him,” Howard said. “If we touched each other, that would have been — no penalty, no foul, incidental contact.”

Howard believes that Samir went out of his way to disrespect the anthem, because both teams were in the locker room as the song played, yet Samir came out during the song to shoot around.

“This was definitely an ‘in your face’ move,” Howard said. “He knew exactly what he was doing because he was waiting for it to happen.”

Howard told the Garden City Telegram that he regrets saying after the incident that he would stop supporting the college if Samir was allowed to continue as a student. Samir withdrew from the college after being removed from the basketball team."
blaze158,blaze,['Liz Klimas'],2013-01-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/01/10/did-you-a-flu-shot-and-still-came-down-with-the-flu-heres-why,"You did your due diligence and received a flu vaccine this year. Congratulations, you’re one of the estimated 36 percent of people to have gotten the shot or nasal spray so far this flu season. So why are you feeling achy, exhausted, congested, feverish and generally lousy?

There are many factors at play here, including that the flu shot is no where close to 100 percent effective at preventing the virus.

“There are any number of reasons why people could have done all the right things and still get the flu,” Massachusetts’ head of the bureau of infectious diseases, Kevin Cranston, said, according to the Associated Press.

This season the flu is already considered “widespread” in nearly all states. Some cites, like Boston, have officially declared it a public health emergency. Boston has seen 700 confirmed cases of the flu, compared with 70 all of last season, with 18 flu-related deaths so far.

The CDC said the proportion of people visiting health care providers with flu-like symptoms climbed from 2.8 percent to 5.6 percent in four weeks. By contrast, the rate peaked at only 2.2 percent during the relatively mild 2011-12 flu season. The estimated rate of flu-related hospitalizations in the U.S. was 8.1 per 100,000 people, which is high for this time of year, according to Dr. Joe Bresee, chief of the epidemiology and prevention branch of the CDC’s influenza division.

Watch this report from CBS regarding Boston’s situation with the flu outbreak:

But why does it seem to be so virulent this year? The most popular strain identified this season is Type A influenza H3N2, which is historically associated with more serious illnesses. It is also among the strains covered by the flu vaccine.

But as Cranston said “no vaccine is 100 percent effective.” One reason is the lag time between vaccination and active immunity. A person who received a flu shot but comes in contact with the virus before the vaccine becomes effective — between 10 days and two weeks — they are still susceptible to becoming ill.

Recent studies have shown that the flu vaccine as a whole is only about 59 percent effective at preventing the illness. NRP pointed out that the vaccine appears to be less effective for the elderly, which is a population often highly encouraged to receive the shot in the first place.

Another reason someone might contract the flu even after receiving vaccination is if the strain they were infected with wasn’t included in the vaccine in the first place. Each year, virus experts select the strains most likely to cause illness that year to include in the flu shot. This year the World Health Organization recommended including the three following strains in vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere:

an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;

an A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus;

a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus (from the B/Yamagata lineage of viruses).

Even though the flu vaccine might have its flaws, the CDC says it’s still the most effective method at preventing the flu and recommends people receive it either in shot or nasal spray form. Whether or not you receive the vaccine, the CDC also points to a few other ways to prevent and/or stop the spread of the virus:

Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.

Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way.

Try to avoid close contact with sick people.

If you are sick with flu-like illness, CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. (Your fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.)

While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them.

The CDC said 18 children have died from the flu so far this season. While it doesn’t keep a tab of deaths overall from the flu, the CDC estimates that 24,000 Americans die each year.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."

It’s not just that Kelly launched a shot on his opponents’ goal that traveled a whopping 80 yards — and that went in before time expired.

It’s not just that Kelly performed his miracle before an awestruck home crowd on the Fourth of July.

It’s also what Kelly’s opposing goalie was doing — or more accurately, not doing — at the time of his long-distance bomb.

Atlanta goalie Adam Ghitelman, you might say, wasn’t exactly minding the net.

Instead, it appears he’d removed one of his protective gloves and was holding a water bottle in one hand and a stick in the other while Kelly’s shot was in the air. The ball is seen hurtling toward the Atlanta goal and flying past Ghitelman’s left side before he knew what happened.

Ghitelman seemed to react only after the ball rocketed past him —

— punctuated by him tossing down his water bottle and raising his arms in disbelief.

The announcers were stunned, too.

“I have never seen anything like that in my entire life,” one exclaimed.

Kelly’s goal gave Denver a 16-9 lead as the fourth quarter commenced, leading to its eventual 24-12 win over Atlanta."

LiveLeak user Grizzman uploaded a video showing viewers his set up and successful near-1.5 mile shot with a .338 Lapua Magnum rifle and a metal target.

“A few days ago I took out the 338 Lapua and attempted the 2,500-yard shot,” Grizzman said. “So I placed the target at 2,530 yards or 1.43 miles away, at that distance the bullet flight time is almost 4.5 seconds!”

Long-range rifle shots are ridiculously hard to execute, which is why military snipers are a rare breed with a carefully honed skill set.

But as sights and gadgets for measuring wind and distance have improved, odds of hitting far-off targets have increased as well.

“I went out early in the morning to beat the mirage, luckly [sic] there was very little wind around 3-4 mph coming from the left, I dialed 2.6 mils Left,” the shooter explained on LiveLeak. “I had to dialed the maximum elevation my scope (Nightforce NXS 5.5-22×56 MIL/MIL) had at 27.4 mils then held over 2.5 mils on the reticle to get me to 29.9 mils.”

Update 9:56 a.m. ET: Scalise’s office released a statement after he was shot in the hip Wednesday morning. The statement said the congressman is in “stable” condition and in “good spirits” as he spoke to his wife by phone on the way to a Washington, D.C., hospital.

Original story below:

“At least five people,” including Republican House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) and two Capitol Police officers, were shot early Wednesday morning at a congressional baseball practice outside Washington, D.C., according to multiple reports.

It happened near a YMCA in Alexandria, Virginia, just south of the nation’s Capitol, where multiple Republican members of Congress were practicing, CNN reported. Sources described the incident to CNN as a “deliberate attack.”

Images on social media showed at least one window near the scene with a bullet hole in it.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said the gunman was carrying “a large gauge rifle.” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told CNN that Capitol Police officers fired back at the shooter with pistols.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that if it were not for Capitol Police, “it would have been a massacre,” according to Fox News. Paul estimated there were at least 50 to 60 shots that rang out.

Fox News, CNN, and other outlets reported that Scalise was shot in the hip. Two Capitol Police officers were also shot. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said on air on CNN that “at least five” were injured, in total. The extent of the injuries was not immediately known.

Brooks said he took off his belt and used it as a tourniquet to control Scalise’s bleeding. The Capitol Police officer who was shot reportedly crawled to the outfield, where Scalise was lying on the ground, to check on him. Flake said Scalise was laying injured in the outfield “for at least 10 minutes.”

“We couldn’t get to him while there were shots,” Flake said.

Fox News reported that the gunman was shot and taken into custody at a nearby hospital. There were no immediate reporters of other shooters.

Scalise met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday. Following the shooting on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a statement, saying that the president and vice president are aware of the shooting.

Both @POTUS & @VP are aware of the developing situation in Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers are with all affected. — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) June 14, 2017

Trump tweeted that Scalise was “badly injured” but expressed confidence that he will “fully recover.”

Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2017

Theunis Botha, 51, and the party he was leading stumbled upon a herd of breeding elephants, some of them pregnant, at the Good Luck Farm near Hwange National Park on Friday, the Independent reported.

Citing Netwerk24, an Afrikanns-language news site, News24 in South Africa reported that Botha shot at three female elephants that stampeded the hunters. A fourth female elephant then charged the group from the side and lifted Botha with her trunk, News24 said. After a member of Botha’s party fatally shot the fourth elephant, the animal fell on top of Botha and killed him, News24 said.

Botha is survived by his wife and five children, who received some sympathy on social media:

Another fellow detractor called Botha a “wanker” and said, “On behalf of all the unarmed wildlife in Zimbabwe ‘Good f***ing riddance.'”

Yet another wrote “may you and all your fans eat s**t … glad you’re dead.. (sic) scum.” An additional non-fan added, “Rot in hell, Theunis Botha, you flat piece of s**t.”

Botha reportedly traveled regularly to the U.S. in search of wealthy customers to take part in trophy hunting, the Independent reported. His Big Game Hounds Safaris company said Botha “perfected Leopard and Lion hunting safaris with hounds in Africa. He pioneered traditional European Style Driven Monteria hunts in South Africa.” A Monteira hunt involves dogs driving animals toward the hunters."

Amos, a retired Norfolk police officer, once shot and killed a 19-year-old black man. He received $3,000 per month while he was on leave. Kaepernick addressed such situations in a recent interview, saying: “The cops are getting paid leave for killing people. That’s not right.”

On August 29, Amos posted an open letter to Kaepernick on Facebook and argued they have more in common than the NFL star might think.

It’s recommended you read Amos’ open letter in its entirety below:

An Open Letter to Colin Kaepernick,

Dear Colin guess you have been pretty busy these last few days. For the record I don’t think any more or less of you for not standing for the National Anthem. Honestly, I never thought that much about you, or any professional athlete for that matter, to begin with. I’ve read your statement a few times and want you to know I am one of the reasons you are protesting. You see I am a retired police officer that had the misfortune of having to shoot and kill a 19-year-old African American male. And just like you said, I was the recipient of about $3,000 a month while on leave which was a good thing because I had to support a wife and three children under 7-years-old for about 2 months with that money. Things were pretty tight because I couldn’t work part time. Every police officer I’ve ever known has worked part-time to help make ends meet.

You know Colin the more I think about it the more we seem to have in common. I really pushed myself in rehab to get back on the street, kind of like you do to get back on the field. You probably have had a broken bone or two and some muscle strains and deep bruising that needed a lot of work. I just had to bounce back from a gunshot wound to the chest and thigh. Good thing we both get paid when we are too banged up to “play”, huh? We both also know what it’s like to get blindsided. You by a 280- pound defensive end, ouch! Me, by a couple of rounds fired from a gun about 2 feet away, into my chest and thigh. We also both make our living wearing uniforms, right? You have probably ruined a jersey or two on the field of play. I still have my blood stained shirt that my partner and paramedics literally ripped off my back that cold night in January. Fortunately, like you I was given a new one. Speaking of paramedics aren’t you glad the second we get hurt trainers and doctors are standing by waiting to rush onto the field to scoop us up. I’m thankful they get to you in seconds. It only took them about 10 minutes to get to me. By the grace of God, the artery in my thigh didn’t rupture or else 10 minutes would have been about 9 minutes too late. We also have both experienced the hate and disgust others have just because of those uniforms we wear. I sure am glad for your sake that the folks who wear my uniform are on hand to escort you and those folks that wear your uniform into stadiums in places like Seattle!

I guess that’s where the similarities end Colin. You entertain for a living, I and almost 800,000 others across this country serve and protect. Are there some bad apples within my profession? Absolutely and they need to be identified and fired or arrested! But you know what, the vast majority do the right thing, the right way, for the right reason. Did I mention that seconds before I was shot, an elderly African American gentleman walking down the sidewalk, turned to my partner and I as we rode past and said, “Get them.” Get who you ask? The thugs terrorizing an otherwise good and decent neighborhood, home to dozens of good, decent African American families trying to raise those families in communities not protected by gates and security guards. No these folks and families depend on America’s Law Enforcement Officers.

Colin I have buried 7 friends, killed in the line of duty and three others who have committed suicide. I have attended more funerals than I care to remember of neighboring departments who have lost officers in the line of duty, during my career. Law Enforcement Officers with different backgrounds, upbringings, and experiences united by their willingness to answer the call to protect and serve their fellow citizens.

Colin I am sorry for the endorsement deals you may lose and the dip in jersey sales, but please know you will NEVER lose what these men and women and their families have lost. And so whether you stand or sit during the National Anthem means very little to me. As for me and the men and women on whose team I was privileged to serve, we will put on our ballistic vests, badge, and gun, kiss our loved one’s goodbye, for some tragically for the last time, and out into a shift of uncertainty we will go. We will continue to protect and continue to serve and we will be standing at attention Colin, not just for the playing of our National Anthem, but far more importantly for the playing of Taps.

blaze164,blaze,['Carly Hoilman'],2016-06-11 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/06/11/former-the-voice-star-fatally-shot-after-concert-singers-brother-detains-gunman-police-say,"ORLANDO, Fla. (TheBlaze/AP) — A gunman who shot and killed a singer who rose to fame after appearing on “The Voice” traveled to Orlando from another Florida city specifically to attack her and then fatally shot himself, authorities said Saturday.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at a news conference that the suspect, identified as 27-year-old Kevin Loibl of St. Petersburg, Florida, didn’t appear to know Christina Grimmie personally. Grimmie was shot to death after giving a concert in Orlando on Friday night. She died early Saturday.

“She was doing a meet-and-greet, just signing autographs and selling merchandise. This white male approached her and opened fire, striking her,” Mina said. “We believe he came here to commit this crime.”

The 22-year-old singer from New Jersey finished third during season six of NBC’s “The Voice” in 2014, competing on the team of Maroon 5 star Adam Levine. She began amassing a following on YouTube as a teenager, gripping online viewers with her powerful renditions of hit songs. Her videos on YouTube have garnered millions of views.

In an earlier statement, police said Grimmie had performed with the band Before You Exit at The Plaza Live in Orlando. The concert ended around 10 p.m., and Grimmie was shot as she signed autographs for fans at a merchandise table in The Plaza Live concert venue.

Grimmie’s brother, Marcus, immediately tackled the gunman, who then shot and killed himself during the struggle, police said. They credited the singer’s brother with preventing the gunman from hurting others. Around 120 others were in The Plaza Live at the time.

“Very heroic actions by Marcus Grimmie to jump in and it definitely could have prevented further loss of life,” Mina said.

After the concert, 17-year-old Kaitlin Martin was standing with a group of other fans outside The Plaza Live, waiting for members of Before You Exit to come out, when she heard several loud “pops.”

“We thought at first they were balloons … but then security started running all over the place yelling at people to get out because someone has a gun and someone is shooting. Everyone is just running all over the place,” said Martin, who traveled to see to the concert from Brunswick, Georgia. “It was chaos.”

Martin said she was unsettled knowing the suspect had watched the concert in the same audience she was in.

“This person was in the crowd with us, and while we were singing, having a great time, he was there with different intentions,” she said.

Detectives were searching Loibl’s cellphone and social media accounts looking for clues as to a motive, Mina said, but they weren’t aware of any history of stalking of Grimmie by the suspect.

Loibl had on him two handguns, two loaded magazines and a hunting knife, Mina said.

There were unarmed security guards at The Plaza Live and they checked bags and purses for contraband, but there were no metal detectors or pat-downs of people as they entered The Plaza Live, he said.

A spokeswoman said all events at The Plaza Live had been suspended until further notice.

Loibl had made travel arrangement to come to Orlando alone, as well as travel arrangements to go back home, but he didn’t have a car, Mina said. The police chief wouldn’t elaborate further.

Grimmie had posted a video of herself shortly before the concert was scheduled to begin, encouraging fans to come see her perform.

Levine posted a photo of himself with Grimmie on Instagram, commenting before her death was confirmed: “I’m sad, shocked and confused. We love you so much Grimmie. We are all praying hard that you can pull through this … this just isn’t fair.”

NBC’s “The Voice” paid tribute to Grimmie on its official Twitter page: “There are no words. We lost a beautiful soul with an amazing voice.”

There are no words. We lost a beautiful soul with an amazing voice. Our hearts go out to the friends, fans and family of @TheRealGrimmie. — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) June 11, 2016

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2014 that Grimmie moved to Los Angeles in 2012 after joining Selena Gomez on tour to focus on her singing career.

“I’m done being surprised by cool things she does. She’s very talented and she’s worked incredibly hard – it’s a dangerous combination,” her brother told the newspaper at the time.

blaze165,blaze,['Buck Sexton'],2012-08-10 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/08/10/blaze-exclusive-check-out-the-paratus-308-clandestine-breakdown-special-ops-rifle-available-to-civilians-too,"The Blaze has been given a first look at an incredible special ops breakdown rifle that you haven’t seen anywhere else.

Consider this a special Firearms Friday treat:

It’s called the Paratus 16, and it is one of the most exciting new rifle designs we’ve seen in a long time.

Designed from the bottom up and built by DRD Tactical Arms, the Paratus was conceptualized from the start as a multi-purpose rifle specifically for Spec Ops/Covert Ops missions. It can also suit many diplomatic or executive security, military, air crews, law enforcement– and of course– home defense uses.

What DRD Tactical has come up with is a high-tech clandestine ops rifle that fits right in your backpack.

While it derives some of its basic concepts from the AR-15 family, the Paratus goes much further with an innovative new breakdown design. As DRD Tactical told the Blaze:

“We developed [Paratus 16] in 7.62NATO/.308 caliber, and the AR platform, being so popular, led us to stay with a direct gas operated system. There are 2 utility patent applications filed, one on the internal recoil system and the other on the quick take down barrel design. The internal recoil system eliminates the buffer tube, spring and buffer from a traditional AR15 design, hence allowing it to have a folding stock.”

For those of you who want to get right down into the nuts and bolts, here are all the weapon specifications:

CALIBER: .308/7.62x51mm

OPTIC MOUNTING RAIL: MIL-STD 1913 SIGHTS: Magpul MBUS Front & Rear

WEIGHT: 9.2 LBS

LENGTH: 38″ with stock unfolded

BARREL: Lothar-Walther Stainless Steel (LW50) 16” with 1 in 10 twist

MAGAZINE CAPACITY: 20 Rounds

BUTTSTOCK: Magpul Folding, Adjustable

SAFETY SELECTOR: Standard AR15 type

RIFLE FINISH: NiBore (NICKEL BORON) TRIGGER

GROUP: GEISSELE 2-STAGE

OPERATION: Direct Gas operated Semi-Automatic

While it has all the benefits of gas-operated rifles like the AR-15 and M4, it adds a high level of portability and can be fitted in many configurations. Much of this stems from the rifles original concept as a clandestine operations firearm, first and foremost.

To that end, the Paratus has a quick change barrel that you don’t need any tools to afix, which means switching out barrels in the field is no problem. One could also decide to carry multiple barrels of different lengths for various missions, like short barrels for Close Quarters Battle and long barrels for Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR) applications.

The whole Paratus package can fit in a small camera size hard case 16″x 10″ x 6″, or be placed in a Halliburton diplomatic attache case. There are also backpack and endless other civilian carry case options. You can see one standard carry configuration below:

So how fast can it be assembled from the case? Really fast. In fact, you can see for yourself in video of the Paratus going from breakdown to throwing rounds, courtesy of DRD Tactical:

Now some of you may be asking “Can I get one?”

The Paratus was created with the elite warfighter in mind, but it is now available to civilian gun owners too. As DRD Tactical put it to The Blaze: “Since we live in a free republic and our fellow citizens can own rifles we will be selling them to the commercial market as we work on demos with [government] personnel.”

He spent years wiring, welding and learning the high art of attention to detail in his craft. But for years he dreamed of a different line of work; he wanted to open up a company to build and sell reliable firearms. And in 2007, he and his wife Karen did just that.

“In my lifetime, we’ve gone from seeing people have large, nice walnut cases where they displayed their firearms; it was a status symbol,” Fuller, the president of Rifle Dynamics, told TheBlaze. “Nowadays people have to hide them in a locked case under the bed.”

Fuller has a passion for weapons, but he especially longs to see people learn to care for and develop a personal connection with their firearms. So in addition to teaching classes on rifle safety and familiarity in Las Vegas, he decided to offer classes where people can learn to build their own weapons.

“It is absolutely legal and possible to buy all the items you need to build your own rifle at home,” Fuller said. He’s right, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives states on its website, “per provisions of the Gun Control Act ( GCA ) of 1968, 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, an unlicensed individual may make a “firearm” as defined in the GCA for his own personal use, but not for sale or distribution.“

Granted, you could look it all up online, order the parts yourself and take on the task of building a rifle in your basement. But if you want to build an AK-47 that will actually operate safely and reliably, you may want to hire a professional.

“We specialize in the Kalishnakov, and I’ve been working with these weapons for more than 30 years,” Fuller said. “Some people can be intimidated by the idea of building their own weapon, but we carefully walk through the entire process and inspect everything.”

Fuller said he and Karen take careful steps to ensure everything is done legally and above board.

“It is a hefty process to get the permits to be able to distribute weapons,” he said. But they “really believe” in making sure gun owners have reliable products to use when needed.

But Fuller also said his dream job is about much more than just building operational firearms. It’s about honoring a nearly lost art form.

“These weapons are 1940s technology, and the the construction method for the AK was stamp sheet metal instead of milled parts … this is the right way to build it,” he said. “Over the years people have tried to build them different ways but it doesn’t really capture what the weapon is famous for, especially the reliability and work in nearly any environment, going nearly 300,000 rounds and still going strong.”

Fuller even developed a rear sight modification to the AK because so many people have complained that the sights were too small. He got creative and consulted with his optometrist — also an avid shooter — to developed the new sights.

“By widening the rear sight notch and rounding the corners it makes the eye naturally align with the sight notch, allowing a much improved sight picture,” the Rifle Dynamics site explains. “The meter marking and battle zero are still to spec, it’s a HUGE improvement using the stock sights.”

“To me it’s all about the Second Amendment,” the 58-year-old licensed gunsmith said.”This is an American tradition and we want to uphold that heritage and respect. We started this business out of our garage and grew it from there, and now all of our build classes are sold out for this year already.”

“This is my dream job,” Fuller said. “If I could have started doing this 30 years ago, I would have.”

Fuller said he meets amazing people in his line of work, especially special operators who often favor their hand-built AK-47s even to their military-issued weapons. “We know plenty of guys who switch over to their personal weapons when the fighting gets really tough, because they know they want them to work,” he said.

Rifle Dynamics hosts build classes in cities around the nation, and Fuller said they are already selling into classes for 2015.

The original clip of Tuesday’s incident was posted to Facebook where it’s been viewed more than 1.5 million times, WMAC said.

As marshals took Bobby Gibbs into custody, his uncle, Corterian Wright, told WMAC he began videotaping the arrest outside a Memphis apartment.

Suddenly, a marshal is seen on the video pointing a rifle at Wright.

When he and others asked why the rifle was being pointed, one of the marshals answered, “We ain’t gettin’ shot,” which the bystanders said was ridiculous.

“Go back in the house,” the marshal pointing the rifle said.

As the marshal moved toward the vehicle waiting to transport Gibbs, he activated the rifle’s light while continuing to point the weapon.

Toward the end of the clip, Wright told the marshal, “Your ass ain’t gonna be workin’ that long” — after which the marshal appeared to smile during a brief spoken reply.

Here’s a new posting of the clip via Facebook. (Content warning: Profanity):

This happened today in East Memphis Tn, they just took this po… This happened today in East Memphis Tn, they just took this post off Facebook so nobody could see it but ima keep posting it and y'all keep sharing it they locked my nephew up and was pointing the gun at me and his pregnant baby motherfor more info: http://bit.ly/1Wyjzvw Posted by But That's None Of My Business on Wednesday, September 30, 2015

In a statement to WMAC, the U.S. Marshals Service said members of the task force “were there to arrest a fugitive wanted for several violent felonies including aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. The fugitive was in an apartment which posed an unknown threat to task force members on the scene. As the fugitive emerged from the residence, he was taken into custody.”

“In accordance with USMS policy, task force members secured the scene until the fugitive was secure and transported. Once the fugitive was transported, task force members left the area,” the statement said.

Wright said the marshal who pointed his rifle at him should be reprimanded. “It was like 12 officers in all,” he told WMAC. “Out of 12, 11 were very professional.”

Wright added that he was concerned about a pregnant woman at the scene, Lafestia Keely.

“I was afraid for my life,” Keely told WMAC, adding, “Everyone had their hands up.”

“I know it’s proper procedures for them to make sure they’re secured and safe,” Wright added to the station, “but after they secured my nephew and put him in the car, you made a statement by keeping your gun pointed and you turned your light on me.”

Black Lives Matter activist Tami Sawyer told WMAC the move by the marshal was “pure intimidation.”

“When you were done messing with them, you turned your back on them,” Sawyer added. “He didn’t back up with the gun. He turned around and got in the car. So how afraid were you really?”

That’s not how former West Memphis Police Chief Bob Paudert sees it. Paudert — whose son Brandon, also an officer, was fatally shot during a traffic stop in 2010 — said the marshal’s reaction was correct, especially given the present anti-police climate.

“We’re being ambushed constantly around this country,” Paudert told WMAC. “They’ve got to take precautions. I think they did exactly what they should do so they could go home at night.”

Wright, however, wants something done.

“They’re going to wait until somebody’s killed and then take action?” he asked.

But it’s where this rifle range is located that has some adults asking questions.

It’s in a high school.

The brand-new North Atlanta (Ga.) High School, in fact, which opens for business Wednesday, according to WSB-TV.

While the range is for the school’s Junior Reserve Officer Training Corp as well as the rifle team, some parents want more information.

“I’ll probably question it a little bit just to get a better idea,” parent Donna Jones told WSB. “Like I said, I didn’t understand they were going to be doing that but I think they’re going to be very careful in protecting the students.”

While sponsoring a rifle range on school property may be eye-opening to some, it isn’t the only campus rifle range in Atlanta; it’s modeled after one already up and running at a neighboring school, WSB reported.

Others fully support having the range on school property. “It’s nothing that can hurt anybody and they will be supervised to the max,” said parent Cappy McAlpin to WSB. “Why not start now for those that want to do that?”

“If I see a kid walking around school with a weapon locked and loaded I would have concern,” parent Bobby Strozier said, adding that he believes the rifles will be safely locked away when not in use.

As it happens, “rifle” is a loose term in this case: The range is for compressed air-powered pellet rifles, WSB reported. The program will also have an instructor certified by the U.S. Army Cadet Command and the Georgia High School Athletic Association, according to Atlanta Public Schools.

In addition, once the range is safety certified, likely within 30 days, and students are allowed to use it, rifle team members will be equipped with the latest safety gear, WSB says.

“I can see why they would be concerned but I know they go through lots of training and they’re heavily supervised,” said senior Turner Hume.

Then she noticed a reflection in the lens of her glasses, WDTN-TV reported.

When she turned around she saw a male at the door, according to a Dayton police report, wearing a clown mask and holding a rifle.

Dressed also in a long-sleeved black shirt, black gloves and black jeans, police said the man told the resident to open her back door, which was locked.

Instead, she ran into her living room and saw two other men in her front yard, and the other man with the clown mask soon joined them.

Citing the police report about last Thursday’s incident, WDTN said the woman grabbed her “black revolver handgun” and walked out front where the man with clown mask pointed the rifle at her and attempted to load it.

Police said she told the man to drop the rifle — and when he didn’t comply, she fired a “warning shot” into the garage, the station said.

All the men in the yard took off running, WDTN reported.

The Kentucky Republican is facing a primary challenge from Tea Party candidate Matt Bevin, and is arguably in less-than-friendly territory at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

C.J. Grisham, the decorated vet arrested last month after “rudely displaying” his rifle while on a hike with his 15-year-old son, was still without his firearms on Thursday. Police in Temple, Texas are holding onto his AR-15 (and .45.-cal. pistol) until his case is resolved, and as you know, the wildly popular rifles aren’t cheap to replace.

But on Friday, Black Rain Ordnance, a Missouri firearms company, graciously offered to give Grisham his choice of any AR-15 rifle at a significantly discounted price — free.

“When we heard about his situation, it was obvious that his rights were trampled on,” Charlie Spires, the gun company’s co-founder, told TheBlaze at the 2013 NRA Convention in Houston on Friday. “Then we hear that they basically confiscated his weapon and he can’t get it back — what can we do? That the was the next question we asked.”

Spires said there were some suggestions of “throwing some t-shirts at him,” but the company wanted to take it a step further. “Ultimately, if they’ve taken his rifle and we are a firearms manufacturer, why not give a rifle to him?”

“I’ve got goosebumps just thinking about it,” Grisham told TheBlaze after learning he would be getting a free rifle. “It’s completely unnecessary… I don’t even have words for it.”

By the way, here’s what someone who just learned he’s getting a free AR-15 looks like:

Spires confirmed that the Army vet can “flip through the catalog and pick whichever AR-15 he wants. So, Grisham made his way down to the company’s vendor booth on the convention floor and went shopping:

But ultimately, Grisham, who is certain he will get his firearms back and win his case, was leaning towards getting a “pink splash” AR-15 for his wife.

Grisham told TheBlaze that his case is awaiting a May 15 hearing, where his legal team will submit a motion for evidence. If the motion is successful, police will be forced to release dash cam footage from the arresting officer’s police cruiser. Grisham said the footage will verify everything he has revealed about the incident.

For all the details — and video — surrounding Grisham’s detainment and arrest, read TheBlaze’s previous report here.

Apparently not satisfied with just one random act of kindness, Black Rain Ordnance also offered a free AR-15 to Glenn Beck for covering Grisham’s story so closely and standing up for America’s gun rights.

So, Beck made his way to the NRA Convention floor and picked out his own rifle:

You can get your own AR-15 from Black Rain Ordnance here — you just will have to pay for it.

Take what hackers demonstrated in a Jeep Cherokee last week.

If having a vehicle hijacked electronically is frightening, how about a firearm?

TrackingPoint, a “precision guided firearm,” boasts that its Xact System is “the most accurate shooting system in the world.”

Perhaps, but not after security researchers like Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger infiltrated its system through a Wi-Fi connection and software flaws and found they could change its aim or disable it all together.

The hackers, who plan to present some of their findings at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas next week, demonstrated to Wired how they were able to “change variables in the scope’s calculations that make the rifle inexplicably miss its target, permanently disable the scope’s computer, or even prevent the gun from firing.”

“You can make it lie constantly to the user so they’ll always miss their shot,” Sandvik told Wired. “If the scope is bricked, you have a six to seven thousand dollar computer you can’t use on top of a rifle that you still have to aim yourself.”

Here’s how the hackers exploited the system, as reported by Wired:

But Sandvik and Auger found that they could use a chain of vulnerabilities in the rifle’s software to take control of those self-aiming functions. The first of these has to do with the Wi-Fi, which is off by default, but can be enabled so you can do things like stream a video of your shot to a laptop or iPad. When the Wi-Fi is on, the gun’s network has a default password that allows anyone within Wi-Fi range to connect to it. From there, a hacker can treat the gun as a server and access APIs to alter key variables in its targeting application. (The hacker pair were only able to find those changeable variables by dissecting one of their two rifles and using an eMMC reader to copy data from the computer’s flash storage with wires they clipped onto its circuit board pins.) […] Sandvik and Auger found that through the Wi-Fi connection, an attacker could also add themselves as a “root” user on the device, taking full control of its software, making permanent changes to its targeting variables, or deleting files to render the scope inoperable. If a user has set a PIN to limit other users’ access to the gun, that root attack can nonetheless gain full access and lock out the gun’s owner with a new PIN. The attacker can even disable the firing pin, a computer controlled solenoid, to prevent the gun from firing.

Watch the demo they gave Wired:

Fortunately, the security researchers found that they could not cause the gun to remote fire. The trigger still has to be pulled by the user for the firearm to shoot.

TrackingPoint Founder John McHale told Wired the company would be developing and issuing a software update as soon as possible in light of Sandvik and Auger’s exploit. The hackers though told Wired they’ve tried to get a response from TrackingPoint on what they’ve found for months.

McHale told the tech site he still stands behind the gun’s safety aspects as well.

“The shooter’s got to pull the rifle’s trigger, and the shooter is responsible for making sure it’s pointed in a safe direction,” he said.

He also added that the fact that this hack requires a Wi-Fi connection to exploit, makes it a more remote possibility that someone would infiltrate the firearm’s system for nefarious reasons.

“It’s highly unlikely when a hunter is on a ranch in Texas, or on the plains of the Serengeti in Africa, that there’s a Wi-Fi Internet connection,” McHale told Wired.

Sandvik and Auger warned that a hacker could mess with the gun’s system in a way that would continue even after the weapon is out of Wi-Fi range, Wired reported.

A couple of years ago when the rifle system became available, TrackingPoint reported sales were strong enough to have people on a wait list. Earlier this year though, Ars Technica pointed out that the company appeared to be experiencing financial trouble.

“Due to financial difficulty TrackingPoint will no longer be accepting orders,” a message on the company’s home page in May read, according to Ars Technica. It’s a message that no longer appears on the website.

McHale told Wired that TrackingPoint is currently “working through an internal restructuring.”"
blaze173,blaze,"['Aaron Colen', 'Staff Writer']",2017-12-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/13/michigan-police-point-gun-at-handcuff-11-year-old-in-search-for-stabbing-suspect,"A police search for a 40-year-old attempted murder suspect ended with an officer pointing a gun at and handcuffing an 11-year-old girl in Michigan last week, sparking condemnation from the police chief and mayor.

What happened?

Grand Rapids police officers were searching for Carrie Manning, who was suspected of stabbing her sister.

11-year-old Honestie Hodges, a niece of the suspect, walked out of the door of her aunt’s house with another aunt and her mother.

Officers had each of the women and the girl approach separately for detaining and questioning.

When Honestie was asked to approach, an officer had a gun pointed at her. As she came forward, the officer had her put her hands on her head, then turn around and walk backward toward him.

When she reached one of the officers, he ordered her to put her hands behind her back as he pulled out his handcuffs, and the girl began to scream.

The officer spoke to Honestie in a calm and reassuring voice during the encounter, but she became upset by what she likely perceived as her being arrested.

“You’re not going to jail or anything,” the officer said as the girl screamed.

‘It makes my stomach turn’

Grand Rapids Police Chief David Rahinsky condemned the officer’s actions, saying the video of the encounter made him sick.

“You listen to the 11-year-old’s response, it makes my stomach turn,” Rahinsky said. “It makes me physically nauseous.”

Rahinsky acknowledged that sometimes suspects try to conceal weapons by giving them to children, but also said he didn’t believe this was a situation where the child posed any danger.

Grand Rapids Mayor Rosalyn Bliss said that “no child in our community should experience that.”

“You should feel safe running to an officer,” Rahinsky said.

The child’s perspective

Honestie told Fox WXMI in Grand Rapids that she was confused by the situation.

“I didn’t know what was going on,” she said. “I didn’t do anything wrong. I’ve never got in trouble by the Grand Rapids police.

“I used to want to be a Grand Rapids police officer, but ever since that happened, I want nothing to do with them. Chief or not, I really don’t feel comfortable around any cops.”"

One suggestion made by officials? Use wooden sticks instead of guns.

What are the details?

KOVR-TV reported Monday that officials in Elk Grove shot down the historical society’s two-day Revolutionary War event and said that local gun laws were to blame.

According to KOVR, the re-enactment — which the society expected several thousand visitors to attend — was set to include “firing black powder muskets,” but officials told the group that using such props were against a local code that prohibits using, maintaining, possessing, firing, or discharging any firearms.

Jim Entrican, facilities manager for the group and president of Elk Grove’s Native Son of the Golden West, told KOVR, “There’s no firing guns in a park, but there’s exceptions for each one of the ordinances.”

Entrican added that exceptions have been made in previous years.

“They actually asked us if we can use wooden sticks, and can you see 12 men in full regalia and another 12 charging with wooden sticks saying ‘Bang bang!'” he said. “It just doesn’t have the same effect.”

Entrican said that the April event would have featured “encampments and all kind of entertainment for the kids to see,” and called the cancellation — ordered late last year by the park district — “very frustrating.”

“History is important, and we’re losing it,” he added.

Entrican says he plans to attempt to change the ordinance preventing the show from continuing as-is, but noted that it could take months. KOVR reported that the group is working along with the city and park district to collaborate on a solution prior to the group’s next event."
blaze175,blaze,"['Aaron Colen', 'Staff Writer']",2018-03-01 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/01/georgia-teacher-who-fired-gun-in-school-previously-tried-to-confess-to-involvement-in-murder-police,"A Georgia high school teacher barricaded himself in a classroom Wednesday and fired his gun through a window. Now, police say the teacher had multiple incidents of strange behavior, including an attempt to confess to a murder, according to WTVC-TV.

What’s the story?

Jesse Randal Davidson, a teacher at Dalton High School in Dalton, Georgia, wouldn’t let students into his classroom at about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.

When the principal tried to get in using his key, Davidson pushed it closed and kept him from entering.

At that point, Davidson fired his snub-nosed .38 revolver through a classroom window.

Police evacuated the hallway and convinced Davidson to surrender after about 45 minutes.

Davidson was charged with aggravated assault, carrying a weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, and disrupting a public school.

How did he get the gun in the classroom?

Dalton High School does not allow guns on campus, but a police spokesman said Davidson brought it in his computer case.

What’s the teacher’s background?

Davidson came to Dalton High School in 2004, and principal Steve Bartoo called him a “good teacher” who was named teacher of the year in 2012. He’s also the broadcaster for school football and basketball games.

Involved in a murder?

Davidson has had some troubling incidents over the past two years, according to police documents.

In March 2016, Davidson told police he’d had an internet affair with a woman named Jacqueline Enrique, who he said was his adopted son’s girlfriend.

Davidson said he broke the affair off after a few weeks, when he told his wife about it. He said Enrique was pregnant with twins at that time, and that she was physically abusive to the children after they were born.

Davidson then said he was approached by “two friends” who offered to “take care” of Enrique for him because of her abuse. Davidson agreed.

After the men returned, Davidson said he asked them if they had scared Enrique, and they replied that it was “worse than that,” which Davidson interpreted as murder.

Davidson did not give any details about the men, and police could not verify the existence of a Jacqueline Enrique. He said he was on several medications for depression and had just been discharged from the hospital. Davidson was taken to a local hospital because he said he was thinking about hurting himself.

The police report speculated that Davidson “may be delusional.”

Anything else?

In January 2017, Davidson was reported to police as missing from the school. He had reported to his wife and supervisor earlier that he wasn’t feeling well.

Davidson was later found by school staff members at a local intersection, sitting on the curb, conscious but unresponsive. He was taken to the hospital.

An email sent to Bartoo on Thursday afternoon asking about the school’s response to the aforementioned occurrences has not yet received a response. School officials were unable to be reached by phone because the school was closed Thursday as a result of the incident."
blaze176,blaze,['Breck Dumas'],2018-03-01 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/01/australia-holds-second-gun-amnesty-collects-nearly-60000-more-firearms-from-citizens,"The Australian government collected 57,324 firearms voluntarily handed in by its citizens after a publicly funded media campaign between July 1 and Sept. 30, 2017.

The country released a National Firearms Amnesty 2017 report on Wednesday, detailing the intentions and outcomes of the initiative. The report also included the results of a voluntary survey provided to participants, asking their reason for surrendering their firearms, the source of the firearms, and their reason for not surrendering their firearms previously.

Why now?

Australia’s latest amnesty program was prompted by the Martin Place Siege, which took place in Sydney in December 2014. Three people were killed and seventeen taken hostage when an immigrant who had been granted political asylum used an unregistered shotgun in an attack at a Sydney café.

The gunman had been released on bail, awaiting trial on sexual assault charges. The shotgun used in the slaying was illegally obtained, prompting an immediate investigation. A government review of the incident resulted in recommended measures with the intent of preventing future gun violence.

Ministers from each jurisdiction met to address the issue at a Law, Crime and Community Safety Council meeting in October 2016. They approved a nationwide firearms amnesty program to be conducted in 2017, with states and territories being held responsible for the administrative and operational costs. The purpose was to improve public safety by reducing the number of unregistered firearms in the country and allowed citizens to hand over their guns and other weaponry without fear of prosecution.

The report referred to an illicit firearms market in Australia, including “grey market” weapons that “should have been handed in or registered following the major firearms reforms in 1996, but were not.” It also notes that at its most recent amnesty, “the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimated there were more than 260,000 firearms in Australia’s illicit firearms market.”

What’s the background?

Thirty-five people were killed in 1996 during the Port Arthur Massacre, when a gunman, Martin Bryant, with a semi-automatic weapon fired into a café in Tasmania.

In response, the Australian government quickly moved to imposed significant gun control laws, leading to the eventual buyback and destruction of one third of the country’s privately held guns.

The 1996 buyback was met with fierce opposition from the countries’ shooters organizations, who argued that their members were not criminals, but Australians.

Prime Minister John Howard, who supported the gun amnesty program, said at the time that while the intent was not to smear law-abiding citizens, this was an occasion for the government to make a decision “in the interests of the overall national good.”"

Cuomo retweeted a headline from an article where a 20-year-old with an expired license claimed to be able to buy an AR-15 at a gun store.

""I was able to buy an AR-15 in five minutes. I’m 20 and my ID is expired.

But the story was inaccurate because the man didn’t buy the gun, he changed his mind before going through the background check.

“Two days after the worst mass shooting in American history,” he wrote, “and my local gun shop in Virginia showed no hesitation in selling me an AR-15.”

“In fact, they really wanted me to buy it,” he said. “And I was only there for five minutes.”

But later he admitted he didn’t buy the gun, and therefore didn’t go through the background check.

“After he walked me through the paperwork, all five pages of it, I told him I changed my mind and wanted to think more before I bought an AR-15. He told me it wasn’t a problem and listed the store hours if I wanted to come back. I then said thank you and walked back to my car.”

When Cuomo was accosted with these facts, he defended retweeting the false story.

“Isn’t the point that the kid’s age and lack of ID wasn’t a deterrent? and this isn’t all gun shops. Place I bought my shotgun basically goes farther than law requires and makes judgments about whom to sell to. Point is the system should be better,” he tweeted.

The point is that the kid lied about buying a gun that he didn’t, and that you are now lying too. — Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) February 21, 2018

“Lying? Look if you want to fight against background checks, make the case,” Cuomo responded. “Whether it is calling the kids actors or LYING about how no laws could stop the shootings…that is the bs to call out. 97% of people want better checks. Why fight that?”

“This isn’t a response,” Cooke replied. “This is a straw man that has nothing to do with what I said to you, and nothing to do with the topic at hand. You promoted somebody who lied, and then you lied about why you did it.”

“It’s also a non sequitur, @ChrisCuomo,” Cooke continued. “The debate at present is over whether to extend background checks to private sales, not over the existing FFL system that the kid you promoted would have gone through had he actually tried to buy a gun. As for the introduction of those . . .”

Some politicians have pondered whether to ban the sale of AR-15 rifles to those under the age of 21 after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting where 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz murdered 17 people with an AR-15."

What did Kimmel say?

Kimmel described the massacre during his show and segued into a call for gun control.

“I’ve been reading comments from people saying this is terrible but there’s nothing we can do about it, but I disagree with that intensely because, of course, there’s something we can do about it,” Kimmel said. “There are a lot of things we could do about it, but we don’t.”

He also addressed the Second Amendment and made a joke that the Founding Fathers “wanted us to have AK-47s” and said that the National Rifle Association not only controls the GOP, but runs the country as well.

“[GOP lawmakers] should be praying … for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country because it is, so crazy,” Kimmel ranted.

Kimmel later said, “Your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient.”

What was Shapiro’s response?

Shapiro in a Tuesday video addressed Kimmel’s Monday night monologue.

“Jimmy Kimmel should not be cheered for what he did,” Shapiro said. “Jimmy Kimmel should be asked to provide the evidence for his suppositions rather than the evidence for his emotions.”

Although Shapiro believed Kimmel’s sentiments to be sincere, “sincerity does not make what you’re saying smart.”

The conservative author noted that Kimmel’s statement about GOP lawmakers praying for forgiveness is nothing more than political rhetoric to further divide the country.

“Last night, he did a long shtick about gun control that was entirely based on emotion and it was really nasty,” Shapiro said. “It was really nasty. I don’t think it was nasty because he doesn’t care. He cares. It’s really nasty because he’s suggesting that you and I don’t care.”

He added that those who don’t agree with Kimmel’s “evidence-less suggestions about gun control” means that “we are bad people” and that “we don’t care.”

“You want to know why the country is not unified? It’s because of stuff like this,” Shapiro said.

He noted that division in the U.S. doesn’t stem from disagreeing on policy, but because certain groups within the country feel necessary to “impute bad motives to people who disagree.”

“Who’s Jimmy Kimmel to decide whether thoughts, your thoughts and your prayers, are insufficient?” Shapiro asked. “So, your thoughts and prayers are only sufficient if you do what Jimmy Kimmel wants you to do? That’s the way this works now? Who died and made him Jesus?”

Shapiro wasn’t finished there, however:"

What did he say?

The former Republican Speaker of the House appeared on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” Tuesday morning where he discussed his take on school safety after last week’s school shooting that took the lives of 17 people and injured many more in Parkland, Florida.

Gingrich said that an important step in ensuring the safety of America’s children is to arm those capable of defending the safety of those same children.

“I think the only long-term solution … depending on the size of the school, is a minimum of six to eight teachers and administrators who are trained in the use of firearms and have conceal carry permits and are prepared to defend the kids,” Gingrich continued.

“Every school in the country is supposed to be a gun-free zone. If gun control worked, how come it didn’t work?” he added.

Gingrich noted it’s important to be “realistic,” and indicated that there has to be a safety net in place to protect children in instances in which measures taken to ensure safety might be lacking.

“I think we have to be realistic: we’re not going to confiscate guns on a scale to make us a disarmed country, and the truth is sooner or later, somebody’s going to slip through the net because the civil liberties problem,” he explained. “If you go out and you pick up every person who’s a little weird, you are really infringing on the right of people to be free.”

What else?

The Claude ISD in West Texas implemented a program in 2016 where staffers were trained to carry concealed weapons and taught what to do if ever faced with an active shooter."
blaze181,blaze,['Becket Adams'],2014-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/03/03/gun-shop-battles-city-over-ar-15-sign-i-will-be-in-jail-or-dead-before-that-sign-comes-down,"A business owner in National City, Calif., claims politics are behind recent attempts by city officials to have him remove a storefront billboard featuring the silhouette of an AR-15-style rifle.

“The sign is not coming down. I will be in jail or dead before that sign comes down,” Dimitrios Karras, a former United States Marine and the CEO of Ares Armor, said in a recent interview with Guns.com.

Ares Armor is known in its community for specializing in do-it-yourself firearm projects and for opposing anti-Second Amendment groups. For example, the company actually registered the domain “SenatorFeinstein.com” so they could link their website to the notoriously anti-gun Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).

Trouble began for the former Marine in November when he had the sign on the National City store refaced. Just a few days after the work was done, the company learned second hand that a City Council member was reportedly unhappy with the sign, according to a statement on Ares’ website.

Later, on Jan. 18, Ares was issued a citation for having the sign refaced without the “necessary permits.”

The store owner contests the citation, arguing that in all the years that the building has existed, before and after his company moved in, city officials have never complained of signs on the property.

“The Local Government of National City thinks it is acceptable to re-interpret their own city code to suite their political agenda if a message appears that does not suite their liking,” Karras said in a statement on the company’s website.

“They have chosen to attack us based on opposing political views,” he added. “They have abused their elected positions in order to silence those who do not agree with them. We will not be removing our sign. I will go to jail first. If it’s a fight they want, it is a fight they shall have.”

For his part, Ron Morrison, Mayor of National City, argues that the citation has everything to do with the city’s ordinances and nothing to do with harassing a local business owner. The mayor explained in an interview with Guns.com that the city “revised their general plan in 1997 to ban rooftop signs.”

“Existing signs, like the one on the building that Ares Armor now occupies, were grandfathered, however in 2012 the city changed their ordinance for the grandfather to break if any building was taken over by a new tenant,” Guns.com notes, citing the mayor’s explanation. “Since Ares moved in at the end of 2013, the city contends that the sign is now illegal.”

Morrison is adamant that the city is merely trying to enforce regulations and that it’s not trying to make an example of of a pro-Second Amendment business.

“The sign had been up there for decades, that’s not an argument,” Morrison said.

“Our ordinance is content-neutral. It has nothing to do with the content of the sign. We told them they can take the exact same sign, the same graphics, and put it on the front of their building,” he said. “That’s what the whole issue is. This doesn’t have anything to do with the Second Amendment, or the First Amendment. They have every right to put that message on their building if they want to.”

But Karras, who has been chronicling the entire ordeal on his company’s website, isn’t buying this explanation.

“The appeal was railroaded and denied,” Karras told Guns.com.

“The city now wants us to spend a ridiculous amount of money in another appeal, but what we are looking at is to see if we can file in federal court before doing that because it is evident the decision is already made before we can get there,” he added. “It’s ludicrous the stuff they are trying to pull right now. They are sticking to their guns.”

blaze183,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2014-02-13 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/02/13/tens-of-thousands-of-connecticut-gun-owners-may-be-staging-a-massive-act-of-civil-disobedience,"On Jan. 1, 2014, tens of thousands of defiant gun owners seemingly made the choice not to register their semi-automatic rifles with the state of Connecticut as required by a hastily-passed gun control law. By possessing unregistered so-called “assault rifles,” they all technically became guilty of committing Class D felonies overnight.

Police had received 47,916 applications for “assault weapons certificates” and 21,000 incomplete applications as of Dec. 31, Lt. Paul Vance told The Courant.

At roughly 50,000 applications, officials estimate that as little as 15 percent of the covered semi-automatic rifles have actually been registered with the state. “No one has anything close to definitive figures, but the most conservative estimates place the number of unregistered assault weapons well above 50,000, and perhaps as high as 350,000,” the report states.

Needless to say, officials and some lawmakers are stunned.

Due to the new gun control bill passed in April, likely at least 20,000 individual people — possibly as many as 100,000 — are now in direct violation of the law for refusing to register their guns. As we noted above, that act is now a Class D Felony.

Mike Lawlor, “the state’s top official in criminal justice,” suggested maybe the firearms unit in Connecticut could “sent them a letter.” However, he said an aggressive push to prosecute gun owners in the state is not going to happen at this point.

Lawlor, the undersecretary for criminal justice policy in the state Office of Policy and Management, also suggested that the legislature should reopen the registration period to encourage more gun owners to register their firearms.

You may recall the viral photo of Connecticut gun owners waiting in line to register their guns in December, which one person said reminded them of the “Weimar Germany.”

Holy Crap. Looks like Weimar Germany @chipwoods @MaxCUA CT men waiting in line to register guns with the govt pic.twitter.com/L74YQxkICy — Legal Immigrant (@votermom) December 31, 2013

Republican state Sen. Tony Guglielmo told The Courant he recently spoke to a constituent at a meeting in Ashford, who informed him that some of his friends with semi-automatic rifles are intentionally taking a stand.

“He made the analogy to prohibition,” the lawmaker recalled. “I said, ‘You’re talking about civil disobedience, and he said ‘Yes.’”

Guglielmo said he really thought the “vast majority would register.”

Other officials think the low registration numbers are due to ignorance on behalf of gun owners who aren’t aware of the new law. It’s impossible to know the main reason why gun owners aren’t showing up to register their guns without hearing from them directly, though Guglielmo’s constituent indicates at least some are practicing “civil disobedience.”

“Sorting out the number of potential new felons is a guessing game. State police have not added up the total number of people who registered the 50,000 firearms, Vance said. So even if we knew the number of illegal guns in the state, we’d have a hard time knowing how many owners they had,” the report concludes."
blaze184,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2013-02-27 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/02/27/fact-check-sen-feinstein-claims-u-s-has-witnessed-an-increased-number-of-mass-shootings-during-gun-control-hearing,"Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) made her case in favor of gun control during a packed hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. The hearing was called to debate Feinstein’s proposed a ban on so-called “assault weapons.”

“Let me now describe the key features of our new legislation, the ‘Assault Weapons Ban of 2013,’” Feinstein said Wednesday. “The bill bans the sale, transfer, importation, and manufacturing of 157 specifically named semi-automatic assault weapons.”

She continued: “It also bans any other assault weapon, which is defined as a semi-automatic weapon that can accept a detachable magazine and has one military characteristic, such as a pistol grip, barrel shroud, or folding stock…These features were developed for military weapons to make them more effective and efficient at killing people in close-combat situations.”

Feinstein, with photos of Sandy Hook victims behind her, argued that the U.S. has “witnessed an increased number of these mass killings” and called semi-automatic “assault weapons” the one “common thread running through these mass shootings.” She says the gun ban is needed in order to prevent future tragedies.

“Sadly, [Newtown] is not an anomaly,” Feinstein said. “We have witnessed an increased number of these mass killings. The one common thread running through these mass shootings — from Aurora, Colorado, to Tucson, Arizona, to Blacksburg, Virginia — is that the gunman used a military-style semi-automatic assault weapon or a large capacity magazine to inflict unspeakable terror.”

But do the facts support Feinstein’s argument?

Let’s start with the claim that mass killings are on the rise in the United States. According to the Associated Press, those who study mass shootings say they are not becoming more common.

“There is no pattern, there is no increase,” says criminologist James Allen Fox of Boston’s Northeastern University, who has been studying the subject since the 1980s, spurred by a rash of mass shootings in post offices.

Grant Duwe, a criminologist with the Minnesota Department of Corrections who has written a history of mass murders in America, said that while mass shootings rose between the 1960s and the 1990s, they actually dropped in the 2000s. And mass killings actually reached their peak in 1929, according to his data. He estimates that there were 32 in the 1980s, 42 in the 1990s and 26 in the first decade of the century.

Chances of being killed in a mass shooting, he says, are probably no greater than being struck by lightning.

“Without minimizing the pain and suffering of the hundreds…who have been victimized in senseless attacks, the facts say clearly that [there] has been no increase in mass killings,” Fox wrote. When clusters of incidents occur close together, he added, that likely reflects a mixture of copycatting and coincidence.

Many anti-gun advocates have noted that six of the 12 deadliest shootings in U.S. history have occurred since 2007, with the Newtown massacre ranking second on that list. However, mass killings, in fact, peaked in 1929.

Feinstein also argued that banning so-called “assault weapons” would help decrease mass shootings.

A study by the University of Pennsylvania concluded that the old assault weapons ban was undermined because it is difficult to define what an “assault weapon” actually is and there were already so many in circulation. The study also concluded that the law appeared to have little effect on gun violence overall, most likely because rifles are used in a small percentage of gun crimes.

Consider this, hands and feet, knifes, shotguns, and handguns all killed more people than rifles in 2010. According to FBI data, 358 people were killed by rifles that year, half that of people who were killed by “hands and feet.”

Finally, Feinstein argued that semi-automatic “assault weapons” were the “common thread” in mass shootings. While Newtown shooter Adam Lanza reportedly used a semi-automatic rifle during his rampage, Aurora shooter James Holmes’ AR-15 reportedly jammed. Holmes also had two Glock pistols and a shotgun, according to reports.

Tucson shooter Jared Loughner reportedly used a Glock 19 pistol with an extended 30-round magazine. All magazines with more than 10 rounds would be banned under Feinstein’s bill.

These are just a few examples, however, to insist that only so-called “assault weapons” are used in mass shootings would not be accurate.

In a previous Blaze report, Jordan Hunter, director of marketing for Daniel Defense, said a semi-automatic rifle is not the weapon most commonly used in mass shootings.

“We tracked 62 mass shootings wherein 5 or more people were either shot or killed from the early 1980’s to now; 41 times pistols were used, 12 times shotguns or some type of hunting-style rifle was used, and 9 times semi-automatic rifles were used (14 percent),” Hunter told TheBlaze.

Overall, Feinstein’s claims — the basis of her gun ban — don’t appear to hold up under scrutiny.

However, it may be important to note that Sen. Feinstein’s bill refers to certain types of handguns and shotguns as “assault weapons.”

Take a look at the full list of weapons that would be banned under the “Assault Weapons Ban of 2013.”

Conservative podcast host and comedian Steven Crowder sent his producer, Jared, undercover to infiltrate a local Antifa group, and in doing so, captured those involved in the movement doling out weapons and discussing violence.

The investigation was launched ahead of a speaking engagement Wednesday by Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

Crowder said his team has been “infiltrating this organization for a long time.” He released the footage on Thursday.

What’s in the video?

A woman is shown in the first 10 seconds of the video describing movements of the group.

“The idea is plainclothes and hard tactics,” she explained. “I don’t think they’ll know what hit them. Because they’re not prepared for what we’re planning.”

Jared also filmed several members of Antifa and pressed them for information on what they were planning ahead of Shapiro’s speech.

They admitted that they were considering using various weapons against those who opposed them, including an “assault weapon,” a “sawed-off shotgun,” and a “regular rifle.”

That’s the moment in the video that they handed Jared an ice pick and directed him to the nearest military supply store to buy a “Ka-Bar,” which is a very large combat knife.

Throughout the video, many of the group’s “tactics” are revealed, including an encrypted messaging app, which allows members to communicate effectively and under the radar.

One of the group members even boasts about the arsenal of weapons he has in his vehicle, “in case the s**t hit the fan.”

Crowder concludes the narrated video by zeroing in on the media and their lack of response to the footage. According to Crowder, not one outlet was interested in the tape.

What happened after the video was filmed?

After Crowder and Jared reviewed the footage, they turned it into university police — who were in the loop on Crowder and Jared’s project — and thanked them for their service.

However, Crowder reported that there was a large entity that had no interest in the footage: the media.

Crowder instead shared the footage on YouTube, and just a day after the video was released, one of the Antifa members on the tape contacted him to file a privacy complaint.

He also spoke with Shapiro, and with him, marveled at the media’s lack of interest in this story.

“Not a single news agency,” Crowder said. “Not one.”

Shapiro lauded their coverage and said, “You guys did more undercover journalistic work than any of these major outlets.”"

Whether the threat comes from Hezbollah to the north, Hamas to the south, or Iran from the east, there are many scenarios that could lead to an outbreak of hostilities this year.

Of course, Israel’s storied military– the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)– comprises the most potent fighting force in the region, which is sure to make most enemies think twice. A large part of that combat prowess is due to world class training and discipline, but the Israelis also have some of the best war fighting gear outside of the U.S.

So we at the Blaze put together a primer on the latest and greatest in Israeli guns.

They are made by Israel Weapons Industries, formerly known as Israel Military Industries, which considers itself one of the world’s leaders in combat-tested small arms. IWI touts its cutting edge family of rifles and pistols, which include, as it states:

“The innovative TAVOR family of Assault Rifles, the ultimate two caliber X95 (Assault Rifle & SMG), the reliable NEGEV Light Machine Gun family, the well-known GALIL Assault Rifle family… the legendary UZI SMG (Mini, Micro and Uzi Pro) and the acclaimed JERICHO family of pistols.”

There are too many to list each individual model here (for those of you who really want a deep dive, the IWI site is an excellent resource) but we have picked out the latest and greatest of the IWI small arms arsenal. Enjoy.

1) The Negev Machine Gun

The NEGEV is a light and technologically advanced machine gun that is very reliable under adverse and extreme conditions such as mud, dirt and snow. Its current variants are the Negev, Negev SF, and Negev 7 (NG-7).

This family of rifles has seen action all over the world. The Negev takes either 5.56mm or 7.62mm ammunition with an open bolt LMG that can be fed by a belt, drum or magazine. Among its most useful features is the semi-automatic safety which makes the Negev a safer weapon in close quarters battle.

The folks over at the Firearm blog pulled out this video clip to give you a fuller sense of the brand new Negev 7 (NG-7’s) capabilities in action, courtesy of YouTube:

2) Galil Sniper and Assault Rifles

The Galil family of rifles consists of multipurpose personal weapons for infantry use. The basic Galil is light weight, air cooled, gas-operated and magazine-fed.

The Galil was first developed over 30 years ago and has been in use ever since. Today the micro Galil has become a popular variant for Israeli police and law enforcement agencies around the globe.

3) Tavor Assault Rifles

There are a whole series of weapons in the Tavor family of bullpup rifles, including the TAR, CTAR, STAR, and GTAR variants.

The Tavor serves as the IDF’s main service weapon, and was developed in close cooperation with the IDF. Among its biggest selling points are high reliability and accuracy under extreme and adverse weather conditions.

The Tavor family are compact rifles with a long barrel and are completely ambidextrous. State-of-the-art sighting systems can be affixed directly to the barrel.

4) The X-95 Family

The X-95 family of bull pup assault rifles was designed for Israel’s special operation units. Like the Tavor, it also boasts high reliability and accuracy under extreme conditions as well as increased hit probability during exertion.

The X-95 has a 30 round capacity, can be equipped with a silencer, has a detachable barrel, and with the aid of a conversion kit, can be turned into a 9mm caliber submachine gun.

Here is a video that shows the durability of the X-95, courtesy of YouTube:

5) UZI SMG

You can’t talk about Israeli weapons without mentioning the world famous Uzi. The first one was created in 1950, and it has since been exported to over 70 countries and has been more widely used than any submachine gun (SMG) in history.

Since those early days, the Uzi family of weapons has expanded dramatically. It has been modified and optimized to meet a variety of personal defense and specialized assault needs, depending on the mission set.

Today, the Mini and Micro UZI versions are very popular weapons, developed for special military units and police entities such as anti-terror teams."

However, that couldn’t be farther from the truth.

What are they saying?

The New York Daily News, a notoriously liberal newspaper, pushed the claim on its front cover on Saturday. “Trained By The NRA: School shooter excelled in marksmanship program sponsored by gun group,” the cover said.

Meanwhile, progressive outlet Think Progress further claimed: “The NRA donated $10,000 to help train the Parkland shooting suspect to use a rifle.”

At face value, the outlets appear to position the National Rifle Association as culpable in the horrific shooting. But in reality, the NRA had nothing to do with the shooting or the shooter.

What’s the truth?

What the stories don’t mention is that NRA monies helped fund a program for the JROTC program the shooter was a member of when he attended high school. The NRA gave the school’s JROTC program more than $10,000 in non-cash assistance to help build its air-rifle team.

The Associated Press explains:



Records show that the Stoneman Douglas JROTC program received $10,827 in non-cash assistance from the NRA’s fundraising and charitable arm in 2016, when Cruz was on the squad

What the NRA did not do — in any way, shape or form — is help “train” the shooter.

The NRA provides millions of dollars, via its Friends of the NRA program, to youth programs nationwide each year to build enthusiasm for shooting sports.

To that end, the air-rifles that JROTC shooting teams use are incomparable to AR-15s. They are lightweight and shoot small pellets propelled by compressed air in a controlled environment, mostly in small indoor ranges. JROTC shooting programs, and the air-rifles they use, do not “train” a person to use an AR-15, which fires a 5.56mm bullet at extremely high velocity.

What story did the outlets fail to tell?

Those of the school’s quick-thinking JROTC cadets who helped save dozens of students."

Here’s what happened

Following the horrific mass shooting in Florida, calls for the gun-control and attacks on the NRA have reached a fever pitch. But this time, according to Pat Gray, things are different. This isn’t the same as Sandy Hook Elementary because, according to Pat, these high school kids have been fed Democratic Party talking points that shift the blame on Republicans, the NRA, and law-abiding gun owners — not the killer himself, or a societal breakdown mind you.

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

Forget that the FBI dropped the ball or the fact that the killer lied in his background check or the fact that simple security measures that don’t impede our Second Amendment rights exist because come hell or high water, they’re going after the NRA and Republicans with the help of Democrats.

The interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation”



If you tuned in to Monday’s episode of “Pat Gray Unleashed” (and why wouldn’t you?), you probably noticed Pat was particularly riled up after listening to an interview the victims did with CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Throughout the interview, they came hard for Republicans, threatened midterm elections and vowed to march on Washington to call for an to gun violence and politicians funded by the NRA.

blaze189,blaze,['Jason Howerton'],2013-01-28 00:00:00,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/01/28/private-buyers-invade-seattle-gun-buyback-offer-cash-for-firearms-that-would-otherwise-be-destroyed-by-police,"The Seattle Police Department held its first gun buyback event since the 1990s this weekend, offering people gift cards for their firearms. However, dozens of private buyers showed up in an effort to acquire the guns using the so-called gun show loophole, which allows guns to be sold without a background check.

Hundreds of people showed up Saturday morning to give their rifles and shotguns as well as semi-automatic rifles to police in exchange for gift cards worth $100 and $200 respectively, KING 5 reports. The police planned to destroy the guns and use them as rebar in local construction projects.

Meanwhile, a number of private buyers set up a makeshift gun show-style event and offered cold hard cash for guns and even lured customers with donuts.

“I pay cash, I don’t give Amazon gift cards,” one dealer told a gun seller.

“It’s a historical firearm, I would hate to see it get destroyed. I’ll give you $100 cash for it,” another buyer offered a gun owner.

Many held up signs that let gun owners know they would pay cash for unwanted firearms.

“I’d rather see it turned back into the gun community used to promote shooting sports,” one man told KING 5.

Private buyer Mason Vranish reportedly purchased a rocket launcher from of a man who had come to exchange it for a gift card, but officers confiscated the weapon on the suspicion that it had been stolen from the U.S. military.

“Their reason was even though it was single time use item it is still military property concern that a soldier had stolen it from the base or whatever and it wasn’t theirs to own… so it somehow ended up in the civilian market illegally,” Vranish told KING 5.

Seattle Police Chief John Diaz said he would “prefer” gun owners not sell their guns to private buyers at the gun buyback event.

“Some are looking at this as a money making operation,” he told KPLU-TV. “But I think that is very few of the people. Most people are here in the spirit of wanting to do something because of some of the tragedies that we’ve seen in our country and in our own city.”

The buyback program is funded by donations from Amazon of $30,000, the Seattle Police Foundation of $25,000 and local businesses of more than $118,000. In the first two hours of the event, police say they gave our $35,000 in gift cards for 160 guns.

In a separate gun buyback event, Mercer County officials say more than 2,500 weapons were turned in for cash during a two-day gun buyback program in Trenton, N.J.

The Trenton gun buyback surpassed one in Camden in December that netted more than 1,100 weapons.

Mercer County residents received $25 to $250 for each firearm depending on type, condition and legality.

About $100,000 was budgeted but because of the huge turnout, the amount spent is expected to be well over double that. Some participants were given vouchers after money ran out Saturday.
