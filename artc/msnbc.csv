msnbc7,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-republican-connects-gun-control-nazi-holocaust,"Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) has an unfortunate track record of making cringe-worthy comments. The most striking example that comes to mind was a story from four years ago when the Republican congressman spoke at an Alaskan high school, less than a week after a student had committed suicide.

Young proceeded to use “salty language,” told a story “that involved flying to Paris to get drunk,” compared marriage equality to “bull sex,” and said the boy who committed suicide must have lacked support from his friends and family. Asked to explain himself after the appearance, the GOP lawmaker added that welfare may have also led to the student’s death.

But as offensive as that was, Young may have topped himself.

Jewish people would have been able to fend off the Nazis if not for gun-control laws imposed by the Third Reich, Rep. Don Young, a Republican from Alaska, argued last week. “How many millions were shot and killed because they were unarmed?” Young asked at an event in Juneau, Alaska, before answering his own question. “Fifty million in Russia because their citizens were unarmed. How many Jews were put into the ovens because they were unarmed?”

If this seems at all familiar, it’s probably because Young isn’t the first Republican to suggest gun control contributed to the Nazi Holocaust. During his presidential campaign in 2015, Ben Carson argued, “]T]he likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.”

Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, explained at the time that Carson “has a right to his views on gun control, but the notion that Hitler’s gun-control policy contributed to the Holocaust is historically inaccurate.” Greenblatt added that “gun control did not cause the Holocaust.”

This isn’t especially complicated: the Nazis had a vast war machine. To believe Jews in Europe could’ve prevented the Holocaust with pistols and hunting rifles is madness.

Indeed, this whole idea that an armed populace is a free populace is belied by reality. Plenty of modern democracies, for example, have created all kinds of restrictions on consumer access to firearms, and none of them have slipped into dictatorial dystopias.

Iraq under Saddam Hussein’s rule, on the other hand, had one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world – but it didn’t stop Iraqis from living under tyranny.

I understand that many Republicans oppose new gun reforms, but perhaps they can leave the Holocaust out of their talking points?

Postscript: In response to the controversy over his remarks, Don Young’s office issued a written statement that said, “He was not implying that an armed Jewish population would have been able to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust.” One sentence later, that same statement added, “A defenseless people are left up to the mercy of its leaders.”"
msnbc8,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-plan-keep-restrictions-gun-research-place,"The day after the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a longtime opponent of new gun measures, said Congress needs to “take a breath and collect the facts.” The Republican leader added, “We don’t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.”

At face value, that seemed like an entirely sensible approach. After all, who could be against collecting facts and data before engaging in policymaking?

The trouble, of course, is that there’s already a federal restriction in place to prevent officials from collecting facts and data – and Politico reports today that congressional Republicans intend to leave it in place, despite recent developments.

Republicans are intent on preserving the so-called Dickey amendment, which prohibits the CDC from advocating on gun control, POLITICO’s Jennifer Haberkorn reports. […] Opponents say the Dickey amendment has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun deaths. But Republicans say they don’t want to add additional controversy to the upcoming spending bills by eliminating it.

I don’t imagine most Americans have heard of the Dickey amendment, but it’s an important policy. As Vox explained this week, “Congress has made it effectively impossible for federally funded researchers to study gun violence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health are the gold standards for public health research in the United States. But they are effectively barred from studying a problem that kills more than 35,000 people in a year.”

Let’s back up and review the context to all of this. The Washington Post reported last fall:

[O]ne reason the positions are so intractable is that no one really knows what works to prevent gun deaths. Gun-control research in the United States essentially came to a standstill in 1996. After 21 years, the science is stale. “In the area of what works to prevent shootings, we know almost nothing,” Mark Rosenberg, who, in the mid-1990s, led the CDC’s gun-violence research efforts, said shortly after the San Bernardino shooting in 2015. In 1996, the Republican-majority Congress threatened to strip funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unless it stopped funding research into firearm injuries and deaths. The National Rifle Association accused the CDC of promoting gun control. As a result, the CDC stopped funding gun-control research – which had a chilling effect far beyond the agency, drying up money for almost all public health studies of the issue nationwide.

As regular readers may recall, it’s common knowledge that the NRA and its allies have fought to kill any kind of restrictions on firearm ownership. What’s less recognized is the fact that the gun lobby also helped block basic data collection, to the point that there’s “no current scientific consensus about guns and violence,” in large part because the NRA “has been able to neutralize empirical cases for control.”

Nearly 20 years after this policy took effect, the principal author of that policy, Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey, conceded that he has “regrets” over the policy that came to be known as the Dickey Amendment.

But the policy remains in place anyway.

There’s been some chatter lately about possible limits of the Dickey policy. Alex Azar, Donald Trump’s new Secretary of Health and Human Services, suggested his agency may be able to do some research on guns and public health, current restrictions notwithstanding.

Those comments have led GOP lawmakers to believe they can turn their attention elsewhere and leave the Dickey amendment in place, presumably indefinitely. What’s unclear, however, is how far HHS can go and whether new legislation is necessary.

Watch this space.

Postscript: It’s worth emphasizing that there is some private research on guns and public health, including a new report from the Rand Corp. which was just released. The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent had a good piece this morning on the latest findings."

msnbc11,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/was-gun-used-crime,"On Sunday in New Orleans, Laderika Smith, 28, returned from the store to find her five-year-old daughter bloodied and lying on the bedroom floor with a gunshot wound to her head. The girl soon died. Her mother has been charged with Relative Cruelty to a Juvenile. She has not yet entered a plea.

“It is all too common,” Doctor Gary A. Smith, president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance, told msnbc. “Children are curious. They watch TV cartoons and a make-believe world,” he added. When kids see guns, “they don’t recognize the danger.”

Smith’s daughter fatally shot herself with a .38 revolver that her mother kept in the home, as Smith admitted to New Orleans police. For decades, a .38 revolver was the firearm most commonly used in crimes, according to ATF studies including a July 2000 report, which is the last time that the ATF issued any comprehensive report. Instead, for more than 12 years– since the first inauguration of President George W. Bush in 2001–the ATF has provided little or no such national data to the public.

“Why was it stopped for over 10 years?” ATF Acting Deputy Chief of Public Affairs Donna Sellers told msnbc. “I cannot really answer why a decision was made to stop publishing that information,” she added. “The decision was made this year to increase transparency and provide the public with more thorough information on crime guns.”

On June 19, the ATF published its findings for Firearms Trace Data for 2012. Data for previous years posted on the ATF website’s statistics page include no more than very general information for each state along with the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands, making in difficult to discern national trends of the types of firearms used in crimes, or where they were bought.

The data for 2012 includes nationally aggregated summaries including “Firearms Types” and “Top Calibers” of weapons “Recovered and Traced” in crimes, along with data on where the weapons used in crimes were purchased and where they ended up, and how long they have been in circulation.

“Tracing crime guns provides critical information that assists domestic and international law enforcement,” Sellers told msnbc.

Most “crime guns,” as ATF officials call them, end up in circulation for just over 11 years. Another trend that emerges from the data is that a .38 caliber handgun has become only the fifth most common caliber of firearm used in crimes (19,425) in 2012, after the 9 millimeter (42,560) of roughly the same size, the smaller .22 caliber handgun (34,130) long ago dubbed as a “Saturday night special,” and the far more powerful .40 caliber handgun (20,674), and the 12-gauge shotgun (20,606), according to ATF statistics now available online.

The ATF’s change to release firearms tracing information is consistent with White House policies since the Newtown tragedy. In January, President Obama signed a 23-point gun control order involving various U.S. agencies to expand their reporting and other activities involving firearms and violence.

Another new trend is that pistols were the most common type of weapon used in crimes in 2012, consistent with the rising use of 9 millimeter handguns in crimes (the overwhelming majority of which are pistols), and the increasingly commercial popularity of 9 millimeter pistols like Austrian-made Glock. U.S. authorities seized a total of 119,273 pistols and 46,037 revolvers from crime scenes in 2012, according to ATF figures published last week.

The common reason given by authorities for seizing firearms from suspects was for illegal possession of a weapon at 61,501 cases, the ATF statistics show. A total of 17,239 firearms were seized for an offense involving a weapon. The average age of the suspect from which a firearm was seized was lowest in the two U.S. territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands at 28, and the District of Columbia at 29, and highest in South Dakota at 45, and Hawaii at 47.

But the flow of firearms across state lines may be the most important statistic to emerge at a time when Congress is continuing to discuss the possibility of increased gun regulations including anti-trafficking legislation. Some states supplied a great many guns used in crimes across the nation. West Virginia was the source of 1,330 crime guns in 2012, nearly half of which were used in crimes in other states.

Other states supplied few guns but ended up being the place where many guns were used in crimes. New York supplied 2,153 guns used in crimes across the nation, and ended up having more than twice as many firearms, 4,850, recovered in crimes inside the state."
msnbc12,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/army-veteran-its-time-vets-speak-about-guns,"Every member of the United States military swears an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For most service members, that oath doesn’t expire when they take off their uniforms and become veterans. Army veteran Christopher Mintz demonstrated as much last month when he charged—unarmed—toward a gunman at an Oregon community college. However, Mintz’s laudable actions overshadowed the story of a different veteran also on campus that day.

John Parker, an Air Force veteran, was in another location on the Umpqua campus when he learned of the active shooter. Parker was carrying a concealed firearm but chose to not engage the shooter. Parker later explained that “not knowing where SWAT was on their response time, they wouldn’t know who we were, and if we had our guns ready to shoot, they’d think we were the bad guys.”

Firearms have the ability to take life, and in the military we take that seriously. Unfortunately, many of our lawmakers don’t.

The discipline Parker exercised didn’t come part and parcel with being a gun owner. Rather, Parker did the right thing because of his military training. Like every member of the military, Parker was trained on how to properly carry, clear, disassemble, clean, reassemble, load, aim, discharge, and safely store any firearm for which he was accountable. Because of his tactical training, Parker knew that, oftentimes, proper use of a firearm means not shooting.

The military asks this much of anyone allowed to possess a firearm, because firearms are lethal. Firearms have the ability to take life, and in the military we take that seriously. Unfortunately, many of our lawmakers don’t, and it’s time that veterans step forward and have our voices heard on the matter.

I too swore an oath to defend this country. Now, I am asking my fellow veterans help protect our citizens against firearm-related fatalities and injuries. Veterans – especially those who are gun owners – must speak up. Veterans must speak as voters, advocates, safety trainers, and examples of responsible gun owners. When it comes to firearms, people trust us because we’ve been trained extensively on how to use a lethal weapon responsibly.

Veterans should think back on how much training it took to earn the right to carry a weapon in the military. We should at least promote similar common-sense measures for the people who are allowed to carry guns in the neighborhoods where our kids play. Veterans know what common sense gun laws are, because they look a lot like the rules we used in the military to keep ourselves safe.

view photo essay Honoring those who serve Scenes from Veterans Day events around the country.

In the military, weapons do not get lost or stolen. Losing track of your weapon in an unthinkable scenario with consequences to match. As veterans, we need to tell lawmakers to make sure all that gun owners maintain accountability or face consequences for lost guns.

More Americans have been killed by firearms in the last half century than all fatalities in all of our country’s wars, combined. If veterans are not holding all gun owners to some of the basic gun safety standards that we learned in the military, then we are failing to uphold our oath. Many of us fought for our country overseas; now veterans have a chance to speak up and start fighting to save lives here at home.

msnbc13,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/look-back-gun-control-history,"In 1994, the Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. The key factor in the major Democratic loss pointed to the federal assault weapons ban that was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994. A part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the assault weapons ban banned semiautomatic weapons from having two or more military features, and placed a ten-year ban on the sale of assault weapons and large ammunition magazines. The ‘94 election was significant because gun control became a deciding factor in the election and wedged two ideologically distant parties further apart.

In 2004, a report to the U.S. Justice Department that assessed the impact of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban on gun markets and gun violence found that “… the most important feature of military-style weapons may be their ability to accept [large-capacity magazines], and this feature has been addressed by the LCM ban and the LCMM rifle ban. Whether changing other features of military-style firearms will produce measurable benefits is unknown.”

Earlier this week, President Obama and the House Democratic Caucus vowed to reduce gun violence by focusing on the following four areas–closing background check loopholes, banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, providing schools with safety resources, and increasing access to mental health services. But the history of gun legislation has shown that one bill does not prevent another massacre from occurring and fuels a recurring pattern.

After a mass shooting, political leaders call for action, then introduce bills that drag out legislative battles, and a law riddled with loopholes finally gets signed. But manufacturers have found ways around even those laws that are deemed legislative milestones: fter the law defined what an assault weapon was, manufacturing companies came up with modified designs and built weapons that became somewhat mainstream. Because the assault weapons ban did not outlaw the sale of semiautomatic rifles and handguns that had been manufactured before 1994, the country quickly discovered that the ban wasn’t all that effective.

For example, Connecticut’s assault weapons ban allowed the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle Nancy Lanza purchased and kept in her home, easily accessible to her unstable son. He used the gun to shoot 20 children and six educators dead. The state ban was modeled after the 1994 federal assault weapons ban.

Mother Jones researched the gun violence of the past 30 years and found that since 1982, there have been at least 62 mass shootings. Twenty-five of these shootings occurred since 2006, and seven took place in 2012. What’s striking is that most of the killers obtained their guns legally.

Generally, the gun control versus the gun rights debate exists focuses on an individual’s right to bear arms and the government’s obligation to counter violence and crime. The wording of the Second Amendment–specifically “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”–seems unambiguous but in fact the interpretation of the law has evolved.

In the 18th and 19th century, armed civilians used guns as a means of survival and protection from foreign enemies. As westward expansion occurred, frontiersman used guns to arm themselves against Native Americans and potential threats in the uncharted territories. Then in 1927, Congress outlawed the mail-order sale of guns or concealed firearms after mob violence broke out from Prohibition. However, mob violence escalated so quickly with the usage of Tommy guns in gang wars that Congress passed the National Firearms Act of 1934, which taxed firearms under 18 inches and on machine guns and required gun registration. This act became the first federal gun-control law.

President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination spurred leaders to pass the Gun Control Act of 1968. This act prohibited the sale of guns to convicted felons, drug users and the mentally ill, and also required firearm dealers to obtain licenses and imposed interstate sale restrictions. The law also raised the age to legally purchase a handgun to 21.

Although the ATF was granted expanded power, the NRA became increasingly agitated, prompting the gun lobby to create a new lobbying branch, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which aimed to nullify the 1968 law. In 1986, President Reagan signed the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act which eased the penalties from the 1968 law, banned a federal registry of gun owners, and disallowed the ATF’s power to inspect gun dealers.

But the gun culture changed again in 1981 when John Hinckley, Jr. tried to assassinate President Reagan and nearly killed his press secretary James Brady instead. He and his wife Sarah became activists. “You can begin to see a sea change of attitudes during this time,” said Sarah Brady. “The NRA was fighting against the cop-killing bullets and plastic guns, and we got into an alliance with law enforcement and we just got together and said, ‘What’s the first thing we should do?’ And we all said, ‘Background checks.’”

In 1991, Ronald Reagan said at a ceremony at George Washington University: “I want to tell all of you here today something that I’m not sure you know. You do know that I’m a member of the NRA. My position on right to bear arms is well known. But I want you to know something else. And I’m going to say it in clear unmistakable language. I support the Brady bill and I urge the Congress to enact it.”

The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed in 1993. This law created a system for background checks of licensed gun buyers, which was maintained by the FBI.

Although this national system prevented convicted criminals and potentially violent people from purchasing handguns, a loophole existed. The 1993 act did not cover private sales from one individual to another. In 1993, 57% of people surveyed by the Pew Research Center said that controlling gun ownership was more important than protecting gun rights; in 2012, the percentage went down to 47%.

In 2004, President George W. Bush said, “I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don’t get in the hands of people that shouldn’t have them.”

Ten years earlier, his father wrote a letter to the NRA just two weeks after the Oklahoma City bombing, resigning as a life member of the NRA. And while Ronald Reagan was the Governor of California, he stated his view on guns in May of 1967 when Black Panther Party members walked into the California Statehouse carrying rifles to protest a gun-control bill. “There’s no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons.”

Former Nixon speechwriter, William Safire, wrote in 1999 how Nixon felt about gun control. “His on-the-record reply: ”Guns are an abomination.’ Free from fear of gun owners’ retaliation at the polls, he favored making handguns illegal and requiring licenses for hunting rifles.”

Now, with the recent Newtown shootings, the issue of gun control and gun rights has returned to national prominence. Americans purchased a record number of guns in 2012 and gun makers have reported a record high in demand. Firearm sales have surged recently as politicians have urged stricter gun laws and a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban following the shooting in Connecticut.

TIME published a list of the worst mass shootings in the last 50 years, excluding Newtown; 15 of the 25 worst mass shootings took place in the United States. Recent research from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center linked guns and homicide and found evidence that shows that more guns means more homicides. Internationally, America is a much more violent country, as Duke University’s Kieran Healy points out in this graph.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicates that 56% believe that the laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter, as opposed to 42% who believe laws should be less strict or kept the same. This 56% number is the highest since 2006, but is still less than the 60-70% who supported stricter laws during the 1990s, including when the federal assault weapons ban was enacted in 1994. Additionally, 69% said that being able to purchase assault and military style firearms played “a good or great role in recent mass shootings”; 38% said it played little to no role. Lastly, 59% said that the availability of high capacity ammunition clips played a good or great role and 39% said it played little to no role.

The poll presents an even larger divide between Republicans and Democrats. The Republican House seems unlikely to budge on gun control, but perhaps a reminder of the Nixon-Reagan-Bush stances on gun control could prove useful."

msnbc17,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-ed-show/new-gun-laws-kentucky-surprise-just-about,"Months before the murders of 20 first graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied the Kentucky legislature to pass one of the most liberal gun laws in the nation. Only 10 lawmakers in both houses voted against the bill last summer and it quietly took effect at the beginning of this year. In fact, the law took effect so quietly it took transportation officials, security guards and firefighters by surprise.

One of the best investigative reporters I’ve ever worked with, Duane Pohlman, has put together a series of stories for WLKY/Hearst about how this new gun legislation has turned Kentucky into what one lawmaker called the “new wild west”. They’re worth watching. For instance, people can bring guns, but not knives into Louisville’s City Hall.

Guns are legal on public buses, according to the state lawmaker who wrote it, though transportation officials have decided to enforce a gun ban anyway.

Firefighters in special districts are given extra rights to carry concealed weapons. Duane talked to one fire chief who explains why that could be seriously dangerous. EMTs can carry too.

I asked Duane a few questions about the law and his reports:

Ed Show: What inspired you to investigate the change in the gun law? Anything beyond fully reporting on the basic change in the law? Duane Pohlman: It wasn’t much to investigate the law and its effect, but getting clear answers was difficult. The law was overwhelmingly and quietly passed by the Kentucky legislature in the Summer of ’12, with backing from the NRA. It was so quiet that many of the public officials and entities were caught off guard when it took effect this January. I received several calls from fire chiefs and mid-level managers who were in disbelief when they were informed. They called me to get some answers. That led to this simple series of stories laying out the law and its impacts. Ed Show: I was surprised that the guard in your first story wasn’t armed with a gun, that knives were not allowed, and that one fire chief is worried about guns on his own crew. What, if anything, surprised you about the response to the law change? Duane Pohlman: Everything! I could not believe this had passed and passed so overwhelmingly (only 10 votes opposed in both houses). I was surprised that Kentucky’s constitution provided more protections than the US Constitution, allowing guns to be carried for personal and property protection. I was surprised by the lack of caring about allowing open guns in urban areas. Above all, I was stunned by the lack of media attention to this issue, which I believe led to it quietly being passed. Ed Show: You reported that public transportation does not allow concealed-carry. If some organizations make exceptions to Kentucky’s law, does it become hard for regular citizens to figure out where they can and cannot carry? Duane Pohlman: It will be hard for citizens to know where they can bring their guns because, frankly, the political leaders are still scurrying for answers. For instance, TARC, the mass transit system in Louisville, is continuing its ban on guns on its buses, though the Executive Director tells me TARC leaders are still researching the legal ramifications of continuing the ban. In addition, I have been told by other leaders they truly don’t know how it applies in places where public gatherings occur. About the only places guaranteed (for now) not to be gun free zones in Kentucky are schools, colleges and universities, and prisons. Again, many of the leaders say they were simply caught off guard when the law took effect and are still sorting it all out. The author of Kentucky’s new gun law, State Rep. Bob Damron, D-Nicholasville, makes it clear. “ I feel more comfortable when citizens have a weapon to protect themselves because, chances are, they’ll protect me as well,” he told me. Fact is many, many people in this part of the country (and other parts) agree.



Kentucky is clearly out-pacing the rest of the nation in allowing citizens to carry guns in public places. The question is, will other states follow?"
msnbc18,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/free-guns-vulnerable-women-houston,"One Texas group wants to stop violence against women–by giving away free guns.

While the national debate over gun control rages on, the nonprofit Armed Citizen Project has begun training and arming single women and single moms with pump action shotguns. On its website, the group describes itself as “dedicated to training and arming vulnerable women” and “fighting the war on women, one free shotgun at a time.” The group is also geared toward providing residents of high-crime neighborhoods with firearms at no cost as long as they complete a 4-to-5 hour firearms class and pass a background check.

“We’re empowering citizens and creating new and responsible gun owners,” Kyle Coplen, the group’s 29-year-old founder, told msnbc on Monday. “Criminals have no intention of dying in your hallway. We think that society should use their fear to deter crime.” An early 2013 visit to the vandalized home of a World War II vet inspired Coplen to create the project, he says.

Armed Citizen Project started equipping Houston-area women with free firearms in March, then rolled out phase two, centered around the city’s Oak Forest neighborhood, in early May. It appears to be a relatively small operation at this stage–they have given away only 35 guns to date–but it’s a message that may resonate despite studies to the contrary.

Coplen argues that guns help protect citizens from potentially dangerous home invaders–an aspect that appeals to women who tend to be physically smaller than the stereotypical burly male robber. “Generally, women who live alone have reached out to us for a reason,” he said. “Having a firearm in the home is a forced equalizer.”

However, a recent study conducted by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center suggested women are in fact less safe with guns in the home. It found that women living in states with more accessibility to guns are at a greater risk for violent death via “unintentional gun deaths, suicides and homicide, particularly firearm suicides and firearm homicides.”

A 2003 study from the University of Pennsylvania indicated that a woman with a gun in her home was nearly three times more likely to be murdered compared to a woman without a gun in the home.

Coplen said the reaction from the community has been “overwhelmingly positive,” especially from law enforcement officials in Texas. Not that that matters, he added: “I really have no interest from hearing elected officials on this.”

Houston City Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who represents Oak Forest, does not see the increased distribution of guns as an effective tool to prevent gun crime. “Statistics show that guns are more likely to be involved in an unintentional shooting than in a self-defense shooting,” said Cohen in an emailed statement to msnbc. “That being said, while I support the Second Amendment, I think we should focus on common-sense solutions such as universal background checks.”

Cohen said her offices received several concerned calls about the program. The group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense requested a formal meeting with her.

msnbc reached out to Houston Mayor Annise Parker’s office for a comment, but received no response.

Before launching in Houston, Coplen and his team pored over crime stats to pick a neighborhood and reached out to community members with an old-fashioned, snail mail postcard–a model they hope to replicate elsewhere.

The Armed Citizen Project has ambitious plans to expand into other cities soon: Tucson, Dallas, San Antonio, Indianapolis Detroit, Chicago, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Atlanta."

msnbc24,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/lindsey-graham-his-ar-15-and-the-rodney-kin,"Lawless behavior in the wake of the Rodney King riots—including “marauding gangs” that were “raping” the women of Koreatown—justifies the need for an AR-15 assault rifle in your home arsenal, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham.

The South Carolina Republican delivered that assertion, during Wednesday’s Senate judiciary committee hearing on gun violence in America while challenging the notion Congress should regulate the size of firearm magazines.

Graham cited a question that came during the Google Hangout his “good friend” and vice president Joe Biden held last week on the topic of guns. “What if there’s an earthquake out here and there’s a lawless situation,” Graham said, inaccurately paraphrasing the question from video blogger Philip DeFranco.

Graham then invoked the six days of racially charged rioting that followed the Rodney King verdict and resulted in 53 deaths, thousands of arrests, and ultimately a military presence on the streets to restore calm.

“In 1992 you had the riots in Los Angeles, I think it was the King event, but you could find yourself in this country in a lawless environment through a natural disaster or a riot,” Graham said, making his own jump from earthquake to race riot.

“And the story was about a place called Koreatown,” the Senator said. “There were marauding gangs going through the area, burning stores, looting and robbing,” he continued, with a pause, “and raping.”

Evidence of “marauding gangs” who were “raping” the women of Koreatown is hard to find—and may not exist at all. Two scholars who have written extensively on the Los Angeles riots, which marked a 20-year anniversary in 2012, characterized Graham’s imagery as “unfounded hyperbole” and “political theater.”

To Graham, however, this violent moment in American history 2400 miles away from South Carolina, requires big at-home firepower.

“And the vice president said, in response to—that’s why I want my AR-15 [again, an inaccurate characterization of DeFranco’s question]—he said no, you would be better off with a 12-guage shotgun. Well, that’s his opinion, and I respect it.”

Of course, he also disagrees with it.

“I have an AR-15 at home and I haven’t hurt anybody and I don’t intend to use it,” he flexed. “But I think I would be better off protecting my business or my family if there was law and order breakdown in my community, people roaming around my neighborhood to have the AR-15, and I don’t think that makes me an unreasonable person.”

The political motivation of Graham’s casual description of “marauding gangs” of rapists was further exposed in his strident defense of gun advocate Gayle Trotter, who called the AR-15 the weapon of choice for “millions” of American women and testified that women need high capacity weapons to protect themselves and their children.

“When you start telling me that I’m unreasonable for wanting that women to have more than six bullets, or to have an AR-15 with people roaming around my neighborhood, I reject the concept,” he said."
msnbc25,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/gop-group-celebrating-mlk-gun-raffle,"An Oregon County Republican Party group is raffling off an AR-15 rifle in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. and President Abraham Lincoln.

The Multnomah County Republicans announced the raffle as a celebration of “the legacy of two great Republicans who demonstrated leadership and courage” and “the denial of the rights they fought so hard against.”

Despite the Multnomah County Republicans’ claim to the contrary, King was not a Republican, and denied any party affiliation.

The raffle will be held next month at the group’s Lincoln Day Dinner, where Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s father and conservative firebrand Rafael Cruz is scheduled to speak. Cruz might have trouble with King’s legacy and ideals, were he to investigate them thoroughly, since he regularly rails against Pres. Obama’s “socialist” efforts, while King advocated a guaranteed income for the jobless and a redistribution of economic power to benefit the poor in his time.

“We are here to reaffirm our strong defense of the Second Amendment and the right to personal protection. The Bill of Rights is inviolable, despite what the gun-grabbers in Salem might try,” Multnomah County GOP Chairman Jeff Reynolds said in a statement.

The Portland-based GOP group is not the first to tout gun rights in connection with King. Last year Larry Ward, a gun activist behind Gun Appreciation Day, argued that King would have supported gun rights and that if he had owned a gun he might have prevented his own assassination.

Ward joined Rev. Al Sharpton on PoliticsNation in Jan. 2013 to debate that very issue, and Sharpton pointed out that King was in fact a staunch advocate for gun control.

“You do realize that Martin Luther King was killed by a gun and that he preached all of his life against the use of any weapons and preached turn the other cheek? So you do realize that what you said was the total antithesis to Dr. King?” Sharpton said.

Gun activists regularly point to Dr. King’s decision to apply for a concealed carry permit as a sign that he strongly supported gun rights, but a closer look reveals otherwise.

“How could I serve as one of the leaders of a nonviolent movement and at the same time use weapons of violence for my personal protection?” he wrote of that incident in his autobiography. “Coretta and I talked the matter over for several days and finally agreed that arms were no solution. We decided then to get rid of the one weapon we owned. We tried to satisfy our friends by having floodlights mounted around the house, and hiring unarmed watchmen around the clock.”

Gun activists in the Portland-area have come under fire for their gun appreciation efforts in the past. This time last year residents became agitated when two activists carried assault rifles around the city."
msnbc26,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/jared-michael-padgett-oregon-shooting,"Police have identified the gunman in Tuesday’s deadly shooting at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon as Jared Michael Padgett, a 15-year-old freshman at the school.

On Wednesday afternoon, police told reporters that Padgett arrived at the school Tuesday morning on a school bus carrying a guitar case and a duffel bag. Police said they believe the case and bag contained the weapons found with the shooter’s body – an AR-15 rifle, a semi-automatic handgun and a large knife, along with nine loaded ammunition magazines “with the capability of holding several hundred rounds.”

Police said only the AR-15 rifle was used during the attack and that Padgett was also wearing a “non-ballistic vest used for carrying ammunition and other items” and a camouflaged helmet.

According to Troutdale Police Chief Scott Anderson, after arriving at the school, Padgett entered the gym and went into the boys’ locker room, where he shot and killed 14-year-old Emilio Hoffman, also a freshman.

“We have not established any link between the shooter and the victim,” said Chief Anderson.

Anderson said after killing Hoffman, Padgett hit Reynolds High School gym teacher Todd Rispler with a “grazing wound” to the hip. According to police, Rispler then fled the locker room and made his way to the school’s office to tell his colleagues what was happening and initiate the school’s emergency lockdown procedure.

Commending Rispler and his police force, Anderson said, “I cannot emphasize enough the role that Mr. Rispler and the responding officers played in saving many, many lives yesterday.”

After leaving the gym, Padgett encountered responding officers in a school hallway, according to Anderson, and he exchanged gunfire with at least one of them before hiding in a bathroom. That is where Padgett was found by authorities dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“The shooter obtained the weapons from his family home,” Anderson told reporters. “The weapons had been secured, but he defeated the security measures.”

“At this time it would be inappropriate to discuss a possible motive for the murder,” he added."

msnbc45,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/man-shot-28-times-police-gives-thanks-after-being-freed,"At an emotional and celebratory press conference Friday, Howard Morgan, the Chicago man who was shot 28 times by police then convicted of attempted murder, maintained his innocence after having his sentence commuted earlier this week.

“Right now I’m just concentrating on clearing my name,” Morgan said, “because I’m absolutely innocent of those charges.”

Morgan was freed Monday after outgoing Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn commuted his 40-year prison sentence. He is now working with lawyers to have his conviction reversed.

“He was no criminal when I married him, and he’s no criminal now,” said Morgan’s wife, Rosalind Morgan, who led the fight for his freedom.



RELATED: Police charged with murder of homeless man

Quinn hasn’t explained the reason for his decision, which angered some police unions, as well as one of the officers wounded in the incident. But Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Morgan, said Quinn was well within his rights.

“What Governor Quinn did was not secretive or mysterious in any way,” said Crump. “It’s what the constitution of this state gives him the power to do.”

“There were thousands and thousands of people who signed the petition after they looked on the record as to what took place,” Crump added.

“What I really believe this is is an example of driving while black,” said Crump. “And we don’t need to go much further than that.”

In 2005, Morgan, a former Chicago police officer who was working as a railroad detective, was stopped by four police officers while driving the wrong way on a one-way street near his home. From there, a scuffle ensued, leading to gunfire. Police said Morgan was belligerent and fired first, while Morgan said police started firing as soon as they saw his gun, and denied firing a shot. In the end, Morgan was shot 28 times, 21 in the back, while three officers were wounded.

At a 2007 trial, Morgan was found not guilty of discharging his firearm, but there was no verdict on a charge of attempted murder. At a second trial, a jury convicted Morgan on the attempted murder charge. He was sentenced him to 40 years in prison.

Lawyers for Morgan, 63, have said key evidence was suppressed at trial, and have complained about double jeopardy.

Morgan’s supporters have said his case is an example of the kind of over-zealous policing that lately has been in the national spotlight thanks to the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and several other unarmed blacks.

But John Wrigley, one of the officers who was shot, told a local news station he has questions for Quinn.

“Why do you think he needed to be released? Why do you think he deserved to be released? Did you sit in on the trial? Did he look at the details of this case? I don’t think he did,” Wrigley said.

Morgan’s was one of 43 clemency petitions that Quinn, a Democrat, granted Monday just before leaving office."

msnbc49,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/nra-obama-will-take-your-rifle-shotgun-han,"Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association, appeared on Fox News Sunday just days after testifying during a congressional hearing on gun violence, to stoke fears that President Obama will disarm “law-abiding citizens” of their most basic weapons.

“During the campaign, when [Obama] said to people, ‘I will not take away your rifle, shotgun, handgun.’ They leafleted the country with flyers like this, ‘Obama’s not gonna take your gun,’ ‘Obama will protect gun rights,’” LaPierre said. “And now he’s trying to take away all three.”

Host Chris Wallace pushed back on LaPierre’s accusations, confirming that shotguns were never a target for tighter gun restrictions.

“Have you looked at the Feinstein bill that’s he’s supporting? That’s exactly what it does,” LaPierre fired back, referring to the renewed assault weapons ban California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced last month. The bill bans the sale and manufacturing of more than 150 types of military-style weapons, which expands on the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban that expired in 2004.

LaPierre continued: ”I think what they’ll do is they’ll turn this universal check on the law-abiding into a universal registry of law-abiding people. And law-abiding people don’t want that.”

Wallace did not let LaPierre skate by with his claims. “There’s nothing that anyone in the administration has said that indicates they’re going to have a universal registry,” he said.

“And Obamacare wasn’t a tax until they needed it to be a tax,” LaPierre retorted.

“I don’t think you can trust these…” he added, trailing off.

In another heated exchange, the Fox News host lashed out at LaPierre for suggesting that President Obama’s children were under the same kind of threat as other children in America.

“That’s ridiculous and you know it, sir.”"
msnbc50,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/hunting-and-high-capacity-magazines,"The news from Colorado is now joined by a discussion of gun laws. Senator John McCain responded to a question Monday about having a gun law debate in the Senate:

Q: Reporter: Can you support some limits on guns and still support the second amendment because the NRA seems to suggest that you can’t? A: McCain: Again, somebody would have to prove that it would actually have a beneficial effect, some of the strictest gun laws in the country are in places where crime is at its worst.

As “The Last Word” staff worked on Friday night to gather information about the shooting at the Batman movie screening, I read reports from Colorado about the types of guns used in this crime. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said four weapons were used in the attack: “Two 40-caliber Glock handguns, a Remington 870 single-barrel pump shotgun and a Smith & Wesson AR-15 assault-style rifle.” As someone who grew up in a rural part of the southeastern United States, most of those sound pretty familiar with the exception of the AR-15 rifle.

From the age off about 10, as soon as the weather changed from summer to autumn and the leaves started to change, so did my sleep schedule as my father would wake me around 3:30 or 4:00 am to go hunting. I would slowly climb into camouflage coveralls and meet my dad at the gun cabinet in the den, where he would choose the appropriate guns for that mornings hunt: Semi-automatic 20-gauge shotguns for duck, goose and other bird hunting; rifles and a 12-gauge shotgun with buckshot for deer season. Pulling a military-style weapon out of the gun cabinet in the den just didn’t happen.

The rifle used in Colorado was made by Smith & Wesson according to reports and thus is an AR-15 “style” rifle, as another company actually owns that name. The AR-15 is the civilian version of the M-16 military assault rifle and was banned from 1994-2004 when the assault weapons ban expired. One of the arguments for the ban were the various attachments available for purchase for this gun like bayonets. I have never seen a bayonet on a bolt action hunting rifle.

In the 1980s and early ’90s when I hunted with my father, the men he hunted with often talked about the laws concerning gun ownership and especially how to make certain that they were abiding by the law. There was a limit as to how many bullets each gun held and thus a limit to how many shots before you had to reload, three four or five as far I remember. I also remember we had no problem returning home with at least a few ducks, geese, or doves. One pull of the trigger, one shot from a shotgun, and usually at least one bird would go down. If you missed, it took just a second to pull the pump and put another shell in the chamber to fire again. Our chocolate lab did not want for ducks to retrieve in the cold November waters of eastern North Carolina.

The Aurora Police Chief says “these weapons can accommodate large ammunition clips.” The AR-15 used in this attack had a ”drum clip” attachment that could have carried more than 100 rounds and with that clip, the gun “could have fired 50 to 60 rounds in a minute, even if the rifle was considered semi-automatic, not automatic.” Oates added “There were 3,000 rounds of ammunition for this rifle.” 3000 rounds.

One of my most vivid memories of hunting was during middle school, very early on a school day. We climbed a deer stand before sunrise and watched over a field that had probably grown soybeans. About an hour later, a buck with small but legal antlers walked out from the woods, into a field and into his final moments. The deer was too far for me to take a shot at, I was armed with a shotgun. Its been a long time and I don’t remember if my dad was carrying the Remington or the Winchester but I do remember it took him just one shot with his rifle for the deer to go down. It took just one shot across a field that was at least 50 yards.

Think about that. One shot from that rifle took down a deer weighing several hundred pounds that likely was as far from us as half the length of a football field. In comparison the rifle used in the Colorado shootings had a drum magazine attachment that holds as many as 100 bullets. Attachments like that were also banned from 1994-2004.

It took my dad and me some time to climb down the tree and walk across that field. The deer was still alive when we got there. It was an awful sight, his eyes were wide open looking panicked or maybe shocked. I looked away as my father put him down and then we carried the carcass to the pickup truck and headed back to town. My dad dropped me off at school with the deer still in the truck bed, with enough time to change out of my camo coveralls before class. In all the time I hunted with my father, he was a loyal NRA member and I never heard him once complain that his rifle held too few bullets."
msnbc51,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/two-students-suspended-massachusetts-school-posing-rifles,"Two Massachusetts students were suspended from their high school after they posed for a photograph holding replica assault rifles, the same day a gunman opened fire inside a school in Washington.

Last Friday, Tito Velez and Jamie Pereira stood next to each other with their Airsoft rifles, which shoot plastic pellets and resemble assault weapons, for a picture ahead of their Homecoming dance, The Boston Globe reported on Wednesday. The students posted the image to Facebook with a caption that read, “Homecoming 2014.”

That day, an alleged gunman opened fire at Marysville-Pilchuck High School in Washington, killing fellow schoolmate Zoe Galasso and critically wounding four others before turning the gun on himself. One of the victims, Gia Soriano, died from her injuries on Sunday. Local officials, including the police chief, called on the community and the entire country to make societal changes to prevent future mass shootings.

Administrators at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School in Taunton on Monday suspended the teenagers for 10 days. The caption, which consequently linked their image to a school event, has been removed from the photo.

Velez later defended his actions during an interview with a local Boston news station.

“This isn’t dangerous, you can’t kill someone with it. We didn’t shoot anyone; we were pointing them at the floor,” he told WBZ-TV earlier this week. When the reporter asked if the couple intended to take the guns to school, Velez responded: “Never. That would be stupid.”

Pereira, Velez’s girlfriend, said their suspension and possible expulsion from school “is way too much.”

RELATED: Mass shootings are on the rise

People have rallied online in defense of the students. The United States Constitution guarantees their freedom of speech through the First Amendment. But their decisions not only linked the guns to a school event, but also created a disruption among other students in the midst of news headlines about recent shootings inside academic buildings. About 25% of the mass tragedies in the past 13 years occurred in an educational setting, according to a report published last month by the FBI.

“To tie that to one of our school events kind of puts it over the top, which brings us into it,” Richard Gross, superintendent of Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School, told WBZ. Taunton police said they would have canceled the dance if authorities were aware of the post on Friday."

msnbc54,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-gun-the-heart-the-assault-weapons-d,"National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre is set to appear Wednesday morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee. His testimony, released Tuesday, repeats the same tired ideas that he has already articulated and that much of the nation has already rejected, including putting armed guards or police in schools. And he makes a pragmatic-sounding case for avoiding action, saying we all need “to be honest about what works–and what doesn’t work.”

LaPierre also defends military-style semi-automatic weapons, which gun-control backers in Congress recently introduced legislation to ban. “Semi-automatic firearms have been around for over 100 years,” he tells lawmakers. “They are among the most popular guns made for hunting, target shooting and self-defense.”

The firearm at the heart of the “assault weapons” debate is a Bushmaster AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. A Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was used last month in the Newtown, Conn. shootings that killed 27. Ten days later in Webster, New York, a man set to fire to his house and used a Bushmaster AR-15 to kill two responding firefighters before killing himself. An AR-15 was also used in last summer’s shooting at a Batman movie theater premiere in Aurora, Colo., and a decade ago in and around Washington by the D.C. sniper.

It’s less suited for hunting and home defense, although some people do use it for both purposes, and more ideally suited for other, more complex scenarios ranging from defending against rioters and looters, participating in the demanding sport of High Power target shooting, or arming oneself to deter police or military forces in the case of a citizens’ insurrection. The popularity of Bushmaster rifles also makes them excellent money-makers for gun manufacturers, too.

Designed as a civilian version of the fully automatic M-16 rifle, issued to American soldiers since the Vietnam war, the AR-15 is named after the original manufacturer, Armalite; the AR does not refer to “assault rifle,” as some have erroneously suggested. The same weapon did appear, however, in the Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Assault Weapons, until pressure from the NRA and gun manufacturers demanded that the author change the digest’s title for his next edition to a Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Tactical Rifles.

Gun-rights supporters have rushed to defend the weapon. In a piece titled “The AR-15: The Gun Liberals Love to Hate,” NRA president David Keene wrote online last month that gun-banning politicians and journalists don’t “understand the nature of the firearms they would ban, their popularity or legitimate uses.”

Some people do use a Bushmaster AR-15 to hunt. But most Bushmaster AR-15’s fire small, but high-powered rounds that can make it difficult to stop a deer or other big game without multiple shots. Only in the past decade or so have AR-15 rifles have become good enough to match the accuracy of most other hunting rifles, and many hunters still seem divided over what some derisively call “black guns.” A few years ago, Field & Stream posed the question in an online forum, Are assault rifles for hunting? One young, but experienced hunter searching for middle ground, wrote:

“I am NOT ‘buying into’ liberal media’s ideas. I don’t mind one bit if someone wants to hunt with a[n] AR-15. I just have a personal opinion about them and their place in hunting,” wrote longliner13, describing himself as a young man and avid hunter. “If you enjoy hunting with an assault rifle, great. Do it. I have myself. But I just have the strong opinion that the AR-15 is not necessary in the field.”

What about for home defense? Most experts, along with many others, recommend keeping either a handgun or shotgun over any other long rifle in a house or apartment. The tight confines of any residence make it difficult to wield a long rifle. And if a long gun were still preferred, a shotgun is both easier to aim and more effective at short-range. While the Bushmaster’s high-powered, small rounds could end up penetrating walls and putting family members or neighbors at risk.

Outside the home, however, over more open ground, a Bushmaster AR-15 might be ideal for self-defense. Many gun-rights activists still point to a 1992 video on YouTube of ethnic Korean store owners and other men on the rooftop of their retail business to defend against looters during the riots over the Rodney King police beating trial. Although the store’s defenders appear to have been armed with only rifles and shotguns, there is no doubt that a Bushmaster rifle capable of firing up to 45 rounds a minute would be an effective deterrent against multiple assailants in a riot or other lawless scenario.

There is one area, however, where a military-designed, semi-automatic rifle like the Bushmaster AR-15 does clearly excel. High Power Competition target shooting is now more common than traditional benchrest shooting competitions “by a huge margin,” according to one expert and blogger. “[T]here are no mechanical crutches in High Power—your arms and body must support the full weight of the rifle as you engage the target from a variety of positions,” placing “a premium on good eyesight, training, and overall fitness.”

The Bushmaster AR-15 is among the weapons of choice for High Power Competition. Shooters fire from standing, sitting, kneeling and prone positions, firing up to 20 rounds at a time. Competitions organized by the NRA have helped make High Power shooting competitions a fast growing sport. The proposed legislation to ban many military-style semi-automatic rifles and limit high capacity magazines announced last week by California Sen. Feinstein would at least alter, if not threaten the future of this expanding field of American gun culture.

Why else might someone need a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle? Perhaps so armed citizens might one day deter, if not overthrow a future tyrannical government. This may sound like rhetoric, but it has been the position of modern NRA leaders and other Second Amendment activists for years. “They’re God-given freedoms. They belong to us as our birthright. No government ever gave them to us and no government can ever take them away,” said NRA chief LaPierre last week in Reno.

Since gun control has come under debate in the wake of the Newtown Sandy Hook shooting, similar views have flooded the Internet. “Hunting is a BI-PRODUCT of #2ndAmendment. The #RightToBearArms is TO DEFEND Self, Family & #USA from MURDERING MEN or #Government. #tcop #GOP,” tweeted last week @johnmatthew19, a self-described “Christian,American,Father,builder”.

Another purpose that Bushmaster rifles serve is to make profits for their manufacturer. Bushmaster rifles have made record sales in the wake of the Newtown grade school massacre. The Bushmaster AR-15 retails for about $1,048.99, making it more expensive that most traditional hunting rifles. People who buy it also tend to buy and use more ammunition. “They are fun, accurate, don’t kick, and before you know it, you’ve sent $100 worth of ammunition downrange with a few twitches of your trigger finger,” wrote one Field & Stream columnist.

The rising popularity of the Bushmaster AR-15 has helped make Remington Arms and its North Carolina-based parent company, Freedom Group, one of the nation’s largest and most profitable gun manufacturing consortiums. To continue sales, Freedom Group quietly collaborates with the gun lobby. In 2011, the same year a new CEO, George Kollitides II, took over Freedom Group, Kollitides was appointed to the NRA’s Nominating Committee to hand-pick candidates for elections to the NRA’s current board of directors, as I reported two weeks ago in Mother Jones. Freedom Group has grown from making nearly $80 million in profits five years ago to making an average of almost $250 million a year since 2009, much of it from sales of Bushmaster rifles.

“Bushmaster was one of the first companies to introduce modern sporting rifles to the consumer market,” reads Freedom Group’s last available annual report, “a market that is growing faster than the general firearms industry.”"
msnbc55,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/national-rifle-association-nra-convention-draws-gun-lovers-and-vote-seekers,"Tens of thousands of firearms enthusiasts gathered in Indianapolis over the weekend for the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) annual meeting, a celebration of gun culture that’s also a magnet for Republican candidates looking to court the movement’s support.

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin delivered the most discussed line of the weekend at a rally Saturday when she called on the government to return to torturing suspected terrorists.

“Well, if I were in charge, they would know that waterboarding is how we’d baptize terrorists,” Palin said.

On Friday, a bevy of potential GOP presidential candidates spoke, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio, former Senator Rick Santorum, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. Others, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, participated remotely by video.

The gun rights movement had plenty to celebrate over the weekend. Despite a push to restrict assault weapons, large ammunition magazines, and expand background checks in the wake of mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Newtown, Connecticut, states have mostly moved to expand the ability of residents to legally obtain and carry firearms in recent months. Organizers of the NRA meeting hope to carry that momentum to Congress, where they’re pushing for new laws that would force state and local governments to recognize gun permits issued elsewhere.

The movement’s recent successes are largely attributable to the intense political support generated by Second Amendment activists through groups like the NRA, whose clout forced politicians to think carefully before supporting even modest gun control measures that enjoy overwhelming majority support among the public.

msnbc56,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rubio-right-the-assault-weapons-ban-failed,"During CNN’s forum on school shootings this week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) faced an outraged parent, whose daughter was shot, and who couldn’t understand the Republican senator’s opposition to an assault-weapons ban.

Rubio responded that the original assault-weapons ban “failed” after its passage in 1994. But is that true? The Washington Post had a good piece on this yesterday, taking a closer look at the data, and concluding that the since-expired law “had a significant impact.”

The 1994 law included a ban on 18 specific models of assault weapons, as well as a ban on any firearms containing certain military-style features, like a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor or a folding stock. It also banned high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 bullets. The bill allowed individuals already in possession of such weapons to keep them. It was also set to expire after 10 years’ time. “The original intent of the assault weapons ban was to reduce the carnage of mass shootings,” [Louis Klarevas, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who wrote a 2016 book on mass shooting violence] said. “And on that front the data indicate that it worked.” Klarevas has compiled data on gun massacres involving six or more fatalities for the 50 years before 2016. His numbers show that gun massacres fell significantly during the time the assault weapons ban was in place, and skyrocketed after the ban lapsed in 2004.

In the American tradition, the country has repeatedly responded to brutal gun violence by imposing new restrictions – each of which was permissible under the Second Amendment. One of the reasons fully automatic weapons aren’t generally available to the public, for example, was the response to the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929.

The massacre in Parkland, Fla., last week was also on Valentine’s Day. There’s no reason policymakers can’t take similar, legal steps in the name of public safety now.

* Postscript: At the same CNN event, Rubio said any attempt to ban assault weapons would open the door too widely: “Once you start looking at how easy it is to get around it, you would literally have to ban every semiautomatic rifle that’s sold in America.” Much to the Republican senator’s chagrin, the crowd erupted in applause.

Yesterday, he followed up by saying this idea may have received cheers, but it’s outside “the mainstream.” First, Rubio opposed a popular and bipartisan background-check bill in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, so I’m not sure he should be commenting on who is and isn’t within “the mainstream.”

And second, there’s ample evidence to suggest Rubio’s assessment is factually wrong."

msnbc67,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/idaho-bill-allow-permitless-concealed-carry-inside-city-limits,"Beginning July 1, Idaho residents age 21 or older will be allowed to carry a concealed firearm without a permit inside city limits.

Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter has signed Senate Bill 1389 into law, which will relax the state’s gun policy and remove permitting requirements for concealed carry. Prior to SB 1389, residents age 18 or older could carry concealed firearms without a permit outside of city limits. Open carry is already legal within city limits.

Despite giving SB 1389 his signature, Otter expressed concern about the bill’s lack of a training or education requirement for those who would carry concealed. In a letter to the president of the Idaho Senate, Otter addressed public safety concerns that law enforcement raised throughout the development of the bill and urged individuals who are considering concealed carry to receive training in firearm safety.

“While S1389 is consistent with the U.S. Constitution, Idaho values and our commitment to upholding our constitutional protections from government overreach, I am concerned about its lack of any provision for education and training of individuals who choose to exercise the right to concealed carry,” the Republican lawmaker wrote. “Such a safeguard would seem to be part of the Second Amendment’s ‘well-regulated’ standard. What’s more, the addition of a simple training requirement in this bill could have addressed the concerns of our valued law enforcement leaders and others who cherish both the shooting culture and the safety of shooters and non-shooters alike.”

Otter added that in the absence of an educational provision, ”I also encourage the Legislature to monitor the exercise of this new law and respond appropriately when and if the lack of statutory education and training requirement undermines public safety.”

Other states that allow concealed carry without a permit include Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Vermont, Wyoming and West Virginia."

msnbc69,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congress-eyes-bills-undetectable-guns,"It hasn’t gotten much attention yet, but a federal ban on undetectable guns will expire in just a couple of weeks. Some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for congressional action ahead of the Dec. 9 deadline.

Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) introduced a bill Thursday that would ban guns designed to escape detection by metal detectors. S. 1774 would reauthorize the Undetectable Firearms Act, which first passed in 1988. Schumer tried to get unanimous consent to pass the bill Thursday evening, but Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) objected, saying it wasn’t a day to be passing any legislation.

“I hope as soon as we come back, we might get this body to pass it, and maybe get the House to pass it,” Schumer said. “We are in a dangerous world. To allow terrorists, criminals, those who are mentally infirm, to walk through metal detectors with guns that are made of plastic and then use them at airports, sporting events, and schools is a very bad thing.”

It’s hardly a secret that congressional Republicans oppose any new gun measures, no matter how popular or sensible they may be, but at issue here is whether an existing law can remain in place.

Under the status quo, federal law prohibits the “manufacture, sale, import or possession of guns that are undetectable by metal detectors and X-ray machines.” The Undetectable Firearms Act was first signed into law by President Reagan in 1988, and it’s been renewed with relative ease twice since then, but with the radicalization of Republican politics, and limited time remaining, the law’s future is very much in doubt.

The irony is, the law is arguably more necessary now than ever. Quite recently, 3-D printing has become more common and readily available to consumers, making it that much easier to produce deadly weapons, quickly and cheaply, that include no metal parts."

Everytown for Gun Safety on Wednesday published the results of an investigation in Washington that show most of the criminals in the state purchase firearms from the online marketplace to avoid background checks. Of the identified people seeking guns in unlicensed sales over the Internet, nearly one in 10 had been convicted of crimes that prevented them from legally possessing firearms, including rape domestic abuse, and assaulting police officers. The investigation also found that 44,000 guns are posted for sale annually on the Internet.

“Of the identified people seeking guns in unlicensed sales over the Internet, nearly one in 10 had been convicted of crimes.” U.S. Department of Justice.

The pro-reform gun group, backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, examined five major Washington classified websites, including Armslist.com, the self-described Craigslist for guns. Those platforms illegally transfer about 4,000 firearms each year. The websites range in size, with hundreds to tens of thousands of firearms listed at any given time. Once each day from Feb. 25 until July 12, 2014, investigators extracted online data from all gun-related ads posted by the self-described “private sellers.”

The findings of the report, “Online and Off the Record,” came on the heels of a ballot initiative in Washington that would require criminal background checks on all firearms sales and transfers in the state — including at gun shows and on the Internet. In an unusual move, philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates last month donated $1 million to the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility, a reform group attempting to reduce violence in the Evergreen State.

Early last year, 345,000 Washington residents began pushing for the initiative, known as “I-594,” to appear on a ballot. They will have a chance to vote on the measure, the country’s only statewide background checks initiative, during the midterm elections in November.

Recent polling reveals that 72% of Washington residents support I-594.

The same day as the organization disclosed the results, Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS) began airing two new television commercials in New Hampshire that highlight two Republican congressional candidates’ opposition to sealing the loophole that allows domestic abusers, stalkers, and other individuals who pose a threat to society to buy guns. Members target Congressman Frank Guinta and state Rep. Marilinda Garcia for holding beliefs contrary to those of most residents in the Granite State.

Many of the pro-reform campaigns, such as the national petitions initiated by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, are focused on addressing the loophole in the federal background checks system. Earlier this year, members of the group successfully convinced Facebook and Instagram to regulate all sales and trades on those sites of firearms that are not subject to background checks."
msnbc73,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/burger-chain-prohibits-customers-openly-carrying-guns,"If you want to bring a gun into a Whataburger, you better keep it out of sight.

The iconic Texas fast-food chain recently announced that it will not allow customers to openly carry firearms in its restaurants, despite a new law that empowers Texans to display their guns while walking the state’s streets.

In an open letter to the “gun rights community,” Whataburger CEO Preston Atkinson explained that while he supports Second Amendment rights, “We’ve had many customers and employees tell us they’re uncomfortable being around someone with a visible firearm who is not a member of law enforcement, and as a business, we have to listen and value that feedback in the same way we value yours.”

RELATED: The states could be the only hope for new gun control laws

Texas Restaurant Association CEO Richie Jackson told the Associated Press that he expects other restaurants in the state to adopt a similar policy before the new law goes into effect next January.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation in June, following years of protests and rallies by gun rights advocates. Among the group’s favorite acts of civil disobedience was the repeated practice of bringing military-style assault rifles into Texas Chipotle Restaurants, prompting push back from the burrito chain.

The new law overturned a ban on open carry that dates back to the post-Civil War era, when it was used to disarm former Confederate soldiers and facilitate the emancipation of slaves in the state.

While Texas’ streets, sidewalks, and parks will soon be open to the visibly armed, the law gives private property owners the right to ban guns in their homes or establishments.

Whataburger patrons will still be allowed to carry firearms in the chain’s restaurants, so long as they keep them concealed. But that gives little comfort to Open Carry Texas founder C.J. Grisham, who told the A.P. that the policy was “premature and irresponsible.”

“I think most gun owners that know this policy are simply not going to go to Whataburger, like me,” he said."
msnbc74,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/americans-favor-stricter-control-over-gun-rig,"A strong majority of Americans still favor stricter gun control laws, according to a new national Morning Joe/Marist poll. The new figures indicate that support for gun control is not waning, as another national poll found in March.

The Morning Joe/Marist poll found that 60% of Americans—83% of Democrats, 43% of gun owners, and 37% of Republicans—support stricter laws. That number is virtually unchanged from the 61% who favored the laws in another NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that asked the same question in February.

The Morning Joe/Marist poll also found an uptick in the number of Americans who prioritize controlling gun violence over gun rights: 53% of Americans believe stopping gun violence should have a higher priority, a step up the 49% that another Marist poll found last month.

Congress has struggled to find politically viable legislation to move forward on the matter, despite the strong support from the public.

While 87% of those surveyed believe in background checks for private and gun show gun sales—a key provision of the Senate’s background check bill—Republicans have vowed to fight such legislation. Only 12% of Americans oppose universal background checks; just 1% in the Morning Joe/Marist poll said they were unsure on the issue.

Fifty-nine percent of Americans favor banning assault weapons, but the bill was dropped in the Senate because it lacked the votes to pass. Democrats are expected to offer the ban as an amendment to the legislation, but it is not expected to pass.

Chuck Todd, msnbc host and NBC News chief White House correspondent, broke down the findings.

“You see why this is going nowhere on Capitol Hill,” explained Todd, on Wednesday’s Morning Joe. “If you look at it by party and you say there’s an overwhelming majority because there’s a majority of Democrats who would like gun laws to be more strict and a majority of independents who would like that. But if you look at it with Republicans, it’s a majority that do not believe gun laws should not be more strict, it’s a majority of Republicans who do not want the assault weapons ban. The only place where there’s a significant Republican support in line with Democrats and independents is on the issue of expanded background checks.”

The party breakdown is stark: 63% of Republicans favor protecting gun rights over controlling gun violence, while only 34% prioritize controlling gun violence. Meanwhile, 77% of Democrats believe controlling gun violence should be the priority; 22% prioritize gun rights. Independents are divided evenly: 48% prioritize stopping gun violence, 48% prioritize gun rights.

“It’s a reminder,” he added. “If a majority of Republicans aren’t on this, it’s not getting through the House–none of this is getting through the House.”

The poll was conducted March 25-March 27 among 1,219 national respondents using both landline and cell phones. It has a margin of error of plus-minus 3.0 percentage points."
msnbc75,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-republicans-vote-expand-gun-access-mentally-impaired,"When an American suffers from a severe mental illness, to the point that he or she receives disability benefits through the Social Security Administration, there are a variety of limits created to help protect that person and his or her interests. These folks cannot, for example, go to a bank to cash a check on their own.If congressional Republicans have their way, these impaired people will, however, be able to buy a gun. USA Today reported

The House of Representatives approved its first effort of the new Congress to roll back gun regulations, voting to overturn a rule that would bar gun ownership by some who have been deemed mentally impaired by the Social Security Administration. The House voted 235-180 largely along party lines Thursday to repeal an Obama-era rule requiring the Social Security Administration to send records of some beneficiaries to the federal firearms background check system after they’ve been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs. The rule, when implemented, would affect about 75,000 recipients of disability insurance and supplemental insurance income who require a representative to manage their benefits because of a disabling mental disorder, ranging from anxiety to schizophrenia.

The full roll call on yesterday’s vote is online here . Note that 97% of House Republicans voted for the measure, while 99% of House Democrats voted against it.While GOP proponents of the bill argued that it’s unfair to limit the rights of the mentally disabled, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), among others, explained, “These are not just people having a bad day…. These are people with a severe mental illness who can’t hold any kind of job or make any decisions about their affairs.”This did not prove persuasive to Congress’ far-right majority, which supported the measure that enjoyed the enthusiastic backing of the National Rifle Association.In terms of the substantive details, the Social Security Administration reports the names of those who receive disability benefits due to severe mental illness to the FBI’s background-check system. The House bill intends to block that reporting, making more people eligible to legally buy a firearm.Often, in the wake of the country’s brutal mass shootings, Republican policymakers have a reflexive set of talking points, and near the top is something intended to sound constructive: working on mental-health issues is a potential area for bipartisan common ground.Yesterday was a reminder that the gap between the parties on issues such as these couldn’t be much greater.And while much of the political world’s attention has been focused on Donald Trump’s alarming antics of late, let’s not overlook the fact that House Republicans have been quite busy this week. The GOP majority voted to make it easier for coal mining debris to be dumped into nearby streams ; Republicans approved a measure to allow oil companies to hide payments to foreign governments ; and yesterday they moved to expand gun access for the mentally impaired.It’s quite an institution."
msnbc76,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/police-three-males-six-females-killed-charleston-church-shooting,"CHARLESTON, S.C. – Police have captured the suspected gunman believed to have fatally shot nine church members gathered Wednesday night for Bible study and prayer, officials said Thursday. Dylann Storm Roof, 21, was taken into custody in Shelby, North Carolina, nearly 250 miles from the scene of the deadly shooting.

RELATED: The question hanging over Charleston

Among the dead in the massacre at one of the nation’s oldest black churches here was beloved pastor Clementa Pinckney, a longtime state senator.

Roof waived his right to an attorney and said he would not fight extradition to South Carolina in his first court appearance later Thursday, an employee of the local Cleveland County Clerk’s office said. He is expected to appear for a 2 p.m. ET bond hearing Friday in North Charleston, South Carolina.

Earlier today, Loretta Lynch said the Justice Dept. will open a hate crime investigation into the shooting. Candice Delong and Paul Butler have more. share tweet email save Embed

“This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America,” Obama said. ”Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace. In a place of worship.”

Shots rang out Wednesday evening after Roof allegedly joined a weekly prayer group gathered at the historic church and asked members to identify the pastor. Roof sat next to the church leader for nearly an hour, authorities said, when around 9 p.m., the gunman opened fire. Police said three men and six women were killed in the massacre.

Local, state and national law enforcement launched a massive manhunt that concluded Thursday morning after a tipster reported a suspicious-looking car to authorities. Police arrested Roof at a traffic stop, Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said in a news conference.

“I cannot say how thankful I am and how appreciative I am of all the people who came together during a very tragic situation, a horrific situation, one that has touched the heart and soul for every person who lives in this community,” Mullen said.

Charleston County coroner Rae Wooten released the names of the victims Thursday afternoon. In addition to Pinckney, other victims identified are Tywanza Sanders, 26, a recent graduate of Allen University; Cynthia Hurd, 54, a library manager at St. Andrews Regional Library; Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, a reverend and mother; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59; Reverend Depayne Middleton, 49; and Rev. Daniel Simmons, 74, who died shortly after being taken to a local hospital.

The Justice Department has opened a hate crime investigation into the shooting, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Thursday, calling the deadly incident “heartbreaking and deeply tragic.”

“Acts like this one have no place in our country and no place in a civilized society,” Lynch said. “Even as we struggle to comprehend this heartbreaking event, I want everyone in Charleston and everyone who has been affected by this tragedy to know that we will do everything in our power to heal this community and make it whole again.”

South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley struggled through tears during a press conference Thursday morning, urging communities across the state to come together and heal. “We woke up today and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,” she said while choking up. “And so we’ve got some grieving too. And we’ve got some pain we have to go through. Parents are having to explain to kids how they can go to church and feel safe. And that’s not something we’ve ever thought we’d deal with.”

The violence erupted at Charleston’s historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, the oldest such congregation in the South, known as much for the role it played at significant moments of racial distress as for its grand Gothic architecture.

It was the second time in three months that violence, death and race mixed in Charleston, where in April a white police officer fired eight bullets at Walter Scott, an unarmed African American man, killing him. The officer was charged with murder and is currently facing trial.

On a campaign stop in the city Wednesday, presidential contender Hillary Clinton spoke passionately about police violence, calling Scott’s death a “terrible tragedy.” She left the city before the shooting occurred, a campaign aide confirmed. There had been local reports that Pinckney was campaigning with Clinton in the state. But a campaign official told msnbc that he was not at her fundraiser.

Community members, clearly distraught, held impromptu prayer circles and gathered into the night as tensions ran high and new details emerged about the deadly shooting. In an interview with NBC affiliate station WIS, a woman claiming to be Pinckney’s cousin relayed an account from a survivor in the room.

“She said that he had reloaded five different times and her son was trying to talk him out of doing that, killing people, and he just said, ‘I have to do it’ and he said, ‘You rape our women and you’re taking over our country and you have to go,’” Pinckney’s cousin said.

Few details are known of the alleged gunman. Roof had been previously jailed on drug charges in March, NBC affiliate WIS-TV reported. He was arrested on trespassing charges a month later. The 21-year-old’s uncle told Reuters that Roof had received a .45-caliber handgun for his birthday in April.

Except for the immediate block by the church, movement was free Thursday morning. Buses rumbled by, people cooled off in the shade of the park across the street. The brutal heat kept the streets relatively clear. Onlookers were, all things considered, few and far between. One man set up a banner “PUT DOWN THE GUNS YOUNG PEOPLE.” A Coca-Cola van stopped by to drop off free cold water for reporters camped out across the street.

Pastor John Paul Brown of nearby Mt. Zion Church said churches in Charleston are generally welcoming of strangers. “Charleston is called the Holy City for a reason,” Brown told msnbc. “To have that apprehension about the safety of churches, there’s just no way to lock every door and check everyone who comes in … You can’t say ‘I represent Christ, let me frisk you.’”

JA Moore, a family friend of Pinckney, said he had known the late pastor since he was a child.

“People are just trying to process it, people are trying to figure everything out, it’s hard to respond to this because it’s this fringe group of people, and it’s not like you can go after an establishment like the police department or the governor’s office,” Moore told msnbc. “It’s a powder keg. You’ve got to think this community that is just getting over Walter Scott, I think everyone is kind of on edge. I think right now people are just kind of waiting to see what happens. This is crazy.”

Bakari Sellers, a lawyer and former state legislator, described Pinckney as a “really good guy” who gave voice to the underserved. “People are just trying to figure out why. And asking the question, where can you be black, if you can’t be black in the street and you can’t even be black in church. That is a big question,” Sellers said.

“There are bad people in this world who are motivated by hate. Every decent person has been victimized by the hateful, callous disregard for human life shown by the individual who perpetrated these horrible acts,” Graham said in a statement. “Our sense of security and well-being has been robbed and shaken.”

“My heart is breaking for Charleston and South Carolina tonight,” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said in a statement. “Tonight we stand together in prayer for Pastor Pinckney and his congregation at Emanuel AME, and for the families who are enduring unimaginable pain at the loss of their loved ones.”

A prayer vigil was scheduled for noon Thursday at Morris Brown AME Church, Rev. Norvel Goff said during the late night press conference.

Jeb Bush, who had been scheduled to hold a town hall-style meeting in the city Thursday, cancelled the event “due to the tragic events unfolding in South Carolina,” a member of his campaign said.

The family of Walter Scott, a black man who was unarmed when he was shot and killed by a white police officer in North Charleston in April, released a statement Thursday condemning the “horrific tragedy” at Emanuel AME Church. “It is our hope that justice will come swiftly,” they said.

msnbc77,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pentagon-nominee-accidentally-tells-the-truth-about-gun-policy,"Dr. Dean Winslow, Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the Pentagon’s top health official, was on Capitol Hill yesterday for his confirmation hearing, and as Politico reported, it turned out to be a little more interesting than expected.

The most provocative exchange came when the discussion turned to Devin Patrick Kelley, who’s believed to be responsible for Sunday’s mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked if Winslow believes service members who are convicted of domestic violence charges should be dishonorably discharged.

“I’d also like to – and I may get in trouble with other members of the committee – just say, you know, how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy … a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used,” Dean Winslow, a physician and retired Air Force colonel nominated to be the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs, said during his Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) quickly interjected, “Dr. Winslow, I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise.”

I suppose there’s some truth to that, though Winslow is an experienced medical professional with an opinion.

As it turns out, of course, that opinion is deeply at odds with the beliefs of the president who nominated him for this Pentagon post. Donald Trump, for example, responded to the massacre in a Texas church by saying this “isn’t a guns situation.”

At this point, I haven’t seen any evidence that Winslow’s nomination is now in doubt as a result of his moment of candor, though it’s not difficult to imagine Trump’s far-right allies in the NRA and elsewhere raising concerns following yesterday’s hearing.

In theory, the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs doesn’t have any role in shaping gun policy, so it shouldn’t necessarily matter what Winslow believes about American consumers’ access to semi-automatic assault rifles, but recent history suggests that doesn’t matter: Senate Republicans delayed President Obama’s pick for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, for more than a year because he had the audacity to describe gun violence as a public-health issue.

The fact that the surgeon general doesn’t have a vote in crafting gun policy was deemed irrelevant."

When a president tweets insults at a Hollywood star, the dignity of his office is tarnished. When a commander in chief uses Twitter to attack a loyal military ally, America’s friends across the globe become unsettled. But when a president uses social media to question the legitimacy of a federal judge following an inconvenient (and temporary) outcome, that is simply unacceptable.

… when the president tries to undermine the legitimacy of the federal judiciary, he must be told in short order that the White House is picking a fight it will not win. For the sake of the country, let us hope the attacks on “so-called” Judge James Robart were merely reckless and not politically calculated. Because speeding further down that path would end in an ugly constitutional crash."
msnbc104,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trial-verdict-extended-ex-south-carolina-cop,"A trial verdict might not be reached until next July for a former South Carolina police officer who was fired after shooting an unarmed black man for a seat belt violation.

WATCH: Chilling new audio uncovered from S.C. shooting tape

On Monday, a solicitor requested that 270 days — the longest time possible — be allotted to reach a conclusion in the case of State Trooper Sean Groubert, The State reported. The solicitor can determine that a decision should be reached in 120, 180, or 270 days depending on the complexity of the hearings and the severity of the offense. The process was implemented in January 2003 to reduce the backlog of the county’s cases.

Groubert, who is white, stopped Levar Jones, who is black, for a seat belt violation on Sept. 4 in a gas station parking lot near Columbia, South Carolina. When Jones reached into his vehicle to grab his ID, Groubert suddenly discharged several gunshots at him, a dashboard camera in the officer’s cruiser allegedly showed.

“Get out of the car! Get out of the car!” Groubert is heard in the video shouting before firing off several rounds and telling Jones to drop to the ground.

“What did I do, sir?” Jones asked the officer after being shot. He was treated at a local hospital for an injury to the hip.

South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which acts as an investigative unit, stated that Groubert “did without justification unlawfully shoot Levar Jones.” Groubert was fired, arrested, and charged with assault and battery of a high and aggregated nature, a felony with a penalty upon conviction of as many as 20 years in prison. He plead not guilty, and according to his lawyer, was justified in shooting Jones because he feared for his life and the safety of others.

South Carolina Department of Public Safety later released another version of the dashboard camera video, which is almost an hour long, in which Groubert tells an individual, who appears to be his supervisor, his own version of the incident. His account appears to be in stark contrast of the footage recorded by the camera.

“Before I could even get out of my car he jumped out, stared at me, and as I jumped out of my car and identified myself, as I approached him, he jumped head-first back into his car … he jumped out of the car. I saw something black in his hands.”

Police brutality recently has received renewed national attention since the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. Protests and violence broke out in the St. Louis suburb following Brown’s death, and the community continues to demand justice. A grand jury is currently weighing whether or not to indict the officer who shot and killed Brown on criminal charges.

In Kansas City, Missouri, the FBI is investigating the case of a police tasing that put another cop’s son in critical condition and a medically-induced coma. And in Baltimore, Maryland, a cop was recently suspended after video footage surfaced of him apparently repeatedly beating a man."

msnbc107,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gun-lobby-who-got-elected-the-nra-board,"This year’s gun lobby board election brought a few surprises, as the National Rifle Association has been trying to keep the results (and the low voter turnout) quiet.

George K. Kollitides II is the founder and CEO of Freedom Group, America’s largest and most profitable firearms consortium. One of the company’s products is the Bushmaster AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that was used last December in the Sandy Hook school massacre.

Last year Freedom Group led the gun industry with record sales of almost $1 billion, or $931.9 million. Kollitides also quietly served last year on the NRA’s shadowy Nominating Committee for the NRA’s 2012 board elections, as reported in January in Mother Jones. His place on the Nominating Committee likely helped get his name on the NRA’s official ballot this year.

Yet he still lost his bid for the NRA board, according to election results just published in the August edition of the NRA’s American Rifleman magazine, available only to NRA dues-paying members, a copy of which was obtained by MSNBC. Kollitides remains a Trustee of the NRA Foundation, according to its latest annual report. The foundation’s activities include organizing gun safety and target shooting competitions for children.

Calls to Kollitides’ office at Freedom Group’s headquarters in Madison, North Carolina, requesting comment were not returned.

Other gun industry executives sit on the NRA’s board. Pete Brownell is the third-generation family CEO of Brownells, Inc., America’s largest supplier of firearms parts, tools and accessories. He easily won his reelection. His father and chairman of the board for the family business, Frank R. Brownell III, is also President of the NRA Foundation.

A representative of Brownells in Montezuma, Iowa, told MSNBC.com that neither executive was available for comment.

Two more gun industry executives sit on the NRA board. One is Ronnie G. Barrett, the CEO of the Tennessee-based Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, who designed the first .50 caliber rifle for civilian use. (Last week Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill that would have banned .50 caliber rifles in New Jersey.)

Another is Stephen D. Hornady, an NRA board director who, like Kollitides, is an NRA Foundation Trustee. Hornady is the second-generation family CEO of the Nebrasksa-based ammunition-making firm, Hornady Manufacturing.

Other gun industry figures like Larry and Brenda Potterfield of MidwayUSA, a Missouri-based retailer and wholesaler of firearms products, have contributed generously to the NRA through programs like “Round-Up,” which allows firearms consumers to round-up their purchase to the next dollar to make a donation in the name of defending the Second Amendment. To date MidwayUSA’s Round-Up program alone has contributed $8.9 million to an NRA endowment.

This year, as in previous years, the top two vote-winners in NRA elections have been Oliver North and Ted Nugent. North is the Fox News host who became famous as the protagonist of the 1980s-era Iran-Contra affair. Nugent is the rocker last seen on national television in January scowling down from the Capital gallery at President Barack Obama during the State of the Union Address.

Another popular NRA board director is Marion P. Hammer. A grandmother, under five feet tall, Hammer has long been the most influential gun rights activist in her home state of Florida, where she was also, by all accounts, instrumental in helping to pass Florida’s Stand-Your-Ground law.

Two other long-standing NRA board members were re-elected this year, despite an organized campaign among NRA Second Amendment activists against one, and a notable degree of negative comments online against the other.

H. Joaquin Jackson is a former, storied Texas Ranger-turned-actor who has played lawmen in films like Extreme Prejudice starring Nick Nolte and The Good Ole Boys directed by Tommy Lee Jones. But a video-recorded interview that Jackson gave back in 2005, saying that military-style semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 rifle have no place in hunting, led NRA activists this year to mount a Facebook campaign against him.

Former Senator Larry Craig is the longest-standing NRA board director, having been first elected in 1983. In 2007 Craig pled guilty to the charge of disorderly conduct for his behavior in a men’s room in Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, leading some NRA activists to turn against him.

Only NRA Life Members are eligible to vote, and this year, as in past years, no more than 7.2% of them, or 123,646 voters out of a total of 1,718,786 Life Members, cast a ballot, according to the independent, pro-NRA, Pennsylvania-based gun rights blog, pagunblog.com.

Life members were asked to vote for up to 25 out of 29 candidates. “No write-in candidates received 250 or more votes to quality,” reads an NRA note on the election results in American Rifleman.

The NRA has even failed to publish a list of its latest board of directors online. Earlier this year the group quietly took down a webpage roster of its board members, rerouting the page, www.nra.org/board, to the gun lobby’s home page.

NRA officials at the group’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia declined to comment.

Other notable NRA directors include the actor Tom Selleck, the former NBA basketball star Karl Malone, who is one of several African-American directors on the NRA’s 76-member board, and Grover G. Norquist, the Republican anti-tax crusader."
msnbc108,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-nra-finds-new-ways-stoke-the-fires-the-culture-war,"The National Rifle Association has a challenge: the far-right organization has allies running the federal government. In practical terms, that leaves NRA members with very little to fear, at least in political terms. The chances of a far-right Congress approving gun reforms that will be signed into law by Donald Trump are zero.

To be sure, the NRA still has to contend with public opinion. A new Quinnipiac poll, for example, released yesterday, found that 94% of Americans – including 93% of Republicans and 92% of voters in gun-owning households – support requiring background checks for all gun purchases.

But the fact remains that the NRA’s Republican allies will simply ignore public attitudes on the subject – a fact the NRA’s members are no doubt aware of.

How, then, will the group keep its supporters engaged? By pointing to a different enemy: Democratic officials may not be in position to approve any national policies, but there are still liberals out there who, the NRA says in a new video, need to be defeated in a culture war:

“They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse ‘the resistance.’ “All to make them march. Make them protest. Make them scream ‘racism’ and ‘sexism’ and ‘xenophobia’ and ‘homophobia.’ To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding – until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. “And when that happens, they’ll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. “I’m the National Rifle Association of America. And I’m freedom’s safest place.”

It’s quite a worldview.

As Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum noted, the NRA has clearly evolved from being an organization interested in the rights of gun owners, and become “a purveyor of wholesale culture war zealotry.” This video is powerful evidence of this: NRA members aren’t told to worry about legislation; they’re told to direct their fears at “comedy shows” and liberals who “terrorize the law-abiding.”

At the root of NRA propaganda in recent years is an unhealthy dose of paranoia and cultural resentment, and the byproduct is bizarre videos like the one the group released this week.

Vox’s report added, “It’s not hard to figure out what the narrative is here. A liberal insurgency is destroying American society. The ‘only way’ to protect yourself from this surge in left-wing violence (a made-up threat, to be clear) is to donate to the NRA.”"
msnbc109,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-meets-nra-tells-group-what-it-wants-hear,"At his White House meeting with senators on Wednesday about gun policy, Donald Trump offered hearty praise for the National Rifle Association, but seemed eager to suggest he doesn’t really care whether the NRA is satisfied with his agenda or not.

“They do have great power, I agree with that,” the president said of the far-right group and its members. “They have great power over you people. They have less power over me.”

At one point during the discussion, when Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) explained his bipartisan background-check bill, Trump effectively mocked his ostensible ally, telling the Republican his proposal didn’t deal with age limits “because you’re afraid of the NRA.”

Soon after, referring to no one in particular, the president added, “Some of you people are petrified of the NRA.”

Just one day later, Trump welcomed NRA representatives into the Oval Office, and while we don’t know exactly what was said, the far-right lobbying group certainly seemed pleased.

The top lobbyist for the National Rifle Association claimed late Thursday that President Trump had retreated from his surprising support a day earlier for gun control measures after a meeting with N.R.A. officials and Vice President Mike Pence in the Oval Office. The lobbyist, Chris Cox, posted on Twitter just after 9 p.m. that he met with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, saying that “we all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control. #NRA #MAGA.”

Around the same time, Trump boasted about the “good (great) meeting” he had with the NRA’s lobbyist.

The New York Times’ report noted that the twin messages “suggest that it may have taken the gun rights group only a little over a day to persuade the president to back away from his apparent embrace of gun control during a remarkable, televised meeting on Wednesday with members of Congress.”

I think “suggest” is the right word under the circumstances, because Trump himself doesn’t seem to know what he wants, or even intends, to do on gun policy.

After the mass shooting in Parkland, he called for action, but stuck to vague generalities. When the president started pointing to specific ideas, the White House took steps to backtrack.

On Wednesday, Trump seemed eager to embrace progressive reforms, bucking the NRA, only to meet privately with the NRA a day later, and apparently tell the group what it wanted to hear.

One of the more common criticisms of the president from public officials is that he invariably agrees with the last person he talks to, even if he said the opposite to the person before. There’s no great mystery as to why this happens – Trump doesn’t know or care about public policy – but on guns, he’s going out of his way to prove that those criticisms are accurate.

For their part, Senate Democrats yesterday unveiled a package of reforms, including universal background checks and a debate on assault weapons, because these are the exact ideas the Republican president expressed support for a day earlier. In effect, the Dems’ plan is a put-up-or-shut-up challenge to Trump.

I think we know which option the president will choose."

msnbc111,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pentagon-nominee-forced-withdraw-after-candid-comments-about-guns,"A month ago, Dr. Dean Winslow, Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the Pentagon’s top health official, was on Capitol Hill yesterday for his confirmation hearing, which seemed to be going well. Then the doctor made the mistake of being candid.

With the mass shooting in a Sutherland Springs church on the minds of many at the time, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked Winslow about service members convicted of domestic violence charges and whether they should be dishonorably discharged. As part of his answer, the doctor shared his belief that it’s “insane” that “in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy … a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used.”

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the committee’s chairman and a beneficiary of the NRA’s generous support, quickly interjected. “Dr. Winslow, I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise,” the Republican said.

Soon after, Winslow’s nomination was put on hold. This week, he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post explaining that his nomination is now over.

Last week, I withdrew my name from consideration to be assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. My appointment had been put on indefinite hold by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I felt the Defense Department needed to fill the position without undue delay. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines deserve the full complement of Pentagon appointees to support them. I am sorry not to be able to assist Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whom I deeply respect, in building the best and most efficient military health-care system possible. I have the credentials to help, including 35 years of experience in the Air Force (including four deployments to Iraq and two to Afghanistan after 9/11), in military and academic medicine, and in private practice, public hospitals, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries, and public health. But unfortunately, I do not possess one credential the committee wanted to see: I do not support the unrestricted ownership of semiautomatic assault weapons by civilians.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) noted yesterday, “Over the course of his six deployments, Dean L. Winslow wielded weapons of war and saw what they did to the bodies of soldiers. When he said those weapons don’t belong on our streets, his nomination to serve the Dept. of Defense was shut down.”

As we discussed in early November, it’s worth appreciating the fact that if Winslow had been confirmed to the position for which he was qualified, he wouldn’t have been able to affect gun policy in any way. Whether the assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs agrees with the NRA’s agenda or not is ultimately irrelevant in a policymaking sense – because consumer access to weapons of war falls far outside the office’s purview.

But for Republicans, that didn’t matter. Winslow, a Trump nominee, shared the wrong thought out loud. Like much of the country, he thinks it’s “insane” for civilians to be able to buy semi-automatic assault rifles, and in this Congress, it’s a disqualifying sentiment.

“I have no regrets,” Winslow concluded in his op-ed. “Having semiautomatic weapons makes no sense. It is a public-health issue that, as a doctor, I felt compelled to bring to the Senate’s attention. As a citizen, I am saddened that our government has become so dominated by pro-gun lobbyists that an appointment such as mine – which has no responsibility for gun control – can be sidelined by a single sentence of informed, personal opinion. And that really is insane.”"

msnbc113,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/following-mass-shootings-house-gop-votes-expand-gun-rights,"It’s rare to see bipartisan agreement in Congress on any kind of legislation related to gun policy, but Democrats and Republicans recently agreed to a modest measure to improve national background check system.

But before the proposal could pass the House, Republicans decided to add something to it.

The House approved a Republican bill on Wednesday making it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. The “concealed carry” bill is the first gun legislation in Congress since mass shootings in Nevada and Texas killed more than 80 people. The House approved, 231-198.

The Associated Press’ report added that the change “is a top priority of the National Rifle Association,” which helps explain why GOP lawmakers made this change to an otherwise bipartisan bill.

The point of the policy is to effectively override state-based conceal-carry restrictions. As the New York Times’ article explained, “Some states … require that permit applicants have live-fire experience and safety training, along with a clean criminal history. Others are more lenient, and a dozen states do not even require a permit. The House bill would not force states to change their own laws, but it would treat a concealed-carry permit like a driver’s license, letting individuals allowed by one state to carry a concealed weapon with them into another state.”

As a political matter, it’s likely that the House bill will struggle in the Senate, where the bill will need 60 votes, which means the bipartisan effort on the background check system will die because of House Republicans’ efforts to approve the NRA-backed measure.

But let’s also not miss the larger context: two of the five deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have occurred since October. It’s already been a brutal year for mass killings in the U.S., and the year isn’t quite over yet.

It’s against this backdrop that congressional Republicans are pursuing policies to expand gun rights, not limit them."
msnbc114,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/nra-backs-cornyn-not-texas-tea-party-challenger,"Even gun giveaways aren’t enough for the National Rifle Association.

The NRA announced its support on Wednesday for incumbent Republican Sen. John Cornyn over challenger Steve Stockman, the tea partier famous for raffling an AR-15 rifle and sending outrageous tweets about abortion.

“The choice is clear for law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen in the U.S. Senate Republican primary election in Texas, and that choice is John Cornyn,” said Chris Cox, chairman of the group’s Political Victory Fund. “We urge all NRA members and like-minded supporters to vote John Cornyn for U.S. Senate.” He also noted the senator’s “A+ rating” on gun issues.

The support from the powerful lobbying group adds heft to Cornyn’s campaign, already millions of dollars ahead in fundraising with a $7 million war chest compared to Stockman’s $32,000.

In an effort to earn some extra dough, Stockman unveiled Obama “barf bags” for sale on his website Tuesday. For a $10 donation, voters will receive a bag with the president’s face on it accompanied by the tagline, “Socialism Makes Me SICK!”

Earlier in the year, he also offered bumper stickers reading, “If babies had guns, they wouldn’t be aborted.”

Stockman entered the Texas Senate race in the 11th-hour and he’s got a long way to go against the second-highest ranking Republican in the Senate. A GOP-leaning poll showed Stockman trailing Cornyn by 44 points.

Early voting in the Texas primary begins on March 4."
msnbc115,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/florida-gop-rejects-gun-measures-declares-porn-health-hazard,"It appears the Republican majority in Florida’s state legislature has a rather macabre sense of humor.

Just a week after a gunman killed 17 people in a massacre at a South Florida high school, the GOP-led state House had an opportunity to debate a ban on assault weapons; As the Miami Herald reported, the right had reason to be pleased with the outcome.

The bill (HB 219), which would ban the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines like the kind used by Nikolas Cruz, has been mired in a House subcommittee for months and has not been heard. Amid rising tensions at the Capitol, Democrats used a highly unusual procedure to try to move the proposal directly to the House floor for a debate and vote. Republicans voted it down, 71-36. Several survivors of the high school massacre, watching from the visitors’ gallery, were overcome with emotion, and the action set off a firestorm of controversy on social media.

The outcome was not unexpected, but that was little solace to those who hoped last week’s bloodshed might help Republican policymakers to reconsider their assumptions about gun restrictions.

But to fully appreciate the absurdity of the circumstances, consider the fact that while Florida’s state House wasn’t willing to tackle efforts to prevent gun deaths, it was willing to debate the public health risks associated with porn. The Tampa Bay Times reported:

The Florida Legislature is declaring pornography as a health risk. The state’s House of Representatives approved the resolution by a voice vote on Tuesday. The resolution states a need for education, research and policy changes to protect Floridians, especially teenagers, from pornography. Republican Rep. Ross Spano says there is research that finds a connection between pornography use and mental and physical illnesses, forming and maintaining intimate relationships and deviant sexual behavior. Spano is also a candidate for attorney general.

State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D) sponsored the assault-weapons measure and highlighted the depravity of yesterday’s developments.

“Has anyone had to bury their child because of pornography?” Smith asked reporters.

That’s hardly an unreasonable question."
msnbc116,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/nra-convention-feature-nonoperational-guns-floor,"The National Rifle Association’s annual convention kicks off in Nashville this week, with 70,000 people expected to participate in the three-day gathering.

Attendees can expect to find the usual NRA fare and exhibitors at the 350,000-square-foot Music City Center, but they shouldn’t expect to find functioning weapons. The Tennessean reports this week on the “multilevel security plan,” which includes an important safety measure: “All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational, with the firing pins removed, and any guns purchased during the NRA convention will have to be picked up at a Federal Firearms License dealer, near where the purchaser lives, and will require a legal identification.”

The New York Daily News sees some irony in the convention policy:

The National Rifle Association wants guns at schools, but not its own annual convention. […] NRA boss Wayne LaPierre has called repeatedly for allowing guns in schools, and other facilities. LaPierre says arming teachers and guards will help prevent gun violence. At least, outside the NRA’s own events.

Of course, there’s also a political angle to keep in mind as the far-right group gathers in Tennessee.

A s the local report noted, at least eight likely Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to speak at the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum: Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Mike Pence, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum, and Scott Walker.

Donald Trump and Sarah Palin are also expected to appear.

Correction/Update : Rather than leaving a confusing series of updates , let’s summarize what we now know. The original report from the New York Daily News , which said the NRA had “banned working guns” from the convention, was inaccurate – Tennessee’s open-carry laws still apply at the NRA event. The Memphis Daily News published a piece explaining Tennessee gun laws in more detail. Similarly, when The Tennessean reported, “All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational,” that referred to the guns on display at exhibitors, not the guns attendees bring themselves. updatesNew York Daily NewsMemphis Daily News

This does not mean, however, that convention attendees face no limits on where and when they can carry loaded firearms. We learned late Wednesday, for example, that no guns are allowed in the convention room during performances from Alan Jackson and Jeff Foxworthy. There’s also an expectation that gun owners will have the proper permits before bringing loaded weapons to see speeches from presidential candidates.

We’ve also since learned that Sarah Palin and Mike Pence have canceled their scheduled appearances."

msnbc126,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/public-attitudes-gun-policy-shift-quickly-following-parkland,"At an event in Florida last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) seemed displeased when his constituents applauded the idea of banning consumer access to semiautomatic rifles. The morning after, the Republican senator said such an approach would be outside “the mainstream.”

As a factual matter, Rubio’s understanding of public attitudes is clearly askew, but just as importantly, he and the rest of the political world should probably pause to appreciate just how much “the mainstream” has shifted of late.

Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to the highest level since 1993, and almost two-thirds say government and society can take action to prevent future mass shootings, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The findings suggest the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, has shifted public opinion on gun laws in a way other recent mass shootings have not. Overall, 70% now say they back stricter gun laws, up from 52% who said so in an October poll not long after a mass shooting in Las Vegas killed 58 people. Just 27% oppose stricter laws.

To be sure, it hasn’t quite been two weeks since the mass shooting in Stoneman Douglas High School, but if it feels like the reaction to the gun violence is different this time, it’s not your imagination.

After the Sandy Hook massacre and Las Vegas slayings, for example, CNN polling found about 37% of Americans “strongly” favored stricter gun control laws. Now, it’s 52%.

After Sandy Hook, about a third of Americans said government and society could take action that would be effective in helping prevent future tragedies. After Las Vegas, it was up to 47%. Now, it’s 64%.

There are some aspects of this that are not yet clear. We don’t know, for example, whether this is a short-term shift, which will fade when the immediacy of the bloodshed is no longer at the forefront of the public’s consciousness. We also don’t know whether Republican policymakers, generally resistant to any new gun laws, are going to ignore public attitudes, just as they did during recent fights over health care, immigration, and tax policy.

I’d also love to hear from polling experts whether – and to what degree – the broader support for new gun restrictions is tied to a broader public backlash to Donald Trump and his far-right agenda. In other words, 70% of Americans now support a more progressive approach to gun laws, but how much of that is the result of the prevailing political winds blowing to the left, bolstering the “resistance”?

Regardless, if the momentum on this issue can be sustained in the coming months, the Parkland issue may have helped change the 2018 midterms in a way the right won’t like.

Postscript: In this poll, 57% of Americans said they’d support “a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of rifles capable of semi-automatic fire.” Someone should probably let Marco Rubio know."
msnbc127,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-senator-gun-show-loophole-doesnt,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), after having been a senator for three weeks, made his second “Meet the Press” appearance yesterday, and was asked whether there are any regulations and/or restrictions on gun rights that he could support. The Republican said background checks to “prevent felons and those with serious mental illnesses from acquiring” firearms “make perfect sense.”

So, is Cruz on board with a universal background check system? Well, it’s complicated.

Though Cruz supports licensed firearm dealers running background checks as part of existing law, host David Gregory noted that 40% of gun sales don’t involve licensed firearm dealers – this includes firearms purchased at gun shows. Cruz disputed the statistic, adding, “You know, there actually isn’t the so-called gun show loophole. That doesn’t exist.”

And why not? Because as Cruz sees it, licensed firearm dealers are the ones conducting sales at gun shows, and these dealers already follow the law on background checks, so there’s no problem. Except, the senator is confused – as we’ve seen over and over again, background checks aren’t conducted at gun shows, and the loophole does exist.

Cruz can’t have it both ways. He can’t say he supports background checks in the interest of keeping weapons out of the hands of felons and the mentally unstable, while also saying he supports a system in which felons and the mentally unstable can get guns without background checks from private sellers.

On a related note, Cruz raised another argument that suggests he doesn’t quite understand the nature of the policy debate.

“[Y]ou have a lot of people that are worried about preserving the safety of their own home. If you’re talking to a single woman living in Anacostia, who has the misfortune to live next to a crack house, to hell her she doesn’t have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, I think is fundamentally wrong.”

Here’s the follow-up question I have for Cruz: who’s arguing that a single woman living in Anacostia can’t legally purchase a firearm? As best as I can tell, no one. Maybe she shouldn’t have access to an assault weapons intended for a military battlefield, and maybe she doesn’t need a high-capacity magazine, but the policy argument is not about whether Americans can have a firearm in their home. That debate has already been settled.

And given this, I can’t help but wonder if Cruz either doesn’t understand the nature of the conversation or if he’s trying to mislead the public with smoke-screen arguments that don’t make any sense."
msnbc128,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/georgia-house-passes-controversial-gun-bill,"The Georgia House passed a sweeping gun bill late Thursday night that allows firearms in bars, nightclubs, school classrooms and certain government buildings that lack security personnel or devices.

Lawmakers moved the bill through the House during the last hour of the night on Thursday, meeting their midnight deadline before the end of the current legislative session. If signed by the state’s governor, the law will give religious leaders the option to “opt-in” to allow guns on their worship premises, where violators cannot be arrested or fined more than $100 each. Additionally, it could grant citizens the right to carry firearms in bars, nightclubs, libraries, sports facilities, senior citizen and youth centers, and on K-12 premises by authorized administrators and teachers.

The law would also allow permit-holders to carry guns into Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints in airports with no penalty, which is a reduction from the maximum felony punishment currently in place. Individuals who claim ownership of a permit would be allowed to leave the security area without consequence, and officials could not detain them or ask to see firearms documentation.

The legislators’ decision is not only a “slap in the face” for victims of gun violence in Georgia, but also for all American sufferers, said Brian Malte, senior national policy director for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

“We know more guns is not a solution to gun violence, so it’s a very sad day in Georgia,” he told msnbc.

Though supporters are pleased with the approval of the bill, many wish it treated religious establishments similarly to bars, nightclubs and municipalities. The government does not belong in church affairs, said Jerry Henry, executive director of Georgia Carry. His group is a main proponent of the bill, also backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA).

“[The bill] means that if you are one who likes to protect yourself, that you have a whole lot more places to protect yourself. It means that if you’re a bad guy, you might want to think about going into some of those places,” Henry told msnbc.

Among other provisions, the law also changes Georgia’s self-defense measures by removing the penalty for possessing a firearm in an unauthorized location. If passed, the legislation will provide security to individuals carrying guns in unauthorized locations, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and without a license in locations currently prohibited.

“There are some states that take guns anywhere, anytime, and virtually for everyone, and they do it in piecemeal. Georgia has decided to do it all in one bill,” Malte said.

Opponents of the bill refer to the measure as an expansion of Stand Your Ground because it has the potential to give felons and other individuals currently banned from owning a gun permission to carry in unauthorized areas. George Zimmerman’s acquittal last summer in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin brought renewed national attention to the Stand Your Ground defense.

Georgia lawmakers, who passed the bill Thursday by a 112-58 vote, will now present the legislation to Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who plans to run for re-election on Nov. 4. Previously, Deal supported loosening gun restrictions, which earned him an “A” rating from the NRA and an endorsement for the GOP primary runoff election in 2010.

The bill is part of the “Safe Carry Protection Act,” which, until earlier this week, contained both a bill from the House and a revised bill from the Senate, as msnbc previously reported. Americans for Responsible Solutions deemed the original House bill “the most extreme gun bill in America.” The Senate version, however, offered fewer allowances for guns in certain places, including the opt-in provision not only to church leaders, but also to bar owners and municipal officials.

RELATED: Georgia bill could allow guns in bars, churches and airports

State senators passed the bill earlier this week before it went to the House. But a lack of transparency left many residents and organizations puzzled about which measures were included and which were removed from the legislation. Ultimately, House lawmakers took out language that would reduce the penalty for a permit-holder caught carrying a gun on a college campus from a misdemeanor to a fine.

“We were pleased that the final bill did not include the guns on college campuses and guns in churches provisions. But the fact remains this bill moves Georgia out of the mainstream,” Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, said in a comment. “Thousands of Georgians and tens of thousands of Americans will continue to show they are tired of the gun lobby advancing its extreme agenda at the expense of their families’ safety.”

House legislators passed a similar bill last year, but it failed in the state Senate. Until this week, legislators had not passed a gun bill since 2010, when they repealed the state’s public-gathering law and replaced it with a more defined list of places off-limits for carrying firearms. Georgia had the highest number of gun deaths per capita among the 50 states that same year, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Opponents view the current bill as a disturbance for places of worship, establishments that serve alcohol and school campuses where parents expect their children to remain safe.

Some institutions, including the Roman Catholic Bishops of Georgia, declined to comment on Friday until they analyzed and determined the effects of the possible changes.

Parts of the Georgia bill have surfaced individually in other states – including Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee – as the national debate about gun rights continues in the wake of the 2012 tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Oklahoma legislators passed a bill this week that would allow any college, university or technology school to establish a policy to permit license-carriers to possess firearms on campus. In Idaho, Republican Gov. Butch Otter last week signed into law a bill that prohibits state colleges and universities from regulating guns.

Ninety-one percent of Georgians supported mandatory background checks for all gun buyers, according to a poll published in March 2013 in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Conn.

Colin Goddard, senior policy advocate for Mayors Against Illegal Guns and a former Georgia resident, told msnbc: “You get to the point where you want to ask: ‘Who exactly are they doing this for?’”"
msnbc129,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jay-nixon-vetoes-bill-allowing-teachers-carry-concealed-guns,"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon vetoed a measure Monday that would have permitted certain educators to carry concealed weapons on school property.

Nixon, a Democrat, cited student safety in public schools as a reason for concern.

“Arming teachers will not make our schools safer,” the governor said in a statement. “I have supported and will continue to support the use of duly authorized law enforcement officers employed as school resource officers, but I cannot condone putting firearms in the hands of educators who should be focused on teaching our kids.”

The measure would have allowed teachers to become “school protection officers,” according to the governor’s office.

“This bill, which would create a new mechanism for the arming of teachers, would not make schools safer,” added Nixon, who is also a former chief law enforcement officer in Missouri.

Monday was the final day Nixon was expected to take action on measures passed earlier in the year. But the legislation could survive if the Republican-led state legislature revokes Nixon’s temporary ban on the bill with a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate during a September session.

Some districts believe schools need armed teachers because they think law enforcement takes too long to respond to emergencies.

In the wake of school shootings across the country, some school board members sent voluntary faculty to a concealed-weapons training. At least 10 districts across Missouri have completed the instruction in the past 18 months.

Districts in other states – including Kansas, Ohio and Indiana – have also demonstrated interest in the training.

Ninety-one percent of teachers said they believe an armed guard would improve school safety at least somewhat, according to a membership poll published earlier this year by the Association of American Educators. Additionally, 75% of the surveyed members feel safe or very safe in their schools. About 20% of the organization’s 20,000 members responded to the survey.

msnbc130,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/cruz-acknowledges-dismisses-reality,"The right’s favorite talking point on expanded background checks is pretty straightforward: the popular, bipartisan proposal must be defeated because it’ll create a national gun registry. Reality proves this is the exact opposite of the truth, but the NRA’s allies keep saying it anyway.

Today, in an interesting twist, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) grudgingly acknowledged the truth, only to dismiss it in the next breath. For those who can’t watch clips online, Cruz told Capitol Hill reporters:

“I don’t disagree that on its face, the currently pending legislation does not purport to create a national gun registry. But the Department of Justice has been explicit that when you require background checks for private firearms transactions, the only way to make that effective is through a national gun registry. So if the bill that is pending on the floor of the Senate passed, the next step in the process would be that critics would say, ‘Well this isn’t effective. We don’t know if you’re selling your firearm to someone else unless we know you have your firearm.’ “And in my judgment a federal registry of firearms – the federal government keeping a list of every firearm that is lawfully owned by every law-abiding citizen – would be terrible policy and would be inconsistent with the Constitution.”

So, there is no federal registry. The legislation explicitly prohibits a federal registry. Under the pending bill, anyone even trying to create a federal registry would be a felon, subject to 15 years behind bars. No one has even proposed the possibility of a federal registry. But Cruz and his allies are convinced one will organically evolve to prevent private gun sales, even though the Manchin/Toomey measure targets gun shows and online sales.

In other words, Congress has to kill one idea, because there’s a paranoid fantasy about the possibility of a different idea coming up at some point in the future.

If this sounds familiar, it’s what unhinged critics of the Affordable Care Act said about “death panels.” Sure, there’s nothing in the proposal that would create “death panels,” but if you close one eye, tilt your head, and use your imagination, you’ll see it’s possible to envision a system in which the federal government starts murdering senior citizens.

This is no way for a mature democracy and ostensible superpower to debate public policy."
msnbc131,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-toll-gun-violence-children,"Over 7,000 children are hospitalized or killed due to gun violence every year, according to a new study published in the medical journal Pediatrics. An additional 3,000 children die from gun injuries before making it to the hospital, bringing the total number of injured or killed adolescents to 10,000 each year.

The new study, led by researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, highlights the toll gun violence has on child mortality rates in the country. Doctors surveyed the most recently released data from 2009 that tracked pediatric hospital stays.

“This study reinforces what we know from the mortality data,” Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told NBC News. “We have an extraordinary health burden in our youth associated with firearms injuries.”

In the 2009 Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID), 7,391 children under the age of 20 had been hospitalized for injuries from firearms and the majority of those gunshot injuries —4,559—resulted from intentional firearm assaults. 2,149 of those injured were accidents, and 270 were suicide attempts. Of the children who were hospitalized, 453 – 6% – died from their injuries.

“That’s more than 7,000 children injured badly enough to be hospitalized,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. John Leventhal, a pediatrics professor at the Yale School of Medicine. “All are unnecessary hospitalizations because preventing gun violence is something that can actually be done.”

Levanthal pointed out that parents should keep their guns locked in a safe hiding place and keep them separate from the ammunition to decrease the high number of accidental injuries, especially for smaller children.

Webster also suggested to NBC News that the government should make it illegal for individuals under 21 to own a firearm, referring to research that shows a peak in homicides between young adults age 18 and 20. “While you have to be 21 to purchase a handgun from a dealer, if you’re an 18-year-old you can go to a private seller and legally purchase a handgun in 38 out of 50 states,” Webster said.

Webster also compared the U.S.’ standing with other high income nations and pointed out that the mortality rate from firearms in the U.S. is nearly 10 times higher than the rates in other wealthy nations. “This is a very unique and abnormal problem that such a wealthy nation should have such high mortality and morbidity in youth related to firearms,” he said.

After the devastating tragedy at Sandy Hook in December 2012, the gun policy debate intensified, coinciding with the rising number of children killed by guns in the U.S. every year. In the first 14 school days of 2014, there have been at least 7 school shootings: at Wakefield Elementary School in Calif., Berrendo Middle School in New Mexico, Liberty Technology High School in Tenn., Albany High School in Georgia, Delaware Valley Charter School in Penn., Widener University in Penn., and most recently, Purdue University in Indiana. In 2013, there were 28 school shootings.



The American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in 2012 that “firearm-related deaths continue as 1 of the top 3 causes of death in American youth.”

“America’s pediatricians remain undeterred and united in our desire to see significant policy change to address this public health crisis,” the AAP wrote on the one-year anniversary of Newtown, pushing for tighter background checks, an assault weapons ban, and federal research on gun violence prevention."
msnbc132,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/court-upholds-strict-san-francisco-gun-laws,"A federal appeals court dealt a blow to the gun lobby on Tuesday by upholding two San Francisco gun laws requiring owners to securely store their weapons and regulating ammunition dealers.

Handgun owners in San Francisco currently must use trigger locks or secure weapons in a safe inside their homes when they are not carrying them. The restriction aims to prevent unauthorized users and children from accessing guns. Additionally, the city forbids licensed ammunition dealers from selling hollow-point bullets, which expand upon impact and can cause massive damage to the human body.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, defended the two separate pieces of legislation this week as reasonable attempts to increase public safety without destroying residents’ Second Amendment rights.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) and several other gun supporters objected to both laws with the belief that gun locks burden Second Amendment rights. The NRA did not respond to msnbc’s request for comment.

“Even when a handgun is secured, it may be readily accessed in case of an emergency,” Judge Sandra Ikuta wrote Tuesday in the three-judge panel’s decision. Residents are allowed to use handguns to defend their homes, she added.

The restriction on ammunition “imposes only modest burdens on the Second Amendment right,” Ikuta wrote of the other bill.

The Second Amendment protects individual rights, but the judges agreed the government can impose restrictions with the intent of enhancing safety, said Christine Van Aken, chief of appellate litigation and San Francisco’s deputy city attorney.

“The Ninth Circuit took the view that as long as it’s not a significant burden on the ability of people to have guns and use them when they’re needed, the government is allowed to regulate for good reasons. Here the idea is public safety and protecting children,” Van Aken told msnbc.

The case was the first that involved the safe storage of firearms at the federal level since a landmark decision in 2008 when the U.S. Supreme Court held the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense. The court then also struck down the portion of an act that required all firearms be kept unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock. (Similar to the San Francisco circuit court, the highest court in Massachusetts affirmed the state’s tough gun storage law last January.)

“It should encourage other communities that are thinking about safe storage laws that they’re perfectly consistent with the Second Amendment and constitutional. We hope it spurs action elsewhere,” Cody Jacobs, staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told msnbc.

The national debate about gun rights continues in federal and state courtrooms across the country more than a year after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Supreme Court this week ruled unanimously that federal law bans people convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse charges from owning guns.

But at the state level, Republicans lawmakers in Georgia last week passed a controversial “guns everywhere” bill that will allow firearms in bars, nightclubs, classrooms, and certain government buildings upon signature from the Republican governor. Legislators in the state House passed a similar bill last year, but it failed in the state Senate.

Similarly, Oklahoma legislators recently passed a bill that would allow any college, university or technology school to establish a policy to permit license-carriers to have guns on campus. In Idaho, Republican Gov. Butch Otter signed into law a bill that prohibits state colleges and universities from regulating guns.

Also in San Francisco, a district court last month crushed an attempt by gun advocates to block a city law banning magazines of more than 10 rounds. But the NRA continues to challenge a similar ruling in Sunnyvale, Calif., where a federal judge earlier this month permitted the city to enforce a voter-approved ban on high-capacity magazines.

Eight states and Washington, D.C., have enacted laws banning large-capacity ammunition magazines. Though the numerical definition varies, magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition generally are considered “large capacity.” The accused gunman in the Aurora, Colo., movie theater massacre used a 100-round magazine during the shooting, which killed 12 people and left scores wounded.

Lawmakers recently litigated these bans in both Connecticut and New York, where judges upheld the prohibitions on large-capacity magazines that can hold more than than 10 rounds, because the legislation balances Second Amendment gun rights and the Obama administration’s call to reduce violence.



RELATED: Court upholds constitutionality of Conn. gun-control law



By the end of last year, Americans’ support for tight gun-control laws had dropped to pre-Sandy Hook levels.

The nonprofit Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ranked California No. 1 and gave the state an “A-” grade for enacting 10 new laws in 2013 that strengthen gun restrictions. In 2010, the Golden State had the ninth lowest number of gun deaths per capita, according to the center. But California is the fourth largest supplier – among all 50 states – of crime guns to Mexico when population is taken into account."

msnbc134,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fireworks-and-firearms-freedomworks,"It’s been a few weeks since David Corn first reported on the behind-the-scenes drama at FreedomWorks, a powerful and well-funded right-wing organization, including the ouster of Dick Armey, who departed with an $8 million payout. We’ve since learned that allegations of wrongdoing and legal threats have intensified, and Corn obtained a memo from Matt Kibbe, president of the group, accusing board members of mounting a “hostile takeover.”

But to appreciate just how out of control things have become at the Tea Party group, take a look at this remarkable piece from Amy Gardner.

The day after Labor Day, just as campaign season was entering its final frenzy, FreedomWorks, the Washington-based tea party organization, went into free fall. Richard K. Armey, the group’s chairman and a former House majority leader, walked into the group’s Capitol Hill offices with his wife, Susan, and an aide holstering a handgun at his waist. The aim was to seize control of the group and expel Armey’s enemies: The gun-wielding assistant escorted FreedomWorks’ top two employees off the premises, while Armey suspended several others who broke down in sobs at the news. The coup lasted all of six days. By Sept. 10, Armey was gone – with a promise of $8 million – and the five ousted employees were back.

Like Josh Marshall, I noticed some chatter overnight about Dick Armey leading an “armed coup” at FreedomWorks, but it never occurred to me that the phrase was being used literally.

But it was. In early September, Armey marched into FreedomWorks’s office with his wife, his executive assistant, and an unidentified man with a gun. Matt Kibbe, the group’s president, and Adam Brandon, its senior vice president, were “promptly escorted” out of the building.

“This was two weeks after there had been a shooting at the Family Research Council,” a junior staff member told the Washington Post. “So when a man with a gun who didn’t identify himself to me or other people on staff, and a woman I’d never seen before said there was an announcement, my first gut was, ‘Is FreedomWorks in danger?’ It was bizarre.’ ”

That sounds like a perfectly good adjective under the circumstances.

We’re also learning, by the way, about some of the mysterious financiers behind FreedomWorks’ operation."
msnbc135,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/duncan-fears-irs-firearms,"With Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) retiring at the end of this Congress, I don’t think there’s any doubt who’ll replace her as Congress’ silliest conspiracy theorist.

Rep. Jeff Duncan wants to know why IRS law enforcement agents are training with AR-15 rifles. As chairman of the House Homeland Security oversight subcommittee, Duncan (R-S.C.) toured a federal law enforcement facility in late May and noticed agents training with the semi-automatic weapons at a firing range. They identified themselves as IRS, he said. “When I left there, it’s been bugging me for weeks now, why IRS agents are training with a semi-automatic rifle AR-15, which has stand-off capability,” Duncan told POLITICO. “Are Americans that much of a target that you need that kind of capability?”

If Duncan’s name sounds familiar, it’s because he’s developed quite a reputation lately. The South Carolina Republican, for example, is afraid of the Census Bureau. He’s also the same congressman who spewed bizarre conspiracy theories – which he apparently learned from Glenn Beck – about the Boston Marathon bombing, going so far that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano felt the need to say Duncan’s ignorant inquiries were “full of misstatements and misapprehensions,” and “not worthy of an answer.”

But what the rifle training for IRS officials? Maybe Duncan has a legitimate concern? Actually, no.

In a statement, the tax agency explained, “As law enforcement officials, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents are equipped similarly to other federal, state and local law enforcement organizations. Special Agents receive training on the appropriate and safe use of assigned weapons. IRS Criminal Investigation has internal controls and oversight in place to ensure all law enforcement tools, including weapons are used appropriately.”

All of this has the benefit of being true. Indeed, the IRS often investigates drug-trafficking operations, so it stands to reason officials would be well armed.

What’s more, as Steve M. noted, IRS guidelines were revised in this area in 2003. Note to Duncan: that was before President Obama took office.

I’ll just throw one more thought out there, in the hopes that the House GOP leadership will think it over: maybe this guy shouldn’t be the chairman of the House Homeland Security oversight subcommittee?"
msnbc136,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/restraining-orders-often-dont-require-surr,"One of the lesser-known battlegrounds of the gun violence debate is the relationship between firearms and restraining orders. In many states, those served with protective orders are not required to surrender their guns, even if gun-related threats have been made. Now, stats are surfacing that suggest seizing firearms in circumstances like these could prevent domestic homicides.

Take Barbara Diane Dye of Oklahoma. According to The New York Times, Dye got an emergency protective order against her husband, Raymond Dye, in 2010. She did this because she was afraid he would react violently when she served him with divorce papers. Approved for a temporary order, with a hearing for a lengthier one in three weeks, Dye hid out in Texas. When she came back in advance of the hearing, her husband cornered her in a bank parking lot, shot her repeatedly with a .357 revolver, and then shot himself with a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol. As he shot her, witnesses say, he kept repeating, “I love you, I love you…”

In her petition, Dye had revealed that her husband had an “arsenal” of weapons. Raymond Dye, however, was not required to surrender them after the protective order was approved.

This isn’t the only case of men disregarding restraining orders to come after their partner with guns. A 2001 study published in the Criminal Justice Review said that approximately one in five women who are shot by a partner had obtained restraining orders first.

The 1994 crime bill addressed this issue by disallowing those served with full protection orders the ability to purchase or possess firearms. Almost twenty years later, the provision is rarely enforced. Last year, prosecutors filed fewer than 50 such cases, according to a Times analysis of data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. This means the issue has largely been left to state regulation.

Some states–like California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts–require anyone served with a domestic violence order, temporary or not, to surrender their guns. Others–like Maryland and Wisconsin–require a full injunction before guns can be taken away. Many have no surrender requirement at all.

Advocates for domestic violence victims say the most dangerous time for a woman are the first days after the temporary restraining order is filed. Barbara Diane Dye, for example, was killed one week before her hearing for a full injunction. But the NRA has pushed back against federal and state measures pertaining to this issue. Being served with a restraining order is not a felony, and, according to Brian Judy, NRA lobbyist for Washington State, ”any crime that is serious enough to cause an individual to lose a fundamental constitutional right should be classified as a felony.”

“The NRA likes to think in terms of hypotheticals,” said msnbc’s Frank Smyth on The Last Word Wednesday. “But we’re not talking, in the real world, about hypotheticals. We’re talking about women who are intimidated, threatened, beaten, injured, and killed by men who have been subject to retraining order but still have their firearms.”

Domestic violence is a major contributor to gun deaths in America. A woman is two times more likely to be shot to death by male intimates than killed in any other way by a stranger. In 2010, 547 women were shot to death by a boyfriend, husband, or ex-husband."

Because it is when our grief and our sorrow and our justifiable rage are at their peak that we are most vulnerable to the seductions of foggy, simplistic, emotion-driven thinking and to the acceptance of reactionary policies that, as we learned during a long and bloody 13 years in this country, don’t necessarily make things better, no matter how much we want them to.

“These moments call for rigor, for resolve and the courage to be clear-eyed and to resist the tug of cheap sentiment.” Chris Hayes

It has been inspirational to watch the courage and resilience of the French people taking to the streets in response to these horrific attacks, and the pluralistic message offered by people like Malek Merabet, the brother of the slain Muslim police officer, who condemned the killers as false Muslims and called for tolerance.

But we are also seeing all the familiar no good, horrible, bad thinking, once again, rush to the fore.

Whether it’s the French far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, who warns of a creeping Islamization of France that threatens civilization and whose message is seen by many as one of the chief beneficiaries of the violence, or the bad thinking of powerful News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, the man behind Fox News, who tweeted what, I shudder to think, a whole a lot of people are thinking: That while most Muslims may be peaceful, they still, quote, “must be held responsible” for the actions of terrorists.

The tweet prompted responses from J.K. Rowling and comedian Aziz Ansari, among many others, with Ansari sarcastically tweeting that Murdoch is responsible for pedophilia committed by anyone Catholic and asking why he is pro-pedophile, complete with sad emoticon.

The thinking reflected in Murdoch’s tweet suggests we are in the midst of some sort of clash of civilizations, with the West on one side and Islam on the other. It is precisely the sort of thinking that took hold after the September 11th terrorist attacks and led to a set of world-historical miscalculations and horrible mistakes and horrific death and destruction.

France is already on a war footing, with its defense minister proclaiming that ISIS must be wiped out and the country deploying 10,000 troops to boost security. France’s lower house of Parliament voted 488-to-one to extend French airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. Four hundred and eighty-eight to one.

I recognize those kind of margins. It’s the sort of margin that the Patriot Act passed by, and the Authorization for the Use of Military Force to invade Afghanistan.

This past Sunday, on Murdoch’s network, Fox News, a terrorism expert named Steve Emerson took anti-Muslim fear-mongering to a new low, claiming there are no-go zones throughout Europe where non-Muslims cannot visit, including one entire British city:

“In Britain, it’s not just no-go zones, there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in.”

Birmingham is actually only about 22% Muslim and Emerson’s bit of idiocy prompted a twitter hashtag, #foxnewsfacts, in which people made jokes like: ”Birmingham has a chain of fast food restaurants called ‘Burqa King.’”

Emerson later apologized profusely, though not before the British Prime Minister called him, quote, “clearly a complete idiot.”

And Emerson’s comment wasn’t even the dumbest to come out of all this. That honor belongs, sadly, to a member of Congress.

Representative Randy Weber, Republican of Texas, tweeted in response to President Obama not joining the Paris unity rally, ”Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris. (For all the wrong reasons.) Obama couldn’t do it for right reasons.” You’ll notice he didn’t bother with the spell check.

Weber offered a rambling and semi-incoherent apology saying he was not trying to trivialize the Holocaust nor to compare the president to Hitler.

When we see the blood spattered on the floor of the Charlie Hebdo offices, the mourners at the funeral of the French Jews killed solely because they were Jews, we naturally reach for words like evil, and conjure figures like Hitler and feel for a moment that the crimes we have witnessed have suddenly clarified everything. But that clarity is a trap. It’s the terrorists’ own lie, the one they wish to peddle to us all. The propaganda of fools and butchers.

These moments call for rigor, for resolve and the courage to be clear-eyed and to resist the tug of cheap sentiment. The terrorists want us not to think – they want us to cower, to rage, to fight.

But thinking is always our best weapon."
msnbc152,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/most-guns-mass-shootings-obtained-legally,"Authorities say Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27 — the shooters who killed 14 people and injured 21 others this week in San Bernardino — had two legally purchased .223 caliber assault-style rifles and two 9 mm semi-automatic handguns. Police want to speak to a friend of Farook who purchased the two semi-automatic rifles used in the massacre, authorities told NBC News Friday.

For gun control advocates, the shooting, which officials announced Friday is being investigated as an act of terrorism, resurfaced long-time concerns.

“The way our laws are structured unfortunately often times allow people to legally buy guns who shouldn’t,” said Mike McLively, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence based in San Francisco.

“The way our laws are structured unfortunately often times allow people to legally buy guns who shouldn’t.” Mike McLively, staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

Such was the case in other horrific mass shootings, including Virginia Tech in 2007 and the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting in June: in both instances the records of the gunmen likely would have raised red flags had they been fully examined through the federal background check system.

A large part of the problem: When an individual goes to buy a firearm, they are subject to investigation under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). A 72-hour hold is put on the sale.

But because federal law operates under the idea of “default proceed,” the sale can legally go through after 72 hours — even if a background check hasn’t been completed. About 9% of background checks require further investigation, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Officials have not said whether there was anything in the San Bernardino shooters’ backgrounds that would have popped up in a background check when they bought their weapons, and little is known about the friend who purchased the assault rifles that they used.

Alan Lizotte, a professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Albany, said secondary firearm transfers — private sales of weapons between individuals that don’t involve a gun dealer or manufacturer — are difficult to track.

“By and large, those secondary transfers aren’t regulated at all,” he said.

And even when they are, states don’t always get the information they need. In New York, for example, the SAFE (Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement) Act of 2013 requires a universal background check, meaning anyone who owns an assault rifle must register it with their county sheriff, whether it’s from a private sale or a gun dealer."
msnbc153,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/the-secret-weapon-could-save-the-voting,"Voting rights advocates are testing whether a little-used provision of the Voting Rights Act could limit the damage of the Supreme Court ruling that struck down a key part of the landmark civil rights law.

Hours after the Supreme Court’s verdict was announced, representatives for the state of Texas celebrated its demise by announcing that they would move ahead with restrictive voting law changes that will disproportionately disenfranchise minorities. Those changes were previously blocked by the Justice Department, through a part of the Voting Rights Act the forces jurisdictions with a history of discrimination in voting to submit their election law changes to Washington in advance, often referred to as “preclearance,” under Section 5. Preclearance prevented discrimination in advance, rather than relying on drawn out litigation that might not be resolved until long after ballots are cast.

Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which the high court struck down as unconstitutional, determined which jurisdictions were covered by that requirement. But Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act allows the federal government to subject jurisdictions with recent records of deliberate discrimination to the preclearance requirement. With Congress polarized and unlikely to come together to fix Section 4’s coverage formula, Section 3 could become the primary tool for the Justice Department and voting rights activists seeking to patch the gaping hole left by the Supreme Court’s verdict. Travis Crum, now a clerk for federal judge David S. Tatel, laid out this approach in an article for the Yale Law Journal in 2010, anticipating that the Supreme Court would someday strike down part of the Voting Rights Act. Crum called Section 3 the Voting Rights’ Act’s “secret weapon.”

Related: How Section 5 stopped a modern day ‘poll tax’



Voting rights advocates are already putting the Section 3 strategy to the test. Last Tuesday, attorneys representing the Texas branches of the NAACP, the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, and Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis in a legal battle with the state over Texas’ redistricting plan asked a federal court to place the entire state of Texas back under preclearance in accordance with Section 3.

“What the court found in the case as a factual matter, their findings were that the congressional map and the senate map were both intentionally discriminatory,” says Gerald Hebert, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center who represents the groups who filed the request. “That kind of intentional discrimination violates the 14th and 15th amendments.”

That high standard of proof is also part of what limits the effectiveness of Section 3 as a replacement for Section 4. To impose preclearance on a jurisdiction not covered by the now-defunct Section 4 formula, you have to prove that officials intended to discriminate. Under the old formula, all that had to be proven was that the election law changes would have discriminatory effects—precisely because most people are smart enough to hide when they’re deliberately trying to discriminate.

In Texas, state officials weren’t that smart. Nevertheless, the requirement that deliberate discrimination be proven means that it will be very difficult to subject states that try to disenfranchise minority voters to preclearance, because all they need is a superficial “race-neutral” reason for making the change.

“What you’re likely to see in states where these actions are brought is states trying to avoid an adverse Section 3 ruling by saying, our real intent here is to hurt Democrats. Since that’s our intent, that’s not a racial intent and that’s not forbidden by the Constitution,” says Brenda Wright, a legal expert with liberal think tank Demos. Judges might not subject jurisdictions to preclearance even if deliberate discrimination is proven, or they might do so only in areas related to the discriminatory policy.

Related: It begins: Republicans rush to change voting laws



Wright pointed msnbc to a 2004 Section 2 case in Massachusetts where officials said they were just trying to protect incumbents when they redrew legislative districts in a manner that weakened the voting powers of minorities. It just so happened that the incumbents happened to be white and the voters they were disenfranchising were black and Latino. The court didn’t buy it, but under Section 2, unlike Section 3, you need to prove only the changes will adversely affect minorities, not that they were intended to.

“Proving intent is not easy,” says Hebert, pointing out that in 1982 Congress changed the standard for proving discrimination in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in order to define changes that would have the “effect” of disenfranchising minorities as discriminatory. That was a change that Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion striking down Section 4, vigorously opposed as a young attorney in the Reagan Justice Department. Section 2 however, unlike preclearance, isn’t as useful for stopping discriminatory election law changes before they happen.

That’s why voting rights advocates are hoping that Congress will not only fix Section 4’s coverage formula, they will strengthen Section 3 so that jurisdictions who make election law changes that have the effect of disenfranchising minorities can be subject to preclearance. Relying on Congress to do anything to strengthen voting rights, however, is a gamble.

In the past Southern conservatives have bristled at being subject to Section 4’s preclearance formula, arguing that they are being punished for the past. Strengthening Section 3 could bypass their opposition. In the meantime, the Justice Department could divert some of the staff and resources once assigned to evaluating states subject to preclearance to ensuring that those jurisdictions with the worst records of discrimination are brought back into the fold under Section 3.

“It’s an important avenue for the department and other litigants to look at,” says Wright. “By no means is it going to be an adequate substitute for what we’ve lost with the Shelby County decision.”"
msnbc154,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-secret-weapon-fight-against-climate-change,"What if we could slow climate change with a few good inventions? That’s the promise of “geoengineering,” often described as plan B if all the politics and protests fail to spur a response to global warming.

RELATED: SCOTUS rules against pollution regulations

Some experts have suggested we repel the sun with cannon-fired reflective dust or clouds of reflective bubbles. Others have mused about free-floating filters to suck carbon from the air. Still others have never given up the old military dream of controlling the weather.

But besides being dangerous beyond belief – akin to levering the earth without knowing exactly where it will roll – these proposals might also be pointless. We already have the perfect geoengineering technology, as President Obama made clear in a joint press conference Tuesday with the president of Brazil.



They’re called trees.

Brazil has done more to slow global warming than any country on earth, primarily by protecting the trees of the rain forest, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday. Those trees were the offstage and understated star of a press conference between Presidents Obama and Dilma Rousseff.

Some environmentalists walked away grumbling, because Brazil didn’t announce a hard cap on greenhouse gases. The bigger news in terms of impact, however, is the country’s new pledge to stop illegal deforestation and regrow a patch of forest the size of Pennsylvania.

You could call it the Lorax-approved solution to global warming.

The Lorax is the Dr. Seuss character who speaks for the trees (because they have no tongues). Brazil already had more trees than most countries. Tuesday’s announcement—to restore 12 million hectares of the Amazon—means millions of additional green, barky things and a huge boost for global efforts to avoid catastrophic climate change.

That’s because trees gobble up carbon, cleansing the sky of the heat-trapping emissions that are blamed for the world’s rising temperatures and increasingly severe weather. If you don’t believe it, just ask a fifth grader: it’s called the earth’s “carbon cycle.”

In the last decade, the Brazilian government has overseen an 80% drop in deforestation, from 28,000 square kilometers a year in 2004 to about 6,000 square kilometers in 2013. It has also boosted agricultural yields, defraying one of the main motivations for further clear-cutting: the need to feed a growing population.

RELATED: Obama administration lays out doomsday climate change scenario

The amount of carbon dioxide sucked up by the Amazon may have fallen in recent years, studies show. But it’s still believed to be north of 1 billion tons a year. That’s equivalent to a two week slurp of all the carbon emissions on earth. If the country succeeds in replanting and restoring as much forest as it promised on Tuesday, it could add another 22 million tons of annual absorption capacity. That offsets thousands of cars and trucks.

“Brazil has reduced its emissions by around 41% as compared to 2005,” the two presidents said in a joint statement issued by the White House.” By comparison the United States has only cut its emissions by about 10%, which is enough to make us the second most aggressive country.

Of course, we can’t entirely plant our way out of danger. That’s why the two countries also agreed to expand the use of renewable energy, promising to generate 20% of electricity from wind, solar and other clean sources by 2030. Brazil also promised to put a limit on emissions ahead of the Paris Climate Change Conference this December.

That gathering could be the world’s last chance to avoid deeper changes to the climate, including more punishing droughts, severe storms and longer heat waves. Scientists insist that a cap on carbon emissions is the only long-term solution.

Trees can help us along the way, however, buying us time for the slow work of politics and preventing the need for more radical interventions. Plus, more trees would redeem the work of the Lorax, giving him a fan-fiction ending that just happens to be real."
msnbc155,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/golden-state-warriors-success-shouldnt-overshadow-openly-gay-team-president,"Largely overlooked amid the pomp and circumstance of the Golden State Warriors’ historic 73-win regular season, captured Wednesday night in front of a ferocious Oakland crowd, was team president Rick Welts, an NBA lifer who helped craft one of the league’s all-time great squads around MVP point guard Stephen Curry.

view photo essay NBA Finals: Golden State Warriors end 40-year championship drought The NBA might just have witnessed a historic changing of the guard.

NBA franchise, as well as a

The fact that the sexual orientation of Welts, the first openly gay president of a major professional sports team, is a non-issue is itself historic. Although his journey to this point – helming a reigning champion commercial juggernaut – was anything but smooth.

Welts, who knew he was gay in his early teens, has been with the league since 1969. He started as a ballboy for the now defunct Seattle Supersonics, and then rose to the top echelons of the league’s front office, as a master of public relations. Welts was the architect behind the expansion of the All-Star Game into a full weekend, adding the three-point shooting competition. He helped Magic Johnson make the transition from HIV victim to advocate, and he was the brains behind the wildly successful marketing of the original Dream Team in 1992. He would later go on to successfully run the Phoenix Suns, but he had a secret – he was gay – and in the world of sports at that time, he felt he couldn’t divulge his truth.

“I just didn’t see how in men’s professional sports this would fit in and I wouldn’t be looked at differently than I wanted to be looked at,” Welts told Soledad O’Brien during a February appearance on HBO’s “Real Sports.”

RELATED: Charles Barkley takes stand against ‘anti-discrimination’ bill in North Carolina

It wasn’t until his partner succumbed to AIDS that Welts came forward and identified himself as a member of the LGBT community to then-NBA Commissioner David Stern. The warm embrace he received helped push him to be more public about his personal life (while he was still serving as president of the Suns), and in a small, symbolic way his gay pride has helped change attitudes and perspectives.

“People who once thought that gay people couldn’t be in sports, and couldn’t be out in sports are seeing someone succeed wildly. It’s really special,” OutSports managing editor Cyd Zeigler told MSNBC..

Still, the league has a long way to go before it can be considered a champion of inclusivity. Despite that fact that just three years ago, Jason Collins became the first openly gay active male athlete in one of America’s premier sports, the NBA has not yet heeded calls to relocate next year’s All-Star game in North Carolina in protest of the state’s controversial legislation that overturned local anti-LGBT discrimination ordinances, which was signed into law on March 24.

“If the NBA was so far ahead of the other leagues they would have gotten in front of the camera the next day [to decry the N.C. law],” said Zeigler.

In just the last few years, marquee players like Joakim Noah and Kobe Bryant have been fined for hurling gay slurs on the court. This past season, Sacramento Kings point guard Rajon Rondo was suspended for a game after hurling an anti-gay remark at a referee who was later to revealed to be a gay man. Meanwhile, players including Chris Bosh and Tim Duncan have been subjected to rumors and innuendo about their sexuality via memes and salacious gossip.

While the WNBA boasts many openly gay players and coaches, the NBA has still not been seen the same kind of representation on or off the court. Still, Zeigler believes the fact that Welts was able to successfully transition between two major NBA franchises without his sexuality being an issue is “powerful.”



According to Zeigler, Welts proved that what matters is who is “the best person for the job, whether they’re gay or straight.”

“It’s important to acknowledge him being gay,” Zeigler added, “but really nobody cares.”

“I hope in some ways just the way I am leading my life and what I represent to other people can be that person that I didn’t have,” Welts told HBO Sports. “That person that they can really relate to and say, ‘Wow that worked out pretty well for him.’”"

msnbc157,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/white-house-sends-provocative-shot-across-the-gop-congress-bow,"In a moment that raised eyebrows in D.C. yesterday, Nancy Pelosi said that if the Republican-led Congress can’t address the nation’s problems, these failing lawmakers should be replaced with members who know how to get things done.

Wait, did I say Nancy Pelosi? My mistake. It was actually White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, apparently indifferent to the fact that it’s her party that controls the legislative branch.

“I don’t think the American people elected Congress to do things that were easy. They elected them to make a government that works, to work properly, and to work for American people. And that’s their job. And if they can’t do it, then they need to get out of the way and let somebody else who can take on a heavy lift and get things accomplished. [„,] “If Congress doesn’t want to do the job that they were elected to do, then maybe they should get out of the way and let someone else do it.”

In all, the president’s chief spokesperson said three times at yesterday’s briefing that members of the GOP-led Congress should be prepared to “get out of the way” and let someone else do their jobs.

I can’t think of a modern precedent for rhetoric like this, with a White House controlled by one party threatening a Congress controlled by the same party. A former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called Sanders’ rhetoric “senselessly provocative.”

And yet, there’s no reason to think Trump World cares. Indeed, the president himself has picked all kinds of fights with individual Republican lawmakers, so Sanders sending a shot across the GOP-led Congress’ bow is consistent with the White House’s curious political strategy.

Don’t be surprised if Sanders’ quote ends up in some Democratic campaign ads next year. It’s a sound bite that could do some damage to incumbent Republicans in 2018, especially if lawmakers end up with no meaningful accomplishments after two years’ worth of work: “If Congress doesn’t want to do the job that they were elected to do, then maybe they should get out of the way and let someone else do it.”"

msnbc159,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-under-fire-after-obamas-warning-shot-guns,"TOLEDO, Iowa — Sen. Bernie Sanders is under fire from Democratic rival Hilary Clinton amid a new campaign by the White House to pressure Democrats into backing his gun control proposals.

On Thursday night, President Obama published an op-ed in The New York Times in which he warned he would “not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform.” Among other measures, the president called on Democrats to support ending a law that grants gun manufacturers immunity from certain lawsuits. Sanders voted for legislation that included the immunity provision in 2005 and indicated earlier this year that he still supports shielding gun companies and dealers from legal action.

Clinton called in to MSNBC’s “Hardball” on Friday to highlight the issue and criticized Sanders for voting multiple times against the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks on firearm purchases, as a congressman in the 1990s.

“When it really mattered, Sen. Sanders voted with the gun lobby, and I voted against the gun lobby,” she said.

RELATED: Sanders knocks Clinton on taxes

Regarding the immunity issue raised in the president’s op-ed, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs told Politico that Sanders was “willing to take another look at that legislation.” In an October debate, the candidate said he did not agree with the entire 2005 bill and was mostly concerned with protecting small gun shop owners rather than large companies.

Sanders told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Friday that he did not believe Obama’s Times piece was aimed at pushing him to the left on gun control and emphasized their agreement.

“You know, there are a lot of candidates and money in the House and the Senate who may be opposed to sensible gun control legislation,” Sanders said. “ I happen not to be one of them. I strongly support the executive order that the president is working on right now. “

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday that breaking down opposition to gun immunity among Democrats like Sanders was exactly Obama’s intention.

“I certainly noticed that Senator Sanders told one of your [colleagues] here when asked this very question, he was eager to point out that Senator Sanders had made clear that he was willing to revisit that position,” Earnest said. “That’s exactly the goal here, right? We want people to change their minds.”

Earnest added that he was not familiar with Sanders’ record and that the op-ed was “not any sort of secret or subtle signal to demonstrate a preference in the presidential primary” when it came to candidates. Nonetheless, he said that any Democratic nominee would need to prove their commitment to “common-sense measures” on guns in order to earn Obama’s support.

After lying dormant for years, gun control has increasingly become a core issue for the Democratic Party over the last four years after a wave of high-profile mass shootings. Even among Sanders fans on Friday, there was some unease over the current debate.

Waiting for Sanders to speak at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Tracy Carstensen, 33, said he was “95%” of the way to supporting the senator, but was concerned about the gun issue.

“He’s been very political about it,” Carstensen told MSNBC. “It’s the only issue where he seems somewhat insincere.”

Jeff Weaver, campaign manager for Sanders, issued a statement Friday afternoon reiterating that the candidate believed “Congress should re-examine a law on manufacturers’ liability” and raising doubts about Clinton’s commitment to the issue. As Weaver pointed out, Obama and Clinton clashed over guns in their 2008 primary, with Obama mocking Clinton as “Annie Oakley” after she accused him of alienating gun owners with his rhetoric."

The National Rifle Association’s interest in recent presidential elections is, at face value, mundane. The NRA has repeatedly expressed its support for Republican candidates, and the fact that it backed Donald Trump in 2016 was one of the least surprising developments of the year.

But many have wondered about the degree to which the NRA intervened on the GOP ticket’s behalf in 2016. Four years earlier, for example, the far-right group was eager to defeat Barack Obama, and to that end, it spent $10 million to boost Mitt Romney’s candidacy.

In 2016, the NRA spent triple that to support Trump.

What’s more, most of money the group spent on the election was spent by part of the NRA’s operation that isn’t required to disclose its donors. McClatchy News reported this week that the FBI, according to the reporting, is exploring possible connections to Russia.

The FBI is investigating whether a top Russian banker with ties to the Kremlin illegally funneled money to the National Rifle Association to help Donald Trump win the presidency, two sources familiar with the matter have told McClatchy. FBI counterintelligence investigators have focused on the activities of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who is known for his close relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the NRA, the sources said.

As Rachel explained on last night’s show, Torshin, Putin’s friend, has faced allegations of money laundering and connections to organized crime.

He’s also a longtime NRA member who, during the 2016 campaign, made multiple efforts to arrange behind-the-scenes meetings between Trump and Russians.

Indeed, you may recall a New York Times report from December about the “Kremlin Connection” email.

A conservative operative trumpeting his close ties to the National Rifle Association and Russia told a Trump campaign adviser [in 2016] that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between Donald J. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, according to an email sent to the Trump campaign. A May 2016 email to the campaign adviser, Rick Dearborn, bore the subject line “Kremlin Connection.” In it, the N.R.A. member said he wanted the advice of Mr. Dearborn and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, then a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump and Mr. Dearborn’s longtime boss, about how to proceed in connecting the two leaders. Russia, he wrote, was “quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S.” and would attempt to use the N.R.A.’s annual convention in Louisville, Ky., to make ” ‘first contact.’ ” The email, which was among a trove of campaign-related documents turned over to investigators on Capitol Hill, was described in detail to The New York Times.

The efforts, the article added, centered on the NRA’s 2016 event and “appeared to involve Alexander Torshin.”

New York’s Jon Chait, noting this and other links between the NRA and Russia, made the case yesterday that the far-right group “is part of the Trump–Russia scandal now.”"
msnbc168,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/gen,"Former Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led the war in Afghanistan, endorsed strong gun control laws Tuesday on Morning Joe.

“I spent a career carrying typically either an M16 or an M4 Carbine. An M4 Carbine fires a .223 caliber round which is 5.56 mm at about 3000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It’s designed for that,” McChrystal explained. “That’s what our soldiers ought to carry. I personally don’t think there’s any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America.”

The AR-15, the civilian version of an M-16 or M-4, has been the weapon of choice in many recent mass shootings —both Adam Lanza and James Holmes used them in Newtown and Aurora, respectively. Since Lanza massacred 20 young children in Newtown, Connecticut, gun control has returned to DC’s front-burner and the president has called for strict gun control measures.

“We’ve got to take a serious look—I understand everyone’s desire to have whatever they want—but we’ve got to protect our children, we’ve got to protect our police, we’ve got to protect our population,” McChrystal said. “Serious action is necessary. Sometimes we talk about very limited actions on the edges and I just don’t think that’s enough.”

McChrystal led the American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, but resigned amidst scandal after Rolling Stone magazine published a controversial profile that portrayed the General and his staff as dismissive and disrespectful of the president.

Tragic shooting sprees aside, McChrystal also pointed to the more deadly and common gun violence—32 people die each day from gun violence—as another reason he believes gun control is necessary.

“The number of people in America killed by firearms is extraordinary compared to other nations, and I don’t think we’re a bloodthirsty country,” he said. “We need to look at everything we can do to safeguard our people.”"
msnbc169,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/gun-lexicon-if-you-speak-out-speak-accura,"I bet you can tell the difference between a horse and a zebra. But can you identify the family, genus, species and subspecies of every animal on the planet?

Like zoo animals, guns are familiar to us all–we see them in movies, many of us own guns. But few of us are experts.

The vast lexicon of gun verbiage is arcane and incredibly technical, and misused most often by the voices most vocal on gun control. Sometimes it’s ignorance, but more often it’s an effort to scare and confuse the public to advance a political agenda. Either way, if we’re going to solve gun crime, we have to get our facts straight. Here’s a crash course.

The term “rapid fire” is meant to conjure scary images of fully automatic bullet spray. Think Rambo–squeeze the trigger and 30 rounds spit out. But the weapons used in Aurora, Newtown, and virtually every other mass shooting in recent history were not fully automatic. They were semi-automatic, meaning one trigger pull, one round.

Rapid fire doesn’t describe the gun used, it describes the shooter’s ability to shoot and reload quickly. So when you say you want to ban “rapid-fire guns,” you might be talking about the handgun your mom keeps by her bed or even the shotgun your dad hunts deer with.

There is no such thing as “high-capacity ammunition,” as the Washington Post called it, or “high-capacity weapons,” as Politico called them. High capacity refers only to magazines, the ammunition-feeding device.

But even when used correctly, the term is arbitrary. There’s no single definition for what makes a magazine high-capacity. The 1994 assault weapons ban limited magazines to 10 rounds, because that probably sounded sufficiently scary.

But banning high capacity magazines is like banning big gulps. Shooters can get around magazine restrictions by–you guessed it–buying more magazines.

Assault weapons is the mother of irresponsible, meaningless catch-all terms.

The term is so ambiguous that neither the federal government nor individual states have a single definition. The 1994 ban defined an assault weapon as a rifle or pistol that has a detachable magazine and at least two other largely cosmetic features, like a bayonet mount, flash suppressor, or pistol grip.

Even each of the seven U.S. states that has an assault weapons ban defines them differently.

Gun control activists most likely mean semi-automatic weapons, and again, that’s a category that includes the most popular guns used for self-defense, competition shooting and hunting.

This may seem like nitpicking. But when President Obama promises that “no one is talking about taking away your hunting rifle or your self-defense handgun” it matters that gun control activists may in fact be talking about taking away your hunting rifle or your self-defense handgun, whether they know it or not.

So let’s forgo the arbitrary, ambiguous, fear-mongering terms and get specific about what we actually mean by gun control. It may be politically effective to rail against “rapid-fire, high-capacity assault weapons” but it doesn’t actually mean anything. If we’re serious about solving gun crime, we should at least start by getting the terms right."
msnbc170,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/nra-blames-hollywood-culture-violence,"After the nation observed a moment of silence at 9:30 a.m. this morning, exactly one week after 20 children and six teachers were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the National Rifle Association broke its silence and delivered its highly anticipated message to the nation. NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre blamed a range of factors but specifically targeted Hollywood, the media and the video game industry for the heightened culture of violence, specifically gun violence, in the United States.

LaPierre discussed the “dirty little truth that the media try their best to conceal”–that the media’s celebration of violence and the glorification of killers “act as silent enablers.” Equally, video games allow players to simulate mass murder. His solution? The nation must deploy armed guards for every school. The lobbying group plans to initiate this effort by launching the National School Shield Program, headed by former Congressman Asa Hutchinson.

There’s the blood-soaked slasher films like “American Psycho” and “Natural Born Killers” that are aired like propaganda loops on “Splatterdays” and every day, and a thousand music videos that portray life as a joke and murder as a way of life. And then they have the nerve to call it “entertainment.” But is that what it really is? Isn’t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? In a race to the bottom, media conglomerates compete with one another to shock, violate and offend every standard of civilized society by bringing an ever-more-toxic mix of reckless behavior and criminal cruelty into our homes—every minute of every day of every month of every year.



LaPierre said the media’s emphasis on violence breeds a more violent society. But James Poniewozik of TIME wrote that “violent video games, and other gory entertainments, are popular in Japan, where guns and gun murders are scarce. If this doesn’t exonerate, or excuse, dumb violence, it at least indicates that armed assaults don’t leap fully formed from American TVs.” He points to a media scholar’s research that pop-culture violence does not directly cause real violence.

Hollywood stars released a new ad today petitioning President Obama and Congress to end gun violence. President Obama responded personally via YouTube today to the 32 separate gun control petitions and once again backed “common sense legislation that has the support of the majority of American people,” such as banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. “I will do everything in my power as president to advance these efforts, because if there’s even one thing we can do as a country to protect our children, we have a responsibility to try.”

Since LaPierre did not take any questions at the press conference, a flurry of celebrities responded on Twitter.

msnbc171,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/introducing-the-nra-kingmakers,"The rites of spring rarely change. Every year, even before the season opens for wild turkey shooting, hunters begin sighting-in their shotguns in the field. And just like the beginning of the hunting season, every spring, members of the National Rifle Association will learn whom their leaders have quietly picked for reelection to the NRA’s governing board. Eligible NRA members will also receive their paper ballots in the mail.

The NRA board appoints a shadowy committee to handpick almost every candidate appearing on the ballot annually. The Nominating Committee members for this year’s NRA board elections include highly-connected Republican leaders, along with figures connected to the nation’s largest conservative lobbying group, gun manufacturers, and even the New York State Police, reporting and internal documents obtained by msnbc show.

The NRA board appointed nine individuals, including six board members and three people from outside the NRA, to the 2013 Nominating Committee last summer—before Mitt Romney’s loss in the presidential race and December’s Newtown, Connecticut Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

But few NRA members—less than 7%—even take the time to vote. “I don’t bother anymore,” posted an NRA member in California, under the screen name HunterJim, “the insiders have set this system up so no outsider is going to be elected.”

Learning who is on the board’s Nominating Committee provides a rare window into the usually obscure gun lobby. At a time when the Obama administration and California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein have proposed a ban on assault or military-style semi-automatic weapons, the NRA is moving in the other direction—having placed three “black gun” or Bushmaster AR-15 advocates on the 2013 Nominating Committee. The NRA is also reaching out to Latinos, perhaps realizing that, like the GOP, it must diversify if it is to survive. Even as some conservatives begin to wonder out loud whether the gun lobby has become a liability, the NRA is connecting with different camps within the Republican Party, along with the conservative and neo-conservative movements.

“These people don’t have the slightest idea how to make their case before a skeptical and increasingly liberal public,” recently wrote one blogger with the user name kowalski, on RedState.com. “It’s not their ideas—it’s the presentation of those ideas by these toupeed old white males who are positively hated in this culture right now but they still cannot face the music.”

There are usually up to 30 candidates on the ballot to elect 25 directors, or nearly one-third of NRA directors, to serve a three-year term. (One director, the 76th board member, is elected annually from the NRA’s convention floor to serve for one year.)

Although a few candidates often make the ballot through a grassroots petition, the rest are placed there by the Nominating Committee and almost all of their choices win. It “is a sad testimony to how seriously flawed the NRA election process is” noted gun rights blogger Jeff Knox, “and the NRA’s unwillingness” to change it.

Matt Schlapp, one of the 2013 members of the Nominating Committee, is a former senior White House adviser to President George W. Bush who served as deputy assistant to the president and director of political affairs. Schlapp is also a board member of the American Conservative Union. He is not an NRA board member and holds no publicly discernible position on the NRA.

“I’ve only attended one meeting,” said Schlapp who confirmed his role on the 2013 Nominating Committee in a brief telephone interview with msnbc.

Another committee member, Joseph P. DeBergalis Jr., is a 25-year-veteran New York State Police Officer and supervising investigator, according to a report by the Albany Times Union. DeBergalis has been a board director for the NRA since 2009. DeBergalis, whose name is not listed on the NRA website’s list of board directors, is from New York, which recently passed the strictest assault-weapons restrictions in the country.

The N.Y. State Trooper is a competitive sports shooter and a “black rifle”, or Bushmaster AR-15 advocate, according to the website of ARFCOM or AR-15.com, a gun rights community that endorsed DeBergalis’ past two successful bids for the NRA board. The Bushmaster AR-15 gained notoriety in 2012 after it was used in December’s grade school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. DeBergalis did not return calls requesting comment and NRA officials at the organization’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, declined to comment on why his name was not listed on the site.

DeBergalis also has ties to Brownells Company, an Iowa-based firearms manufacturer specializing in selling firearms accessories, parts, and gunsmith tools to the public, as well as police departments across the nation. The company’s website boasts that Brownells “respects and supports the 2nd Amendment—protecting your right to keep and bear arms.” Brownnells Company chief executive officer, Pete Brownell, serves with DeBergalis on the NRA board. DeBergalis is also a Brownells Company “Volunteer Training Instructor,” according to the Brownell Company’s website.

The make-up of this year’s Nominating Committee also suggests that the NRA may be attempting to diversify beyond what one gun rights blogger called “the OFWG” or “Old Fat White Guy hoe-down.” Nearly a handful of African-Americans are now on the NRA’s board, most notably the former Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers forward Karl Malone, who has been the face of the gun lobby’s “I’m the NRA” national advertisements. Yet it is still hard to find many African-Americans at NRA conventions. “I met twelve black persons in attendance at [last year’s NRA] conference in St. Louis,” wrote Rick Ector in his blog Legally Armed in Detroit.

Will the gun lobby do any better with Latinos? Another Nominating Committee member is Antonio Hernández. He is one of the first Hispanics recruited for the Nominating Committee; since 2001, there has been one Chicano on the NRA board. Hernández is the deputy legal counsel of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico, and endorsed Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Hernández holds no other position in the NRA. In a brief telephone interview, he confirmed his assignment and said that he is a sports shooter.

Following the intense scrutiny the NRA has faced in the wake of the Newtown massacre, some Republicans have begun to openly worry about their association with the gun lobby. At a time when Republican leaders are trying to reach out to both Latinos and women, some fear the NRA and its stubborn response to gun violence may only hinder the GOP’s appeal.

The experience of NRA director H. Joaquin Jackson underscores the gun lobby’s challenge as it tries to diversify. Already a storied Texas Ranger, Jackson gained national prominence when he was recruited by the actor/director Tommy Lee Jones to play a Texas Sheriff in the 1995 TV film “The Good Old Boys.” In 2001, the NRA’s then-Nominating Committee put Jackson on the election slate for the board, where he has served since. But in 2005 Jackson told the Texas Monthly in an on-camera interview that he opposed both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, leading some NRA members to demand he be recalled. Jackson, who later said he misspoke, is one of the board members up for reelection this spring.

“I was very disappointed watching that news conference—which it wasn’t—it was just a painful slog from one end to the other,” posted kowalski on RedState.com following NRA chief executive officer Wayne LaPierre’s press conference one week after the Newtown shooting. “What LaPierre said in the abstract was helpful, but he really did look and sound like he was delivering the message from a funeral home, as the undertaker of something already dead.”

Last month, reporting for Mother Jones, I obtained the NRA Report of the 2012 Nominating Committee to elect candidates to the NRA’s current board of directors.

“There is little change of any injection new blood,” complained gun rights blogger Knox. “Historically we can expect that at least 23 of the 25 incumbents will win reelection.”

The NRA’s 2012 Nominating Committee Chairman was Patricia A. Clark, a competitive sports shooter and longtime NRA board director who happens to live in Newtown, Connecticut just a few miles from the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Quietly serving under her on the same 2012 Nominating Committee was George Kollitides II, the chief executive officer of the North Carolina-based Freedom Group, one of the nation’s largest gun making consortiums that made the Bushmaster AR-15 rifled used in Newtown, last summer in Aurora, Colorado, and in and around Washington by the DC sniper a decade earlier.

One 2013 Nominating Committee member, Carolyn D. Meadows, sits on the board of the both the NRA and the American Conservative Union. Two other NRA directors, the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist and NRA President David Keene, are also on the ACU board. (Another ACU director, Asa Hutchinson, is an NRA consultant. A former U.S. Attorney, Arkansas Republican Party chairman, and Bush administration drug enforcement chief, Hutchinson was recently appointed by NRA CEO LaPierre to lead the NRA’s National School Shield Emergency Response Program that aims to put armed guards or police in every school.)

The rest of this year’s Nominating Committee are pulled from the gun lobby’s own locker. William H. Allen, this year’s Nominating Committee chairman, serves as Inspector with Tennessee’s largest Sheriff’s office. Allen is also a champion competitive shooter and Second Amendment activist who, like DeBergalis, enjoys the support of the AR15.com “black gun” group.

Charles L. Cotton, pulls double-duty as the NRA’s trustee of its Civil Rights Defense Fund and takes up cases to establish legal precedents in favor of gun owners, along with his work on the Nomination Committee. Longtime NRA director, Ret. Air Force Gen. William H. Satterfield served in the Reagan administration as both general counsel of the Federal Regulatory Commission, and as deputy solicitor in the U.S. Interior Department. Rounding out the committee is J.D. Williams a Texas-based lawyer and former trustee of the NRA Foundation. Williams and Satterfield each seem more like older generations of NRA leaders, as they are both hunters and conservationists involved in preserving wildlife habitat for game fowl and waterfowl.

Richard Pearson is not an NRA director but, like fellow committee members DeBergalis and Allen, Pearson competes in High Power matches using AR-15 and other long-range, semi-automatic rifles. He is the third person appointed by the board from outside the gun lobby—after Schlapp and Hernandez–to the Nominating Committee. An insurance broker, Pearson is executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association and a certified semi-automatic firearms instructor.

This year, some of the better known NRA directors up for reelection include former Republican Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, Brownells gun maker CEO Pete Brownell, retired All-Pro NFL defensive tackle, sports shooter, and former spokesman for Winchester and Fiocchi Ammunition Dave Butz, former Idaho Senator Larry Craig –who resigned over allegations of sexual impropriety in a men’s room, Marion P. Hammer, the petite grandmother and gun rights advocate most responsible for Florida’s Stand-Your-Ground law, former Iran-Contra-era White House official and news commentator Oliver North, and the rock artist and Vietnam War-era draft dodger, who last year was visited by the U.S. Secret Service after using threatening language against President Obama, Ted Nugent.

The Nominating Committee controls the slate for board and knowing the composition of this year’s Nominating Committee suggests that –despite America’s worst gun tragedy two months ago at the Sandy Hook school—the NRA is already planning to dig in and fight any proposed restrictions or regulations of guns, no matter how reasonable they may seem to the rest of the nation."
msnbc172,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congressional-republicans-still-back-looser-gun-restrictions,"Close video Murphy pushes Congress on guns as US suffers another gun massacre Senator Chris Murphy talks with Rachel Maddow about resistance in Congress to doing anything to prevent any future gun massacre in the United States and where he sees the possibility of progress on gun restriction legislation. share tweet email save Embed

In the wake of the devastating mass shooting in Las Vegas, several Democratic policymakers are renewing their push for measures intended to reduce gun violence. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), for example, said yesterday he’s moving forward with a proposal to strengthen background checks – an idea that’s long enjoyed broad national support.

Also yesterday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reached out to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), requesting that Congress create a bipartisan select committee on gun violence to examine which policies are most effective in saving lives.

In all likelihood, Republicans will ignore these requests. In fact, as the Washington Post reported, GOP lawmakers are eyeing new proposals to weaken gun restrictions, not strengthen them.

Last month, a House committee advanced a bill, the Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, that would make it easier to buy firearm silencers, which are treated akin to machine guns and explosives by federal authorities. Advocates of the measure, including the National Rifle Association, have cast it as a safety enhancement. […] The legislation also includes provisions that would loosen restrictions on transporting firearms across state lines and prevent certain types of ammunition from being designated as “armor-piercing” and thus subject to tighter federal oversight.

The bill, which we’ve been keeping an eye on in recent months, was poised to come up for a vote this week, but in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, GOP leaders have delayed consideration of the legislation.

If that sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because this isn’t the first time: Republicans initially delayed the bill on silencers because of the mass shooting that nearly killed House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). In other words, a mass shooting delayed a Republican gun bill, which made a comeback, only to be delayed by another mass shooting.

GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, are also eyeing a bill to allow states to honor conceal-carry permits across state lines, potentially weakening state-based restrictions, though it too will probably be delayed by the Las Vegas slayings.

If either (or both) of the measures pass, it won’t even be the first gun bill approved by this Congress. A bill to expand gun access for the mentally impaired was approved in February.

Indeed, we appear to be looking at an arrow that’s only allowed to point in one direction. After the gun massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, the only federal gun measures that passed eased gun restrictions. A year after Newtown, the Boston Globe examined state laws and reported, “Today, it is easier, not harder, to carry a gun in many parts of the nation than it was before the Newtown massacre last Dec. 14.”

So long as GOP officials have power, this will continue indefinitely."
msnbc173,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/lawmakers-introduce-measure-ban-high-capacity-magazines-0,"A group of lawmakers introduced a measure in Washington on Thursday that aims to end the sale of large-capacity ammunition, used by mass shooters in Newtown, Connecticut; Aurora, Colorado; Tucson, Arizona; and Fort Hood, Texas.

Co-sponsors Rep. Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut and Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, both Democrats, unveiled the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act. The bill would ban the importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

“The only thing more senseless than the gun violence that has taken too many of our nation’s children and countless innocent Americans is the failure of Congress to pass common sense gun safety measures, like this one, that are supported by 90 percent of the American public,” Menendez said.

RELATED: Newtown families sue rifle manufacturer

High-capacity magazines can hold up to 100 rounds of ammunition. During the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, the gunman used a 30-round high-capacity magazine to fire 154 shots in less than five minutes. He killed 20 first-graders and six educators. Eleven students escaped because the gunman had to pause to reload his gun. Supporters argue the new bill could save lives by forcing potential future shooters to change magazines more often.

Eight states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning large-capacity ammunition.

Several gun-control advocates joined Esty and Menendez during their afternoon press conference, including House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and advocates from the Newtown Action Alliance. The measure also includes the authorization of buyback program for high-capacity magazines.

RELATED: The gun control success stories you haven’t heard

For almost two years, Congress has been in a stalemate about gun-safety legislation, following the failure of the Senate to pass a comprehensive and bipartisan background checks bill in April 2013. In that time, nearly 100 school shootings have occurred on American soil, the FBI says mass shootings are on the rise, and active-shooter and lockdown drills have become part of children’s academic routines. A review of 62 mass shootings in a 20-year span found that large-capacity ammunition magazines were used in half of the incidents.

Ten families that were affected by the mass shooting at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, 2012, filed a lawsuit in December against Bushmaster for making, distributing, and selling the AR-15 rifle. The action alleges negligence and wrongful death."
msnbc174,[],,http://www.msnbc.com/slideshow/inside-the-2016-nra-convention,"This May, Louisville, Kentucky played host to the National Rifle Association convention — an annual meeting of pistols and politics that this year boasted a 500,000 square foot firearms display. The convention, conceived by the Union officers who founded the NRA after the Civil War, is in its 145th year.

On its opening night, NRA leaders endorsed Donald Trump for president just before the presumptive Republican nominee took the stage and declared, “crooked Hillary Clinton is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office.”

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre also chimed in on the Democratic front-runner, saying that “if she could, Hillary would ban every gun, destroy every magazine, run an entire national security industry right into the ground and put gun-owners’ names on a government registration list.”

“Hillary Clinton,” warned NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox, “has a legitimate chance to be the next president as long as people like us stay home.”

In response, Clinton, who has advocated for change in American gun policy but has never suggested, despite Trump’s claims, abolishing the Second Amendment, tweeted that the country should not accept 33,000 gun deaths in a year as “normal,” adding that “we can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence.”

Meanwhile, hundreds of NRA members, toddlers in tow and guns in hand, shopped the grounds of the convention showroom, where patriotic emblems abound and defense of the “Constitutional right to bear arms,” is key.
