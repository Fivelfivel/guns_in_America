KR 0.20% said it would stop selling guns to buyers under 21 years old through its Fred Meyer locations, the third major retailer to tighten its policies while lawmakers continue to debate how to respond to the latest school shooting in America.

The U.S.’s largest supermarket chain said Thursday it would raise the minimum age to purchase arms and ammunition in all of its Fred Meyer stores in response to the Parkland, Fla., high-school tragedy. Kroger currently sells firearms at 43 Fred Meyer locations in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

Kroger stopped selling assault-style semiautomatic rifles in Oregon, Washington and Idaho at Fred Meyer stores several years ago and decided Wednesday to no longer sell those style of guns or special orders for them in Alaska, a spokeswoman said.

Kroger’s Fred Meyer chain, which the company acquired through a merger in 1999, sells general merchandise, including home items, electronics and sporting goods. Kroger sold roughly $7 million worth of firearms and ammunition out of $115 billion in total sales in its 2016 fiscal year, the company said.

“Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers,” said Jessica Adelman, a spokeswoman for the Cincinnati-based chain. “In response to the tragic events in Parkland and elsewhere, we’ve taken a hard look at our policies and procedures for firearm sales.”

Meijer Inc., also said Thursday it would raise the minimum age to purchase ammunition in stores to 21 years old. The 235-location, general-merchandise chain based in Grand Rapids, Mich., doesn’t sell firearms, said a spokesman for the company.

Bi-Mart, a regional sporting goods chain with 77 stores, said Thursday it also would raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm or ammunition to 21. The Eugene, Ore., company sells rifles and shotguns, but doesn’t sell assault-style weapons or high-capacity magazines.

“We agree with many policy makers and our peers that increasing the age limit to 21, in order to purchase a firearm, is a step in the right direction,” the company said. “We will continue to carry our current selection of items for the hunter and sport shooter.”

The retailers’ moves follow announcements by two of the largest U.S. firearms retailers. Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. on Wednesday raised the purchase age for guns to 21. Dick’s also said it would stop selling high-capacity magazines at all its stores and halt sales of assault-style rifles at its 35 Field and Stream stores. Walmart halted sales of assault-style rifles in 2015.

It is unclear how many gun buyers are under 21, because the federal government doesn’t track sales and the Federal Bureau of Investigation doesn’t disclose the age of applicants for background checks. The FBI conducted 25.2 million background checks for firearms last year, down from a record 27.5 million in 2016.

Under current law, licensed gun dealers can sell a handgun to someone 21 years old and sell a rifle to someone who is 18. President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have expressed support for raising the age limit for rifle sales, but the National Rifle Association has rejected any such move. An NRA spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The alleged 19-year-old Parkland shooter left 17 people dead and has prompted a growing list of U.S. companies to re-evaluate their gun-selling policies and preferential treatment to NRA members. Many companies have taken a stand on gun control in response to a social-media movement spurring the action, but the moves can come with reputational risks.

The Domini Impact Investments LLC mutual fund in 2016 asked Kroger to stop selling semiautomatic weapons in its stores. Kroger challenged the resolution, and federal regulators sided with the company because such investor requests generally can’t govern what a company sells.

In addition to the increased age limit, Kroger is reducing space devoted to firearms in its Fred Meyer stores in response to “softer demand and changing customer preferences,” Ms. Adelman said. Fred Meyer stores currently sell shotguns, .22-caliber rifles, bolt-action hunting rifles and handguns.

The gunman who authorities said killed at least 59 people at a Las Vegas music festival appears to have used at least one rifle outfitted with a device that allowed the weapon to fire at a rapid rate, and had nearly two dozen firearms in his hotel room, law-enforcement officials said.

Investigators found 23 firearms in a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. The weapons included AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles as well as a large cache of ammunition, two law-enforcement officials said.

At least one of the guns was outfitted with a “bump stock,” a device that allows the weapon to increase the rate of fire on a semiautomatic rifle, one of the officials said.

The​gunman alternated between two windows in the hotel room, ​firing​upon thousands of concertgoers below, ​one official said. The staccato of automatic gunfire could be heard in videos of the shooting that were posted online. ​

The suspect, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, killed himself before police entered the hotel room, authorities said.

Las Vegas Massacre

Investigators searching Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nev., retrieved 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition, Las Vegas police officials said Monday.

Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said they also found Tannerite, an​explosive that detonates when shot by bullets and is used in target practice.

In Paddock’s car, authorities found more ammunition and ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used to make explosives, Mr. Lombardo said.

Automatic rifles, which meet the legal definition of a machine gun, can fire continuously with one pull of a trigger and are heavily restricted under federal law.

The AK-47, invented for the Soviet Army following World War II, is sometimes used as a generic label for a family of guns that are found on battlefields around the world, often identifiable by a wood stock and grips.

The gun can toggle between automatic and semiautomatic, though manufacturers sell civilian versions that fire semiautomatic only.

The AR-15, originally developed by Armalite and Colt, is a semiautomatic rifle that resembles the black firearms carried by U.S. soldiers.

Gun experts speculated on Twitter and in online groups that the gunman may have used an accessory to ramp up the rate of fire on a semiautomatic rifle, such as a trigger crank or bump stock, which uses a combination of forward movement and recoil to engage the trigger rapidly. Such accessories are far cheaper and easier to obtain than an automatic weapon.

The 1934 National Firearms Act requires automatic weapons to be registered with the federal government, unlike semiautomatic firearms.

A 1986 law prohibits civilian possession of machine guns that weren’t registered before May of that year. The law exempts automatic firearms possessed by or sold to government agencies.

As of April, 630,019 machine guns were registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including more than 11,700 in Nevada, up from 456,930 machine guns in 2010. That number includes weapons to be used by government officials and unserviceable guns that are purchased as ornaments.

Conversion kits that allow gun owners to turn a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic one are treated the same as machine guns themselves, said David Kopel, a Colorado attorney and gun-rights advocate. Such a conversion by a civilian would have had to have been done before 1986 in order to be legal.

Until 2016, would-be buyers of machine guns had to receive permission from their local sheriff or chief of police and submit their photos and fingerprints to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Many buyers, unable to get law-enforcement sign off, resorted to buying machine guns, silencers and other heavily regulated weapons through trusts, legal entities that were subject to fewer restrictions.

ATF eliminated the need for law-enforcement permission while imposing background checks on those who buy weapons through trusts. Now, buyers need only alert their local authorities to their federal applications for machine guns or other weapon regulated under the National Firearms Act.

Mateen was able to buy several weapons before the attacks, despite the fact that he was known to the FBI. Photo: Zachary Scheffer for The Wall Street Journal

As authorities investigated the shooting Sunday that left 50 people dead, President Obama and other advocates for gun control made calls for stricter laws governing gun ownership.

In statements made Sunday afternoon, President Obama called the shooting “a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or a house of worship, or a movie theater, or a nightclub.”

Related Videos In a press conference, President Obama said the shooting at the Orlando nightclub Pulse, which claimed 51 lives so far, marked the deadliest in United States history. Photo: AP

He reiterated a need for stricter gun laws, saying, “To actively do nothing is a decision as well,” but didn’t elaborate on type of changes he would like to see. In the past, Mr. Obama has called for stricter background checks on gun purchases and for more research on technology to make guns safer, among other measures.

Florida has some of the friendliest laws for gun owners in the nation. The state imposes no restrictions on the design or magazine capacity of the AR-15 and other modern semiautomatic rifles of the type officials say was wielded by the suspected gunman, Omar S. Mateen.

While every state allows concealed carrying of guns in some form, Florida is one of more than two dozen in which authorities must grant concealed-carry licenses for applicants, as long as they have no disqualifying criminal convictions. Applicants must submit to a background check and must show competency with a firearm.

A state database shows Mateen was a licensed security officer and had a license to carry a handgun in the performance of his security duties. That license requires applicants to submit proof of firearms training and undergo a criminal-background check.

FBI official Ronald Hopper said at a press conference in Florida that the FBI had investigated Mateen in 2013 and 2014 for possible links to terrorist movements but that agents didn’t find enough to merit continuing either investigation. At the time of the attack, Mateen wasn’t under investigation or under surveillance, Mr. Hopper said in response to questions about why the suspect had been able to purchase weapons despite these red flags.

An ATF official at the press conference said his team had traced the weapons found at the scene of the attack and determined that Mateen had legally bought at least two firearms in recent days. “He is not a prohibited person so he can legally walk in to a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms,” said the official. “He did so. And he did so within the last week or so,” the official said. The official declined to say where the guns were purchased.

State law allows Floridians with concealed-carry licenses to wear their firearms in most places, but guns are barred from schools, college campuses, courthouses, government buildings and establishments that serve alcohol as their main purpose, according to gun-law experts. Florida law bar civilians from carrying rifles in public, except to convey them in their cars to hunts, gun ranges and shooting-sports events.

It is unclear whether Pulse, the Orlando nightclub, allowed its patrons to carry concealed weapons. Gun-rights activists in the past have argued that so-called “gun-free” zones, in which weapons are banned, become soft targets for those with intent to kill.

Florida was among the first states to pass a “stand your ground” law in 2005, eliminating a legal obligation to attempt a retreat before using deadly force against a perceived threat. The law became a focal point after the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, by a neighborhood watch volunteer.

""Florida’s approach to gun laws does nothing to prevent these types of tragedies—in fact, quite the opposite—and makes it all too easy for people intent on doing harm, from terrorists to domestic abusers to violent felons, to get guns,” said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry group for gun manufacturers, declined to comment on President Obama’s remarks or the shooting. A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Florida is one of a handful of states that ban carrying firearms openly, including California and New York, according to OpenCarry.org, a gun rights site that tracks firearms laws. The Florida Supreme Court is considering a challenge to the state’s open-carry ban. The National Rifle Association has asked the court to hold that “the open and peaceful bearing of arms is constitutionally protected conduct,” according to a brief filed in April.

The NRA says it has about 300,000 members in Florida. The NRA’s top lobbyist in Florida is Marion Hammer, one of the group’s long-serving advocates and a former NRA president. She is often described by both gun-rights advocates and supporters of increased gun regulation as the NRA’s ace.

Still, two NRA-backed bills to lift the open-carry ban and permit firearms on college campuses failed in the Florida Senate this year.

The 2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn., in which 27 people were killed, many of them young children, led to a push for tighter gun laws at the federal level, though the proposed bill was defeated in the Senate in April 2013. A handful of states, including Washington, Oregon and Maryland, have since changed their gun laws in an attempt to prevent more gun deaths.

A CASHMERE SWEATER offers posh assistance. A face-obscuring scarf helps, too. I’ve learned, however, that the real secret to fighting truly cruel cold is to wear legging-like pants under your trousers. I’m not talking about your father’s “long johns”—saggy and sad with the texture and style quotient of a burlap sack. These are base layers: closefitting, lightweight and almost supernaturally warm. And unlike long johns, which convey a sort of folksy, log-cabin sensibility, “base layers have more of a tech element,” said Angelo Spagnolo, 28, a staff writer at the website BuzzFeed, who wears Uniqlo Heattech tights under his trousers as a seasonal suit of armor.

While athletic brands have long sold thick compression under-layers, intended to help you retain body heat when you’re snowboarding or ice skating, recent innovations have allowed for thinner, lighter iterations that are bringing the concept off the ski slopes and onto city streets in a big way.

When seen on store racks, the new guy-leggings (and long-sleeve T-shirts)—from both relative newbie brands like Aether and stalwarts like Patagonia—look interchangeable, like identical castoffs from Spiderman’s closet. Unless a cold front happens to be plowing through the fitting room, the only way to test them is out in the real world. And so I did during a recent trip to Santa Fe (average December low: 18 degrees). Here, a brief guide to four base layer pants from the most popular brands.

To start, Pennsylvania Rep. Michael Doyle, who manages the Democratic team, invited the Republican team to the Democratic club tonight for dinner. Republican manager Joe Barton of Texas accepted, joking he’ll be bringing his “food tester.”

It be Mr. Barton’s second time at the club in his more than 31 years in Congress – and the two coaches spent most of their joint press conference talking about how times have become more partisan in Washington, and attributing it to a climate that may have led to the shooting on Wednesday morning.

“Members are not looked at as people anymore, we’re kind of looked at, I won’t say targets, but people think they can come to our town hall meetings and just say the most obnoxious things and think we won’t feel it,” Mr. Barton said, referencing the rowdy constituent meetings that members have faced as they’ve gone home this year.

Mr. Doyle pointed to the pressure on members to get home right after votes on Thursday or Friday said to not assimilate to Congress, saying it limits time to socialize.

“We’re not allowed to stay here because then we’ve gone Washington,” he said.

The two hope that the game brings a sense of camaraderie and raises money for charity – though they both adamantly refused the idea that the teams should not be drawn across party lines, an idea floating around on Twitter as a sign of bipartisanship. Both said they were plotting ideas to honor Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and hoped he could watch it on CSPAN from the hospital."

Mr. Kalashnikov in London launching a vodka drink in 2004 Associated Press

Mr. Kalashnikov died in Izhevsk on Monday at age 94, after a long illness, said Yelena Filatova, a spokeswoman for the gun's manufacturer, Kalashnikov Concern. She didn't give further details.

Mr. Kalashnikov said the automatic rifle was designed ""to protect the motherland"" after World War II. But the AK-47 and its descendants and knockoffs became mainstays for armies and guerrilla soldiers around the globe. Light, durable, cheap to manufacture and simple to maintain, the rifle creates a deadly spray of bullets without much of a kick.

The design of the Avtomat Kalashnikova—or Kalashnikov's automatic—spread widely after its rollout in 1949. It is estimated that 100 million have been produced.

Mr. Kalashnikov said he regretted that it became the weapon of choice for guerrilla armies. ""It was like a genie out of the bottle, and it began to walk all on its own and in directions I did not want,"" he told Britain's Guardian newspaper in 2003. But he added, ""I sleep soundly. The fact that people die because of an AK-47 is not because of the designer, but because of politics.""

Mr. Kalashnikov's biography took on near-mythic proportions, propelled by a Communist media apparatus hungry for peasant heroes. He was the child of near-illiterate peasants, born in the remote region of Altai, where the family farmed, according to published reports.

But during Stalin's agricultural collectivization in 1930, his father was deemed a class enemy and the family lost its land. The father died soon after the family was deported to the Siberian region of Tomsk.

Short of stature and mechanically adept, Mr. Kalashnikov said he dreamed of becoming a poet. But as World War II got under way, he joined a tank brigade. Injured early in the war, he was assigned to a firearms lab.

Soviet engineers had developed a new, smaller gun cartridge, and after the war the Soviet Army declared a contest to design a gun to fire it. Working with a team, Mr. Kalashnikov created the winning design. He later married the project's draftswoman.

Mr. Kalashnikov became a national hero and subject of multiple biographies in Russian. He was twice named a Hero of Socialist Labor, one the USSR's highest honors, and in 2009 a Hero of the Russian Federation. He also served as a member of the Supreme Soviet, the USSR's rubber-stamp legislative body.

He continued to work into his 80s as the chief designer and a consultant at the arms factory in Izhevsk, Russia, where the AK-47 was first manufactured.

The rifle's use shows no signs of flagging. In the fall of 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he had ordered an upgraded version of the AK-47.

""Blame the Nazi Germans for making me become a gun designer,"" Mr. Kalashnikov said in 2007 at an event marking the 60th anniversary of the gun.

Several companies have cut ties to the National Rifle Association after consumers took to social media to voice outrage against the gun lobby, days after a Florida high-school shooting left 17 people dead.

Insurance giants Chubb Ltd. CB -0.37% and MetLife , MET 0.93% cybersecurity company Symantec Corp. SYMC -0.24% , and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Enterprise, Alamo and National rental-car chains, were among those that said they would end partnerships with the NRA.

Saturday, both Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL -0.04% and United Airlines, a unit of United Continental Holdings Inc., UAL -0.30% ended their discount travel programs with the organization. The airlines also asked the NRA to remove their information from its website.

Companies are reacting partly in response to a social-media movement to pressure or boycott entities with NRA ties, energized by the emotional calls for gun-control action from survivors of the shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and students around the country. On Friday, the hashtag “#BoycottNRA” was among the top trends on Twitter nationally.

One of the first companies to sever ties was First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately owned bank in the U.S. The bank said Thursday it wouldn’t renew its contract with the NRA for a co-branded credit card, which was promoted as the “official credit card of the NRA.” The NRA Visa card offered a $40 cash-back bonus, enough to pay for the gun lobby’s $40 annual membership fee.

“Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA,” the bank said in a Twitter post, following which it decided not to renew its contract.

An NRA spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the companies’ decisions to cease such partnerships. But in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, NRA head Wayne LaPierre railed against “the elites” for renewing calls on gun-ownership limits. “As usual, the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,” Mr. LaPierre said.

In recent years, companies and their leaders have become vocal on issues such as transgenderism, immigration policy and gay rights. Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN 0.73% Jeff Bezos last month granted $33 million in college scholarships for illegal immigrant high-school graduates in the U.S. In the aftermath of North Carolina’s now-repealed “bathroom bill,” which required transgender people to use public bathrooms based on their birth sex, companies including PayPal Holdings Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Adidas AG scuttled or froze plans to add jobs in the state.

However, the business community has been more reticent about wading into the gun-control debate. Many companies worry about the threat of boycotts from the NRA, which claims some 5 million members, said Larry Hutcher, a co-founder and managing partner at New York law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, who has advised companies on public-relations crises.

That corporate reluctance may be changing as public support for some gun-control measures appears to be building, Mr. Hutcher said. A Quinnipiac University National Poll conducted earlier this week found that two-thirds of American voters support stricter gun control, the highest level of support measured by the survey ever.

“Companies are looking at the same numbers as we do,” Mr. Hutcher said. “That’s why they feel confident enough to terminate these relationships.”

Enterprise Holdings, which had a partnership with the NRA to provide discounts to the association’s members, said Thursday that its three rental-car brands would end the discount program on March 26. Hertz Global Holdings HTZ 0.94% and Avis Budget Group followed with similar announcements on Friday.

Symantec said it would stop a discount program for its LifeLock identity-theft and Norton anti-malware software for NRA members. Chubb said it planned to stop underwriting NRA-branded insurance policies for gun owners, though it said it had made the decision several months ago.

The NRA, like many member associations, has had discount partnerships with numerous companies listed on its website for products ranging from wine to hotel reservations to FedEx shipping expenses. Lists of many of those companies have circulated on social media with calls to pressure them to end their relationships with the gun lobby.

FedEx didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other companies targeted in the boycott campaign include Amazon. Under the hashtag #StopNRAmazon, consumers on Twitter have demanded that the company ban NRATV, the gun lobby’s news outlet, from being streamed on Amazon platforms.

Amazon representatives weren’t immediately available for comment.

“I’m someone who will buy napkins from @Amazon rather than go to the store but if @Amazon, @Amazonhelp, and @JeffBezos don’t stop streaming the violent rhetoric of NRAtv, I may have to leave the house again,” tweeted one user.

Democrats in New Jersey are moving forward with several bills to further tighten the state’s gun laws, which are already among the strictest in the nation, making the Garden State the latest to take up the issue after the Florida school shooting that killed 17.

Lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee in the state Assembly will hold a public hearing Wednesday on seven proposed measures, including legislation that would allow law enforcement to seize firearms from people identified by mental-health professionals as serious threats to themselves or others. Another bill would reduce the maximum capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 from 15 rounds.

“We’re going to have a respectful discussion about gun safety focused on common sense solutions that respect the rights of law-abiding citizens,” Assemblywoman Annette Quijano, a Democrat who heads the committee, said in a statement.

Democrats are eager to move forward with new firearm laws after former Republican Gov. Chris Christie vetoed several gun-control measures passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature during his two-term tenure. Mr. Christie did, however, sign legislation shortly before leaving office that banned the semiautomatic firearm accessories known as “bump stocks.”

New Jersey’s new governor, Democrat Phil Murphy, who took office in January, campaigned on a strict gun-control platform. Last week, Mr. Murphy and the governors of New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island said they would work together to restrict the movement of illegal guns between their states and share information about residents who are banned from owning guns.

A spokesman for Mr. Murphy declined to comment on the legislation that will be discussed Wednesday. New Jersey has the country’s third-strictest gun control laws after California and Connecticut, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun-control group.

New Jersey Assemblyman Parker Space, a Republican, said he most likely won’t support the proposed bills, which he described as a “knee-jerk reaction” by Democrats to the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

“They’re just so far out of touch and out of reality on the real logistics on gun ownership in New Jersey,” Mr. Space said. “Law-abiding citizens are going to follow the laws, the people who have intention to hurt people are not going to follow the laws.”

In the state Senate, Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said she has already received some pushback from opponents of new gun restrictions. But Ms. Weinberg, a Democrat, said that she is confident New Jersey will adopt stricter gun-control measures and is optimistic that laws will be passed at the federal level, as well.

“The issues out of Parkland and these enormously articulate young people that have come forth—I have never felt nationally a sense of optimism about gun safety until now,” Ms. Weinberg said, referring to students from the Florida school who have called for new gun laws following the shooting. “This is the first time that I honestly feel we have reached a tipping point.”"

MERCED, Calif.—Hundreds of law-enforcement officers descended on a Northern California county on Wednesday and arrested 49 suspected gang members and seized 120 firearms, including assault rifles and automatic weapons, California’s top prosecutor said.

Attorney General Xavier Becerra said 500 local, state and federal officers swooped into dozens of Merced County neighborhoods in predawn raids targeting Sureno gang members.

“Some of the most violent criminals in our community have been taken off our streets along with many of the weapons they use to commit murder and mayhem,” said Merced County District Attorney Larry Morse.

Officers also confiscated $170,261 in cash and seized cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine with a street value of $1.7 million, Mr. Becerra said.

The raids come after a year-long investigation of violent crimes involving Sureno gang members working for the Mexican Mafia prison gang, Mr. Becerra said.

At least eight homicides and violent assaults have been solved, he said.

The operation was the result of a joint investigation by the California Department of Justice’s Bureau of Investigation, the Merced Area Gang and Narcotic Enforcement Team, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

During his first 25 years hunting big game, Robert Phillips never killed from farther than 250 yards. He wasn’t certain how to calculate the pull of gravity on a bullet traveling farther than that, not to mention the harder-to-calculate effect of wind.

But four years ago, Phillips invested in a rifle and sighting system that does all that calculating for him. On a hunt in New Mexico this fall, Phillips downed an elk with one shot from 683 yards. His longest kill with this new gear came at 1,180 yards, four times beyond any conventional range.

“From that distance, the animal isn’t frightened. It’s not jittery. And you’re not jittery either,” says Phillips, a home builder in Columbus, Ind.

In this ancient American sport, the newest thing is a long-range-shooting system that measures distance, determines wind effect and fires high-powered ammunition. These systems turn hunters into snipers by taking the guesswork out of calculating the effects of gravity and wind on a bullet traveling as far as a mile. Applying technical expertise to firearm sighting systems, new players such as Gunwerks and TrackingPoint are winning shares of a market long dominated by venerable brands like Remington and Winchester. “A TrackingPoint Precision-Guided Firearm ensures never-before-seen precision at extreme distances,” says the website of TrackingPoint, based in Pflugerville, Texas.

Of about 14 million rifle hunters in America, about 5% are using new long-range systems, estimates Gunwerks founder Aaron Davidson. “And I would expect that 5% to turn into 50%,” says Davidson, a mechanical engineer who started his company in 2006. In the hopes of spurring such growth, Davidson’s company produces a cable hunting show called “Long Range Pursuit,” which he says gains about 300,000 viewers a week.

But as if big-game hunting weren’t controversial enough, many of the sport’s own practitioners disapprove of long-range hunting, calling it a violation of a tradition known as fair chase. Getting close to a deer or elk requires stealth and patience. Within 300 yards, the snap of a twig or sudden shift in wind can alert a wild animal that danger is near, sending it under cover. For the hunter, evading a wild animal’s exquisite senses can be one of the greatest thrills of the sport.

‘The animal should have a chance. If you shoot at an animal from 500 yards or farther, you’re depriving him of his tools. You negate his eyesight and his hearing and his sense of smell.’ —David E. Petzal, Field & Stream editor and a hunter since 1960

“The animal should have a chance,” says David E. Petzal, Field & Stream magazine’s field editor and a hunter since 1960. “If you shoot at an animal from 500 yards or farther, you’re depriving him of his tools. You negate his eyesight and his hearing and his sense of smell.”

Long-range shooting is the latest new technology to come to the attention of state wildlife officials, who in various places have limited or banned hunters from using drones, trail cameras and night-vision equipment. This year in Nevada, the state wildlife commission proposed outlawing electronically controlled firing systems on big-game rifles, a measure that could effectively ban some long-range shooting systems. “To their credit, our wildlife commission is taking a stand on technologies they feel are going beyond the fair-chase ethic,” says Tyler Turnipseed, Nevada’s chief game warden.

In a 2014 statement, the Boone and Crockett Club, a 129-year-old conservation and record-keeping group, said the club “finds that long-range shooting takes unfair advantage of the game animal, effectively eliminates the natural capacity of an animal to use its senses and instincts to detect danger, and demeans the hunter/prey relationship in a way that diminishes the importance and relevance of the animal and the hunt.”

Hunting big game ought to be as difficult as hitting a fastball, says Field & Stream’s Petzal. “If you practice it ethically, most of the time you won’t succeed,” says Petzal, who once went 17 seasons without taking an elk despite hunting for one every year. “I’m talking about 2-3 weeks up and down mountains year after year with nothing to show for it,” he says.

Proponents of long-range hunting acknowledge that it can improve a hunter’s chances of making a kill. But what’s wrong with that, they ask, given that hunters often spend tens of thousands of dollars on equipment, travel and licenses in pursuit of animals whose numbers are abundant—sometimes overly abundant? They also say that long-range systems don’t eliminate the element of chase or the grind of hauling heavy equipment up mountains. “It’s no cakewalk,” says Phillips, a 65-year-old Gunwerks customer.

As for ethics, proponents say that super-accurate sighting systems make hunting more humane at any range, by killing animals instantly, thereby reducing the risk of wounded prey escaping. “Without TrackingPoint 14% of animals shot suffer and require two or more shots to be killed. Many are never found,” says a TrackingPoint document. “With TrackingPoint 99.5% of animals are cleanly harvested.”

South Carolina home builder William Sinnett bought a TrackingPoint system not only for himself but for his business partner, who had a habit of jerking when he fired upon a big-game animal.

“He had a tick, so he’d just wound an animal, and sometimes we’d find the animal and sometimes we wouldn’t,” says Sinnett, a former military sharpshooter. Since using the TrackingPoint system, however, “my business partner hasn’t missed a shot,” says Sinnett.

Proponents of long-range shooting also argue that the virtues of creeping close to a big-game animal are overblown. They note that bow hunting—which requires extraordinary stealth—often wounds rather than kills. “Bow hunters wound animals that get away—and that’s unethical,” says Phillips.

One factor likely to limit growth is cost. While a conventional deer rifle can be bought for a few hundred dollars, these ultra-sophisticated rifles and shooting systems can cost a few thousand dollars up to nearly $25,000.

In language reminiscent of the Cold War, Mr. Putin used his annual state-of-the-union address to boast about Russia’s military prowess and put on a display of new armaments, including intercontinental ballistic missiles and underwater drones.

“Efforts to contain Russia have failed,” Mr. Putin said to Russia’s political elite gathered in Manezh Hall adjacent to Red Square, speaking before large screens displaying images of the weapons.

Amid applause from the audience, a video showed a digital animation of a cruise missile fired from northern Russia flying across the Atlantic Ocean, evading missile defenses, then circling around the southern tip of South America before heading north toward the U.S.

Most of the weapons Mr. Putin highlighted are already well known to the U.S., whose missile defenses are designed to counter the actions of rogue states rather than of Moscow. He did surprise some U.S. analysts by announcing that Russia would field a new nuclear-powered, air-launched cruise missile.

Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual state of the union address to show off a series of new armaments, including nuclear weapons he claims are capable of penetrating U.S. air-defense systems.

Mr. Putin’s demonstration of might is further evidence of a general ratcheting up of sophisticated arms development among the world’s largest military powers. A Pentagon review last month made it known that the U.S. would undertake a major upgrading of its air-, land- and sea-based strategic nuclear forces, at a cost the Congressional Budget Office has estimated at $1.2 trillion.

China is also upgrading its arsenal, though its nuclear force is much smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia.

Moscow and Washington have both announced they are meeting their obligations under the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits each side to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. Hopes have vanished that the accord would be followed by one mandating deeper cuts.

Instead, the two sides are concentrating on updating systems allowed under that treaty and deploying weapons that fall outside its scope.

Among those, the Pentagon is planning to develop two new sea-based nuclear weapons—a new “low-yield” submarine-launched ballistic missile and a sea-launched cruise missile—it says are needed to deter Russia from contemplating the limited use of nuclear weapons during a military crisis.

Mr. Putin’s speech, in part, appeared designed to send a message that Russia would spare no effort to maintain its own nuclear capability.

“What worries me most is the resurgence of a dynamic to outmatch the other side with new nuclear weapons,” said Hans M. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists, which is critical of the American and Russian nuclear modernization plans.

Franklin Miller, a former Defense Department official who advised the Pentagon on its nuclear-modernization plans, said the new U.S. systems are needed to maintain the American nuclear deterrent, however much Russia might not like them.

“I think Putin understands that U.S. has awakened from its somnolence on nuclear issues,” Mr. Miller said. “If he understands that Russian should not carry out the first use of a nuclear weapon, all is well.”

Most of new systems touted by Mr. Putin on Thursday appear to be designed mainly to evade or penetrate limited U.S. antimissile defenses.

Among the weapons displayed on screens behind Mr. Putin was a new Sarmat heavy intercontinental missile that he said was capable of reaching any point on the globe. The Pentagon has long anticipated that system would be deployed next year. Last month’s nuclear review also indicated that the Pentagon was aware of the nuclear-armed torpedo Mr. Putin touted, which could be used to attack U.S. ports and submarine bases.

There was a new twist in Mr. Putin’s highlighting of a Russian program to develop nuclear-powered cruise missiles, which he said had undergone a successful test launch at the end of last year and would have an unlimited range.

The Russian president seemed to be sending a message that if the U.S. expands its defenses against ballistic missiles, Russia can circumvent them, U.S. analysts suggested. The U.S. has long maintained that the main purpose of its antimissile defenses is to block an attack by a rogue state like North Korea, and that they aren’t nearly capable of undermining Russia’s nuclear deterrent.

“The Russians seem to have more confidence in the U.S. ballistic missile defense than even the staunchest U.S. advocates do,” Mr. Kristensen said.

Mr. Putin’s approval rating at home shot up to over 80% after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 and has remained around that level. State-television news and talk shows regularly blame the U.S. for many of the world’s problems and present Mr. Putin as standing up to Washington. Domestic critics, meanwhile, accuse him of warmongering to distract from Russia’s stagnant economy.

Mr. Putin, who is almost certain to be elected to another six-year term in a presidential ballot on March 18, started his speech Thursday by talking up plans to better the economy, saying Russia needed to improve average life expectancy and raise people out of poverty.

The U.S., he said, had exploited Russia’s economic, political and military weakness after the collapse of the Soviet Union to ignore Moscow’s views, including by moving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization closer to Russia’s borders.

“No one listened to us. Listen to us now,” he said.

Images of Russia’s new weapons were displayed on large screens as Mr. Putin spoke. Photo: Maxim Shipenkov/EPA/Shutterstock

Mr. Putin said Russia’s Syria campaign had allowed the military to show off the results of a modernization program he launched in 2011. “The whole world knows the names of our newest airplanes, submarines, air-defense systems,” he said.

Ivan Konovalov, an independent defense analyst in Moscow, said the speech demonstrated how quickly Russia’s arms industry is progressing.

“It is developing some of the best weapons in the world, and the United States, if they want to maintain parity, has to answer the challenge quickly,” he said.

The Pentagon had little to say publicly about Mr. Putin’s speech, stressing that U.S. missile defenses were aimed at “rogue” nations, not Moscow.

“We are not surprised by his statement,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said Thursday during a press briefing, adding the American people should be assured the U.S. military is “full prepared” to defend the country.

The fact that most electronic devices these days need memory hasn’t always been enough for Micron . MU 4.43%

Few companies reflect the boom-and-bust cycle of tech as well as the memory chip maker. The last decade has seen several instances of sales gains quickly fading and profits swinging to losses. Micron’s stock price has followed a similar roller coaster, most recently illustrated by a huge two-year bull run in 2013-14 followed closely by a crash that wiped nearly three-quarters of the company’s market value in half the time.

That is why investors who have done particularly well with Micron of late could be forgiven some trepidation. The company’s share price has jumped nearly 133% over the past 12 months, making it one of the best-performing chip stocks in that period. Micron has benefited from strong memory price gains, yet it is fair to wonder when the inevitable turn will take place.

That doesn’t appear to be in the cards anytime soon. Memory prices have risen sharply in the past year but aren’t near their peak yet. Spot prices for the mostly commonly tracked version of 4 gigabyte DRAM memory hit $3.09 last month compared with the five-year high of $4.37 from mid-2014, according to DRAMeXchange. Tim Arcuri of Cowen & Co. estimates that Micron’s DRAM average selling price will show a 19% sequential jump when the company reports its fiscal second quarter results later this month.

It helps that DRAM is no longer so closely correlated with the sluggish personal computer market. Because anything with a CPU chip also requires memory, DRAM usage has been helped by demand from cloud-service operators building their own servers. And while smartphone sales have slowed considerably, manufacturers are putting more DRAM into their devices to boost performance. Apple Inc.’s latest iPhone 7 Plus contains 3 gigabytes of DRAM compared with 2 gigabytes for its predecessor, and the next iPhone could add even more if Apple wishes to keep up with rivals like Samsung and Huawei.

Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal’s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.

Still, Micron is highly sensitive to shifts in chip supply. A big jump in DRAM production by Samsung in 2015 pushed prices, and thus, Micron’s revenue, down.

The potential of more memory production coming online later this year bears watching. Spending on capital equipment by DRAM producers fell in 2016 from the previous year, but it is expected to pick up about 8% this year, estimates Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest.

But it helps that—despite its recent gains, Micron’s shares aren’t terribly expensive at just 7 times forward earnings. That is a 45% discount to its three-year average, so not such a stretch even for those whose near-term memories of this stock remain painful.

nyt169,['James P. Sterba Staff Reporter Of The Wall Street Journal'],,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB859158866417482000,"When a 24-year-old Marine sharpshooter named Carlos Norman Hathcock II chalked up the farthest recorded kill in the history of sniping -- 2,500 yards (1.42 miles) -- in February 1967, he fired a Browning M2 .50-caliber machine gun. It was a 128-pound behemoth normally used to blast light armored vehicles, shoot down airplanes, strafe ships, and terrify opposing ground forces.

Sgt. Hathcock's amazing shot not only made history. It helped plant an idea that -- thanks to the ingenuity of America's firearms hobbyists and tinkering gun makers -- is now a reality: the .50-caliber civilian sporting rifle.

Today's hot .50-calibers are slimmed-down 30-pound models used to hit bull's-eyes at 1,000 yards, hunt elk and other big game and blast away at coyotes and other varmints. They are the darlings of gun enthusiasts who want what one manufacturer calls ""ultimate big-boy toys"" -- the most powerful firearms (with a few ""elephant gun"" exceptions) civilians can legally own without federal registration. Among the rifle's attributes: six times the muscle of a .30-06 deer rifle, an advertised (if disputed) effective range of 3,000 yards (1.7 miles), a bang that can permanently damage unprotected ears, and a traffic-stopping allure at gun shows.

Why the appeal?

""Some people just want the biggest thing on the block,"" says Skip Talbott, a custom gun maker from Fallon, Nev., who founded the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association (FCSA) in 1985 with Marty Liggins, a smokeless-gunpowder maker from McEwen, Tenn.

""Why do people buy a Ferrari?"" asks Mr. Liggins, who named his .50-caliber ""Babe.""

While some gun makers used scantily clad women to hawk their wares at the recent SHOT (Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade) show in Las Vegas, Lou ""the Incredible Hulk"" Ferrigno worked the booth of Barrett Firearms Mfg. Inc., of Murfreesboro, Tenn.; he signed autographs and photos of the Barrett 82A1, a 10-shot semiautomatic .50-caliber rifle (suggested retail: $6,800) featured in the movie, ""Robocop.""

At another booth, McMillan Bros Rifle Co., of Phoenix, showed off its ""Boomer"" models ($3,700 to $4,100), popular with target shooters. Six other .50-caliber makers at the show offered models priced between $2,500 and $7,000, including a prototype designed by M-16 rifle inventor Gene Stoner called the Stoner SR-50 ($6,995) from Knight's Manufacturing Co., of Vero Beach, Fla.

Lots of .50 owners build their own; that is how the FCSA got started. ""Guys would say, 'I can hit an ant in the a-- a mile away,'"" Mr. Liggins says. ""We finally said, 'Prove it.'"" The group's first match, in 1985, drew only six shooters. At last July's world championships, 108 shooters turned up. FCSA membership has tripled in the past four years to nearly 1,700. Since the rifle crossed into the civilian market in the early '80s, Mr. Talbott says, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 have been sold to civilians.

For $25 annually, FCSA members get a list of equipment and ammunition suppliers, names of experienced .50-caliber builders and tinkerers they can call for advice, invitations to target matches, and a subscription to the group's quarterly magazine, ""Very High Power.""

The group's motto, ""Dedicated to the sporting uses of the .50 BMG [Browning Machine Gun] Cartridge,"" is apt. Dedication is what it takes. Competitors shoot from a benchrest at targets 1,000 yards (nearly 0.6 miles) away. They could compete at 2,000 yards, but only the military has ranges that big. Finding 1,000-yard ranges where it's safe to compete is difficult. Noise objections forced them off a range in Williamsport, Pa., and a Phoenix range canceled a match in January after .50-caliber bullets during tests ricocheted over a big hill into a trailer park.

Modern muzzle breaks, which diffuse recoil energy, have greatly reduced the .50-caliber's kick. (An early model blew one designer off the bed of his pickup truck, rupturing his rib cage.) But muzzle breaks make them extremely loud. Gale McMillan, a pioneering .50 designer, says that the only time he fired one without ear plugs, ""it felt like you rammed an ice pick down my ear.""

For many .50-caliber owners, it was love -- or at least a major shot of adrenaline -- at first sight. ""Wow, this would be fun to shoot,"" Buddy Clifton, an engineer at Allied Signal Technical Services Corp., in Pasadena, Calif., recalls thinking when he first saw one. The first one he fired ""absolutely sounded like a bomb going off."" Fearing its recoil, Mr. Clifton took two pillows to the range for cushioning. Its kick was more like a shove, he says, no worse than a 12-gauge shotgun. Today, Mr. Clifton holds three world .50-caliber precision-shooting records.

Precision isn't easy. At 1,000 yards, bullets arc perhaps 20 feet up and then down to the target. A four mile-an-hour cross wind can push a round 20 inches awry. Changes in humidity or sunlight can mess up trajectory. Nevertheless, two years ago Craig Taylor, of Vancouver, Wash., put five shots within 3.2395 inches of each other -- the best-ever results of a .50 caliber competition. He owns two rifles, named Alawishus and Floyd. ""We're still in the infancy of how accurate these things can get,"" he says.

That gives Secret Service agents and other law-enforcement officers goose bumps. But the FCSA says the guns are ""not a weapon of choice of the criminal"" because they are ""too large and heavy to be employed in normal criminal behavior.""

Still, law-enforcement angst went up a notch after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said it found two Barrett .50s in the arsenal of David Koresh's Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. This caused a temporary panic at the FCSA, which feared a backlash. It commissioned a survey of its members, which found that nearly half were college educated, 37% had incomes above $75,000 annually, and two-thirds were either salaried professionals or business owners. The results were sent to the National Rifle Association to help ward off any anti-.50-caliber legislation.

Firearms above .50-caliber-cannons, generally-are mostly regulated by the BATF under the Gun Control Act of 1968 as ""destructive devices,"" requiring registration, owner fingerprints on file and a $200 fee. In 1993 the Idaho Fish and Game Commission banned hunting with firearms weighing more than 16 pounds after elk hunters using regular rifles argued that hunting with .50s was unfair. Still, most other states allow .50-caliber hunting.

While the .50-caliber machine gun has been around since 1917, its metamorphosis into a rifle was slow. Mr. Hathcock's sniper record in Vietnam inspired a few homemade rifles. Then came the 1979 American Embassy takeover in Iran. Marine guards wanted something to blow open embassy safes without necessarily destroying classified papers. Around the same time, Ronnie Barrett, a commercial photographer, went to his home workshop to build the first .50-caliber semiautomatic, the Barrett 82A1. An emergency shipment was ordered from Barrett Firearms by the U.S. Marines after the 1983 bombing of their barracks in Beirut, Lebanon.

Though the military versions have since seen action in the Gulf War, and are popular with police SWAT teams, the civilian .50 caliber -- the Branch Dividian discovery notwithstanding -- appears to have remained steadfastly recreational. Even enthusiasts believe its accuracy beyond 1,000 yards is exaggerated. Rock McMillan, who makes some of the most accurate .50s on the market, says: ""If you offered me a million bucks to stand 1,500 yards out and let you take one shot at me with the .50 of your choice, I'd probably take it."""
