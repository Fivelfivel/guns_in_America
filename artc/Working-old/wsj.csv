KR 0.16% said it would stop selling guns to buyers under 21 years old through its Fred Meyer locations, the third major retailer to tighten its policies while lawmakers continue to debate how to respond to the latest school shooting in America.

The U.S.’s largest supermarket chain said Thursday it would raise the minimum age to purchase arms and ammunition in all of its Fred Meyer stores in response to the Parkland, Fla., high-school tragedy. Kroger currently sells firearms at 43 Fred Meyer locations in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

Kroger stopped selling assault-style semiautomatic rifles in Oregon, Washington and Idaho at Fred Meyer stores several years ago and decided Wednesday to no longer sell those style of guns or special orders for them in Alaska, a spokeswoman said.

Kroger’s Fred Meyer chain, which the company acquired through a merger in 1999, sells general merchandise, including home items, electronics and sporting goods. Kroger sold roughly $7 million worth of firearms and ammunition out of $115 billion in total sales in its 2016 fiscal year, the company said.

“Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers,” said Jessica Adelman, a spokeswoman for the Cincinnati-based chain. “In response to the tragic events in Parkland and elsewhere, we’ve taken a hard look at our policies and procedures for firearm sales.”

Meijer Inc., also said Thursday it would raise the minimum age to purchase ammunition in stores to 21 years old. The 235-location, general-merchandise chain based in Grand Rapids, Mich., doesn’t sell firearms, said a spokesman for the company.

Bi-Mart, a regional sporting goods chain with 77 stores, said Thursday it also would raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm or ammunition to 21. The Eugene, Ore., company sells rifles and shotguns, but doesn’t sell assault-style weapons or high-capacity magazines.

“We agree with many policy makers and our peers that increasing the age limit to 21, in order to purchase a firearm, is a step in the right direction,” the company said. “We will continue to carry our current selection of items for the hunter and sport shooter.”

The retailers’ moves follow announcements by two of the largest U.S. firearms retailers. Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. on Wednesday raised the purchase age for guns to 21. Dick’s also said it would stop selling high-capacity magazines at all its stores and halt sales of assault-style rifles at its 35 Field and Stream stores. Walmart halted sales of assault-style rifles in 2015.

It is unclear how many gun buyers are under 21, because the federal government doesn’t track sales and the Federal Bureau of Investigation doesn’t disclose the age of applicants for background checks. The FBI conducted 25.2 million background checks for firearms last year, down from a record 27.5 million in 2016.

Under current law, licensed gun dealers can sell a handgun to someone 21 years old and sell a rifle to someone who is 18. President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have expressed support for raising the age limit for rifle sales, but the National Rifle Association has rejected any such move. An NRA spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The alleged 19-year-old Parkland shooter left 17 people dead and has prompted a growing list of U.S. companies to re-evaluate their gun-selling policies and preferential treatment to NRA members. Many companies have taken a stand on gun control in response to a social-media movement spurring the action, but the moves can come with reputational risks.

The Domini Impact Investments LLC mutual fund in 2016 asked Kroger to stop selling semiautomatic weapons in its stores. Kroger challenged the resolution, and federal regulators sided with the company because such investor requests generally can’t govern what a company sells.

In addition to the increased age limit, Kroger is reducing space devoted to firearms in its Fred Meyer stores in response to “softer demand and changing customer preferences,” Ms. Adelman said. Fred Meyer stores currently sell shotguns, .22-caliber rifles, bolt-action hunting rifles and handguns.

Investing giant Blackstone Group BX -0.21% LP asked outside fund managers over the weekend to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns, according to people familiar with the matter.

The urgent request—Blackstone gave the managers about a day to answer—reflects the snowballing pressure on companies to cut ties with the firearms industry in the wake of this month’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

American corporations have generally stayed away from politically-sensitive debates, although that has been changing as some high-profile CEOs waded into immigration and gay rights discussions. But many companies have been galvanized in recent days into assessing their exposure to gun-related issues, as calls for action grow on social media. Companies including insurer MetLife and Delta Air Lines Inc. have scaled back ties with the National Rifle Association.

Eric Dezenhall, a Washington-based crisis consultant who has advised firms on boycotts and public-safety issues, said that among companies he has recently spoken to, “there is a feeling that there is a sea change, a generational change that has to be addressed” regarding gun control.

Even so, companies need to differentiate between the “media and cultural noise at the moment” and the extent to which it translates into consumer support for businesses taking action, he said.

The online backlash to companies severing ties with the NRA was swift from gun supporters and others who don’t like companies getting involved in public policy debates.

Thomas Moore, an NRA member and retired electrical engineer in Buffalo, Wyo., said he has sent letters to rental car-companies Enterprise Holdings, Hertz Global Holdings as well as Delta Air Lines to register his disgust with their decisions to end discount programs offered to NRA members. Though he says he’s been a loyal customer to those companies, he now will consider their competitors instead.

“They’re making a hasty reaction to try to smooth some of the anger that people have about what went on in Florida,” he said.

Financial firms, especially those who lend to or invest in gun makers, are contending with the issue. Bank of America Corp. said it was “joining other companies in our industry to examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings” and would “engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for nonmilitary use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.”

A spokesman for BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager and one of the biggest managers of index-tracking funds, said the firm would be talking with weapons-related companies “to understand their response to recent events.” He added that the money manager has no choice but to invest in the companies in the indexes its vehicles track.

Both the BlackRock statement and the Blackstone email refer to gun makers but also gun sellers, a vastly larger swath of American business. Walmart Inc. sells guns in some stores. The retailer phased out the sale of assault-style rifles in 2015, said a Walmart spokesman.

Blackstone’s weekend email asked for information about “any ownership or lending” of or to “gun manufacturers or gun sellers,” according to people familiar with the request. One of the people said the request went by email to managers at about a dozen hedge funds in which Blackstone has a stake.

Blackstone has taken steps over the years to eliminate its exposure to guns across its various lines of business.

“We believe we have next to no direct exposure to the firearms industry, but it’s not surprising that we would want to confirm,” a spokeswoman for the firm said in an emailed statement.

Related Video Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims.

In recent years, private-equity firms have increased their scrutiny of public and private companies they invest in or might invest in, and whether these companies have exposure to the gun business and other areas that bring controversy, and they have sometimes have steered clear of placing investments, industry members say.

Lately, firms that invest in hedge funds and other vehicles that buy and sell public shares have been increasing their own examination of ties to these industries, says Brett Barth, who helps run BBR Partners LLC, a New York firm that invests in hedge funds and private-equity funds for wealthy clients.

BBR says it has been increasing its focus on the “ESG policies,” or those related to environmental, social and governance issues, of its investments. That category includes exposure to companies making or selling guns, he says.

BlackRock Chief Laurence Fink wrote a letter earlier this year to CEOs of the companies in which the firm invests, in which he pushed top leaders to outline their long-term plans and how their companies contribute to society.

Mr. Fink told executives that in addition to laying out how they will achieve and sustain good financial results, they “must also understand the societal impact of your business as well as the ways that broad, structural trends—from slow wage growth to rising automation to climate change—affect your potential for growth.”

Cerberus Capital Management LP, a private-equity firm that has invested in gun manufacturers, came under pressure for holding those stakes after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn. when 20 students and six staff members were killed. In that case, the shooter used a Bushmaster rifle, manufactured by Remington Outdoor Co., one of Cerberus’s portfolio companies.

Cerberus in 2015 allowed its investors to sell their stakes in the gun maker. About half of them sold, a person familiar with the matter said. Remington said Feb. 12 that it would file for bankruptcy, citing concerns about increased gun regulation and a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by nine family members of Sandy Hook victims, which alleges that the gun maker is liable for producing and selling a weapon unfit for civilian use.

Gun makers and sellers appear likely to face increased pressure from both large shareholders and advocacy groups during this year’s proxy season.

The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based shareholder advocacy group, whose members include faith-based organizations, institutional investors and other money managers, said last week that it had filed gun-safety resolutions at two companies that make guns.

Shareholders in American Outdoor Brands Corp. and Sturm, Ruger & Co. last week filed resolutions asking the companies to detail their efforts to understand the “reputational and financial risks they face from gun violence in the U.S.” and to make their products safer, ICCR said Friday.

A diabolical-sounding Russian word has been making waves recently: “kompromat,” meaning “compromising material,” collected on someone for the purposes of blackmail. Less than two weeks before being sworn in as president, Donald Trump faced reports that the Russian government had “kompromat” on him, allegedly including evidence of sordid dealings with prostitutes and compromising financial ties.

The accusations appeared in a dossier prepared by a British ex-intelligence officer that was posted by BuzzFeed. Mr. Trump and Russian officials have both dismissed the dossier’s claims, which news outlets including The Wall Street Journal couldn’t verify. But the story has brought new attention to a word that has its roots in the cloak-and-dagger machinations of the Soviet era, when real or manufactured dirt might be gathered to disable political foes.

By combining the first two syllables of “komprometiruyushchiy,” meaning “compromising,” with the first syllable of “material,” which is also a Russian word, “kompromat” follows a popular pattern of Russian word formation, especially for terms related to the government and its ideological underpinnings. Examples go back to the Bolshevik Party’s creation of an executive committee in 1917, known as the “Politburo”—short for “Politicheskoye Buro,” or “political bureau.”

In her book “How Russia Really Works,” Alena Ledeneva of University College London writes that “kompromat” is “derived from 1930s secret police jargon.” But it is difficult to know for sure how far back it goes, since such tactics were not talked about publicly until the “thaw” under the reign of Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and early 1960s.

Yoram Gorlizki, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, has recently uncovered archival material showing that the secret police and party officials were using the longer phrase for “compromising materials” in 1953. But Mr. Gorlizki told me that the shorter “kompromat” doesn’t appear in those documents.

To track down early examples of “kompromat” in Russian, I consulted with Donna Farina, an expert in Russian lexicography who teaches at New Jersey City University. She found the word first appearing in the Russian literary magazine Neva in 1962, though she notes that the writer appears to assume readers would already know the word.

A 1968 book, Enrico Altavilla’s “The Art of Spying,” suggests that Soviet-style “kompromat” had been introduced to the Communist secret service of East Germany. In 1983, the word appeared in the English translation of Russian dissident Lev Kopelev’s memoir, “Ease My Sorrows,” in which he recalls learning that a rival had “started gathering a kompromat, a compromising affidavit.”

“Kompromat” didn’t start showing up in English-language news sources until Boris Yeltsin served as Russian president in the 1990s. In April 1993, Reuters reported that Russian Vice President Alexander Rutskoi had been accused by a Yeltsin ally of “collecting ‘kompromat’ (compromising material) for political ends” to bring Yeltsin down.

The Soviet era may be over, but the word lives on.

Photo: Derik Holtmann/Associated Press

The Washington Post, which has adopted “Democracy Dies in Darkness” as its slogan, reports on the person who allegedly launched a violent daylight attack this morning on democratically-elected Members of Congress, their staffs and a security detail:

The man suspected of firing dozens of rounds into an Alexandria baseball field Wednesday morning has been identified by federal law enforcement officials as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill.

A Facebook page believed to be his features pictures of Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, and rhetoric against President Trump, including a recent post that reads: “Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.”

Hodgkinson was among those taken to a hospital Wednesday, and President Trump announced that he had died from “his injuries.”

The Facebook page believed to be Hodgkinson’s also featured a post critical of an energy pipeline and the following statement: “Democratic socialism explained in three words: We the People.” Recent attempts by this column to return to the page have resulted in a message from Facebook that the “content isn’t available right now.”

Your humble correspondent happened to be on Maria Bartiromo’s Fox Business Network television program when news of the shooting broke this morning. We were soon joined via telephone by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R., Fla.), who reported that he had left the baseball practice along with Rep. Jeff Duncan (R., S.C.) just minutes before the shooting started.

Mr. DeSantis stated:

We’ve reported to police that there was a gentleman that confronted us when we were going to our car and he wanted to know whether it was Republicans or Democrats that were out there. We said it was Republicans and he kind of started walking to the field.

Mr. DeSantis later told the network that having seen news photographs of the alleged shooter, he and Mr. Duncan agreed that it was the same man who had confronted them in the parking lot.

Hodgkinson’s local newspaper, the Belleville News-Democrat, has published a series of letters it received from the alleged shooter, who was apparently obsessed with raising tax rates on high-income earners and making the IRS code much more complicated. Hodgkinson saw income inequality as a significant problem.

Almost five years before he opened fire in Alexandria, Va and wounded Rep. Steve Scalise and four others, Hodgkinson railed in a letter to the editor:

If the rich paid their fair share of taxes today, we wouldn’t be in this predicament. We need to vote all Republicans out of Congress. We need to demand Congress add 10 or more brackets to the existing tax code. We need 20 brackets to $20 million, and a 60 percent top marginal rate.

We can get our country back if we all vote the right way.

In other letters from 2012, Hodgkinson called for as many as 55 different tax brackets for individual income tax filers, up from seven under the current system, and wrote: “I hope the Obama administration raises the income tax rate for the rich to 70 percent or more.” Hodgkinson defended then-President Obama against critics of his economic policies:

I can’t believe how many people are upset with our president. You’d think that the world was full of rich millionaires. Why else would these people talk badly about a guy who has their best interest at heart?

I read the other day about a man blaming President Barack Obama for food stamp recipients going up from 26 million to 46 million. Anyone with a knowledge of the facts would know that this is because of former President George W. Bush, and his ruining our economy.

As for Hodgkinson’s victims, the Journal reports:

Mr. Scalise’s representatives said he was shot in the hip and was undergoing surgery at a Washington hospital. The 51-year-old lawmaker from Louisiana was “in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone” before the surgery, representatives said in a statement.

Regarding the other victims, the Washington Post adds:

Zach Barth, a legislative correspondent for Rep. Roger Williams (R-Tex.), was shot but expected to make a full recovery.

Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods , was taken to a local hospital in unknown condition, according to a company spokesman.

Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said his two wounded officers are in good condition and have not suffered any life-threatening injuries.

The officers were identified as Special Agent Crystal Griner and Special Agent David Bailey. Without the presence of these officers and their ability to return fire, it seems certain the carnage would have been much worse. Hodgkinson appears to have fired more than 50 times.

Hodgkinson longed for a “more progressive tax system.” Readers of his various notes on the subject probably figured he was talking about mere policy debates when he lamented in 2012 that it was “a shame that Democrats won’t attack the Republicans.”

To start, Pennsylvania Rep. Michael Doyle, who manages the Democratic team, invited the Republican team to the Democratic club tonight for dinner. Republican manager Joe Barton of Texas accepted, joking he’ll be bringing his “food tester.”

It be Mr. Barton’s second time at the club in his more than 31 years in Congress – and the two coaches spent most of their joint press conference talking about how times have become more partisan in Washington, and attributing it to a climate that may have led to the shooting on Wednesday morning.

“Members are not looked at as people anymore, we’re kind of looked at, I won’t say targets, but people think they can come to our town hall meetings and just say the most obnoxious things and think we won’t feel it,” Mr. Barton said, referencing the rowdy constituent meetings that members have faced as they’ve gone home this year.

Mr. Doyle pointed to the pressure on members to get home right after votes on Thursday or Friday said to not assimilate to Congress, saying it limits time to socialize.

“We’re not allowed to stay here because then we’ve gone Washington,” he said.

The two hope that the game brings a sense of camaraderie and raises money for charity – though they both adamantly refused the idea that the teams should not be drawn across party lines, an idea floating around on Twitter as a sign of bipartisanship. Both said they were plotting ideas to honor Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and hoped he could watch it on CSPAN from the hospital."

A little more than a week after a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub, the U.S. Supreme Court turned away a legal challenge to a state law that bans the type of rifle used in that massacre.

The court announced Monday it wouldn't hear an appeal seeking to overturn Connecticut’s ban on semiautomatic rifles that resemble military weapons and high-capacity magazines. The Connecticut law, as well as a similar ban in New York, were upheld by lower courts and will remain in place.

Few had expected the justices to entertain the argument that such bans are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court routinely has turned away attacks on gun regulations since 2010, when it delivered the second of two rulings establishing an individual’s right to keep handguns in the home for self-defense. Lower courts, meanwhile, have almost always upheld state and local gun laws as permissible regulation of any Second Amendment right.

The Supreme Court’s move comes as the Senate is expected to vote on four separate gun-control measures proposed in the wake of the Orlando shooting.

The high court’s decision, itself, isn’t surprising. Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February has left the court with eight justices, split between four liberals and four conservatives, and the court has repeatedly balked at taking up potentially controversial cases likely to end in 4-4 deadlocks.

Last year, the Chicago-based Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Highland Park, Ill., ordinance banning semiautomatic rifles like the Sig Sauer weapon used in the Orlando shooting on June 12. In December, the Supreme Court declined to review that decision, over the published dissent of Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia.

Seven states and the District of Columbia ban certain types of semiautomatic rifles that share characteristics with weapons used by the military. Gun enthusiasts sometimes call them “black rifles” because of their matte-black color. Supporters of bans on such weapons often refer to them as assault rifles. A 10-year federal ban these types of rifles lapsed in 2004.

New York and Connecticut updated their laws in 2013 in response to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults.

The laws prohibit rifles with at least one “military-style” feature, including telescoping stock, forward pistol grip, flash suppressor or grenade launcher. The states also outlawed magazines that hold 10 bullets or more.

The New York-based Second Circuit upheld both laws in October, ruling that the dangers posed by military-style features like grenade launchers and silencers “are manifest and incontrovertible.”

The Connecticut Citizens Defense League, the plaintiff in the Connecticut case, filed its petition with the Supreme Court just days before Justice Scalia’s death, said Scott Wilson, the group’s president.

“That was a little bit of a twist of fate,” Mr. Wilson said.

The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, which had challenged the New York ban, also asked the high court to review the Second Circuit decision, but withdrew its petition after Justice Scalia’s death.

“We were concerned that a split decision by the Supreme Court would do nothing but reaffirm the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, and we didn’t want to take that chance,” said Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association.

George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general, said in an emailed statement that measures passed by the state legislature were “entirely appropriate, sensible and lawful.”

Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, called New York a leader in “keeping deadly weapons out of the hands of people who intend to do harm.”

The high court has begged off nearly every Second Amendment case it has been asked to review since 2010, the year the justices ruled that the Heller opinion applied to state and local gun restrictions, not just federal regulations.

Gun-rights groups launched more than 900 challenges to gun regulations from 2008 to 2015, according to a study last year by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that supports increased gun regulation. Courts have upheld the regulations in 96% of them.

In the case of two women accused of using nerve agent VX to murder Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea’s dictator, one question has puzzled authorities: How could the alleged attackers unleash a chemical weapon in a crowded airport without harming themselves or passersby?

Chemists reviewing evidence presented at the trial this week say it appears the plot worked by using a method of combining mildly toxic, relatively unstable elements of VX that don’t require heat to synthesize into the deadly nerve agent.

One of the identified substances, an alkyl chloride that Malaysia’s chemical weapons analysis center said was found on the clothing of Mr. Kim and one of his attackers, acts as a precursor that can be combined with another to form VX.

The presence of that precursor, along with the full VX nerve agent detected on Mr. Kim’s body, suggests there was a second precursor that went undetected in laboratory tests, said the chemical experts, who aren’t involved in the case. That compound likely would have been a sulfur-containing organophosphate, from a group of compounds commonly used in insecticides. Applied together to Mr. Kim’s face, they would have formed VX and entered his bloodstream in minutes.

From the Archives The instrument of Kim Jong Nam's death was the highly toxic nerve agent VX, Malaysian police said. Photo: AP (Originally published Feb. 24, 2017)

Experts in medicinal chemistry and forensics said failure to detect the sulfur-containing organophosphate wouldn’t be unusual since it can degrade quickly, especially in humid environments, leaving only the rotten-eggs smell of sulfur gas and an acid. That acid, also a breakdown product of VX itself, was detected on Mr. Kim and on the other attacker.

The alkyl chloride and organophosphate precursors are toxic, but not nearly to the degree of VX, which was developed in the 1950s for chemical warfare and is the most potent of all nerve agents. Chemical experts theorize that Mr. Kim’s attackers exposed him to VX in such a binary form, allowing them to handle less-potent chemicals and survive.

Mr. Kim died shortly after being assaulted by two women at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13. Malaysian officials have said Mr. Kim died of VX poisoning. On Thursday, the lead chemist in Mr. Kim’s postmortem report, Raja Subramaniam, of Malaysia’s Department of Chemistry, testified he had found an array of VX precursors, VX-related breakdown products or VX itself on the victim and assailants.

Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam and Siti Aisyah of Indonesia are charged with murdering Mr. Kim. They have pleaded not guilty and face death if convicted. Malaysian officials have said the women acted under the instructions of North Koreans, some of whom flew from Malaysia moments after the attack. North Korea has denied involvement, and defense lawyers say the women believed they were performing a television prank.

Some aspects of the attack emerged in the ensuing days, but more detail become apparent in this week’s hearings.

On Thursday, Dr. Subramaniam revealed the alkyl chloride precursor was found on Ms. Huong’s clothing and fingernails. Security footage shows Ms. Huong was the second of the two women to approach Mr. Kim, coming from behind him and reaching around to touch his face. Testing showed her white, long-sleeve shirt emblazoned with the letters “LOL” was contaminated with VX.

Laboratory tests showed the first alleged attacker, Ms. Aisyah, had only one VX-related chemical on her: the acid that could either be the breakdown product of the second precursor or of VX itself. Defense lawyers are seeking to challenge those results. In the first week of the trial, prosecutors submitted samples taken from Mr. Kim and the alleged attackers, displaying them in transparent bags.

A binary application of VX was developed in the 1970s by U.S. weapons experts looking for safer ways to handle the nerve agent. Researchers aimed to place two precursors in separate compartments of missile warheads, leaving them to mix in flight. That method required heat for a reaction to occur, and wouldn’t be practical in an assassination attempt, chemical experts said.

The precursor identified during the trial indicates a different chemical pathway to VX: mixing it with the organophosphate in a reaction that doesn’t require heat.

Martin Boland, senior lecturer in medicinal chemistry at Charles Darwin University in Australia, said the method is an application of reasonably well-known organic chemistry. “It is probably avoided in binary weapons manufacture because the precursors are less stable and more toxic” than the method developed in the 1970s, he said. “But it is a viable method for production of unitary VX in a lab.”

VX has no known use apart from chemical warfare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Like all mass-produced nerve agents, it works by blocking the biological action of the enzyme cholinesterase, leading to loss of control of muscles and glands as the body’s electrical impulses rage unchecked. Muscles contract, creating convulsions. Eyes blur and speech slurs. Overstimulated glands cause profuse sweating, tears and salivation. A common cause of death is asphyxiation.

Many of the symptoms match those of Mr. Kim, doctors and witnesses said in court.

The alleged assailants appear to have been unharmed. Neither woman tested positive for VX in the bloodstream. But even if one was exposed to VX, she could have washed it off quickly enough to avoid harm, or been wearing a cream barrier to prevent VX from absorbing into the skin, experts said.

Israel’s military said one of its jets was shot down by antiaircraft missiles during strikes on Syrian targets after it intercepted an Iranian drone launched from Syria that had infiltrated its airspace, intensifying tensions between the two neighbors.

The F-16 aircraft crashed in Israeli territory, the military said Saturday, updating an earlier statement about how the plane was downed. The pilots ejected and one was taken to the hospital in a serious condition, it added.

Syrian state media called the strikes a “new Israeli aggression.” The shots set off warning sirens in northern Israel of an imminent rocket attack, the Israeli military said.

The U.S. blamed Iran for the clash and voiced concern about the escalation of violence, saying it “strongly supports Israel’s sovereign right to defend itself.”

“Iran’s calculated escalation of threat and its ambition to project its power and dominance, places all the people of the‎ region—from Yemen to Lebanon—at risk,” said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. “The U.S. continues to push back on the totality of Iran’s malign activities in the region and calls for an end to Iranian behavior that threatens peace and stability.”

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said earlier Saturday that Syria had a right to defend itself, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The Israeli claim of the downing of an Iranian drone and Iran’s involvement in the downing of an Israeli jet were “too ridiculous to dignify a discussion,” he said.

While Israel and Syria have exchanged volleys frequently in recent months and the Israeli military has intercepted enemy drones, the incident Saturday was unusual in that Israel for the first time claimed it involved an Iranian unmanned aerial vehicle.

It was also the first time Israel has lost a jet during a strike in Syria, despite dozens of airstrikes in recent years.

The Israeli military “sees the Iranian attack and the Syrian response as a severe and irregular violation of Israeli sovereignty,” it said.

Hezbollah in a statement announced the beginning of a “new strategic phase” that will put an end to Israeli’s abuse of Syrian land and air. “We confirm that the developments of today absolutely mean the end of the old formula,” the party said in a statement released on Lebanon’s National News Agency.

Israel has amplified criticism of Iranian attempts to set up military bases and weapons factories in Syria in recent months, warning it would engage in a conflict with the Syrian regime should Iran and Tehran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah entrench on its border.

The alleged involvement of Iran in Saturday’s incident heightens concerns that Israel could be drawn into a war with Syria and its allies.

“This direct Iranian operation against Israel is a major escalation,” said Dan Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel and national security adviser for the Obama administration.

“There is a risk of these events escalating into a full-blown conflict if Hezbollah is tempted, or instructed by Iran, to join the fray,” said Mr. Shapiro, who is now a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies.

A spokesperson for the Syrian regime couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on Saturday’s incident. An official at Iran’s United Nations mission didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Iran has denied it is seeking to establish bases in Syria, but has said it would continue to defend Syrian territory from foreign forces.

Russia and Iran are the main backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the yearslong civil conflict in Syria and Tehran vows to destroy the Israeli state.

Israel fears that after the fall of Islamic State and as the Syrian regime consolidates power in large parts of Syria, Iran will set up military bases there that could threaten Israeli security.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Moscow late last month for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Iranian attempts to further set up militarily in Syria and create precision missile factories on the ground there.

“I made it clear that we will not agree to either of these developments,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement after the meeting. “And will act accordingly.”

Israel has largely stayed out of the Syrian war, though it has launched some 100 airstrikes on what it has said were convoys ferrying Iranian weapons to Hezbollah through Syrian territory.

The military also has increasingly hit what it claims are Iranian-controlled military bases in Syria in recent months, increasing tensions between the two sides.

Later on Saturday, the Israeli military said it mounted a “large-scale attack” on 12 Syrian sites, including three aerial defense batteries and four Iranian targets that are part of Iran’s military establishment in Syria.

Those strikes come after the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israeli missiles earlier this week had hit military targets near Damascus, the Syrian capital. The Syrian army said it had intercepted the strikes.

Israel also launched missiles in December against a military base controlled by Iran near Damascus, according to pro-regime media.

Warplanes in September also struck a Syrian facility north of the central city of Homs. Israel didn’t confirm that it had conducted the attack, but Israeli officials subsequently said the facility was producing arms for Iran and Hezbollah.

Stephen Voisine of Wytopitlock, Maine was arrested after authorities got a tip that he had shot a bald eagle, a federal misdemeanor punishable by up to a year’s jail time.

Because he had a previous state conviction for domestic violence, Mr. Voisine also was convicted of violating federal law prohibiting people with such records from possessing a firearm, which carried a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

He was sentenced to serve one year and a day, exceeding the maximum allowed for killing the eagle by one day.

The court, in a brief written order, said it would consider whether Mr. Voisine was improperly sentenced to extra prison time for the weapons possession, along with a second case involving another Maine man, William Armstrong III, who was sentenced to three years’ probation for possessing a firearm after a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.

Both men argued their prior domestic violence convictions were too minor to merit punishment for possessing firearms. The cases were consolidated on appeal.

Mr. Voisine argued his 2004 domestic violence conviction, for which he pleaded guilty to a state misdemeanor and paid a $200 fine for “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly” causing “bodily injury or offensive physical contact,” wasn’t sufficient to trigger the federal gun-possession charge. The federal statute applies to those convicted of state misdemeanors involving “the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.”

The brief court record doesn’t specify what precisely Mr. Voisine did in the domestic dispute.

Legal papers also provided few details regarding the shooting of the bald eagle, which isn't at issue before the Supreme Court. But according to a 2012 report in the Bangor Daily News, authorities said Mr. Voisine may have been the first person to kill a bald eagle in Maine since President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act in 1940.

“It is bad enough to shoot our national bird out of the sky, but even if he mistook it for a hawk, it is illegal to shoot a hawk in Maine,” said U.S. District Judge John Woodcock in Bangor, Maine, who sentenced Mr. Voisine, the News reported.

The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case in early 2016 and decide before July.

But Maine also has a long and proud tradition of military service, a legacy of world-class manufacturing, and a high percentage of personal firearm ownership.

That's why I invite manufacturers of firearms and related accessories—some of which are under siege in their home states by politicians pushing anti-gun legislation—to come to Maine. As a state that is fiercely protective of our right to bear arms, we will welcome you and your business.

When a Bangor daily newspaper in February tried to get the names, addresses and dates of birth of all Mainers with concealed-firearms permits, we leapt into action, drafting and passing a bill in 48 hours to temporarily shield the personal information. Democrats joined Republicans to swiftly enact this emergency legislation. (Legislation to permanently shield the information is in committee.)

Although Maine has one of the highest rates of firearm ownership in the country, we also have one of the lowest rates of gun violence. We are a safe state, and we plan to keep it that way. Even better, our dedication to protect the rights of law-abiding gun owners crosses party lines. Maine Democrats, many of whom serve rural areas where hunting and gun ownership are a way of life, readily agree with Republicans that the rights of firearms owners must not be infringed.

We are dismayed to see strict anti-gun legislation in states that are home to some of our country's best firearms manufacturers. Beretta USA Corp. in Maryland, Colt Manufacturing Co. in Connecticut and Magpul Industries in Colorado are facing hostile—and hysterical—legislation from politicians who slap them in the face for providing their states with jobs, opportunity and revenue.

Beretta, Colt and Magpul: Come to Maine. Our tradition ranges from Hiram S. Maxim, inventor of the first fully automatic machine gun, who was born in 1840 in Sangerville, Maine, to the renowned Bath Iron Works, which produces the world's most advanced surface warships. As the Navy said during World War II, ""Bath-built is best-built."" Other firearms and defense contractors in Maine include Smith & Wesson and General Dynamics .

When it comes to firearms, the rugged individualism of Mainers is alive and well. Richard Dyke acquired Bushmaster Firearms in the late 1970s and produced high-quality, AR-15-type rifles until 2006, when he sold the company. The new owner consolidated manufacturing with its operations in New York, vacated the facility in Windham, Maine, and laid off the local employees.

But Mr. Dyke still owned the facility. So he started another company, Windham Weaponry, and in 2011 he put his former employees back to work making high-quality rifles that are already considered some of the best on the market. That's how Mainers do it.

Maine is home to L.L. Bean, the supplier of outdoorsmen and women, as well as Kittery Trading Post and national retailers Cabela's and Wal-Mart , all of which offer firearms to consumers. Just as we welcome and support these companies and the jobs and opportunities they create, we would welcome and support the manufacturers of firearms and accessories.

Beretta, Colt, Magpul and any others: In Maine you will find air, rail and seaports that can carry your exceptional products across the country and across the globe. You will find hardworking Mainers, and you will find a governor who is ready to provide incentives and guarantees that will make it attractive for you to set up shop in our state.

I will never sign anti-gun legislation that erodes the rights of Maine citizens, drives your business away or infringes on the U.S. Constitution or the State of Maine Constitution.

Come to where you are welcome and where you will be appreciated. Come to Maine. I'll even throw in some lobster.

Mr. LePage, a Republican, is the governor of Maine."

A partial list of these awful incidents includes Chris Harper-Mercer at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College; Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook school; James Holmes in Aurora, Colo.; Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson; and Cho Seung-Hui, who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007.

All these events have two things in common: guns and mental illness. From that fact flows the demand, every time, that we “do something.” Saying it, however, is not the same as doing something that would in fact mitigate this recurrent carnage. Doing something in our system inevitably means putting in motion an array of actors toward this goal—elected or appointed public officials, the police, the medical community and not least parents.

Guns first. When a Parkland happens, the liberal half of America’s politics puts forth the same two-word solution: gun control. There is a simple causality to this argument—fewer guns, fewer murders. Always left out is evidence it would work.

A Semi-automatic AR-15's is shown here at Good Guys Guns & Range, Orem, Utah, Feb. 15. An AR-15 was used in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. Photo: George Frey/Getty Images

Gun-control laws—for example, to regulate bump stocks, AR-15s or ammunition magazines—foundered because advocates have never offered credible evidence they would deter mass shootings. Because gun proponents believe, not without reason, that the left’s ultimate goal is confiscation, the political prospects for a gun control solution have been and will remain about zero.

On Thursday the gun-control side pointed to President Trump’s signing of a bill last year revoking an Obama rule requiring the Social Security Administration to forward to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System the names of disability recipients who need a third party to help them manage their benefits because of a mental impairment. But this overly broad Obama rule was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union and National Rifle Association.

That dispute nonetheless points to another part of the do-something demand: the violently mentally ill. Let us stipulate that a necessary line should separate the large population of people getting treatment for emotional or mental illnesses and those whose mental disturbance has brought them to the brink of doing significant physical violence.

Unlike gun control, medicine has ample evidence that appropriate medication or treatment can stabilize the violently mentally ill. The National Institute of Mental Health collects data on evidence-based approaches involving drugs, intense psychiatric treatment and intervention.

The argument here involves questions over what levels of therapeutic coercion should be permitted. For example, should courts be able to require the severely mentally ill to take treatment to avoid commitment to a hospital? With appropriate legal protections, we think the answer is yes. Advocates for this idea often include the patients’ distraught families.

For years, though, some mental-health activists and lawyers, with allies inside the federal bureaucracies, have fought the idea of involuntary institutionalization for violent patients who refuse treatment. Their approach clearly isn’t working. Treatment requirements, by the way, don’t need a federal law. States can enact civil-commitment laws if they wish.

There is also an interim solution against murderous assailants: shoot back. There is evidence it works.

Last November in Texas, a rifle instructor, with an AR-15, shot a suspect about to open fire on a church full of people. The shooter dropped his weapon and fled. In 2015 a security officer shot and killed two gunmen about to carry out an ISIS-inspired attack in Garland, Texas. The armed security guard at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland didn’t get a chance to engage Nikolas Cruz, but fewer might have died if he had. Institutions such as schools probably must train and arm someone to provide self-defense in a world with so many threats.

There is one other possibility, suggested by President Trump in his Parkland statement Thursday: “Create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life.” The thought sounds self-evident. But on the available evidence, the idea of dignity in life looks more than ever to be in need of restoration."

Chinese state-backed hackers have recently targeted South Korean entities involved in deploying a U.S. missile-defense system, says an American cybersecurity firm, despite Beijing’s denial of retaliation against Seoul over the issue.

In recent weeks, two cyberespionage groups that the firm linked to Beijing’s military and intelligence agencies have launched a variety of attacks against South Korea’s government, military, defense companies and a big conglomerate, John Hultquist, director of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye Inc., said in an interview.

The California-based firm, which counts South Korean agencies as clients, including one that oversees internet security, wouldn’t name the targets.

While FireEye and other cybersecurity experts say Chinese hackers have long targeted South Korea, they note a rise in the number and intensity of attacks in the weeks since South Korea said it would deploy Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, a sophisticated missile-defense system aimed at defending South Korea from a North Korean missile threat.

China opposes Thaad, saying its radar system can reach deep into its own territory and compromise its security. South Korea and the U.S. say Thaad is purely defensive. The first components of the system arrived in South Korea last month and have been a key issue in the current presidential campaign there.

One of the two hacker groups, which FireEye dubbed Tonto Team, is tied to China’s military and based out of the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, where North Korean hackers are also known to be active, said Mr. Hultquist, a former senior U.S. intelligence analyst. FireEye believes the other, known as APT10, may be linked to other Chinese military or intelligence units.

China’s Ministry of Defense said this week Beijing has consistently opposed hacking, and that the People’s Liberation Army “has never supported any hacking activity.” China has said it is itself a major hacking victim but has declined to offer specifics.

Mr. Hultquist said the two hacking groups gained access to their targets’ systems by using web-based intrusions, and by inducing people to click on weaponized email attachments or compromised websites. He declined to offer more specific details.

Hack Attacks Recent cyberattacks attributed to Chinese state-backed groups. Since February Spear-phishing* and watering hole** attacks were conducted against South Korean government, military and commercial targets connected to a U.S. missile defense system.

Sources: FireEye, Trend Micro, Fidelis, PricewaterhouseCoopers and BAE Systems, WSJ reporting

Mr. Hultquist added that an error in one of the group’s operational security provided FireEye’s analysts with new information about the group’s origins.

South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last month that its website was targeted in a denial-of-service attack—one in which a flood of hacker-directed computers cripple a website—that originated in China.

A spokesman said that “prompt defensive measures” ensured that the attacks weren’t effective, adding that it was maintaining an “emergency service system” to repel Chinese hackers.

The ministry this week declined to comment further, or to say which cybersecurity firm it had employed or whether he thought the attacks were related to Thaad.

Another cybersecurity company, Russia’s Kaspersky Lab ZAO, said it observed a new wave of attacks on South Korean targets using malicious software that appeared to have been developed by Chinese speakers starting in February.

The attackers used so-called spear-phishing emails armed with malware hidden in documents related to national security, aerospace and other topics of strategic interest, said Park Seong-su, a senior global researcher for Kaspersky. The company typically declines to attribute cyberattacks and said it couldn’t say if the recent ones were related to Thaad.

The two hacking groups with alleged ties to Beijing have been joined by other so-called hacktivists—patriotic Chinese hackers acting independently of the government and using names like the “Panda Intelligence Bureau” and the “Denounce Lotte Group,” Mr. Hultquist said.

South Korea’s Lotte Group has become a particular focus of Chinese ire after the conglomerate approved a land swap this year that allowed the government to deploy a Thaad battery on a company golf course.

Last month, just after the land swap was approved, a Lotte duty-free shopping website was crippled by a denial-of-service attack, said a company spokeswoman, who added that its Chinese website had been disrupted with a virus in February. She declined to comment on its source.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t respond to questions about the website attacks. The ministry has previously addressed Lotte’s recent troubles in China by saying that the country welcomes foreign companies as long as they abide by Chinese law.

The U.S. has also accused Chinese state-backed hacking groups of breaking into government and commercial networks, though cybersecurity firms say such activity has dropped since the two nations struck a cybersecurity deal in 2015.

The two Chinese hacking groups named by FireEye are suspected of previous cyberattacks.

FireEye linked Tonto Team to an earlier state-backed Chinese hacking campaign, identified by Tokyo-based cybersecurity firm Trend Micro Inc. in 2012, which focused on South Korea’s government, media and military. Trend Micro declined to comment.

Two cybersecurity reports this month accused APT10 of launching a spate of recent attacks around the globe, including on a prominent U.S. trade lobbying group. One of those reports, jointly published by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and British weapons maker BAE Systems, said the Chinese hacker collective has recently grown more sophisticated, using custom-designed malware and accessing its targets’ systems by first hacking into trusted third-party IT service providers.

Because of the new scrutiny from that report, FireEye said in a recent blog post that APT10 was likely to lay low, though in the longer run, it added, “we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.”

Corrections & Amplifications

FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, believes that a Chinese hacking group known as APT10 may be linked to Chinese military or intelligence units. A previous version of this article incorrectly said that FireEye had linked APT10 to China’s Ministry of State Security. (April 21, 2017)

WASHINGTON—A day after President Donald Trump called for a sweeping overhaul of U.S. gun policy, lawmakers from both parties appeared divided on what they would support, with some pitching their own plans and others calling for Mr. Trump to keep up the public pressure.

Mr. Trump made waves in the gun debate Wednesday by backing some approaches backed by Democrats and others embraced by Republicans in a White House meeting with lawmakers. On Thursday, GOP senators said they were waiting to hear more from the White House, including..."
wsj166,"['Peter Nicholas', 'Julie Bykowicz', 'Peter.Nicholas Wsj.Com']",,https://www.wsj.com/articles/nra-chief-defends-gun-rights-in-wake-of-school-shooting-1519323329,"OXON HILL, Md.—The head of the National Rifle Association called for fortifying the nation’s schools and cast efforts to tighten gun laws as attacks on American freedom, in a speech just over a week after a Florida school shooting that left 17 dead.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and chief executive of the NRA, used language similar to that employed by President Donald Trump on protecting students, while also taking shots at some of the president’s favorite political targets, including the national media, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prominent Democratic lawmakers.

Mr. LaPierre said local officials and parents need to take steps to “harden” schools, “including effective, trained armed security that will absolutely protect every innocent child in this country.” Mr. Trump also called Thursday for “hardened” security, proposing that some teachers be armed.

Mr. LaPierre told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference that liberal lawmakers, egged on by the media national, are cynically using the latest school tragedy to roll back Second Amendment gun protections. Current laws, if more vigorously enforced and observed, are sufficient to curb mass shootings, he said.

“What they want are more restrictions on the law-abiding,” Mr. LaPierre said. “Think about that. Their solution is to make you—all of you—less free.”

The NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, faces renewed scrutiny following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Critics say the NRA’s campaign donations and political influence give it outsize influence in Congress, where the group works to stave off stricter gun controls and loosen existing ones.

The group endorsed Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential race and spent $30 million in ads supporting him and attacking his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Mr. Trump mentioned the group’s support of him during the White House meeting with local officials.

“They’re very close to me. I’m close to them,” Mr. Trump said, adding he had spoken “often” with the NRA in the past few days as he worked to develop a response to the Parkland shooting. He also played down potential conflict with the group over some of his proposals, such as placing new age restrictions on gun purchases, which the NRA has opposed.

“It’s not a battle,” he said. “I think the NRA wants to do the right thing.”

The NRA has long been a potent political force. The group says it has five million dues-paying members, and it “grades” politicians on their gun stances, sending those report cards to members across the country. In a measure of its cash clout, the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics calculated that five Republican senators have received more than $27 million in election aid from the group over their careers.

In his CPAC speech, Mr. LaPierre took political positions that align with Mr. Trump, accusing Democratic lawmakers of politicizing the shooting rather than coming up with what he billed as practical solutions.

“They want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of school security, the failure of family, the failure of America’s mental health system and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI.”

The FBI acknowledged after the attack that agents failed to act on a tip in January about the alleged shooter in Florida.

In another nod to Mr. Trump, Mr. LaPierre also attacked the FBI more broadly, and said rank-and-file members should call “BS on its rogue leadership.” He didn’t specify what he meant when describing FBI “corruption, and its own unethical agents.”

Mr. Trump fired James Comey as the head of the FBI in 2017 and has regularly criticized officials over their handling of separate probes into Russia meddling in the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Mr. LaPierre had harsh words for prominent Democratic lawmakers, saying the party has shifted left over the past few decades and is now controlled by “European-style socialists.” He mentioned some potential Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential race, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California.

“They hide behind labels like Democrat, left-wing and progressive to make their socialist agenda more palatable, and that is terrifying,” he said.

Sen. Harris responded to Mr. LaPierre in a tweet: “I am not going to be silenced by attacks from the NRA or anyone else — and neither will my Senate colleagues or the students from Stoneman Douglas. It’s time to stand up to the gun lobby and keep our communities safe.”

The office of Sen. Warren didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

On the media, Mr. LaPierre said: “You know, the whole discussion of the Second Amendment and the gun issue in this country has become so dishonest in the national media.”

In separate comments at CPAC, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said media outlets have their own motives. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” she said. “You guys love it. I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but I am saying you love the ratings.”
