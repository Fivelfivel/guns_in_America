Organizers of the March 24 protest are now seeking a permit to use Pennsylvania Avenue on a route that would take them from the Capitol to Trump International Hotel, NBC-4 reported.

The massive anti-gun rally, spearheaded by survivors of the Feb. 14 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people, is expected to draw 500,000 marchers. It was planned for an 11-block stretch of the mall, with sound systems, 14 Jumbotrons, 2,000 chairs, 2,000 portable johns and 14 tents, according to the permit application the group filed Feb. 20. Students and other speakers, musicians and video tributes are planned for the event.

“March for Our Lives is created by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,” organizers wrote in the application.

But another application, written by hand, was filed earlier for the space for the same day. That group sought permission for a “student project” related to “filming for a talent show,” according to the paperwork. The name of the school was redacted by the Park Service. The event will require jump ropes, two bikes and two tables. The project “takes a day to finish. Games will be the main activity for filming,” according to the application.

National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said permits are granted on a first-come, first-served system, regardless of what the space is used for.

“By regulation, when there is a conflict of time and location for events, precedence is established by the order in which the permit application was received,” Litterst told National Public Radio.

Litterst said the Park Service typically works with organizers of displaced events to find an alternative space. He suggested West Potomac Park and Pennsylvania Avenue.

The stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue now being eyed by the marchers —3rd Street NW to 12th Street NW — is within the District of Columbia’s jurisdiction, not a federal agency’s.

Anti-gun marches are planned for the same day at other locations across the country, as well as in other countries.

A message on the March for Our LivesFacebook page reads: “On March 24 we will take to the streets of Washington, DC and our communities across the country. We will be the last group of students who have to stand up for fallen children due to senseless gun violence. March with us.”

“My message for the people in office is: you’re either with us or against us. We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,” says Cameron Kasky, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS who survived the shooting https://t.co/23UcS7BvpW https://t.co/ERSSNzMPbu — CNN (@CNN) February 18, 2018

George and Amal Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and Steven Spielberg have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the march. Several celebrities plan to attend."

Gerald Herbert/The Associated Press After 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida, gun control advocates say they have momentum to enact new state laws. But in the years since the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, more state laws have actually expanded access to guns.

By Matt Vasilogambros

In the two weeks since the Florida school massacre, state lawmakers around the country have introduced bills to ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, and expand background checks — and also to arm teachers, lighten penalties for carrying without a permit, and waive handgun permit fees.

If history foretells, the gun-rights bills will have a better chance at success. In the years since Sandy Hook, when 26 were slain in 2012, states have enacted nearly 600 new gun laws, according to data compiled separately by the National Rifle Association and the Giffords Law Center to Reduce Gun Violence.

Nearly two-thirds of those were backed by the NRA.

It is “indisputably true” that there have been far more new laws that loosen gun restrictions than tighten them, said Michael Hammond, the legislative counsel at Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based “no compromise” gun lobbying organization. The way a state reacts to mass shootings depends on who controls its legislature, he said. And in the case of the states that expanded access to firearms, most were controlled by Republicans.

“If you are in favor of the Second Amendment, grow up with guns, are comfortable with guns, don’t want to see kids turned into sitting ducks, you’re more likely to say the solution is more guns,” Hammond said.

By the NRA’s count, governors since 2013 have enacted 382 “pro-gun” bills — many widely expanding access to firearms.

Governors in Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas and Texas, signed bills that would allow people with concealed carry licenses to bring guns onto college campuses, joining seven other states with similar laws.

New laws in at least five states — Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and West Virginia — allow gun owners to carry loaded firearms without a permit or training. So-called permitless carry laws now are in effect in more than 10 states.

After the latest massacre in Florida, Indiana lawmakers are close to making their state the next that allows people to carry guns on church grounds, even if there is a school on church property. Jack Sandlin, the Republican state senator who wrote the bill, said it’s “common sense” to want to pass this kind of legislation after mass shootings.

“People want to know how to protect themselves and protect their families,” Sandlin said. Before being elected to public office, he spent 35 years in law enforcement.

Successes in Gun Control

Also in the past five years, 210 “gun safety laws” were enacted in 45 states, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonprofit named after former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who survived an assassination attempt in 2011.

That’s far fewer than the number backed by the NRA, but advocates for restricting access to firearms don’t see things that way. Comparing the number of laws that expanded gun access to the number of laws that tightened restrictions on guns is “a false paradigm,” said Dan Gross, the former president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

“Sure, if you count every one of those little BS things that the corporate gun lobby has put out that you can say has weakened gun laws, it’d probably be a losing tally for us,” Gross said. “But when you look at it through the lens of what states have done to make them meaningfully safer, you can make a strong case that momentum has shifted.”

Since Sandy Hook, states such as Colorado, Delaware, New York, Oregon and Washington have expanded background checks for gun purchases.

During that same period, Alabama, Louisiana, Nevada, Tennessee, Utah and several other states enacted laws that prevent people convicted of domestic violence from possessing a gun. Nearly 30 states now have similar laws, and Oregon passed a similar bill last month.

Unlike NRA-backed legislation that is passed mostly in red states, these measures are being passed in both blue and red states, said Allison Anderman, the managing attorney at the Giffords center.

“The NRA is not getting permitless-carry and campus-carry laws enacted in true blue states like California, New Jersey, Connecticut or New York,” she said. “Whereas we’re getting laws that we think are extremely impactful in states like Alabama and Louisiana. How many people would have been shot and killed if we hadn’t passed those bills?”

What States Will Do Now

Two-thirds of Americans now support stricter gun control laws, polls have found. Further, nearly 90 percent of Americans support background checks for gun purchases.

Gun control activists say there is clearly a momentum right now. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, signed a “red flag” executive order this week that keeps guns away from people “who pose a danger to themselves and others.” Similar measures are being considered in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey.

The governors of Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and Rhode Island have joined forces to create a “States for Gun Safety” coalition to expand gun control efforts.

Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott proposed raising the age to buy assault rifles — a move that was also called for this week by President Donald Trump.

But even with this action, many states are far from enacting new gun restrictions. Already, some states are struggling to pass bills that would ban bump stocks, the devices that allow assault weapons to fire continuously. The Las Vegas gunman used a bump stock to quickly shoot more than 500 people.

States such as Idaho, Kentucky and South Dakota are now considering measures to further loosen gun laws in the wake of the Florida shooting.

In Arizona, a state with some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country, lawmakers are unlikely to pass new restrictive bills, said state Rep. Daniel Hernandez Jr., a Democrat. He interned for Giffords in 2011, and he was there when she and 18 others were shot in the parking lot of a supermarket in Tucson. He came to her aid and is credited with helping save her life.

Hernandez said it’s hard to pass restrictive gun bills in Arizona because of strong opposition from special interest groups, such as the Arizona Citizens Defense League, but also because guns are a part of the state’s history and culture."
huffpo2,huffpo,"['Sara Boboltz', 'Reporter']",2018-03-03 17:49:34-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/connecticut-high-school-student-national-school-walkout_us_5a987630e4b0479c0250a7af,"At home in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the news that a gunman had killed 17 people — mostly teenagers ― at a Parkland, Florida, high school didn’t come as a shock to 15-year-old Lane Murdock.

“When I found out, I was horrified, but kind of in the way of ‘Oh, another one?’” she told HuffPost.

That feeling didn’t sit right with her. Murdock hadn’t been very politically active, but her own reaction to the images coming out of Florida compelled her to dive headfirst into one of America’s most divisive issues: gun violence.

“It’s ingrained in American culture and that’s not OK ― the fact that I didn’t feel an overwhelming amount of emotion because it’s so normal,” she said. “I had such a numb reaction, I knew it was time for change. I know that the whole nation is numb to things like this, and that’s why change isn’t happening.”

So Murdock set out to organize a massive student walkout.

More than a thousand miles away, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High students were diving in, too. Suddenly confronted with news cameras, the teens spoke about the horror that had engulfed their school, appearing on national television visibly angry and sometimes in tears. They crafted a social media campaign, Never Again, and proposed a march on Washington, D.C., called the March for Our Lives. It’s scheduled for Saturday, March 24.

Lane Murdock Max Cumming (left), Paul Kim and Lane Murdock are organizing a national anti-gun walkout on the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine shooting.

Murdock doesn’t know any of the Parkland students. But in the hours after the shooting, she created a petition, “National High School Walk-Out for Anti Gun Violence,” on the activist platform Change.org. Murdock’s petition calls on the U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump to enact legislation aimed at preventing gun violence. She also proposes a day of protest on Friday, April 20, the 19th anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado that shocked the nation but sparked little action on gun reform.

The idea is that students across the country will leave their classes at 10 a.m. local time, followed by 17 minutes of silence — one minute for each victim of the Parkland shooting. Then, students will share their views on guns with peers and adults in an open-mic session. Individual schools are encouraged to add to the day’s schedule as they wish.

As of Saturday, the petition had around 242,000 signatures with a goal of 300,000. An accompanying website offers more details on the planned walkouts and graphics for DIY T-shirts.

Murdock’s event is scheduled for nearly a month after the March for Our Lives, which is expected to feature several high-profile speakers. With help from gun reform groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage, the latter event consists of at least 375 planned “sibling” marches. Murdock’s protest will also come around five weeks after #ENOUGH: A National School Walkout, which is set for Wednesday, March 14, by the organizers behind the Women’s March. Similar to Murdock’s event, #ENOUGH is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and last for 17 minutes to protest legislative inaction on gun policy.

Galvanized by the Stoneman Douglas students ― some of whom are now familiar faces on television and social media ― kids across the country are stepping up and speaking out for gun law reform.

Yet with so many events vying for their support, can they keep up the momentum?

“That’s the question of the year for me,” Murdock said, adding that organizing is especially difficult now that “our attention spans have never been shorter.”

Still, she sees the preceding events as “a nice ramping-up” to her National High School Walkout that “will keep the movement in people’s minds because they’re nicely spread apart.”

Organizing a nationwide protest when you’re attending high school five days a week is no simple thing. When she’s not in class or doing homework, Murdock, a sophomore, is checking her email, posting to Twitter and speaking with reporters. A few days after launching her petition, she enlisted the help of two seniors at her school, Paul Kim, 17, and Max Cumming, 18. Together, they’ve partnered with Indivisible, a nonprofit resistance organization, to come up with a guide for student activists on what to do on the day of the walkout.

Given their inherently disruptive nature, walkouts have proven controversial in some school districts, and some administrators have announced they will suspend kids who participate. In response, a number of universities said that disciplinary measures doled out to anti-gun protesters won’t count against them in the admissions process. Hundreds of students across Florida and other states have already staged anti-gun walkouts in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting.

Although Murdock refers to the National High School Walkout as “mine” as much as she calls it “ours,” she wants to be clear that she’s not pushing specific policy changes.

On Friday, April 20th we want students to attend school and then promptly WALK-OUT at 10:00 am. Sit outside your schools and peacefully protest. Make some noise. Voice your thoughts. ""We are students, we are victims, we are change."" — National School Walkout (@schoolwalkoutUS) February 17, 2018

“I think it’s important that this movement isn’t just about me or my ideologies. I mean, I have them, and I have them very strongly,” she said. (She doesn’t buy the National Rifle Association’s argument that the problem is not guns, it’s mental health, and she’s skeptical of Trump’s plan to incentivize armed teachers.) “But it’s also about giving a platform for kids of all sorts of backgrounds.”

Speaking for herself, Murdock said she’s “not one of those kids who’s been in New England and has never seen a gun before.” Her mother’s family hails from Texas, where Murdock was born. Several of her relatives own guns.

“I’ve definitely known people who are proud of their gun ownership and who see it as a part of their right as an American and American culture,” Murdock said.

She believes she understands the point of view of gun rights activists. Seeing so much gun violence concentrated in the U.S. has simply led her to disagree. Living just 30 minutes from Newtown, Connecticut ― the site of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that took the lives of 26 small children and adults ― has also had an impact. Gun violence is something people talk about in her community, and Murdock encourages other kids her age to start a dialogue with friends and family on the issue.

Teens can also contact their representatives at all levels of government, she noted. Their voices matter, even if they’re a few years away from hitting the voting booths.

“It’s important for people to know that my movement ― as well as being about gun control and solidarity with the Parkland kids ― it’s also about youth empowerment,” she said.

Murdock said she would like to meet the Parkland students whose tragedy inspired her to take action. As she explained it, she wanted to give them space to attend funerals and mourn before making an effort to get in touch. She plans to travel to Washington for the March for Our Lives, where many of those students are also expected to appear."

REI said on Thursday that it would place a hold on any future orders with Vista Outdoor, a conglomerate that recently acquired several popular adventure brands that have long been featured in REI locations. But Vista Outdoor also owns Savage Arms, a gun manufacturer and retailer that stocks several models of semi-automatic “modern sporting rifles.” Such manufacturers are facing backlash after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.

The Seattle-based REI said it had been in discussions with Vista Outdoor for the past week, and that the two companies’ relationship would be put on hold since REI learned that Vista Outdoor would not make a public statement “that outlines a clear plan of action” regarding common-sense gun control measures.

“REI does not sell guns. We believe that it is the job of companies that manufacture and sell guns and ammunition to work towards common sense solutions that prevent the type of violence that happened in Florida last month,” REI said in a statement. “We have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds. Companies are showing they can contribute if they are willing to lead. We encourage Vista to do just that.”

Numerous petitions have been calling for some of the nation’s biggest retailers, including REI, to end their relationships with gun manufacturers and firearm lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association. This week, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Walmart said they would no longer sell guns to anyone under the age of 21. Dick’s also said it would immediately end all sales of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines in its stores.

Companies including Delta, Hertz and MetLife have also terminated their relationships with the NRA in the weeks following the Parkland shooting.

CamelBak, one of the companies owned by Vista Outdoors, said efforts to boycott the brand were misplaced after another outdoor retailer, Canada’s Mountain Equipment Co-op, announced that it would suspend orders of the company’s products.

Dünzl\ullstein bild via Getty Images REI said it would suspend its relationship with Vista Outdoor, a conglomerate that owns several popular adventure brands but also a major gun manufacturer.

“Our brand falls within the Outdoor Products segment of our company, which operates separately from Vista Outdoor’s Shooting Sports segment,” CamelBak said in a statement. “Since 1989, CamelBak has been committed to forever changing the way people hydrate and perform. Our passion and love for the outdoors is unchanged. We are deeply committed to the individuals and communities we serve and we proudly partner with organizations to promote the enjoyment of the outdoors.“

REI has been no stranger to political statements in recent months. CEO Jerry Stritzke said he was “mad as hell” after the Trump administration decided to dramatically scale back two national monuments in Utah ― Bears Ears, which was cut by about 85 percent, and Grand Staircase-Escalante, which was reduced roughly by half."

There is NO SUCH THING as Dick’s Sporting Goods selling “an assault rifle” because it does not exist. Rather it would be a termed a semi-auto rifle or semi-auto carbine. Also, there is no such thing as a “high capacity” magazine. Over 5? Over 10? Over 15? Over 20? Over 30? Over 90?

Kinds of firearms have nothing to do with these mass murders. Think about it: The SAME firearm that the school children call to save them is the SAME firearm that only some of the perps use.

Example: During a church murder spree earlier this year where members were caught unarmed, an NRA member with an AR-15 STOPPED the carnage by scoring three hits on the murderer and then chased him down in a truck until the perp bled out. So there is no such thing as a “bad gun” or an inappropriate firearm in the hands of a “good guy”. Why would you ban a firearm? There is a Second Amendment in effect. Two, there are 450 million firearms in this country – nearly one for every man, woman and child!

My customers want the SAME firearm that the “bad guys” have so they can over-power them. I use my AR-15 for hunting and personal defense. The AR-15 started out in the civilian market, NOT the military.

I am sure I will have MANY MORE semi-auto rifles and semi-auto carbines offered on my online auction site because now EVERYONE will want one. When liberals attempt to introduce legislation for “bans” (no such thing as there are MILLIONS and MILLIONS of semi-auto rifles and semi-auto carbines in this country and NO ONE is going to “give up” any) they stimulate the market like never before. We always say Bill “Monica” Clinton was the world’s greatest gun salesman ever with his “Assault Weapon Ban” (did not work whatsoever as production kept going with just a few cosmetic changes and it caused MILLIONS of Americans to arm up with them anyway – hence no one reinstated the “ban” – not even the most liberal of legislators), however Obuma was the world’s best salesman (2016 there were 27.5 million firearm checks through NICS and way over that figure in private sales). A new record!

So will I make changes? Yes. I will be accepting even more semi-automatic firearms for sale! The market will go out of sight. I figure if someone can go to war with firearms, then they can surely buy one when they get back at age 18!

America’s school teachers and staff MUST arm up. I am on the Cody School Board and we are currently putting through a policy that will arm our teachers and staff. We need the correct firearms to do this.

Good Americans will NEVER give up any kinds of firearms. Period. Rather they will more heavily arm up with mass murder sprees as reported by the media.

History clearly shows us this.

The first surveys, conducted with the tragedy still flashing across TV screens, show a brief uptick in concern about gun violence, and maybe a spike in the national appetite for tighter firearm restrictions. Then, as soon as the story fades from the headlines, the increase is gone.

This time looks different.

A HuffPost/YouGov survey taken immediately after the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, found the same familiar uptick. But in the days since, the numbers have continued to shift in favor of congressional action on guns. There’s also a rising belief that Congress could actually take such action.

The deaths of 17 students and staff members Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School ― and the surge of activism that’s followed, led by surviving classmates ― have, the polling suggests, moved the national debate in a way that last year’s shootings at a Las Vegas concert and a Texas church did not.

Americans now say by a nearly a two-to-one margin, 50 percent to 26 percent, that it’s politically possible to pass stricter gun laws ― a high in polling since 2015, and a remarkable swing from less than two weeks ago, when just 38 percent saw it as feasible.

HuffPost

The shift spans political lines and includes both those who favor such a change and those who don’t. The share of Hillary Clinton voters believing new laws can be passed rose by 13 percentage points, while the share of Donald Trump voters rose 17 points.

Active support for making gun laws stricter has increased more modestly in the HuffPost/YouGov poll: It currently stands at 58 percent, up from the 48-to-54-percent range it occupied from last year.

But other questions show more substantial movement in a willingness to accept new restrictions, and in a sense that they’re legislatively achievable.

Sixty percent of Americans now say that mass shootings are something that can be stopped, rather than a fact of life in the country ― up 18 points from as recently as last October. A 51 percent majority say Congress should take action to reduce mass shootings, up 10 points since last year.

And 65 percent, including a majority in both parties, now say that it’s possible to enact some kinds of new gun regulations while still maintaining Americans’ right to bear arms. Immediately after last year’s Las Vegas shootings, just 53 percent said so.

Much of the change on this question appears due to a shift of opinion on the right. A majority of Trump voters, 52 percent, now say gun laws could be tightened without violating the Second Amendment, up from 43 percent immediately after the Parkland shooting and just 33 percent after last year’s Las Vegas shooting. Among Republicans, the number is currently 61 percent, up from 42 percent last fall.

The change in opinion on guns should come with a sizable helping of caveats. Public support for gun control ― and especially for specific measures like background checks, which enjoy near-universal support ― has long outpaced the implementation of actual policy on the issue, in part because opponents of gun restrictions have been more likely to make their views heard to officials.

And though the 21 percent who count gun issues among their top priorities in the HuffPost/YouGov poll is notably higher than it was last year, the topic still ranks behind issues like health care and the economy. It’s also unclear whether the momentum behind this push for gun control will last the months until the midterm elections.

At this moment, however, the political landscape looks more promising for gun control advocates than it has in some time.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll is among a slew of recent surveys finding a substantial shift on gun control. A roundup of the latest from other outlets:

CNN: “Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to the highest level since 1993, and almost two-thirds say government and society can take action to prevent future mass shootings, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The findings suggest the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, has shifted public opinion on gun laws in a way other recent mass shootings have not.”

Politico: “Support for stricter gun laws has spiked in polls conducted after the fatal South Florida school shooting, hitting its highest level in at least a quarter-century. Roughly 2 in 3 Americans now say gun control laws should be made more strict in the wake of the murder of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to a number of polls, including a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll that shows support for stricter gun laws among registered voters at 68 percent, compared with just 25 percent who oppose stricter gun laws.”

Quinnipiac: “American voters support stricter gun laws 66-31 percent, the highest level of support ever measured by the independent Quinnipiac University National Poll, with 50-44 percent support among gun owners and 62- 35 percent support from white voters with no college degree and 58-38 percent support among white men.”

YouGov: “A majority of the public consistently has supported many gun control proposals: just over half in last week’s Economist/YouGov Polls say they want stricter gun laws in general. But support has not grown beyond that ― until now. ... The movement towards supporting stricter gun laws has taken place across the political spectrum.”

Marist: “Following the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 71% of Americans, including 58% of gun owners, agree the laws governing the sale of firearms need to be stricter. This is up from 64% in October 2017. ... Of note, 77% of Americans who say a candidate’s position on gun policy will have a major influence on their vote in this year’s midterm elections assert gun laws need to be strengthened.”

USA Today: “Americans overwhelmingly support tougher gun laws, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but they also overwhelmingly agree on this: Congress isn’t likely to act anytime soon.”

CBS: “Sixty-five percent of Americans now say laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter ― an eight-point increase from December. It is the highest number recorded in this poll for stricter gun sale laws. The rise has been primarily among Republicans and independents, with a large increase among Republicans from last December. Democrats remain in favor.”

The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 26-28 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

The program enabled people to register their firearms, sell them to a licensed dealer or have them destroyed, according to the department. It also provided protection from prosecution for people who aren’t criminals but still had unregistered firearms from what Australia calls the “grey market.”

“It’s critical to get them off this grey market … so they don’t end up in the black market,” said Angus Taylor, the country’s federal law enforcement minister. “Taking these unregistered firearms off the streets means they will not fall into the hands of criminals, who might use them to endanger the lives of innocent Australians.”

Some grey market weapons have been found to have been passed onto the black market and used in several recent attacks in Australia, including a siege on a cafe in Sydney in 2014.

But the country hasn’t experienced a mass shooting since 1996, when a gunman wielding AR-15 and L1A1 rifles killed 35 people during the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania. Then-Prime Minister John Howard implemented a series of gun control measures, which banned certain types of firearms and created a registry for gun owners. He also introduced the idea of a government buy-back program, in which gun owners handed in hundreds of thousands of firearms between October 1996 and September 1997.

Australia has been cited as a potential model for the U.S., where calls for gun reform typically go unheeded.

“I have no doubt that a debate will be raised again about United States gun laws,” foreign minister Julie Bishop told “Sunrise” morning show in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas last fall. “Each state has different laws. What Australia can do is share our experience.”

Yet gun control advocates in Australia are concerned about the hundreds of thousands of firearms that remain in the hands of private citizens, as well as about insufficient enforcement of gun laws. A 2017 review of the National Firearms Agreement, the law put in place following the Port Arthur shooting, determined that most states had significantly loosened their gun laws since 1996."
huffpo10,huffpo,"['Michael Mclaughlin', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice Reporter']",2015-06-17 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/17/guns-self-defense-study_n_7608350.html,"American gun owners are far more likely to injure themselves or someone else with their firearm than to stop a criminal, according to a new study from a group calling for tighter gun control.

The study, released Wednesday by the Violence Policy Center, found there were 258 justifiable homicides involving civilians using firearms in 2012, compared with 8,342 murders by gun. Even if a criminal isn't shot down, the study found that civilians rarely use guns to protect themselves. ""Intended victims of property crimes engaged in self-protective behavior with a firearm"" only 0.1 percent of the times they were targeted by a crook.

The report, titled ""Firearm Justifiable Homicides and Non-Fatal Self-Defense Gun Use"" relied on FBI and Bureau of Justice data. The Violence Policy Center said the report disproves the premise of arguments by the National Rifle Association that more guns in the hands of regular people will reduce crime.

“The NRA has staked its entire agenda on the claim that guns are necessary for self-defense, but this gun industry propaganda has no basis in fact,” the group's executive director, Josh Sugarmann, said in a statement. “Guns are far more likely to be used in a homicide than in a justifiable homicide by a private citizen. In fact, a gun is far more likely to be stolen than used in self-defense.”

In addition to the thousands of annual murders, roughly 22,000 people die accidentally from a gun or use one to commit suicide.

Gun rights advocates, however, have long armed themselves with contrarian statistics, saying people are safer thanks to the Second Amendment.

The Cato Institute, which advocates against restrictions on gun ownership, maintains a map showing where a firearm has successfully stopped a crime. The group says there are many unreported incidents in which a would-be criminal flees when a civilian brandishes a gun in self-defense.

""Gun control proponents cannot deny that people use guns successfully against criminals, but they tend to play down how often such events take place,"" the Cato website says.

The Gun Owners of America maintains a section on its website ""just for skeptics"" that cites reports that Americans each year use guns 2.5 million times in self-defense.

Claims that guns are used millions of times each year in self-defense are untrue, however, according to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, which also found that ""firearms are used far more often to intimidate than in self-defense.""

“Purchasing a gun may help enrich the firearms industry, but the facts show it is unlikely to increase your personal safety,” Sugarmann said. “In fact, in a nation of more than 300 million firearms, it is striking how rarely guns are used in self-defense.”

The Second Amendment is highly contested. There is no doubt that people do have the right to carry and have a stockpile of guns (""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"") and a state has the right to organize a well-regulated Militia. But, the main issue is on the right to self-defend with a firearm.

The main problem with the notion of self-defense is it imposes on justice, for everyone has the right for a fair trial. Therefore, using a firearm to defend oneself is not legal because if the attacker is killed, he or she is devoid of his or her rights. In addition, one's mental capacity is a major factor in deciding whether a man or woman has the right to have a firearm. There are two reasons for ensuring mental capacity. First, one of the Five Aims is to ensure domestic tranquility and there can be no tranquility if one does not have the capacity. Second, if one's brain is distorting his or her reality, they do not have the proper reasoning and deduction skills to use a firearm.

Therefore, if we ponder and meditate on the recent events in news about guns, it would be obvious that the current state is incorrect. A gun for civilians is a weapon for a revolution and not for ordinary use. The belief that a gun is a useful tool to protect one is counterintuitive because guns get into the hands of people who use them for horrible reasons. In addition, there are reasons why cops are trained to use a firearm in stressful situations. It is not to keep their mind at ease or anything of that sort, but to be able to fire accurately at the target in the correct location. It is immensely difficult to fire when under pressure. Moreover, one may argue this is an analogous argument and yes it is because the United States government is lobbied to not study or fund research that observes the effects of guns. This cripples the chance of evaluating a proper policy to deal with gun violence. But, there was one study by ABC, which observed using guns in a classroom. All the participations poorly performed at the mock situation.

Once again, if there is an argument in the reasoning of this amendment and others, one must filter it through the Five Aims of the USA and the Bill of Rights. This is to ensure that any argument can be answered, avoiding a political divide."
huffpo12,huffpo,"['Melissa Jeltsen', 'Senior Reporter']",2016-02-26 10:20:30-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-lite-domestic-abusers-own-guns_us_56cf6822e4b0871f60eaa82b,"In 2009, an anonymous tipster contacted authorities with a hunch: A bald eagle had been shot and killed, and they knew who did it.

A Maine man, Stephen Voisine, was arrested for the crime. He turned over his rifle to police. As it turned out, he was not legally allowed to own guns. Six years earlier, he’d been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor against his girlfriend after she called police and said he’d slapped her -- and not for the first time. Two years later, he was convicted of assaulting her again.

Under a federal law called the Lautenberg Amendment, if you’ve been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor, you can’t own or buy a gun. If you’re caught with one, as Voisine was, you can face up to 10 years behind bars. In 2011, Voisine was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a prohibited person.

On Monday, he and another Maine man with a similar story are taking their case to the Supreme Court. Lawyers for the two men are arguing that their convictions for violating the amendment should be reversed -- because they never should have lost their gun rights to begin with.

Both men were convicted of domestic violence under Maine statutes that include ""reckless"" conduct. Their lawyers argue that the men acted in the heat of the moment and their impulsive, reckless acts of domestic violence are not serious enough to qualify under the federal gun ban.

In essence, as The Trace explains, they're arguing for a hierarchy of domestic violence offenses. In their estimation, not all domestic violence convictions should result in a gun ban. Instead, they say, only intentional, purposeful acts of violence should trigger the loss of gun rights under federal law.

The question put to the court boils down to this: Does it matter what mental state you are in when you commit domestic violence? Under the law, if you commit such a crime recklessly, as opposed to knowingly or intentionally, should you still forfeit your right to buy or possess guns?

Why should I care about this case?

If the court sides with the two men, it's possible that only some types of domestic violence convictions would result in abusers losing their gun rights.

That would be a dangerous scenario, according to the many anti-violence organizations that filed friend-of-the-court briefs. Research shows that if an abuser has access to a gun, victims are five times more likely to be killed. A recent Associated Press analysis found that an average of 760 Americans were killed with guns annually by intimate partners, though that is likely an undercount. More than 80 percent of the victims were women.

It also appears to go against the spirit of the Lautenberg Amendment, which was enacted to make sure that all domestic abusers -- whether convicted of felonies or misdemeanors -- can't own guns.

Oh, right, the Lautenberg Amendment. Why is it important again?

In 1996, Congress passed the amendment to the Gun Control Act, which barred individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from owning or buying guns.

At the time, people who were convicted of felonies were already banned from owning guns. But Congress noticed that domestic abusers were falling through the cracks. Even if they were alleged to have committed serious, violent crimes against their partners, the offenses were frequently charged as or pleaded down to misdemeanors.

“The fact is, that in many places today, domestic violence is not taken as seriously as other forms of criminal behavior,” then-Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) argued on the Senate floor.

In the past few years, there’s been state-level drive to strengthen laws keeping guns away from domestic abusers and ensuring that those who are barred from owning weapons are actually required to hand them in.

So why do the petitioners believe their convictions don’t count under the federal gun ban?

Lawyers for the men are arguing that the gun ban should only apply to people who intend to hurt their partners, not those who merely act recklessly or impulsively.

But as the government lawyers point out, most states' simple assault and battery laws --- which are typically used to address domestic violence -- lump crimes committed recklessly or intentionally together.

The stakes of this decision will be measured in lives. Everytown for Gun Safety

For example, under Maine law, a person is guilty of assault if he or she ""intentionally, knowingly or recklessly cause bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person."" Many states use similar language.

It’s important to note that reckless acts don’t mean accidental. Under Maine law, a person acts recklessly when he or she ""consciously disregards a risk that the person’s conduct will cause such a result.""

What does the government think?

The government’s position is that the federal gun ban on domestic abusers was clearly intended to include reckless acts of violence. Excluding those acts from the Lautenberg Amendment would ""frustrate (if not destroy) Congress’s manifest purpose"" to keep firearms from convicted domestic abusers, according to government lawyers.

Many types of violence that are common in abusive relationships, such as pushing, slapping, hitting and restraining a person, could be considered reckless, they argue. ""[T]o exclude reckless conduct would be to exclude exactly those familiar forms of domestic abuse from [the Lautenberg Amendment]. Congress could not have intended that result.""

However, the Supreme Court may think the language in the Lautenberg Amendment is constitutionally vague, in which case it may agree that the federal charges against the two men should be dropped. This is because criminal law requires statutes to be written very specifically and any provision that sweeps too broadly is in danger of being restricted.

If the court goes that route, it's likely to simply decide that the ""reckless"" use of physical force, without more specificity at the state level, means someone can't be federally prosecuted under the anti-gun law.

Why does it matter if domestic abusers have access to guns?

More women in this country die at the hands of their intimate partners -- their boyfriends, husbands and exes -- than any other type of perpetrator. Most of those homicides are committed with guns.

In a recent project, The Huffington Post tracked all the people killed in suspected intimate partner homicides over the month of January. We found that 112 people were killed, including children and bystanders. Firearms were responsible for 57 percent of those deaths.

In addition, most U.S. mass shootings are related to domestic violence.

Laws that make it harder for domestic abusers to get guns are shown to save lives. One study, for example, found that state laws restricting firearm access for people subject to protective orders were associated with a 25 percent lower rate of gun-related intimate partner homicides.

As Everytown for Gun Safety summed up in a friend-of-the-court brief for the case, ""the stakes of this decision will be measured in lives.""

huffpo13,huffpo,"['Peter H. Stone', 'Ben Hallman', 'Senior Editor For Projects', 'Investigations', 'The Huffington Post']",2013-01-11 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/nra-gun-control-firearms-industry-ties_n_2434142.html,"Throughout its 142-year history, the National Rifle Association has portrayed itself as an advocate for the individual gun owner’s Second Amendment rights. In turn, the NRA relied on those gun owners, especially its 4 million or so members, to pressure lawmakers into carrying out its anti-gun control agenda.

In the last two decades, however, the deep-pocketed NRA has increasingly relied on the support of another constituency: the $12-billion-a-year gun industry, made up of manufacturers and sellers of firearms, ammunition and related wares. That alliance was sealed in 2005, when Congress, after heavy NRA lobbying, approved a measure that gave gunmakers and gun distributors broad, and unprecedented, immunity from a wave of liability lawsuits related to gun violence in America’s cities.

It was a turning point for both the NRA and the industry, both of which recognized the mutual benefits of a partnership. That same year, the NRA also launched a lucrative new fundraising drive to secure “corporate partners” that’s raked in millions from the gun industry to boost its operations.

But that alliance, which has grown even closer in recent years -- and includes ties both financial and personal, a Huffington Post examination has found -- has led to mounting questions from gun control advocates about the NRA's priorities. Is the nation’s most potent gun lobby mainly looking out for its base constituency, the estimated 80 million Americans who own a firearm? Or is it acting on behalf of those that make and sell those guns?

According to a 2012 poll conducted by GOP pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, 74 percent of NRA members support mandatory background checks for all gun purchases, a position that the NRA has stridently opposed. “There’s a big difference between the NRA’s rank and file and the NRA’s Washington lobbyists, who live and breathe for a different purpose,” Mark Glaze, the executive director of the gun control group, said.

The questions about the NRA's ties to the gun industry, and whether those ties have influenced its agenda, have come to the forefront in the wake of horrific mass shootings last year in Connecticut, Colorado and Wisconsin.

A week after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in a Newtown, Conn., school, Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president and top lobbyist, gave a tense, combative performance at a press conference in which he signalled the organization wouldn't budge from its long-held opposition to most gun control measures.

Instead, LaPierre revealed that the NRA favored putting thousands of armed guards in schools to curb shootings. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he said.

The NRA’s deep ties to the gun industry dismays some lawmakers who have introduced gun control bills responding to the mass shootings.

“The NRA is basically helping to make sure the gun industry can increase sales,” Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat and longtime gun control advocate, told The Huffington Post. McCarthy last week proposed a bill that would ban new sales of new large ammunition clips that increase the lethality of weapons like those used in mass shootings in Connecticut, Colorado and Wisconsin.

“No one is challenging NRA members' right to own guns,” McCarthy said. ""We’ve had large mass shootings which have [involved] large mass assault weapons clips. These clips aren’t used for hunting.”

McCarthy’s husband and five other people were shot dead in a brutal assault in 1993 on a New York commuter train by a man wielding a gun with a large-capacity ammunition clip.

The Obama administration is reportedly considering a much broader approach to curbing gun violence: bans on assault weapons and large ammunition clips, mandatory background checks on all gun purchases, increased mental health checks and expanded penalties for carrying guns near schools. On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden said that the White House had determined that ""executive action can be taken,"" though the specifics have not been settled.

The administration is also trying secure backing from big retailers like Walmart that sell guns, with an eye to undercutting the influence of the NRA and gun industry allies -- a strategy that might peel off some of their gun-owner grassroots. Walmart leaders announced this week that they will attend a Thursday meeting at the White House.

Gun control advocates who have lagged badly behind the NRA in fundraising and organization are now are accelerating their efforts. On Tuesday, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), who was badly wounded two years ago in a mass shooting, launched a new gun control political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, to counter the NRA’s legendary financial and political clout with Congress.

The NRA declined to comment. In recent years, it has argued that defending gun owners and the gun industry is one in the same. Any new laws or regulations that would limit the availability of firearms, or restrict who can own them, would violate the Second Amendment, the organization has said. The NRA has said it does support efforts to keep guns out of the hands of felons, those who have been adjudicated as mentally incompetent, or unsupervised children.

The NRA forwarded a letter to The Huffington Post that the group sent to Congress. The letter is signed by Chris Cox, who runs the NRA lobbying arm. “We know that the facts prove gun bans do not work and that is why they are not supported by the majority of the American people,” the letter said. Cox promised that the NRA would adopt a “constructive” stance in the debate, and reiterated past NRA positions that existing laws need to be better enforced.

In 2011, 32,000 Americans died due to gun violence. The homicide rate in the U.S. is about 20 times higher than in other advanced nations.

'YOUR FIGHT HAS BECOME OUR FIGHT'

Close ties between the NRA and gunmakers go back at least to 1999, when the NRA publicly declared its support for the firearms industry as it prepared to defend itself from a rash of liability lawsuits filed by cities and municipalities.

“Your fight has become our fight,” then-NRA president Charlton Heston declared before a crowd of gun company executives at the annual SHOT Show, the industry's biggest trade show. “Your legal threat has become our constitutional threat,"" he said.

Following the passage of the shield law that dismembered those lawsuits, the NRA launched a new fundraising drive targeting firearms companies the organization had just helped in a big way. That effort, dubbed ""Ring of Freedom,"" paid off handsomely. Since 2005, the NRA drive has pulled in $14.7 million to $38.9 million from dozens of gun industry giants, including Beretta USA, Glock and Sturm, Ruger, according to a 2011 study by the Violence Policy Center, a group that favors gun control.

The Violence Policy Center study cited an NRA promotional brochure about the corporate partnership drive, noting that LaPierre promised that “this program is geared towards your company’s corporate interests.”

Despite the millions of dollars it has collected from the gun industry, the NRA’s website says “it is not affiliated with any firearm or ammunition manufacturers or with any businesses that deal in guns and ammunition.”

Besides its heavy lobbying for the special legal protections for gunmakers and distributors, the NRA pushed successfully in 2004 to ensure that a 10-year ban on assault weapons, enacted in 1994 over strong NRA objections, wasn’t renewed. Since then, annual rifle production by U.S. gunmakers has risen by almost 38 percent, according to federal gun data.

“The NRA clearly benefits from the gun industry,” William Vizzard, a former agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told The Huffington Post. “There’s a symbiotic relationship. They have co-aligned goals much more than 30 or 40 years ago.”

Vizzard noted that the gun industry has evolved slowly in recent decades from a “stodgy and conservative” business, which sold mostly rifles and sporting arms, to one that now traffics in paramilitary weapons and handguns. The NRA and the gun industry “have grown closer as the business has changed,” he said.

The intertwining interests of the NRA and the gun industry are also underscored by the gun company executives on the NRA board.

Among the gun industry heavyweights on the 76-seat NRA board are Ronnie Barrett, CEO of Tennessee-based Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, which makes a military-style rifle sold with high-capacity magazines. Pete Brownell, who heads Iowa-based Brownells Inc., another maker of high-capacity magazines, also sits on the NRA board.

These companies and other gun industry giants have ponied up big bucks to the NRA since 2005, according to a list of NRA corporate partners posted at its last convention.

For instance, Brownells is in an elite group of donors that have given between $1 million and $4.9 million since 2005. Barrett Firearms in the same period chipped in between $50,000 and $99,000.

Another notable donor is Freedom Group, which owns Bushmaster, the company that made the AR-15 military-style rifle used by Adam Lanza in his bloody assault on Sandy Hook. The Freedom Group has donated between $25,000 and $49,000 to the NRA’s corporate effort.

The NRA’s most generous gun industry backer is MidwayUSA, a distributor of high-capacity magazine clips, similar to ones that Lanza loaded into his Bushmaster rifle and Glock pistol. These clips increase the lethality of weapons by allowing dozens of shots to be fired before the shooter has to reload. According to its website, Midway has donated about $7.7 million to the NRA through another fundraising program that dates back to 1992. Under this program, customers who buy Midway products are asked to “round up” the price to the next dollar, with the company donating the difference to the NRA.



While the bond between the NRA and the gun industry has tightened, the NRA’s annual budget of about $250 million is still largely derived from other sources, including membership dues, merchandising and ads in NRA magazines. The magazines, though, are chock-full of gun industry ads.

Still, veteran gun control advocates said the NRA’s links with the gun industry may backfire as it deploys its lobbying to stave off new curbs.

“I think it’s much easier for policymakers to defend the NRA when they’re perceived as efforts on behalf of gun owners,” Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, said. “That equation changes dramatically when they’re seen as defending the gun industry.”

Whether this prediction holds true in the looming debate over gun control remains to be seen. But in the early-2000s, most lawmakers had few reservations about showing their support for the NRA -- even when the organization was lobbying for a law that would carve out a legal safe haven for the gun industry from civil negligence lawsuits.

'HOW'S THE WAR GOING?'

The fight to pass the liability shield law, known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, began after state attorneys general won a landmark $200 billion settlement against tobacco companies on claims they knowingly misled smokers about the dangers of cigarettes.

The success of the smoking cases led more than 30 cities and municipalities to sue the gun industry, citing negligence in the marketing and sale of firearms. The industry also faced increasing negligence lawsuits filed by victims of gun violence.

The most significant of these cases was brought by the families of the 13 people killed or seriously injured over a three-week span by the Washington, D.C.-area snipers, John Muhammad and Lee Malvo. The pair used a .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle, the same model as Lanza. The weapon was allegedly stolen from a gun shop with a history of weapons ""disappearing"" from its inventory. The victims' families claimed the shop was negligent, as was the gunmaker, for not better policing problem stores.

In 2004, Bushmaster and the gun dealer settled the lawsuit for $2.5 million in a case that gun control advocates hailed as a ""major breakthrough.""

The gun company warned that cases like this could bankrupt it. Gunmakers described the legal fight in militaristic terms.

""As I walk through the plant, employees stop to ask me 'How's the war going?'"" said Rodd Walton, the top lawyer for Sig Sauer, then called Sigarms, at a congressional hearing in 2005. “It's the war we are fighting against plaintiffs filing junk and frivolous lawsuits.""

Though the gun industry has its own lobbying arm, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, based in Newtown, Conn., its influence pales in comparison with the NRA, which grades lawmakers on their fealty to the Second Amendment, and runs attack ads against candidates it perceives as on the wrong side of the fight. In the wake of its last major defeat -- the 1994 assault weapons ban -- the NRA mounted a successful campaign to push many of the ban's supporters, especially Democrats from rural areas, out of office.

The gun industry found a ready ally in the NRA, as Heston’s 1999 call to arms demonstrated. To aid its cause in Congress, the NRA enlisted one of its most trusted and powerful soldiers: then-Republican Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a longtime NRA board member.

The NRA and its allies argued that the lawsuits could destroy the gun industry, thus endangering Second Amendment rights.

""The cost of these lawsuits threatens to drive a critical industry out of business ... jeopardizing Americans' constitutionally protected access to firearms for self defense and other lawful uses,"" Craig said.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence fiercely opposed the bill to protect gunmakers from liability. ""This was entirely a fight for the gun industry and more specifically for the worst actors in the gun industry,"" said Jonathan Lowry, a lawyer for the organization.

One of the bill's congressional opponents was Rep. Mel Watt. (D-N.C.). ""I had no animosity toward guns, I had an animosity for setting precedents for other industries,"" Watt recently told The Huffington Post. Watt said he didn't understand why gunmakers should gain a legal shield available to no other industry.

But the NRA won the day, handily. Craig, who did not respond to a request for comment made through his lobbying firm, spearheaded the effort to get the bill through the U.S. Senate, where it eventually collected 15 Democratic votes, including that of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

In May 2006, the NRA's lobbying arm awarded Craig the Harlon B. Carter Legislative Achievement Award, its highest honor.

'MASSIVE OBAMA CONSPIRACY'

Since the passage of the 2005 law, ties between the NRA and the gunmakers have deepened.

The gun industry and other large corporate and individual donors chipped in $71.1 million in 2011 to NRA coffers, compared with $46.3 million in 2004, according to a Bloomberg News review of NRA tax returns.

The NRA’s fierce lobbying for other laws -- especially bills that have passed in almost every state allowing the carrying of concealed weapons -- also seem to have endeared the pro-gun goliath to many companies. After Wisconsin passed its concealed carry law, Fifer of Sturm Ruger told analysts in an earnings call that sales in the Badger State should get a boost.

As the debate about gun control moves forward, some analysts said the NRA's hard-line rhetoric benefits the gun industry in another way: it boosts sales.

“The NRA is generating fear,” said Vizzard, the former federal agent. “The industry has learned that the more controversy there is about guns, the more guns sell -- whether it’s a legitimate controversy over a bill, or a trumped-up one like, 'Obama’s been re-elected, they’re going to take away our guns.'”

A case in point has been the NRA’s strident rhetoric about the threat posed by President Barack Obama. The president, to the dismay of gun control advocates, failed to back new gun curbs in his first term, even though he endorsed renewing the lapsed assault weapons ban during his 2008 campaign.

Even so, the NRA's LaPierre fiercely opposed Obama's reelection, warning in late 2011 of a ""massive Obama conspiracy to deceive voters and hide his true intentions to destroy the Second Amendment in our country.” Interestingly, stock prices for gunmakers Sturm, Ruger and Smith & Wesson jumped in the wake of Obama’s November win.

After the Newtown massacre, sales jumped again. Given the NRA's past rhetoric, the odds are good that it will characterize any new gun legislation as proof that it was right to be wary of the president's motives.

Even so, the NRA would be wise to consider whether its rhetoric and agressive anti-gun control stance might alienate some of its membership, Vizzard said. Historically, he said, the NRA membership ""appears to be more amenable,"" to certain types of regulation than the NRA leadership is.

The NRA’s ability to intimidate legislators at the polls may also be waning after last fall’s election. The NRA spent $17.4 million on the presidential and congressional contests in last year's general elections, according to Open Secrets, the web site for the Center for Responsive Politics. The NRA failed to unseat Obama and lost six out of seven Senate races, where it spent more than $100,000, according to Media Matters.

That gives hope to Rep. McCarthy as Congress begins to consider new legislation, including her bill to ban the sale of new high-capacity clips: “We’ve had members of Congress who’ve stood up the NRA and they’ve survived elections,” McCarthy said."
huffpo14,huffpo,"['Erin Schumaker', 'Senior Reporter']",2016-11-04 10:45:47-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/99-percent-chance-you-know-gun-violence-victim_us_581920c5e4b0f96eba96c42e,"For many people hearing about gun violence, it can feel really far away ― a mass shooting on the other side of the country, a death in the home of a gun owner, the street violence described in Donald Trump’s offensive appeal to African-American voters: “You walk down the street, you get shot.”

Indeed, racial segregation helps further the myth that many Americans won’t be affected by gun violence.

“Because everyday gun violence is concentrated in racially segregated neighborhoods, it’s easy for millions of Americans to think they won’t be affected,” the Guardian reported in a June investigation into America’s gun problem.

But in reality, firearm injuries and death will impact nearly every single American over the course of his or her lifetime.

According to a study published this month in the journal Preventive Medicine, there’s a 99 percent chance that someone in your social network will by injured or killed by a gun over the course of your lifetime. Those statistics don’t differ much by race, with 97 percent of white Americans, 99 percent of black Americans, 99 percent of Hispanic Americans and 90 percent of people of other races knowing at least one person affected by gunfire by the time they turn 60.

“When you start talking to people, you realize that everybody knows somebody who’s been injured by a gun,” said study author Dr. Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and a dean at the Boston University School of Public Health. “This is a challenge that we all need to wrap our brains around. Not simply a challenge that affects people who are ‘other’ or unlike us.”

Galea and his BU colleagues relied on fatal and non-fatal gun injury data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as research that estimates the average person’s social network to be a relatively similar group of 291 people.

Of course, not all social networks lack diversity. “I would expect that there is more heterogeneity across groups than the paper could actually capture,” Galea said, noting that he and his colleagues applied gold standard social network assumptions to their model, but in the end, the results are group averages.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 82,000 people are injured and 33,000 people are killed by firearms every year. One statistic that often goes underreported: More than 21,000 of those gun deaths are by suicide.

Focusing on so-called ‘inner-city’ gun violence obscures much of the problem

Firearms kill black Americans at twice the rate of white Americans, according to a 2014 study published in the British Medical Journal. And as the Guardian rightly notes, poor and racially segregated neighborhoods (the south and west sides of Chicago for example) have higher levels of gun violence.

But ignoring the widespread nature of firearm injuries and deaths flattens the picture: It discounts deaths by suicide and discourages communities outside of the gun violence spotlight from investing in solutions to a problem that affects everyone.

For example, suicide is concentrated in white America.

Two-thirds of gun deaths are suicides and white men make up the majority of those deaths, accounting for 83 percent of suicides in 2014. And the problem is growing. Suicide by any method increased by 43 percent among middle-aged men, ages 45 to 64, over the last 15 years.

What’s more, white Americans are more likely than black Americans to view guns positively. According to a 2014 Pew survey on gun ownership attitudes, white Americans (62 percent) are more likely than black Americans (54 percent) to say that guns protect people rather than put people’s personal safety at risk.

Coupled with the new study, the Pew survey suggests that the majority of Americans ― and especially white Americans ― perceive firearms as safer than they are.

Starting from scratch on firearm research

The new study, like most gun violence research, doesn’t have much to build on.

“Gun violence is probably the only thing in this country that kills so many people, injures so many people, that we are not actually doing sufficient research on,” Dr. Alice Chen, the executive director of Doctors for America, told HuffPost last year.

The Dickey Amendment, passed in 1996 following National Riffle Association pressure, effectively stifled firearm research for the next two decades by forbidding CDC funding “to advocate or promote gun control.” But in 2013, after the Sandy Hook massacre, President Barack Obama issued an executive order to the to CDC to resume studying gun violence causes and prevention.

Still, the CDC hasn’t done much to wade back into the field, and even an executive order from the president can’t undo 20 years of missed research."

However, the results of a national teacher survey, released Wednesday, suggests the goals of the ""guns-in-schools"" bills may be far from what teachers really want.

According to the online poll, 72.4 percent of teachers would not likely bring a firearm to school, if allowed. Administered by the School Improvement Network in January, the questionnaire surveyed 10,661 educators from all 50 states.

The results echo a similar poll, conducted in January by the National Education Association, that found 68 percent of its members -- primarily teachers, faculty and education support staff -- opposed a proposal to arm teachers.

""They are the ones that are living with the risk as it relates to school safety and violence,"" Chet Linton, chief executive officer of the teacher-training company that administered the most recent survey, told USA Today about the motivation behind the poll, ""so we thought it would be good just to share what they had to say.""

The survey paints an interesting picture of how gun violence in schools -- especially in the wake of Sandy Hook -- has shaped teacher opinions about school safety. While 91.6 percent of respondents said they feel safe in school, educators are far from unanimous when it comes to school safety and guns.

According to the poll's results, 31.1 percent of teachers say their schools are not safe from gun violence.

While legislators in states such as Arizona, North Carolina and Mississippi have proposed bills that would enable teachers to carry firearms in schools, a majority of teachers (87.8 percent) would prefer armed police officers over arming themselves (27.6 percent).

Recently, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan spoke out on behalf of educators, calling such proposals to arm teachers ""a marketing opportunity"" for the gun industry.

""The vast majority of teachers have spoken pretty loudly and said they're not interested in being armed, so that's a red herring,"" Duncan told reporters during a meeting at the U.S. Education Department.

Instead, the White House has suggested allowing individual school districts the opportunity to hire armed guards -- but only if they want them. In January, President Barack Obama addressed school safety issues, recommending that resource officers be placed in schools in order to help prevent crime and violence. Though these in-school police officers would be federally funded, they are by no means a requirement for all districts."

In Nevada, like in most states, it’s legal to openly carry long guns, like rifles and shotguns. No permit is required for this sort of display. That means people are allowed to walk down the Las Vegas Strip with a military-style rifle slung over their shoulder, although casinos and other private businesses can bar those individuals from their premises.

It’s also legal in Nevada to own a fully automatic firearm, such as a machine gun, though federal regulations require owners to pay a $200 fee and submit to an extensive federal background check and fingerprinting, which can take up to a year to complete. This weaponry is regulated under the National Firearms Act. Some states have laws specifically restricting machine guns, but most don’t.

Because of the rarity of these weapons, however, fully automatic firearms can be incredibly expensive ― usually between $20,000 and $30,000, said Benjamin Bunker, a Las Vegas attorney who specializes in firearms-related matters.

“If he was gonna buy a full-auto machine gun, he would’ve found a dealer online selling it, they would have entered into a purchase agreement, he’d pay the guy, the guy would then transfer the full-auto machine gun to a dealer, and then the dealer holds on to that gun until the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] gives him the green light,” said Bunker.

There are plenty of firearms on the black market. But illegal full-automatic machine guns are a top priority for ATF, and are harder to find, said Bunker.

That said, Nevada does not specifically restrict open carrying of machine guns.

“Nevada doesn’t make any distinction, semi-auto versus full auto,” said Bunker.

Authorities have not yet publicly identified any weapons the gunman used on Sunday, but confirmed that the shooter rained down fully automatic gunfire on a crowd of concertgoers, killing at least 58 people and injuring more than 500 from his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino. Las Vegas police said there were at least 10 firearms in his hotel room, including “long rifles.”

Typical military-style rifles are semi-automatic and are not capable of automatic fire, but they can be illegally altered to do so. Nevada does not restrict this popular type of semi-automatic weaponry, nor does it limit high-capacity magazines. Most states don’t."

But few people may know that the California Democrat used to own a firearm herself.

During an appearance at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club on Wednesday, Feinstein recounted the time she was targeted by a domestic terrorist group, the New World Liberation Front, while a member of the city's Board of Supervisors in the mid-1970s.

She described finding an unexploded bomb outside her San Francisco home, the lives of her family members saved only by a rare overnight freeze that disarmed the weapon's mechanism. Shaken from the scare, and another incident in which the windows of her beach house were shot out, Feinstein obtained a revolver that she kept in her purse.

""I thought if they were going to take me out, I wanted to take a few of them with me,"" she told the audience with a laugh.

But after witnessing the assassination of City Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone in 1978, Feinstein's views on guns shifted. She later gave up her concealed weapons permit.

""I was the one that found Supervisor Milk's body, and I was the one to put a finger in a bullet hole, trying to get a pulse,"" Feinstein, who succeeded Moscone as mayor following his death, told the Advocate in an interview earlier this year. ""Once you have been through one of these episodes, once you see what the crime scene is like -- it isn't like the movies -- it changes your view of weapons.""

""I know from first-hand experience what damage ... weapons can do to bodies,"" she explained at Wednesday's event. ""I have a deep belief that these weapons are antithetical to our values.""

Feinstein said that one of her proudest moments was handing a cross made of melted-down firearms, including her own revolver, obtained through a San Francisco gun buyback program to Pope John Paul II while on a trip to Rome in the early 1980s. Feinstein later authored the since-expired federal assault weapons ban signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994.

On Wednesday, she expressed frustration with Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) decision to cut a new measure banning assault weapons from a broader package of gun control legislation pushed by congressional Democrats in the wake of the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn. As the chief sponsor of a proposed ban on many semi-automatic weapons, she was unable to guarantee the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster. Reid has promised the provision will later be submitted as an amendment to a gun control package, to be voted on separately.

Feinstein blamed much of the reticence of lawmakers to come out in favor of gun control squarely on the outsize influence of the National Rife Association.

""[Some officials] are afraid the NRA will come into their state with $5 million -- in Arkansas or in North Dakota or in Montana -- and defeat them,"" she said. ""These rural states are much more difficult for people to stand tall on when it comes to guns.""

She added that she believes many lawmakers' decisions are motivated by fear.

""There's fear [among some senators] that if they vote for the [gun control] bill they wont be reelected,"" she charged. ""I say, if they're not willing to vote [for what they believe in], they shouldn't be in the Senate in the first place."""

Greg Abbot signed legislation permitting people with proper licenses to carry handguns in plain view. Though this so-called ""open carry"" law won't take effect until January, one Texas restaurant chain has already prohibited visible firearms from its properties, and experts say other local eateries will follow.

While only 5 states and Washington, D.C., now ban open carry in public places, businesses can issue their own no-gun policies. In fact, a HuffPost/YouGov poll in 2014 found that 55 percent of Americans prefer that shops and restaurants forbid guns.

In recent years, several major restaurants and retailers across the country have asked customers to refrain from openly carrying firearms -- some have even banned concealed guns altogether from their locations. Here are a few of the businesses that have taken a stand against open carry laws:

1. Whataburger

We’ve had many customers and employees tell us they’re uncomfortable being around someone with a visible firearm who is not a member of law enforcement, and as a business, we have to listen and value that feedback. ... We have a responsibility to make sure everyone who walks into our restaurants feels comfortable. For that reason, we don’t restrict licensed concealed carry but do ask customers not to open carry in our restaurants.

On July 2, the Texas-based hamburger chain asked customers to refrain from openly carrying firearms in its restaurants. Whataburger President and CEO Preston Atkinson affirmed his company's commitment to serving the gun rights community -- even mentioning that he has his own open carry license -- but went on to say that customers had expressed concerns over visible firearms in the restaurants. Concealed carry, he added, is fine for Wataburger patrons, but he asked people not to open carry in his stores:

2. Chipotle

The display of firearms in our restaurants has now created an environment that is potentially intimidating or uncomfortable for many of our customers.

Chipotle, which noted that it traditionally complies with local laws regarding open and concealed firearms, asked customers in 2014 to refrain from bringing firearms into its stores. The move came after a group of open carry activists appeared at a Dallas-area store , bearing military-style assault rifles. When the gun-control advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America started a petition for Chipotle to publicly denounce the open carry of firearms in its stores, the company complied:

3. Panera Bread

Within our company, we strive to create Panera Warmth. This warmth means bakery-cafes where customers and associates feel comfortable and welcome. To this end, we ask that guns not be brought into this environment unless carried by an authorized law enforcement officer. Panera respects the rights of gun owners, but asks our customers to help preserve the environment we are working to create for our guests and associates.

Following Chipotle's lead, Panera Bread also asked customers not to bring guns into its restaurants. In a statement, the company said:

4. Sonic

Sonic and our franchise owners work hard to provide an inviting environment for customers and employees alike. While we historically have relied upon local laws to guide how we address the display of guns at drive-ins, recent actions required we carefully reconsider this approach. We’ve considered the views and desires of our customers and employees that staff the drive-ins across the country. Accordingly, we’re asking that customers refrain from bringing guns onto our patios or into our indoor dining areas. With respect to the storage of guns in vehicles, we ask that our customers continue to honor local laws.

In 2014, Sonic waded into the debate, announcing that firearms were no longer allowed in its restaurants. Patrick Lenow, Sonic's vice president of public relations, told HuffPost

5. Chili's

We recognize that the open carry of firearms creates an uncomfortable atmosphere and is not permitted under many local liquor laws. So, we kindly ask that guests refrain from openly carrying firearms into our restaurants and we will continue to follow state and local laws on this issue.”

Chili's launched a coordinated statement with Sonic to take a stand against open carry policies. Ashley Johnson, a spokeswoman for Chili's' parent company, Brinker International, explained the company's decision in a 2014 email to HuffPost:

6. Starbucks

Recently ... we’ve seen the 'open carry' debate become increasingly uncivil and, in some cases, even threatening. Pro-gun activists have used our stores as a political stage for media events misleadingly called 'Starbucks Appreciation Days' that disingenuously portray Starbucks as a champion of 'open carry.' To be clear: we do not want these events in our stores. Some anti-gun activists have also played a role in ratcheting up the rhetoric and friction, including soliciting and confronting our customers and partners. For these reasons, today we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer bring firearms into our stores or outdoor seating areas—even in states where 'open carry' is permitted—unless they are authorized law enforcement personnel.

Starbucks was among the first chains to request that customers leave their firearms at home. In 2013, CEO Howard Schultz wrote an open letter to customers regarding the polarizing issue of open carry:

7. Target

This is a complicated issue, but it boils down to a simple belief: Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create.

In 2014, the third-largest retailer in the U.S. told customers not to carry guns in its stores. Target's interim CEO said in a statement:"

The Violence Policy Center, a research group that advocates for gun safety legislation, has found in past reports that traffic fatalities have been declining due to what the organization calls ""effective regulation,"" such as safety prevention initiatives, improved vehicle and highway design, and efforts from the government and advocacy groups. Firearm-related deaths, meanwhile, have only climbed.

The VPC analyzed the latest available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tallies all gun deaths, including suicides and accidents, and all fatalities in car crashes. As the number of people who die in car crashes goes down, the organization says, the number of people who die from guns is going up needlessly.

""Firearms are the only consumer product the federal government does not regulate for health and safety,"" VPC Legislative Director Kristen Rand said in a press release. ""Meanwhile, science-based regulations have dramatically reduced deaths from motor vehicles in recent decades. It’s well past time that we regulate firearms for health and safety just like all other consumer products.""

When VPC first compared firearm and traffic deaths in 2009, gun deaths exceeded fatal motor vehicle accidents in only 10 states. That number more than doubled in just six years.

(A full list of the 21 states can be found here.)

""The historic drop in motor vehicle deaths illustrates how health and safety regulation can reduce deaths and injuries that were at one time thought to be unavoidable,"" the report stated.

Nine out of 10 American households in 2014 had access to cars, while only one-third had access to guns, according to the group.

Automobile deaths far outpaced gun deaths for years, but that gap has been closing steadily over the past decade. In 2014, the Center for American Progress predicted that more young Americans would die from guns than motor vehicles in 2015. Other reports have made similar predictions across all age groups, suggesting that 2015 could be the first year gun deaths would top automobile deaths nationwide.

Last year's data isn't available yet, but the VPC shows that vehicle deaths still exceeded gun fatalities nationwide in 2014 -- 35,647 to 33,599. However, the organization says gun deaths will surpass motor vehicle deaths in more and more states if current trends continue.

Violence Policy Center

Gun violence kills an average of 36 people a day in the U.S. -- a number that doesn't include suicides, which account for more than 60 percent of all firearm deaths -- and many experts say the time to rethink our approach to the problem is overdue.

Doctors For America, an organization for medical professionals and students promoting health, now calls gun violence a public health crisis, and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has referred to gun violence as a health epidemic.

Congress has not budged on restrictions it passed two decades ago that have kept the CDC from researching gun violence as a public health issue. Earlier this month, a number of senators called for a hearing on the years-long blockage and pushed for the agency to research the issue.

Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) also presented legislation that would invest $10 million a year over the next decade into the CDC’s gun violence research."

This time, it was technically a Sig Sauer MCX, but it's in the same classification of gun. It's a category of weapon called ""military"" or ""assault rifles."" And while some people would like to blame that nomenclature on the ""ignorance"" of liberals, it's how they are actually marketed.

But there is also a technical distinction between an assault weapon and the ""semi-automatic rifles"" which the gun advocates want you to know about.

I will quote the Blaze here, so as to not be called ""gun grabber"" or be accused of any bias in my definition:

For the purpose of this article, we'll focus on AR-15s since it is what CBS calls ""the most popular rifle in America"" and one often designated an ""assault"" rifle. An AR-15 is the civilian equivalent to the military's M-16. So what's the difference? Kelly Alwood, a firearms trainer and consultant, told TheBlaze the only difference is that one is fully automatic and the other is semi-automatic. It's a small yet simultaneously big distinction. Firearms for use by the military are able to shoot continuously with one pull of the trigger, machine-gun style. Civilian firearms, on the other hand, only allow one shot per trigger pull.

So one is semi-automatic, and the other is fully automatic. Got it.

See, with a semi-automatic weapon, you have to pull the trigger each time you want to fire a round. You can't just hold the trigger down and have a steady stream of bullets come out like you can with a fully automatic.

Doesn't that sound a lot less deadly?

This, to the gun-rights advocate, is the quintessential distinction between them. But that's a distinction without a difference.

Then there's what's called a ""bump stock.""

You can buy one right here for just $135.95.

So what is a bump stock, you ask?

I'll let this guy tell you because he seems like he knows what he's talking about. After all, he's selling them, right?

At about the 20-second mark, what did he say?

""This stock will let you use your semi-automatic rifle to bump-fire--or mimic automatic firing--without breaking any laws.""

""Mimic automatic firing... without breaking any laws.""

Those are his words, not mine. And while he goes on to adhere to the semantic distinction, he's doing it emphasizing that in practicality, there is not one.

Alright, so what does that mean.

At 38 seconds:

""Bump firing is the use of a recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to simulate the effect of firing fully auto.""

So basically, it lets you do the same thing as a fully automatic weapon; it just lets you do it in a slightly different way. Each time the gun recoils, it bounces back, which causes it to automatically pull the trigger again, which causes another recoil and so on.

With both an automatic weapon and a bump stock, you're holding your finger still while the gun automatically fires, but on a technicality, the trigger is being pulled each time with a semi-automatic.

Using the word ""automatic"" as an adjective, you can describe a semi-automatic with a bump stock as an automatic weapon, even you can't call it one by its technical definition.

Perhaps a visual will help. Here's a guy bump-firing 100 rounds in a matter of seconds:

Visually, does that seem any different than an automatic gun to you? Would you feel terrified if you were pinned in with a crowd as someone fired into it with a gun like that? Or would you feel safe and secure in knowing that it's not really an assault rifle?

But there's a problem with the guy in the last video. He's using what's called a double drum, and they suck. They tend to jam up, and that's the last thing you want to happen if you're trying to murder 100 people in a matter of minutes. Just ask James Holmes.

So what's a would-be psychopath to do?

Well he could go buy himself the top-rated AR-15/M16 50RD 223/5.56X15 DRUM Magazine which sells for $215.00 and describes itself as:

Rugged, reliable 50-round drum magazine designed for .308/7.62x51mm & .223/5.56x45mm, full metal jacket ammunition provides plenty of capacity and reduces reloading time. Rated for full-auto fire, the low-profile drum is still compact enough for shooting from the prone position. Integral hand wheel makes it easy to crank back the spring for quick loading/unloading. X-15 magazine fits AR-15/M16 style rifles, and functions with .223/5.56x45mm & 300 Blackout ammunition. The X-15 is also shorter than a standard 30rd magazine.

It's designed to reload quickly, and it's rated for full auto fire--their words, not mine.

Becuase in case the first 50 rounds that went into the deer didn't do the job, you need to be able to dump another 50 into him fast, or Bambi might get away.

Look, let's stop with this nonsensical distinction without a difference between automatic and semiautomatic. With a bump stock, it's effectively the same thing. The ""gun rights"" people know it because they're the ones buying it; the gun manufacturers know it because they're the ones selling it.

And the killers know it because they're using them to shoot over 100 people in a matter of minutes.

Do you think those victims feel any less ""assaulted"" because they weren't ""technically"" shot by an assault weapon?

What they're hoping for is that the rest of us won't know, and we'll just buy into the ""one pull per bullet"" nonsensical rhetoric and let it go.

I don't think the founders had the Orlando shooting in mind when they wrote the Second Amendment.

But we should in considering our gun legislation and start recognizing the difference between a weapon to defend yourself and your family and one designed for assaulting others."
huffpo21,huffpo,"['Andy Campbell', 'Senior Reporter', 'Roque Planas', 'National Reporter']",2016-06-14 19:18:48-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-orlando_us_576059f3e4b0e4fe5143fd4d,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- It took us 38 minutes to walk out of a gun shop with a death machine.

Just two days after Omar Mateen used a semi-automatic rifle to murder 49 innocent people and injure dozens more, we were able to purchase an AR-15 -- a rifle similar to Mateen’s that has been used in several other mass shootings on American soil -- in less time than it takes to buy a cart full of groceries.

We would have been locked and loaded within five minutes, but the gun shop employee we spoke to said the queue on background checks was longer than usual because people were scrambling to buy AR-15s in the wake of the shooting. That’s both terrifying and unsurprising -- gun sales often skyrocket after mass shootings.

But the ease with which we purchased our AR-15, a Vietnam-era gun hailed by the military as being the perfect killing machine, was surreal. This, despite the fact that Florida Gov. Rick Scott had declared a state of emergency in Orange County, which includes Orlando.

On any given day, regardless of whether your town has endured a horrific tragedy, it’s not hard to purchase a weapon of mass murder like we did in most of America. A reporter for the Philadelphia Daily News was able to get one in just seven minutes in Pennsylvania on Monday.

Within seconds, we had it in our hands: A rifle that weighs less than a small watermelon and can, like the MCX Sig Sauer that Mateen used, easily fire several dozen rounds in less than 10 seconds. Our Diamondback DB15's killing power is striking, and at $644, it’s a relatively affordable murder weapon.

Huffington Post HuffPost's Andy Campbell gets the feel of the Diamondback DB15.

Gun shop employees were happy to discuss lethality. When another customer looking to purchase a small, .22-caliber handgun noted that it wouldn’t fare well against a “6-foot-3, 350 pound man,” the employee agreed.

“You’d have to hit him in the neck or the heart,” said the employee, whom we aren’t naming for this story.

He went on to joke with the customer that he should either pick a bigger gun or use the .22 to “shoot him in the stomach 15 times, that’d really piss him off.”

Behind him, the TV blared Fox News coverage of the massacre at Pulse nightclub, located nearby. On the wall, a framed photo of President Barack Obama with the caption, “Firearm Salesman Of The Year,” hung next to an array of other long rifles, some of them higher caliber than the AR-15, and some of them more affordable, too.

Semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 have been used in several of the most deadly shooting rampages in the United States in recent years, even before the attack in Orlando. The killers behind the mass shootings in San Bernardino, California, the elementary school at Newtown, Connecticut, and the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, all used AR-15s.

Huffington Post

Andy Campbell/Huffington Post

They’re not the cheapest rifles around -- another, higher-caliber carbine hung on the wall at our shop for half the price. But the National Rifle Association calls the AR-15 the most popular weapon in the U.S. ""It is customizable, adaptable, reliable and accurate,"" the organization says on its blog.

Shop workers told us we’d have to wait if we wanted to buy a smaller gun. There’s a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases in Florida, but that rule does not apply to rifles.

The employee made some small talk, declaring that all guns fall under one of three classifications: Leisure, defense and hunting. We aren’t sure which category Mateen’s gun falls under.

Under any of the gun shop employee’s definitions, there seems no reason for a weapon that can fire 10 or more bullets in quick succession. The AR-15 and its close cousins are not made to hunt deer. They’re made to kill people.

All it took to attain one was a driver’s license (the one we used was from out of state) and a few minutes to wait for the background check to clear. We signed state-issued proof of sale documents that asked whether we were felons or drug addicts, and where we lived.

Waiting for the background check was the hardest part -- and that only involved a few minutes of idle time. We requested data from the state Department of Law Enforcement on the current volume of background checks for similar guns, but did not get an immediate response. The department has been overwhelmed by public records requests since the shooting, a spokeswoman said.

Nothing that we or the store employees did was illegal or unusual. You can buy semi-automatic rifles at several stores in the Orlando area.



As of this writing, we have the same firepower that Mateen had when he opened fire at one of Orlando’s most famous gay clubs. We don’t have any ammunition, though -- the shop ran out of .223-caliber rounds.

We plan to return the gun. Eventually, it will join countless other rifles of its kind on the legal, Great American gun market.

UPDATE: 6/15 -- We attempted to return the AR-15 to the shop where we purchased it. Despite having a return policy, they refused. So we opted to turn the gun over to Orlando police, who said they would have it destroyed."

Some supporters of stricter gun laws argue it's far too easy to obtain firearms like the shooter's Sig Sauer MCX, an $1,800 semi-automatic rifle and a cousin of the highly popular AR-15. They say the same features that have made these weapons fit for the battlefield render them unfit for civilian use. In the wrong hands, their accuracy, reduced recoil, large magazine size and high rate of fire make these guns perfectly suited to inflict mass casualties in a short period of time. And it's hard to discount that concern: In seven of the last eight high-profile mass shootings -- as well as in earlier incidents in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado -- perpetrators were armed with assault-style rifles.

But as momentum builds for a new assault weapons ban, data shows just how small of an effect such legislation would have on the overall levels of gun violence in the U.S.

At least 84 people have been killed and 119 have been injured so far this year in 86 shooting incidents involving assault-style rifles, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation that tracks gun violence. Those numbers include the casualties at Pulse nightclub over the weekend.

There have been at least 267 incidents involving assault-style rifles in 2016, including reported weapons thefts, crimes in which the guns were brandished, arrests for illegal possession and other legal interventions in which they weren't fired.

Those deaths account for about 2 percent of the 6,153 gun deaths and less than 1 percent of the 12,560 gun injuries the Gun Violence Archive has counted so far this year. This tally consists largely of homicides and assaults, but also includes suicides that were part of a murder-suicide. It also counts accidental deaths, the majority of which involve handguns, not rifles.

If those numbers seem high, that's because they are. The U.S. has the highest gun death and ownership rates in the developed world. Americans are 10 times more likely to be killed with a gun than people in other developed nations; with an estimated 300 million to 400 million civilian firearms, the U.S. is by far the most heavily armed nation per capita. About 20 million to 30 million of those guns are assault-style rifles, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobbying group that wants you to refer to these weapons as ""modern sporting rifles.""

Gun Violence Archive notes that its count could be incomplete because it relies on news and police reports, which don't always include full details on the weapons used. Its data also only specifies incidents involving AR-15s and AK-47s, two of the most popular types of assault-style rifles but not the only ones available to civilians.

While these rifles hardly factor into the routine gun violence that rips through the nation every day, we found plenty of incidents that underscore the inherent danger they present.

In May, for example, a military veteran engaged in a standoff with police in Houston managed to fire off 212 shots from an AR-15 before a SWAT sniper killed him. He injured six people with the rifle, all after killing a man in an ambush with a handgun. The suspect's family claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Earlier this week in Detroit, armed gunmen used an AK-47 and another weapon to open fire on a vehicle, killing two and injuring one more in a hail of 30 bullets. An AK-47 was also used in a mass shooting in Pittsburgh earlier this year, when gunmen unloaded 49 rounds into a crowd of partygoers, killing five and wounding three.

Other shootings have flown further under the radar, likely because they didn't result in casualties. Earlier this week, a man reportedly armed with an AR-type rifle fired between 40 and 50 shots at police officers in Georgia. Nobody was injured.

With so many assault-style rifles already in circulation, gun advocates believe these rare instances of misuse shouldn't outweigh evidence suggesting that the overwhelming majority of owners are law-abiding citizens. But opponents argue that this level of firepower is unnecessary for civilians, especially considering how easy it is for them to obtain. They say these guns -- which have an average price tag of $1,000 but often come much cheaper -- give pretty much anyone the means to carry out a mass casualty event. Some lawmakers want to address that by renewing the sort of assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.

Which side is right? It's a worthwhile debate. And maybe we don't need to choose between nearly unlimited access and total prohibition. Maybe would-be buyers of assault-style rifles should have to first provide endorsements from people willing to vouch for their intentions. Maybe ""modern sporting"" riflemen and riflewomen should be required undergo periodic certification to make sure they're fit to be members of the ""well-regulated militia"" referenced in the Second Amendment. At the very least, maybe we shouldn't just let people buy these weapons on a whim, with no waiting period whatsoever."

I asked, ""Why are you wearing that?"" and he said, ""Because I can."" In Arizona, he could.

Then I told him he could either work for network news that day, or wear the gun, but not both.

But I've thought about that moment many times in trying to understand guns, and passionate gun people. The attraction to guns and the ""because I can"" mentality is foreign to people like me who don't care about guns, but it is the central conflict in the national debate. Millions of Americans own guns because they can, not because they particularly need them, or have plans to use them. Most guns are never fired. But since President Obama was reelected, and the Newtown massacre, gun shops have been selling out as buyers snap up guns for fear that in a few months they won't be able to. They're buying guns now, while they can, because they can.

The president's proposal for a renewed assault weapons ban and other tighter restrictions on gun buying will only further whip up the frenzy. It's what the gun guys have been afraid of since he was first elected.

Very popular is the AR-15 and its multiple clones, the semi-automatic rifle based originally on the military M-16. It's black, mechanical, and utilitarian. With its collapsing stock, sights, scopes and accessory rails, it looks a little like a fantasy weapon out of a video game. It is quite good at putting multiple rounds dead on target without punishing your shoulder. They are known as ""black guns."" Buyers don't want a beautiful $3,000 custom-made Beretta shotgun with hand-carved scrollwork and a polished walnut stock. They want military-ugly.

The AR-15 feeds the fantasy that in a national emergency The Boys from Vermont could pull out their guns and save the nation. Or the true patriots could resist an American government that's gone astray and become the oppressor. Never mind that what most oppresses people is not a soldier at the door, it's a tax bill.

Think what's happening to so many Americans. Pay is shrinking, if you have a job at all. Kids are on drugs, cellphones, videogames or all three. Taxes are rising but the street department doesn't have enough money to fill the pothole in front of your house. People are being nibbled to death by medical insurance paperwork, the price of cable television and the phone bill. They are losing their homes. They can't save for retirement and think Social Security won't be there. Millions of Americans feel like there is nothing they can do about any of it.

An AR-15 puts power in your hands and tells you that in some dire situations you could do something about it. In a post-apocalyptic breakdown, that unemployed man grabs his Bushmaster, defends the home and forages for food. He becomes the man again, strong and providing. The power to do it is right there in the bedroom closet.

Assault weapons are a problem, but they are also a symptom of frustration and powerlessness out there in America. When ""because I can"" is the primary reason for having a gun, you're in for a fight if you try to take it away. Simply owning a powerful gun convinces millions of Americans they are free."

But Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel was quick to shut her down.

Interrupting Loesch’s response to a question about assault weapons, Israel stressed that she was “not standing up” for survivors of gun violence.

“I understand that you’re standing up for the NRA … but you just told this group of people that you’re standing up for them,” he said. “You are not standing up for them until you say, ‘I want less weapons.’”

The sheriff’s words were met with cheers and a standing ovation.

Loesch was roundly lambasted at the town hall and on social media for various comments she made about gun control, many of which were misleading.

She repeatedly said that 19-year-old school shooter Nikolas Cruz, who legally purchased an AR-15-style assault rifle and other weapons, should not have been able to buy the firearm because he was an “insane monster” and “nuts.”

“People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” Loesch said, echoing a common misconception that mental health issues are a primary cause of gun violence. Her remark also ignores the fact that the NRA has also vocally advocated against gun bans on people with mental illness.

Netizens took to Twitter to challenge her remarks.

Loesch was also roundly criticized on social media for suggesting that “fully-automatic firearms” existed during the time of the founding fathers.

Responding to a comment made by a grieving mother that the Second Amendment was written during a time of “muskets” and not the weapons of today, Loesch responded that “at the time there were fully-automatic firearms that were available, the Belton gun and the Puckle gun.”

Twitter did not hold back their ridicule.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) in November, is calling out Blunt for not supporting tighter background checks on gun sales ― and in a way that only someone with Kander’s military background could do.

In an ad released Wednesday titled “Background Checks,” Kander, who is currently Missouri’s secretary of state, stands at a table assembling an AR-15 rifle while talking about his time in the U.S. Army. Oh, and he’s blindfolded.

“Senator Blunt has been attacking me on guns,” Kander says, jamming together gun parts he can’t see. “In Afghanistan, I volunteered to be an extra gun in a convoy of unarmored SUVs. And in the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights. I also believe in background checks so that terrorists can’t get their hands on one of these.”

Then, in dramatic fashion, he peels off the blindfold, looks into the camera and holds up the now-assembled rifle.

“I approve this message,” Kander says, “because I’d like to see Senator Blunt do this.”

Watch the ad here:

Blunt has voted at least twice against strengthening the background check system by closing the so-called gun show loophole and extending checks to all internet gun sales. About 90 percent of Americans support these reforms.

Kander’s ad comes after the National Rifle Association ran a spot accusing him of being weak on Second Amendment rights. The NRA endorsed Blunt in April.

The gun group was not impressed with Kander’s response:

You can visit the battlefield today, it's a national monument beautifully kept by the U.S. Park Service, located a half-hour's drive from the office of Maura Healey, who happens to be the current Massachusetts Attorney General, a.k.a., the AG.

Maura started her own little revolution last week by issuing a regulation that basically banned the purchase of AR-15 assault rifles throughout the Bay State. Current AR-15 owners (like me) can keep their guns, they can also transfer them to anyone else who can own firearms in Massachusetts, but in terms of the civilian arsenal being increased through the addition of more AR rifles, to all intents and purposes Massachusetts is now AR-rein.

Two things happened within 24 hours after the ban was announced: (1). Every, single AR in the inventory of every single gun shop in Massachusetts was sold; and, (2). The Gun-mob Nation noise machine started going full blast. The NRA got right into the act by calling the AR order ""obviously incorrect;"" the National Review said that her action meant that Healey could make the state gun law ""mean what she wanted it to mean;"" and a Republican state legislator in Massachusetts, who is known for his outspoken reverence for anything having to do with the 2nd Amendment, filed a bill to strip the AG from having any ability to alter rules and regulations over gun sales.

Now the fact that gun sales are legal commerce, the fact that someone who purchases a gun in a gun shop is, ipso facto, a consumer, the fact that the AG's office runs a very active operation known as the Department of Consumer Protection, the fact that this means the AG has the authority to promulgate and enforce rules on items that are sold to consumers in Massachusetts, none of these facts mean anything to State Senator Don Humason or his Gun-mob Nation supporters at all. Because the truth is that Gun-mob Nation doesn't want gun sales or gun ownership to be regulated because any type of gun regulations are, you know the rest of this sentence, a violation of 2nd-Amendment 'rights.' Now it just so happens that such rules are not a violation of anything within the Constitution or without. But just tell that to Senator Humason and his Gun-mob Nation friends.

In particular his Gun-mob Nation friends, who began peppering various media venues like Facebook with some of the worst, most offensive comments about Maura that have ever been seen. Calling her a 'fascist,' a ''bitch,' a 'c**t,' the language made a Donald Trump speech sound like something out of Mary Poppins. According to the Boston Globe newspaper, one big-mouth tweeted that he wanted to hire a homeless person to rape and disembowel the AG.

Now don't get me wrong. Gun issues provoke strong emotions on both sides of the fence. And while I thought that the AG was absolutely correct in calling attention to the fact that removing a few, cosmetic doo-dads from an AR-15 doesn't in any way diminish the lethality of the gun. Nevertheless, gun owners have every right to voice their anger, and even State Senator Humason has the right to do a little grandstanding by filing his stupid bill.

Let me break the news to my friends in Gun-mob Nation. There's a pretty good chance that a certain person will be president next year and I don't mean Donald Trump. And there's a good chance that she will send a gun bill to Congress, but being committed to the usual process, she'll invite input from both sides. So Gun-mob Nation will have a choice -- either get a seat at the table or stand around outside. And I guarantee you that if they use the language that Massachusetts Gun-mob Nation is using against Maura Healey, they'll be standing outside."

Police in Bardstown, Kentucky, say Adam Tingle’s wife told him she saw a clown outside, and he yelled at the person in question, The Kentucky Standard reported Saturday. When the person didn’t react, he allegedly fired one shot into the air to scare them off, and his wife called 911.

Apparently, the “clown” was actually a woman walking her dog. Tingle was charged with second-degree wanton endangerment.

Of course, this raises the question of why someone’s reaction to seeing a clown would be shooting at them. Cops say Tingle told them he was scared because of recent criminal activity involving clowns.

Tingle was referring to a bizarre series of so-called “creepy clown” incidents that have been reported throughout the United States over the past few weeks, beginning with a little boy in Greenville, South Carolina, who told his mother that two clowns were trying to lure him into the woods.

Since then, reports of clown incidents — from simply spotting creepy-looking clowns to reports of physical violence — have exploded across the United States. Many of the reports have turned up no physical evidence, and some have proven to be outright hoaxes — like when an Ohio teenager was late for work and allegedly made up a story about a clown attacking her as an excuse.

The media-fueled frenzy has led to increased fear of anyone who may appear to be dressed as a clown. In Tingle’s state of Kentucky, a man was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge after allegedly dressing in a clown costume and walking in a wooded area near some apartments in the middle of the night. And in New Haven, Connecticut, public schools have banned clown costumes for Halloween under the premise that the outfits would be “threatening” given the nation’s current coulrophobic vibe."

On Feb. 13, 2015, ATF proposed treating certain types of 5.56-by-45-millimeter ammunition as banned armor-piercing handgun ammunition and withdrawing an exemption previously granted to the M855 5.56-by-45-millimeter cartridge because it fell within the ""sporting purposes"" exemption to the ban. In the proposal, ATF explains:

Specifically, 5.56mm projectiles loaded into the SS109 and M855 cartridges are commonly used in both ""AR-type"" rifles and 'AR-type' handguns. The AR platform is the semi-automatic version of the M16 machinegun originally designed for and used by the military. The AR-based handguns and rifles utilize the same magazines and share identical receivers. These AR-type handguns were not commercially available when the armor piercing ammunition exemption was granted in 1986. To ensure consistency, upon final implementation of the sporting purpose framework outlined above, ATF must withdraw the exemptions for 5.56 mm 'green tip' ammunition, including both the SS109 and M855 cartridges.

The National Rifle Assocation (NRA) and the Newtown-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) moved quickly to label the ATF proposal a backdoor effort to ban AR-15 assault rifles (ignoring the fact that the specific ammunition in question is just one type of round compatible with the weapon). The NRA, labeling President Obama a ""dictator"" in an alert sent to its members, warned that the proposal was ""a move clearly intended by the Obama Administration to suppress the acquisition, ownership and use of AR-15s and other .223 caliber general purpose rifles....""





This is despite the fact that ATF is only doing what the NRA and other members of the gun lobby consistently argue should be done: enforcing the gun laws already on the books. Opponents also allege that no law-enforcement officer has been shot with one of the cartridges fired from a handgun. Testing the veracity of that assertion is challenging, but the whole point of the ban on ""armor-piercing"" ammunition is to prevent law enforcement and first responders who rely on body armor from ever having to face assailants wielding handguns loaded with armor-piercing rounds.

Yet left unstated is the fact that ATF's proposal, as detailed in a new report from my organization, the Violence Policy Center, is the direct result of the gun industry's own actions.

Facing a continuing decline in household gun ownership, the gun industry is constantly engaged in efforts to create new product lines to sell to a shrinking consumer base. In recent years the industry has aggressively marketed AR-15 assault pistols that use common rifle ammunition, such as the 5.56-by-45-millimeter round used in AR-type assault rifles.

As a 2011 article published in Handguns magazine, titled ""AR Pistols: The Hugely Popular Rifle Platform Makes a Pretty Cool Handgun as Well,"" noted, ""There's no doubt in the last few years that AR pistols have become extremely popular.""

These pistols have emerged as part of a new and growing trend. They combine the firepower of a rifle, able to accept high-capacity ammunition magazines designed for assault rifles, with the increased concealability of a handgun. As a result, these weapons raise the question as to what degree they pose a special threat to law enforcement and the bullet-resistant vests that they rely upon as well as public safety in general.

A recent survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) found that more than 92 percent of officers reported that they are required to wear body armor, either ""at all times when on duty"" (57 percent) or ""at most times when on duty"" (35 percent). These percentages reflect the understanding of law-enforcement agencies that body armor is an essential element in protecting the lives of police officers. As a result, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data, since 1987 only one law-enforcement officer has been killed by handgun ammunition that penetrated body armor. At the same time, PERF points out that ""large majorities of officers -- between 89 and 99 percent -- understand that body armor ... generally cannot be relied upon to stop rifle bullets....""

In response to the ATF proposal, NSSF urged ""all industry employees, target shooters and gun owners"" to ""contact your Member of Congress AND the ATF to oppose this unnecessary ban...."" On its site NSSF acknowledges the industry's marketing efforts around AR-15 assault pistols, noting ""the increasing prevalence of handgun versions of rifle platforms...,"" yet takes no responsibility for the armor-piercing threat this new generation of pistols represents. Instead, like the NRA, the gun group portrays it as a plot by ATF to ""now ban the widely used M855 and SS109 ammunition."" Yet if the industry had not begun marketing these pistols, creating a new and lethal threat to law enforcement, the federal law regarding armor-piercing ammunition used in handguns would not have been applicable.

The gun industry knew that this new breed of assault pistol could trigger restrictions on specific types of ammunition that are considered armor-piercing when used in a handgun, but it moved ahead anyway, continually driven by the need to create new, militarized market categories in the face of declining household gun ownership. Now the gun industry and the National Rifle Association are attempting to rewrite history. Contrary to their assertions, the ATF proposal is not a backdoor attempt to limit the ammunition available for AR-15 rifles but the necessary response to a new threat created by the industry itself."

Aerosols of biological agents are invisible, silent, odorless, tasteless, relatively easily dispersed, and they are 600 to 2000 times cheaper than other weapons of mass destruction. It has been estimated that the cost of a biological weapon is about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per square kilometer. Production is comparatively easy, using common technology available for the production of some antibiotics, vaccines, foods, and beverages, and delivery systems such as spray devices from an airplane, boat, or car are commonly available.

Another appeal of biological agents for terrorists is the natural lead time provided by the organism's incubation period (3 to 7 days for most potential organisms), which allows terrorists to escape before an investigation by law enforcement or intelligence agencies could even begin. Apart from the use of an endemic infectious agent likely causing initial confusion because of the inability to differentiate a biological warfare attack from a natural epidemic, for some agents, the potential exists for secondary or tertiary transmission by person-to-person transmission or natural vectors. For these reasons, biological weapons have become a new weapon of choice for virtual terrorists, who seek to acquire toxic pathogens or their ingredients online.

Scientists are concerned that a technique called Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) is now so cheap and widely available that amateurs will start experimenting at home or in school labs. The technique works like genetic scissors to cut away DNA code and replace it with new genes. It has been hailed as one the most significant scientific breakthroughs in recent years, but there are fears that in the wrong hands, the procedure could unleash dangerous strains of bacteria or other organisms. Kits to make E.coli resistant to antibiotics are already for sale on the Internet.

The comparatively low cost and ease of use of the CRISPR system (which is a naturally-occurring defence mechanism used by bacteria) has made it feasible for a greater range of users beyond those who would ordinarily make use of the techniques of molecular biology. Prior to CRISPR, editing DNA required sophisticated labs, years of experience, a PhD degree, and many thousands of dollars. Today the simple do-it-yourself CRISPR kits could enable virtual terrorists targeting the food supply chain to alter the avian influenza genome and engineer a large bird flu epidemic, similar to the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Asia that affected not only poultry, but also other mammals, including human beings.

In 2002 CNN ran an exposé on Al-Qaeda’s (AQ’s) experiments with crude toxins and poisons, testing the lethality of cyanide creams, ricin, mustard, sarin, and botulinum. AQ associates infiltrated Turkey, Britain, Spain, Italy, France, Sweden, Germany, and other countries to begin coordinating and planning ricin and cyanide attacks via a loose association of cells. US government knowledge of the extent of the network grew from a handful of terrorists in one country to dozens of extremists in 30 countries. The Islamic State may also have access to weapons containing sarin nerve gas that remained in Syria, as well as mustard agents and nerve agent rockets from Iraq, and chemical materials leftover from Libya programs. While It is unclear how effective these agents would be after years of storage, they could still be usable.

In 2015, the Blue-Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense issued a National Blueprint for Biodefense, calling for leadership and major reform to optimize efforts to combat the threat of bioterrorism. As if to emphasize the urgency of the threat, that same year, the annual report of the Federal Select Agent Program described 233 potential occupational exposures or releases of select biological agents and toxins outside of the primary barriers of biocontainment in the US. Since 2001, the US government allocated $6 billion to research the threats, which pales in comparison to the amount spent on cybersecurity, airport screening, or border security. Of 46 items the Blueprint recommended for action in the first year following release of the report, partial progress had been made toward only 17 of them, and only 2 had been completed as of 2016.

A verification system could diminish the risk of terrorist acquisition of biological agents, given the ever-present possibility of deliberate acts of sabotage or terrorism. A lone actor terrorist or a disgruntled employee with knowledge of the operations of chemical plants or laboratories -- having become acquainted with safety and security procedures -- could exploit existing vulnerabilities in order to smuggle deadly pathogens out of the facility. It has been estimated that up to 95 percent of incidents related to security-related breaches were the result of insiders who were already employed and/or had a security clearance.

The ability to acquire key ingredients via the Internet, and to ‘hire’ individuals with the scientific knowledge to make biological weapons, means that bioterrorism is, and will remain, an omnipresent risk. With the stakes as high as they are, common sense dictates that businesses and governments must combine their resources to find more effective ways to battle the scourge of Virtual Terrorism. Fully implementing the Blueprint would be an excellent place to start."
huffpo31,huffpo,"['Michael Mcauliff', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",2017-02-18 10:24:11-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-mild-mannered-woman-from-washington-is-the-democrats-deadliest-weapon_us_58a77653e4b037d17d27d494,"WASHINGTON ― A few weeks after the 2013 government shutdown, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) compared the Republicans in the House to the preschoolers she once taught. To deal with a bunch of fractious, obstreperous 4-year-olds, she said, you need a plan.

When Murray made her comparison, she was about to sit down with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in what turned out to be the only significant successful bipartisan budget negotiation Congress has managed since the shutdown.

Four years later, the House is still roiled by a crowd of sharp-elbowed and feuding Republican lawmakers who can’t agree even on how to do the one thing they all say they want ― repeal Obamacare. But now, there’s a new alpha boy atop their playground monkey bars.

President Donald Trump outdid them all, belittling, bullying and insulting his way to the Oval Office.

Murray is familiar with the personality type.

“There is a bully in every classroom,” Murray said this week. “And the best way to teach other children in your preschool class that it’s not OK is to make it not OK.”

That is precisely what Murray and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are trying to do. Since there are only 48 senators on their side of the ledger, they lack the votes to beat back Trump and a raft of nominees that Democrats see as historically awful. What they can do is show the country and their Republican colleagues that it’s not OK. Murray is turning out to be Schumer’s deadliest weapon in that fight.

Still, there have been some notable successes from the Democrats’ perspective, particularly with nominees going through the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on which Murray serves as the top Democrat.

Chief among them is the withdrawal of labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, a fast-food maven who was fond of employing scantily clad women to peddle his Carl’s Jr. burgers, and whose restaurants have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for labor and safety violations.

The salacious ads and history of labor law infractions probably were not the daggers that did in the labor nominee, however.

Ironically, his troubles started with a video created by a woman who Trump floated as a potential presidential running mate on the Reform Party ticket in 1988 ― Oprah Winfrey, via her TV show. A video from “The Oprah Winfrey Show” featured Puzder’s ex-wife dressed in disguise in 1990 to allege domestic abuse.

That she had gone on the program had been known since shortly after Puzder’s nomination, but Winfrey’s producers stonewalled media attempts to obtain the episode. The Oprah Winfrey Network’s lawyers did temporarily provide a videotape to the HELP Committee that they refused to leave behind. Murray and her staff worked with committee Chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) to make sure other senators saw it ― or at least had a chance to. Although Puzder’s former wife, Lisa Fierstein, later recanted the allegations, it had an impact. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that she had seen the tape and wanted to make it public.

Murray has made a habit of maintaining bipartisan relationships and working across the aisle, passing things like the rewrite of the No Child Left Behind Act. A firm member of the Pantsuit Nation, and a politician who launched her Senate career as a “mom in tennis shoes,” she politely and privately wielded a stiletto against Puzder, offering trenchant insights into Puzder’s attitudes in private conversations with Republicans in hallways and on the Senate floor. One thing Puzder said in an interview was particularly disturbing to the handful of Republicans who were prepared to oppose him.

“Someone asked him why he wanted to be secretary of labor, and he said that it would be the best job he could have ‘with his clothes on,’” Murray said. “I presented that to one Republican senator who said to me, quote, he doesn’t get it, does he?”

Whether it was specifically the video that felled Puzder can be debated. Revelations that he employed an undocumented immigrant as part of his household help for years hurt him with a number of conservative Republicans, as did Puzder’s advocacy for immigration reform.

For Murray, he was a walking highlight reel of all that is wrong with Trump.

“This is a president who got elected after a video came out of him on the bus with ‘Access Hollywood.’ When that happened, that was such a defining moment for many people,” Murray said. “But the people who voted for him said that’s OK, he won’t do this going forward. And yet to me his nominee shared many of those same sexist, horrible attitudes towards women.”

“That’s what I felt really took him down, and should have taken him down,” she said.

Murray and the Democrats also scored a near miss with an especially focused strategy to question then-Education Department nominee Betsy DeVos.

The billionaire charter school advocate botched numerous questions that Murray and other Democrats on the HELP committee had prepared in advance, and then followed up on. Especially glaring was DeVos’ lack of understanding of federal disability laws, exposed when Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) asked how her own disabled child would be able to get an education in one of the publicly funded charter schools that DeVos favors. DeVos did not understand that providers of public education are supposed to provide it to all of the public. Public schools spend significant resources to ensure disabled children get an education, and while charter schools are required to as well, they often fight the requirement.

Other questions showed that she was unfamiliar with basic debates in the education community. She was also caught in a possible lie when she said she had nothing to do with her family’s foundation giving $5 million to the anti-gay religious group Focus on the Family. Devos insisted it was all her mother’s doing. Murray came back with a tax filing from the foundation that listed DeVos as a vice president. DeVos claimed it was a clerical error, but records showed she was listed in the position for 17 years.

DeVos’ terrible showing cost her two Republican votes, and for the first time in history, a vice president had to break a 50 to 50 tie in the Senate to confirm her.

None of that work to bring down those nominees was an accident, Murray said.

“I felt from the beginning, this administration ― who I think expected to win ― was putting together a cabinet without doing the critical work that one should do at the cabinet in vetting people, in knowing what issues they might have,” Murray said. “So I directed my staff to do that with Betsy DeVos, with [Health and Human Services Secretary Tom] Price. And with Puzder.”

Aides familiar with the strategy said that Murray vowed to do that vetting herself when she came back to Capitol Hill after the election. She reassigned a slew of policy staff and turned them into temporary investigators, churning out detailed memos that were then shared with other senators and their staff. No other committee appears to have done as thorough a dive into the backgrounds of the nominees coming before them.

Heading into the DeVos hearing, Murray made sure to coordinate Democratic questions, to avoid overlap and make sure effective follow ups were delivered. When, for instance, Hassan asked DeVos about her role in the Prince Foundation, and DeVos demurred, Hassan was able to pull out tax documents with her name on them.

As each new embarrassment and unflattering detail emerged, Schumer would often highlight them in his morning Senate floor speeches that the Democratic leaders then spread further in news conferences.

Since Democrats themselves changed the rules around nominations in 2013 to allow confirmations to pass on simple majority votes, there’s little they can do beyond slowing down the process and trying to give the public enough time to see exactly who is ascending to power in the reign of Trump.

And Murray said she intends to keep showing why it’s not OK.

“As I have had constituents tell me since the day of the election, Senate Democrats are the only barrier we have to fight back against things that aren’t right coming from a Republican administration, Senate and House,” Murray said. “So, we’re it. We started working from day one to be the people who take that role on.”

Rape became politicized during the recent election. Extreme conservatives favored the modifiers ""legitimate"" or ""forcible"" while feminists countered with the slogan, ""Rape is rape."" When a woman is raped during an armed conflict, rape takes on a different character. Rape becomes a weapon of war -− a cheap weapon of war.

Under any circumstance, rape is a brutal, dehumanizing attack. Rapes of civilian women during war take on the most horrendous aspects of this crime. Women are often raped in front of their husbands and children by multiple men using their bodies and, at times, gun barrels or other objects to penetrate women.

Like any rape, these acts may to lead to pregnancy and transmission of STDs and infection. The psychological toll can be devastating. Victims may be stigmatized by their communities and even subject to honor killing by their families. Typically, justice is not available because civil police organizations are disbanded or ineffective during wartime.

It is important to recognize that conflict rapes are much more than opportunistic pillaging. In modern warfare, rape has become a strategic weapon used to humiliate, demoralize and dehumanize the enemy. The use of rape as a tactic may, in fact, be ordered by those in command of combatants. In ethnic conflicts, rape is seen as a tool of genetic ""cleansing."" Even when a conflict has ended with a truce or ceasefire, rape continues to be used as a weapon against the vanquished civilian population. Rape violates the Geneva Convention and is viewed as a ""crime against humanity"" by the International Criminal Court.

Recent history provides horrific examples of the use of rape as a weapon of war:

Approximately up to 500,000 women were raped during the Rwandan genocide

Approximately up to 64,000 women were raped in Sierra Leone

Over 40,000 women were raped in Bosnia-Herzegovina

Hundreds of women are raped every day in Syria, Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo

The reality of rape during conflict is brought home by a crowd-sourced map of Syria that reports the location and details of sexual assaults occurring during the current conflict. This resource is maintained by the Women under Siege Project of the Women's Media Center.

The days between Nov. 25 and Dec. 10 have been designated by the Center for Women's Global Leadership and the Nobel Women's Initiative as the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign. In 2012, this campaign focuses on gender violence in conflict, use of small arms in domestic violence and state actors perpetrating violence against women, such as commanders sexually assaulting military women with impunity.

You can speak out against these outrages in a number of ways: Organize an educational activity, write to your newspaper, blog or tweet. The campaign's website offers an action kit with information sheets, model letters and sample posts. Follow the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign on Facebook and follow them on Twitter and adopt the campaign's logo as your profile picture.

You don't have to be a woman to participate in this campaign. All you need is a voice and a conscience."
huffpo33,huffpo,"['David Lohr', 'Senior Crime Reporter']",2017-10-02 11:32:46-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/las-vegas-gunman-weapons_us_59d24bd3e4b05f005d35aa9c,"Stephen Paddock brought an arsenal of weapons into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas before opening fire on a crowd at a country music festival Sunday night, police said.

“We are still going through the search warrant … but [he had] in excess of 10 rifles,” Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters at a Monday morning press conference.

According to Lombardo, Paddock opened fire at about 10 p.m., as an estimated 22,000 people attended the final day of a three-day Harvest music festival, headlined by country music star Jason Aldean. Mandalay Bay Resort is adjacent to the concert venue.

The 50 deaths and at least 400 injuries make the attack the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, surpassing the 2016 massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The gunman in that case committed suicide after killing 49 people dead and wounding 58.

The Las Vegas gunman, Paddock, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound when police breached his 32nd floor hotel room, authorities said. Paddock, 64, lived in Mesquite and had been staying at the hotel since Sept. 28, according to police.

Witnesses reported hearing what they’ve described as automatic gunfire for more than five minutes. It’s not yet clear how many rounds of ammunition were fired, sending frantic concertgoers scrambling for cover.

The gunfire “just kept coming,” Robyn Webb told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “It was relentless.”

Authorities have not specifically identified the weapons used by the gunman.

Assault rifles, manufactured by several gunmakers, are available for purchase by anyone who can pass a background screening. They are typically sold as semi-automatic, meaning they fire one bullet for each squeeze of the trigger.

An automatic weapon, sometimes known as a machine gun, can fire continuously when the trigger is held. Federal gun laws allow possession of pre-1986 models, which can be purchased in most states by law-abiding citizens who pass a background screening, pay a tax of $200, and register the gun with the federal government.

It’s unclear if the weapons used in Sunday’s shooting were legally owned and purchased by the shooter.

The massacre will likely reignite the debate on gun control, particularly in Nevada, which has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the United States. Firearm owners there are not required to have a license, and do not have to register their weapons. The state does not prohibit the sale of assault rifles, and places no limits on the number of firearms an individual can possess and the capacity of ammunition magazines.

Authorities are likely to release details on the weapons used in the shooting once they finish examining items seized.

The gunman’s motive was unclear.

We have “no investigative information or background with this individual that is derogatory,” Lombardo said.

This is still an active investigation. The FBI asked anyone with videos or photos concerning the shooting to call 800-225-5324.

In a sign of mounting nuclear anxiety around the globe, the conference timeline is extremely condensed by U.N. standards. As early as July, Conference President Elayne Whyte Gómez of Costa Rica hopes to unveil a draft text — a “rapid pace,” she explained, “reflecting the urgency Member States attach to the need to realize progress in nuclear disarmament.”

The treaty text is expected to be a historic document, a landmark in collective security and international law. As a tool to force the nuclear genie back into the bottle, it is also expected to be roughly as effective as a plate of egg salad sandwiches.

Everyone in the U.N. conference hall knows this, of course. The treaty is not a naive attempt to compel the immediate disarmament of the nuclear powers. As with other U.N. disarmament efforts, this treaty is about strengthening norms, nudging progress, and keeping the flame lit on the idea that humanity can overcome its historical cycle of mass bloodshed. The limited expectations surrounding the treaty are reflected in the language of even its most ardent supporters. Daryl G. Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association, released a statement that sounded like a lukewarm book blurb. A new treaty, he said, “could be a useful and timely contribution... It is a worthy goal.”

As much as anything, the treaty talks can be seen as a collective diplomatic howl from the nuclear bleachers, over which hangs a Doomsday Clock reading two and a half minutes to midnight. Nuclear dread is cresting at levels not seen since the early 1980s, when senior figures in President Ronald Reagan’s Pentagon spoke in earnest about “winnable” nuclear war that everyone would be able to survive so long as there were “enough shovels to go around.” In an echo of that era, the new U.S. president does not understand the nuclear taboo and shares a patron with a biochemist and sheep rancher who seems to believe gamma rays are essentially a form of Vitamin D.

As in previous eras of high atomic anxiety, the U.S. and Russia are center stage. This time, however, the nuclear superpowers are grappling cliff-side without the guardrails that provided relative stability for much of the Cold War. Long gone is the cornerstone Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that banned defensive systems and brought a measure of reassurance to both sides. The U.S. is now building an open-ended, layered missile defense system near Russian borders. The system is part of a dangerous and destabilizing quest for nuclear “primacy” — that is, the ability to knock out other nuclear powers with a first strike. Whether U.S. officials describe the system as such is irrelevant. This steady drive toward primacy, combined with NATO expansion, has deepened suspicions and accelerated countermeasures by Moscow, including new missile development and violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

This mutually reinforcing dynamic is now accelerating. It is feeding insecurity leading to reductions in the size of “decision windows” that were already terrifyingly small. Leaders now have less confidence and less time to respond to data that suggests incoming missiles, which can involve anything from Norwegian weather balloons to sunlit clouds to misplaced software.

Some combination of machine error and human panic has always been the leading candidate for triggering planetary nuclear holocaust, and that threat has never been greater. Russia currently has no satellite early warning system, relying on short-notice ground radars to provide notice of a surprise attack. The U.S. knows this, yet continues to pursue policies that only stoke Russian fears of just such an attack. That the nuclear controls are now in the hands of a man whose mental health is routinely questioned in public, and whose hot temper is taken for granted, can only heighten the paranoia of adversaries. This, in turn, heightens the odds of a globe-melting overreaction.

Our own command and control system, meanwhile, is a fraying mess of analog tech run by inexperienced and possibly coked-up airmen. At the top of the chain is a White House full of Rapture-ready hawks and spite-driven nihilists, led by a man who has wondered aloud “why do we make” nuclear weapons if we’re not going to use them.

Against this backdrop, the U.N. conference is, if nothing else, a welcome statement of resolve. It’s also an overdue return to an institutional promise made long ago. In its very first sessions, U.N. member states discussed how best to bring nuclear weapons under international control. Those efforts failed; arsenals ballooned; the nuclear club expanded. In 1970, most nuclear powers recommitted to disarmament with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Fifty years after the NPT, the U.N. is once again taking up the threat it was tasked with solving in the year of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Just as newsreels of the first bombs haunted the U.N. debate of the 1940s, the 2017 conference opens under the digitally remastered shadow of thermonuclear test footage.

The films, released by the government this month, are the stuff of a million slow-motion Cold War nightmares: multi-megaton, city-swallowing suns that make Little Boy and Fat Man look like backyard bang snaps. Our nuclear complex is not studying these old test tapes to rekindle the transatlantic disarmament movement. The project is part of a $300 billion nuclear maintenance and modernization program.

“We need to be able to validate our codes and trust that the answers that are being calculated are correct,” explained Greg Spriggs, the physicist at California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory overseeing the film project. “The legacy that I’d like to leave behind is a set of benchmark data that can be used by future weapon physicists.”

The Livermore release closes with Spriggs stating his preference that “we would never have to use a nuclear weapon ever again.” But as Albert Einstein quipped the last time the U.N. debated a bomb ban, you cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.

Preparing for war isn’t all that Spriggs and his Livermore colleagues are doing. It’s more accurate to say they’re preparing for war in ways that make war more likely. The current issue of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists features a jaw-dropping report by several leading nuclear analysts that details how the U.S. Energy Department’s Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program has provided cover for enhancing warheads with “super-fuze” detonation technology in a way consistent with building a first-strike capability. The new warheads are most alarming from Moscow’s view, and thus most destabilizing, when fitted onto submarine-based missiles within range of Russia’s land-based silos.

“This increase in capability is astonishing,” write the authors of the Bulletin report. “It creates exactly what one would expect to see, if a nuclear-armed state were planning to have the capacity to fight and win a nuclear war by disarming enemies with a surprise first strike.”

Former Secretary of Defense William Perry, one of several recent high-profile defectors from the official nuclear consensus, has described current U.S. policy as “sleepwalking into [a] new nuclear arms race... We and the Russians and others don’t understand what we are doing.”

That may have been true in the 1940s. But in the seven decades since the first U.N. debate on nuclear weapons, we’ve had time to figure some things out. The evidence now suggests a darker conclusion: We know exactly what we’re doing. Or at least some of us do."

Washington, the South's military protector, applied substantial pressure to kill the program.

Today it looks like Park might have been right.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea continues its relentless quest for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Its Special Forces and unconventional tactics -- such as tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone -- threaten to disrupt allied operations. While most of its conventional weapons are decrepit, Pyongyang still could wreak havoc in Seoul with artillery and Scud missiles.

The South is attempting to find an effective response. It closed Kaesong industrial complex, which provided the North with nearly $100 million in hard currency annually. Seoul also is talking with the U.S about installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system. Nevertheless, neither of these steps is likely to much affect Pyongyang's behavior.

Although the DPRK is unlikely to attack since it would lose a full-scale war, the Republic of Korea remains uncomfortably dependent on America. And Washington's commitment to the much more populous and prosperous ROK likely will decline as America's finances worsen and challenges elsewhere multiply. Seoul could find itself ill-prepared to deter the North.

In response, talk of reviving the South's nuclear option is growing. Won Yoo-cheol, parliamentary floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, told the National Assembly: ""We cannot borrow an umbrella from a neighbor every time it rains. We need to have a raincoat and wear it ourselves.""

Won is not alone in this view. Chung Moon-jong -- member of the National Assembly, presidential candidate, and Asan Institute founder -- made a similar plea two years ago. He told an American audience ""If North Korea still refuses to surrender its nuclear weapons then we have to make the ultimate choice."" That is, ""if North Korea keeps insisting on staying nuclear then it must know that we will have no choice but to go nuclear."" He suggested that the South withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and ""match North Korea's nuclear progress step-by step while committing to stop if North Korea stops.""

The public seems inclined to follow such advice. Koreans' confidence in America's willingness to use nuclear weapons in defense of the ROK has declined, while support for a South Korean nuclear program is on the upswing, hitting 66 percent in 2013. Nearly a third of people ""strongly support"" such an option.

While President Park Geun-hye's government remains formally committed to the NPT, Seoul has conducted nuclear experiments and resisted oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Like Japan, the ROK could develop a weapon quickly if it chose to do so, perhaps in a matter of months.

Of course, the idea triggers a horrified reaction in Washington and among those committed to nonproliferation.

Unfortunately, in Northeast Asia today nonproliferation operates a little like gun control in the U.S.: only the bad guys end up armed. China, Russia, and North Korea all have nuclear weapons. America's allies, Japan and South Korea, do not, and expect Washington to defend them. To do so the U.S. would have to risk Los Angeles to protect Seoul and Tokyo -- and maybe Taipei and Canberra as well, depending on how far Washington extends the ""nuclear umbrella.""

While America's overwhelming nuclear arsenal should deter anyone else from using nukes, conflicts do not always evolve rationally. If Washington's nuclear commitment is triggered, even inadvertently, the U.S. would find itself wandering down a completely unexpected and dangerous path. South Korea and Japan are important international partners, but their protection is not worth creating an unnecessary existential threat to the American homeland. Indeed, the potential price of initiating nuclear war actually reduces the credibility of Washington's commitment and thus its deterrent value.

Better to create a balance of power in which the U.S. is not a target if nukes start falling. And that would be achieved by independent South Korean and Japanese nuclear deterrents. Such a prospect would antagonize, perhaps even convulse, China. But then, such an arsenal would deter the People's Republic of China as well as DPRK. Which also would serve American interests.

Moreover, the mere threat of spreading nuclear weapons might end up solving the problem. That is, when faced with the prospect of Japanese and South Korean nuclear weapons, China might come to see the wisdom of applying greater pressure on the North -- most importantly, cutting off energy and food shipments. The U.S.-ROK discussions over THAAD appeared to touch a nerve in Beijing, and Xi Jinping's government indicated its willingness support a UN resolution imposing more pain on the North for its latest nuclear launch. That declaration might end up being mostly for show, but maybe not. And the prospect of having two more nuclear neighbors would concentrate minds in Zhongnanhai.

Abandoning nonproliferation is not a decision to take lightly. No one wants a nuclear arms race. More nuclear powers mean more possibilities of misuse or mistake. Moreover, China might retaliate by accelerating its own nuclear development

But the PRC already is improving its nuclear forces to diminish Washington's edge. And allowing North Korea to enjoy a unilateral advantage creates a different, and even greater, set of dangers. The right trade-off isn't obvious.

Which is why policymakers should consider the possibility of a nuclear South Korea. The NPT does not necessarily triumph over other security concerns. Keeping America entangled in the Korean imbroglio as Pyongyang develops nuclear weapons is a bad option which could turn catastrophic. Blessing allied development of nuclear weapons might prove to be a better alternative.

Park Chung-hee was a brute, determined to stifle political freedom while focusing on economic development. But his desire for an ROK nuclear weapon looks prescient. Maybe it's time for the good guys in Northeast Asia to be armed as well.

Knocking on a stranger's door and asking them to register to vote is a strange experience. In a diverse city like Miami where one can find someone from any nationality or political background behind that door, it can be both a rewarding experience and a challenging one. It can be frustrating to hear a person say that they feel so disenfranchised by the system that they don't feel the urgency to vote. On the other hand, I'm exhilarated as an elections canvasser when we talk and they change their minds.

I've worked in several voter registration campaigns in the past, and what is unique about this 2016 presidential race is that the apathy often at play is not a factor when I talk with potential voters. Latinos are feeling the urgency to cast a ballot like never before and it is because they oppose Donald Trump's bid for the White House in record numbers.

I've met the folks who will prevent a Donald Trump presidency. They are a powerful coalition composed of people from all walks of life with vastly different cultures and nationalities. I've worked with my fellow immigrants day after day as a community organizer in a massive voter registration campaign working to turn out voters. Regardless of their native country, these Americans are eager to become registered voters so they can make a difference in their communities.

These prospective voters, about 2.8 million Latinos, have been emboldened by one of the most bizarre elections ever seen in American history. Republican nominee Donald Trump has risen to the top of the party on a scorched earth campaign in which he has called for a ban on Muslims coming into the country and the forced deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country. Faced with this intense anti-immigrant rhetoric, people who have never considered voting before are now eager to do so.

I worked with the community outreach group New Florida Majority from February to April in a campaign to register 5,000 new voters in nine weeks. We went to Hispanic and Haitian neighborhoods in Miami with traditionally low voter turnout rates in an effort to connect with people and inform them about the issues affecting their communities. We knocked on doors, stood outside shopping centers, joined in popular events such as the iconic Calle 8 Festival in Little Havana and visited Hispanic and Creole restaurants.

It was a very strange experience helping to empower people so they can have a voice through the ballot when I'm excluded from that privilege.

I came to this country on a tourist visa with my parents and overstayed it, effectively rendering me without legal status for 11 years. I felt pride in helping people exercise their right to vote, but at times I also felt a mix of jealousy and frustration.

I know the power of voting and am eager to cast my first vote, but I never imagined that at age 25, I would still not have done so. It was difficult and frustrating to live here as an undocumented resident, but it also taught me the necessity for strong civic engagement and our individual responsibility to stand up for our communities. Growing up, I always lived with fear that a wrong choice would land me in police custody and possible deportation. I was paranoid that sharing my undocumented status with the wrong person could lead to being reported to ICE, and possible deported and ripped away from my family and friends. I watched my parents drive to work every day with the fear that a simple traffic stop could lead to their arrest for driving without a license.

As I registered new voters, I found that I was not alone. I was inspired talking to community members who were eager to demand the dignity and respect that has been denied to them despite their years of hard work. Natalia Jaramillo comes to mind, a Latina from Colombia who had previously been unable to become a citizen because it was so expensive and who now is eligible to vote for the first time. She told me that she was not wasting the opportunity to vote on behalf of those in her community who could not and who, like her, were disgusted by the politicians that disrespected the contributions of Latinos in this country.

I remember speaking to Johanna Shemesh from Brazil, who told me that as a woman she had a responsibility to stand up for her community against the racism and hatred of Donald Trump, whose anti-women policies would hurt her reproductive rights.

Trump's rhetoric last June was another hateful notch in what has been a long history of discrimination and xenophobia against immigrants in this country. Although I acquired residency through marriage in 2011, my parents are still living in the U.S. undocumented and seeing this racist xenophobe in my television screen refer to Mexican immigrants in this country as killers and rapists filled me with indignation. The hateful rhetoric currently at the forefront of the Republican party drove me to do as much as I possibly could to stop this man from ever becoming president.

Florida has voted for Democratic President Obama in the past two elections and it appears that the Republican party has not learned that disregarding the Hispanic vote is a losing strategy that will guarantee defeat in this crucial swing state where 23 percent of the population is Hispanic. We hit our target goal of 5,000 new registered voters at the end of the nine weeks, and we will continue to hit the streets to turn out voters until the Florida registration deadline 29 days before the November 8th election.

As an immigrant youth (and I know that there are thousands who feel as I do), I will never forget the way my family was treated during these difficult years. A couple of weeks ago, I applied for my citizenship after spending five years as a permanent resident, making it highly likely that I will get to cast my first vote ever in this election. Myself and others who experienced the hatred and xenophobia directed at our hard working community will always remember who our friends were and who weren't. We'll vote accordingly.

Has a weapon ever been invented, no matter how terrible, and not used? The crossbow, the dreadnought, poison gas, the tank, the landmine, chemical weapons, napalm, the B-29, the drone: all had their day and for some that day remains now. Even the most terrible weapon of all, the atomic bomb, that city-buster, that potential civilization-destroyer, was used as soon as it was available. Depending on your historical interpretation, it was either responsible for ending World War II in the Pacific or rushed into action before that war could end. In either case, it launched the atomic age.

During the Cold War, the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, relied on a strategy that used to be termed, without irony, ""mutual assured destruction"" or MAD. Its intent was simple enough: to hold off a planetary holocaust by threatening to commit one. With their massive nuclear arsenals, those two imperial states held each other and everyone else on the planet hostage. Each safely secured more than enough nukes to be able to absorb a ""first strike"" that would devastate its territory, leaving possibly tens of millions of its citizens dead or wounded, and still return the (dis)favor.

After the Soviet Union disappeared in 1991, nuclear weapons did, too -- without going away. The American and Russian arsenals, and the nuclear geography that underlay them, remained in place, just largely unremarked upon. In the meantime, the weaponry itself spread. In those years, the last superpower, which seldom discussed its own arsenal, selectively focused its energies on containing the spread of nuclear weaponry in three nations: the first was Pakistan some part of whose ever-growing nuclear arsenal it feared might fall into the hands of extreme Islamic fundamentalists in a land Washington was in the process of destabilizing via a war in neighboring Afghanistan and a CIA drone campaign in its tribal borderlands; the second was North Korea, a country encouraged in its quest for nuclear weapons by watching the U.S. take down two autocrats, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qaddafi, who gave up their nuclear programs prior to U.S. interventions; and the third was Iran, which had a nuclear program (started by the U.S. in an era when the country was considered our bulwark in the Persian Gulf), but as far as anyone knows no plans to weaponize it.

In the meantime, Washington (and so the American media) simply ignored the very existence of Israel's massive nuclear arsenal and actually aided the further development of the Indian nuclear program. In these years, it also threatened or, in the case of Iraq, a country that no longer had a nuclear program, actually launched what Jonathan Schell has called ""disarmament wars.""

That the spread of nuclear weapons, whatever the country, is a danger to us all is obvious. Who exactly will use such weapons next and where remains unknown. But there is no reason to believe that, sooner or later, nuclear weapons -- which have now spread to nine countries -- and are likely to spread further, will not be used again.

Recently, a Texas-based nonprofit got a lot of publicity by announcing that it had fired the first handgun ever made almost totally by a 3-D printer. This act, modest enough in itself, nonetheless highlights a trend of our time. Weaponry that once only a large state, mobilizing scientists, industrial power, and resources could produce can now be made by ever-smaller states -- say North Korea with limited resources and a malnourished populace. Similarly, weapons once made by large companies can now be assembled by individuals. Or put another way, ever more powerful weaponry is increasingly available to ever less powerful states and even non-state actors. It was, for instance, the Aum Shinrikyo cult that, in 1995, produced sarin nerve gas -- ""the poor man's atomic bomb"" -- in its own laboratory and used it in the Tokyo subways, killing 13, just as in the U.S. anthrax began arriving in the mail a week after 9/11, killing five people.

We don't know where or why a nuclear weapon will be used. We don't know whether it will be a North Korean, South Korean, Indian, Pakistani, Lebanese, Iranian, Israeli, or even American city that will be hit. All we should assume is that, as long as such weapons are developed, amassed, and stored for use, one day they will be used with consequences that, as Nick Turse, author of the bestselling Kill Anything That Moves, reports in ""Nuclear Terror in the Middle East,"" are -- even for those who have studied the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- beyond imagining."

Pyongyang has ramped up work on its nuclear program and claims it is capable of launching a nuclear-armed missile that would reach the continental U.S.

The reclusive nation carried out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test early Sunday morning, which North Korean state television swiftly described as a “perfect success.”

The regime claims it detonated a hydrogen bomb, and although analysts have expressed skepticism about that, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said Tokyo could not yet dismiss the possibility that it was indeed an H-bomb ― a device much more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.

Pyongyang successfully conducted its first two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July ― a feat U.S. President Donald Trump had called an impossibility shortly before his inauguration in January. The launches triggered international alarm and condemnation, and sparked a battle of escalating threats between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime.

Former President Barack Obama had warned Trump that a nuclear North Korea would likely be the most pressing issue faced by the new administration.

Despite assurances from Trump that a North Korea that can hit the U.S. with nuclear weapons “won’t happen,” some experts believe such a capability may be within Kim’s grasp. Here are the components of North Korea’s developing nuclear program, and the West’s efforts to stop it.

Nuclear Weapons

North Korea has been working to acquire a functional, deliverable nuclear weapon for decades. Those aspirations began during the rule of former Supreme Leader Kim Il Sung at the close of World War II and began to take shape under the reign of his son, Kim Jong Il, who first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006.

As New York Times reporter David Sanger explained in an interview with NPR’s Dave Davies in late March:

“Kim Il Sung remembers that General [Douglas] MacArthur, during the Korean War, wanted to use nuclear weapons against North Korea and China. He was stopped from doing this. But it made a very big impression on Mr. Kim, and he knew that North Korea, to survive and deter attack, needed to have this capability itself. And he’s the one, the grandfather of the current North Korean leader, who started down this path.”

The North was able to purchase much of its initial nuclear technology from one of the founders of Pakistan’s nuclear program and bought centrifuges to enrich uranium from Libya.

The North is in possession of up to 20 nuclear warheads, according to an annual report released this week by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

KCNA KCNA/Reuters An undated photo released by the official news agency shows North Korea's annual central report meeting.

Nuclear Tests

North Korea has so far conducted six nuclear weapons tests, all at an underground test site in the country’s northeast called Punggye-ri. Those blasts, which began in 2006, have only gotten stronger over the past decade as the North hones its weapons program.

As The New York Times noted, the first such test, conducted by current leader’s father, Kim Jong Il, had a yield of less than 1 kiloton, or the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT. The second, conducted three years later, clocked in at 2.35 kilotons. The North’s most recent test was the strongest ever. It caused a shallow magnitude 6.3 earthquake, and was estimated to be at least “five to six times” stronger than the previous test last September.

The explosive power of Sunday’s purported H-bomb is adjustable from tens of kilotons to hundreds of kilotons, according to a North Korean report cited by The Times.

Comparatively, “the Little Boy” bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima held 15 kilotons of energy. The College of Arts and Letters at the Stevens Institute of Technology released a series of maps in 2015 that show just how damaging such weapons would be to cities around the world.

South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said Wednesday that in light of the North’s recent ICBM launch, he believes there is “a high chance” Pyongyang will soon conduct a sixth nuclear test.

The Missiles

Alongside nuclear development, North Korea has undertaken an active and at times successful campaign to launch ballistic missiles, with an ultimate goal of crafting an ICBM capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to U.S. soil. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 3,400 miles.

Shortly after the first ICBM launch, North Korean state TV claimed the long-range missile was capable of reaching “anywhere in the world” and could carry “a large, heavy nuclear warhead.” This has not been verified.

The North has displayed two types of ICBMs at military parades since 2012, the BBC pointed out, but both remain untested.

The Musudan, another North Korean ballistic missile, is thought to be capable of reaching the U.S. territory of Guam. It was tested eight times in 2016, only partly succeeding once.

In May of 2016, U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials announced the North has the ability to attach a small nuclear warhead on top of missiles capable of reaching much of South Korea and Japan. Experts have varied greatly in the past couple of months about North Korea’s ability to strike the U.S.

Missile Tests

Kim has personally overseen the test launches of several ballistic missiles. While the tests are meant to fine-tune the North Korean arsenal, they also serve a political purpose.

Several of the recent tests have been timed to coincide with important strategic moments for the region.

The one in February coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Another one, in April, was timed ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to the U.S. Yet another launch in March was conducted in retaliation for joint U.S.-South Korean military drills. The July 3rd missile test ― Pyongyang’s 11th this year ― was launched on the eve of U.S. Independence Day, and days before the G-20 summit in Europe. Kim dubbed it “a gift for the American bastards.” Three weeks later, the July 28 test came a day after the North Korean holiday “Day of Victory,” which marks the 1953 ceasefire in the Korean War.

The North also launched three short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast on Aug. 25, intensifying the harsh rhetoric between the regime and Trump. And on Aug. 28, it fired an intermediate range missile over northern Japan.

Pyongyang is flexing muscles that experts say are getting bigger.

What North Korea Wants

North Korea’s nuclear aspirations, experts say, hinge on Kim’s desire to retain control of the isolated nation.

“Above all else, North Korea’s nuclear program is about security,” John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, told the BBC last September. “It is, by their estimation, the only reliable guarantee of the country’s basic sovereignty, of the Communist regime’s control, and of the rule of Kim Jong-un.”

Sanger, the Times reporter, echoed that view on “Fresh Air”:

“If you consider your objectives to be to assure regime survival, to make sure that North Korea remains the Kim family’s personal fiefdom, then they’ve pursued a pretty rational strategy, one in which loyalty is above all, in which even members of the family who challenge the leadership end up getting executed. And under that structure, the North Koreans, for an unstable, irrational regime have played a pretty good game since 1953.”

International Response

Kim has continued weapons tests despite increasingly strict condemnations from the international community. In January, the United Nations imposed its “toughest ever” sanctions on the country in an attempt to stifle the program. It issued its latest round of sanctions restricting foreign trade and exports of certain goods on Aug. 5, after the second ICBM test.

But such actions have failed in the past.

Last September, former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the North’s actions in recent years had led to an unprecedented state of turmoil in the region.

“Never in the past have I ever seen such kind of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula,” Ban said.

In light of Sunday’s test, South Korea has called for the “strongest possible” response from the international community, including new sanctions to “completely isolate” Pyongyang.

Trump tweeted Sunday morning that the hermit kingdom’s “words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.” He also continued his criticism of China’s role in the defusing the situation, tweeting Beijing is “trying to help but with little success.”

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters U.S. President Barack Obama held a joint news conference with South Korea's then-President Park Geun-hye at the White House in Washington Oct. 16, 2015.

Obama’s Response

Under Obama, the United States tread carefully and refrained from any direct action against Kim’s regime. As a member of the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. helped increase sanctions against North Korea following its September 2016 nuclear test.

“The United States is realistic about what this resolution will achieve. No resolution in New York will likely, tomorrow, persuade Pyongyang to cease its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons,” former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said at the time. She added that such sanctions impose “unprecedented costs on the [North Korean] regime for defying this council’s demands.”

The U.S. also reportedly was engaged in more covert operations. Sanger and his colleague William Broad reported last March that the Obama administration had been working to sabotage North Korea’s missile program for years with cyber operations. Such initiatives, the pair wrote, may have derailed components inside the missiles either before or shortly after they were launched.

While evidence is circumstantial, Sanger said that in the course of his reporting the Times noticed some missiles, including the intermediate-range Musudan, had a failure rate of 88 percent.

“This for a country that hired a lot of former Soviet scientists after the Berlin Wall fell and after the Soviet Union dissolved, brought them to Pyongyang, bought a lot of their technology and in their early days had a very high success rates with the North Korean missile program because they were basing it on experiences that the Soviets and later Russia had had. And suddenly, their failure rate soared.”

Trump’s Conundrum

Despite condemnation from the U.N. and the West, Kim has shown no willingness to halt his country’s weapons program. Trump promised on the campaign trail to rein in the hermit nation, but faces few good options to do so.

Observers looked at the first meeting between Trump and Xi in early April for possible signs of the administration’s North Korea strategy.

China could play a significant role in motivating Pyongyang to reverse course. The country has continued to trade with North Korea, and Chinese companies provide up to 40 percent of the foreign currency the North uses to trade internationally.

The Trump administration had ramped up its rhetoric ahead of the meeting, with Trump even threatening direct intervention.

“If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will,” Trump told the Financial Times in April. “That is all that I am telling you.”

In a series of tweets in July, the president expressed his frustration at China’s apparently insufficient efforts to exert its influence over the North.

“Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!” he wrote, later adding: “Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us ― but we had to give it a try!”

In a statement soon after, chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana White announced that the U.S. remained “prepared to defend ourselves and our allies and to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against the growing threat from North Korea.”

“The United States seeks only the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Our commitment to the defense of our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad,” she added.

Her statement marked a significant escalation of the U.S. response. Shortly after the North’s missile test in March, Tillerson had a simple reaction: “The policy of strategic patience is over.”

Uhhhh what does this mean pic.twitter.com/PzRpi6xjVt — Jessica Schulberg (@jessicaschulb) April 4, 2017

Pyongyang’s ICBM launches and claims that it has the ability to strike the continental U.S. sparked a heated war of words between Kim and Trump, with the threatening in August “fire and fury” for North Korea.

Direct action presents major difficulties as the South Korean capital, Seoul, lies just 35 miles from the North’s border and within easy striking distance of the country’s non-nuclear artillery. Were Trump to act, Kim could set his sights on a city of 12 million people that has long been a friend to the West.

It’s also unclear whether strikes could effectively target the North’s program, as infrastructure is spread across the country and in some cases lies underground.

For now, only time will tell how the Trump administration will handle a country set on pursuing a nuclear arsenal at any cost."

Roff']",2015-01-16 11:24:56-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-roff/autonomous-or-semi-autono_b_6487268.html,"Over the new year, I was fortunate enough to be invited to speak at an event on the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hosted by the Future of Life Institute. The purpose of the event was to think through the various aspects of the future of AI, from its economic impacts, to its technological abilities, to its legal implications. I was asked to present on autonomous weapons systems and what those systems portend for the future. The thinking was that an autonomous weapon is, after all, one run on some AI software platform, and if autonomous weapons systems continue to proceed on their current trajectory, we will see more complex software architectures and stronger AIs. Thus the capabilities created in AI will directly affect the capabilities of autonomous weapons and vice versa. While I was there to inform this impressive gathering about autonomous warfare, these bright minds left me with more questions about the future of AI and weapons.

First, autonomous weapons are those that are capable of targeting and firing without intervention by a human operator. Presently there are no autonomous weapons systems fielded. However, there are a fair amount of semi-autonomous weapons systems currently deployed, and this workshop on AI got me to thinking more about the line between ""full"" and ""semi."" The reality, at least the way that I see it, is that we have been using the terms ""fully autonomous"" and ""semi-autonomous"" to describe the extent to which the different operational functions on a weapons system are all operating ""autonomously"" or if only some of them are. Allow me to explain.

We have roughly four functions on a weapons system: trigger, targeting, navigation, and mobility. We might think of these functions like a menu that we can order from. Semi-autonomous weapons have at least one, if not three, of these functions. For instance, we might say that the Samsung SGR-1 has an ""autonomous"" targeting function (through heat and motion detectors), but is incapable of navigation, mobility or triggering, as it is a sentry-bot mounted on a defensive perimeter. Likewise, we would say that precision guided munitions are also semi-autonomous, for they have autonomous mobility, triggering, and in some cases navigation, while the targeting is done through a preselected set of coordinates or through ""painting"" a target through laser guidance.



Where we seem to get into deeper waters, though, are in the cases of ""fire and forget"" weapons, like the Israeli Harpy, the Raytheon Maverick heavy tank missile, or the Israeli Elbit Opher. While these systems are capable of autonomous navigation, mobility, trigger and to some extent targeting, they are still considered ""semi-autonomous"" because the target (i.e. a hostile radar emitter or the infra-red image of a particular tank) was at some point pre-selected by a human. The software that guides these systems is relatively ""stupid"" from an AI perspective, as it is merely using sensor input and doing a representation and search on the targets it identifies. Indeed, even Lockheed Martin's L-RASM (long-range anti-ship missile), appears to be in this ballpark, though it is more sophisticated because it can select its own target amongst a group of potentially valid targets (ships). The question has been raised whether this particular weapon slides from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous, for it is unclear how (or by whom) the decision is made.

The rub in the debate over autonomous weapons systems, and from what I gather, some of the fear in the AI community, is the targeting software. How sophisticated that software needs to be to target accurately, and, what is more, to target objects that are not immediately apparent as military in nature. Hostile radar emitters present little moral qualms, and when the image recognition software used to select a target is relying on infra-red images of tank tracks or ship's hulls, then the presumption is that these are ""OK"" targets from the beginning. I have two worries here. First, is that from the ""stupid"" autonomous weapons side of things, military objects are not always permissible targets. Only by an object's purpose, location, use, and effective contribution can one begin to consider it a permissible target. If the target passes this hurdle, one must still determine whether attacking it provides a direct military advantage. Nothing in the current systems seems to take this requirement into account, and as I have argued elsewhere, future autonomous weapons systems would need to do so.

Second, from the perspective of the near term ""not-so-stupid"" weapons, at what point would targeting human combatants come into the picture? We have AI presently capable of facial recognition with almost near accuracy (just upload an image to Facebook to find out). But more than this, current leading AI companies are showing that artificial intelligence is capable of learning at an impressively rapid rate. If this is so, then it is not far off to think that militaries will want some variant of this capacity on its weapons.

What then might the next generation of ""semi"" autonomous weapons look like, and how might those weapons change the focus of the debate? If I were a betting person, I'd say they will be capable of learning while deployed, use a combination of facial recognition and image recognition software, as well as infra-red and various radar sensors, and they will have autonomous navigation and mobility. They will not be confined to the air domain, but will populate maritime environments and potentially ground environments as well. The question then becomes one not solely of the targeting software, as it would be dynamic and intelligent, but on the triggering algorithm. When could the autonomous weapon fire? If targeting and firing were time dependent, without the ability to ""check-in"" with a human, or let's say, that there were just too many of these systems deployed that ""checking-in"" were operationally infeasible due to band-width, security, and sheer man-power overload, how accurate would the systems have to be to be permitted to fire? 80%? 50%? 99%? How would one verify that the actions taken by the system were in fact in accordance with its ""programming,"" assuming of course that the learning system doesn't learn that its programming is hamstringing it to carry out its mission objectives better?

These pressing questions notwithstanding, would we still consider a system such as this ""semi-autonomous?"" In other words, the systems we have now are permitted to engage targets -- that is target and trigger -- autonomously based on some preselected criteria. Would these systems that utilize a ""training data set"" to learn from likewise be considered ""semi-autonomous"" because a human preselected the training data? Common sense would say ""no,"" but so far militaries may say ""yes."" The US Department of Defense, for example, states that a ""semi-autonomous"" weapon system is one that ""once activated, is intended only to engage individual targets or specific target groups that have been selected by a human operator"" (DoD, 2012). Yet, at what point would we say that ""targets"" are not selected by a human operator? Who is the operator? The software programmer with the training data set can be an ""operator,"" and the lowly Airman likewise can be an ""operator"" if she is the one ordered to push a button, so too can the Commander who orders her to push it (though, the current DoD Directive makes a distinction between ""commander"" and ""operator"" which problematizes the notion of command responsibility even further). The only policy we have on autonomy does not define, much to my dismay, ""operator."" This leaves us in the uncomfortable position that distinction between autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons is one without difference, and taken to the extreme would mean that militaries would now only need to claim their weapons system is ""semi-autonomous,"" much to the chagrin of common sense.

huffpo40,huffpo,"['Nina Golgowski', 'General Assignment Reporter']",2017-09-06 11:18:44-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiger-shot-killed-georgia_us_59afe974e4b0dfaafcf42e3b,"Authorities are investigating the origins of a tiger seen running around a Georgia neighborhood before attacking a dog, leading to its shooting death by police.

The big cat was spotted around 6 a.m. Wednesday near I-75 outside of Stockbridge, roughly 20 miles southeast of Atlanta, before it was fatally shot, the Henry County Police Department said.

“The tiger began to run toward the Meadow Brook community off of Jodeco Road, to the back of a residence and began to attack a dog,” police said in a release that noted animal professionals were contacted.

Fearing for the public’s safety, officers fatally shot the animal, with police telling CBS 46 that they didn’t have time to retrieve a tranquilizer gun.

Brittney Speck, who moved to the area two months ago, said it was her little dachshund named Journey that was attacked while in her backyard.

“The tiger jumped on top of my dog and the officers just started firing rounds and took it down and then gave my dog back,” Speck told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

AJC This small dog named Journey was seen wagging her tail after reportedly surviving an attack by a tiger in Georgia.

“She’s great, she’s OK,” she said of her brave dog, seen wagging her tail, though a bit timid of approaching reporters and their cameras.

“She’s a little shaken up. I’m sure she’s had better mornings,” Speck said. She expressed relief that it wasn’t her three children ― ages 3, 4, and 7 ― who were outside at the time.

“It was massive, it was huge,” she emphasized.

Where the tiger came from remained unknown as of Wednesday morning.

Noah’s Ark Animal Sanctuary in Locust Grove, Georgia, about 17 miles south of where the cat was killed, said that all of their tigers are accounted for. However, when police contacted them, they headed to the scene hoping to assist.

“We responded immediately and were on the way to the scene with hopes of chemically immobilizing the tiger and bringing it to Noah’s Ark. Unfortunately, human life became at risk and the tiger was shot by the authorities,” the wildlife sanctuary said in a statement. “Thank you to the officers for trying their best to bring this animal to safety.”

Gerri Yoder, Henry County’s animal control director, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that tigers are not legal to own without proper permitting. Because of that, the animal could have been “a victim of the exotic pet trade” and “born and bred for the purpose of resale.”"

Schultz, whose gender identity was non-binary and who wished to be referred to by the pronoun “they,” was an engineering student and president of Georgia Tech’s Pride Alliance. Police say the student approached officers with a knife around 11 p.m. on Saturday.

Schultz appears emotionally distraught in bystander footage of the shooting. Officers can be heard repeatedly telling Schultz to “drop the knife,” but Schultz tells officers to shoot. At one point, someone says, “No one wants to hurt you, man.”

In the graphic video below, Schultz can be seen continuing to approach the officers before a single gunshot rings out, followed by screams.

Schultz’s mother, Lynne Schultz, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that her child had several medical issues, including depression, and had attempted suicide two years ago. But she said she doesn’t believe that Schultz was attempting “suicide by cop,” or provoking police into killing them.

During a press conference alongside civil rights attorney L. Chris Stewart on Monday, Schultz’s family members questioned why officers didn’t use a Taser or mace and whether police had received training for interacting with people who are mentally disturbed.

“Why did you have to shoot? Why did you kill my son?” Schultz’s father asked.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it is now investigating the shooting.

“Officers provided multiple verbal commands and attempted to speak with Schultz, who was not cooperative and would not comply with the officers’ commands,” the agency said in a statement on Sunday. “Schultz continued to advance on the officers with the knife. Subsequently, one officer fired striking Schultz.”

Facebook Schultz, 21, was president of Georgia Tech's Pride Alliance and studied engineering.

Rates of depression and suicide are particularly high among members of the LGBTQ community, various studies have found.

According to a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey Report that surveyed 27,715 transgender people across the U.S., 40 percent of respondents reported having attempted suicide in their lifetime. That percentage is nearly nine times the overall attempted suicide rate in the U.S., which was 4.6 percent.

“Respondents also encountered high levels of mistreatment when seeking health care,” the study found. “In the year prior to completing the survey, one-third (33%) of those who saw a health care provider had at least one negative experience related to being transgender, such as being verbally harassed or refused treatment because of their gender identity.”"

Castile, in the car with his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter, at first calmly informed the officer he had a firearm and is told by Yanez not to “pull it out.” He tells the officer he is not and is then shot several times. In audio from the footage, Castile can be heard saying “I wasn’t reaching” as the gunfire ends.

Throughout the trial, Yanez maintained that Castile was reaching for the weapon, but his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, said he was reaching for his wallet. Reynolds’ live-streamed video following the shooting went viral and prompted massive protests in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

Now a transcript of an interview between investigators and Yanez reveals the officer’s shocking interaction with Castile, including the quick escalation. Five passages from the transcript are below, with emphasis added. The mistakes in the transcript are from the original.

1. Castile clearly stated he had a gun, and the situation escalated in a “split second.”

Investigator: “From the time he mentioned to you that he had a firearm, weapon, um, what was the timeline? Did he immediately announce that at start ...?”

Yanez: “I can’t remember if he immediate announced it but it caught my attention right away and it seemed like it was split-second from the time he told me to the time he was reaching down, to the time I gave him direction, to the time he had the his hand wrapped around it and then I gave him more direction and shots were fired.”

2. Castile made a “C-shape” with his hands, and it was dark inside the vehicle.

Yanez: “He dropped his hand down and, can’t remember what I was telling him but I was telling something as his hand went down I think. And, he put his hand around something. And his hand made like a C shape type, um, type shape and it appeared to me that he was wrapping something around his fingers and almost like if I were to put my uh hand around my gun like putting my hand up to the butt of the gun.

“And then I lost view of it. Cuz he kept canting his shoulder and then I believe told him again I can’t remember don’t do it. And then he still kept moving his hand and at this point I looked and saw something in his hand. It was dark inside the vehicle, I was trying to fumble my way through under stress to look and see what it was to make sure uh what I was seeing. But I wasn’t given enough time and like I said he had no regard for what I was saying. Didn’t follow my direction. And, uh he started reaching out and then pulling uh away from his uh his right thigh. I don’t know if it was in his pocket or in between the seats or the center console. But I, I know he had an object and it was dark. And he was pulling it out with his right hand. And as he was pulling it out, a million things started going through my head. And I thought I was gonna die.”

3. Yanez said the car smelled like “burnt marijuana,” and he wasn’t sure if Castile’s gun was for protection “from a drug dealer.”

Yanez: “As I get up to the car I’m hit with an odor of burning marijuana .... And I know it’s already been smoked and I’ve been around uh through my training I’ve been around burnt marijuana and uh as a police officer I’ve been around burnt marijuana and uh fresh marijuana. So I know the distinct smells between both.

“I can’t remember if I asked for his ID or not but, I know I asked for his ID or his driver’s license. And then he goes I have a gun. And as I’m telling him or as he’s telling me that he’s reaching down between his right leg, his right thigh area and the center console. And he’s reaching down and I believe I’m telling him something along the lines of don’t reach for it, don’t do it. Referring to the, uh the firearm. Yep. Because usually people that carry firearms carry ’em on their waistband. Um and or in between the seats and being that the vehicle smelled the inside of the vehicle smelled like marijuana um I didn’t know if he was keeping it on him for protection, for, from a, a drug dealer or anything like that or any other people trying to rip him. Rip him meaning steal from him.”

4. Yanez said Castile fit the description of a robbery suspect and had a similar “wide-set nose.”

Investigator: “Do you remember what you pulled ’em over for?”

Yanez: “I was keeping my eye on 2424 Larpenteur which is a convenience store on Larpenteur at the intersection of Larpenteur and Eustice. It’s on the southwest comer of the intersection. Um, I wanted to pay attention to that because we had a strong armed robbery last week uh which involved two African American males um, one having a firearm and pointing it at the clerk and then the other uh the victim to!d me that he also had a firearm but I wasn’t ab!e to see it when the video was reviewed. Um, so I was sitting at a intersection and I see a white vehicle. I can’t remember what kind of vehicle it was. Um but I see two occupants. What I believed was two occupants inside the car. And I couldn’t make out the passenger. But I knew the passenger had a hat on. And I couldn’t make out if it was a guy or girl I just knew that they were both African American and the driver uh appeared to me that he appeared to match the uh physical description of the one of our suspects from the strong arm robbery, gunpoint.”

Investigator: “What is that description?”

Yanez: “Um it was a (sigh) I can’t remember the height, weight but I remember that it was, the male had dreadlocks around shoulder length. Or longer hair around shoulder length. And, um it wasn’t specified if it was corn rows or dreadlocks or straight hair. Um and then just kind of distinct facial features with like, a kind of like a wide set nose and uh I saw that in the driver of the vehicle.”

5. A 4-year-old girl in the car, the daughter of Castile’s girlfriend, was in the line of fire.

Investigator: “Where is the little girl seated?”

Yanez: “She was seated behind, directly behind the front seat passenger. But diagonal, uh, from where I was standing. Um, so basically behind the driver. And then, so...”

Investigator: “Behind the driver or the passenger?”

Yanez: “So if I’m facing the driver she was, she was diagonal from him. Behind the backseat or front seat passenger. So she was in my line of fire. Um, but I made sure that I directed my firearm down and as best as I could and let off rounds and as the rounds were going off I thought he was still moving for his gun and (sigh) I it just seemed like he was pulling out the gun and the barrel just kept coming. It seemed like something was just coming out and I thought it was a gun ..."

“Inoculate yourself with the word of God,” urged Gloria Copeland, who with her husband co-founded the Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Texas.

Both serve on Trump’s evangelical advisory board.

While health officials continue to urge people to get flu shots during a season that has been marked by widespread illness, Copeland told followers that faith in Christ is all that’s really needed.

“Well, listen, partners, we don’t have a flu season,” Copeland said in a video clip posted online by Right Wing Watch. “And don’t receive it when somebody threatens you with, ‘Everybody’s getting the flu.’ We’ve already had our shot: He bore our sicknesses and carried our diseases. That’s what we stand on.”

She said the faithful who don’t have the flu can ward off the infection by repeatedly saying, “I’ll never have the flu. I’ll never have the flu.”

For those who are ― somehow ― sick anyway, she offered a prayer.

“Flu, I bind you off of the people in the name of Jesus,” she said, “Jesus himself gave us the flu shot. He redeemed us from the curse of flu, and we receive it and we take it, and we are healed by his stripes, amen.”

Last week, the CDC said flu hospitalizations have reached their highest point in nearly a decade, and that 48 states are experiencing widespread illnesses due to the virus.

The agency also urged people who have not yet been vaccinated to get the flu shot."

The officer reportedly fired at the pajama-clad victim from inside a police cruiser while she addressed his partner through the driver’s window.

Justine Ruszczyk, 40, was killed after she called 911 to report what she thought was a possible assault on her street, her fiancé confirmed Monday.

It appears she most frequently went by the name Justine Damond, even though she was not yet legally married to fiancé Don Damond, 50. The couple had planned to get married in August, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

Shown below are Justine Damond, Don Damond and Don’s son Zach Damond.

Don Damond mourned the loss of his fiancée in a statement Monday afternoon and criticized the police for not being more forthcoming with information surrounding her death.

“Our hearts are broken and we’re utterly devastated by the loss of Justine,” he said, describing his fiancee as “a teacher to so many in living a life of openness, love and kindness.”

“She was so kind and so darned funny,” Damond said while holding back tears. “We’re desperate for information. Piecing together Justine’s last moments before the homicide would be a small comfort.”

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner announced Monday that Justine Damond died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen and described her death as a homicide.

Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it would provide consular assistance to the victim’s family, and released a brief statement on behalf of relatives.

“This is a very difficult time for our family,” the statement says. “We are trying to come to terms with this tragedy and to understand why this has happened.”

Justine Damond’s father, John Ruszczyk, addressed her death in a statement to Australian media on Tuesday.

“We thought yesterday was our worst nightmare, but we awoke to the ugly truth and it hurt even more,” he said. “Justine was a beacon to all of us, we only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death.”

Zach Damond, 22, who identified himself as the slain woman’s future stepson, said in a video posted to Facebook that she was killed after calling 911 to report a sound in the alley behind her home.

Justine Damond went outside in her pajamas to talk to the officers when they arrived to investigate about 11:30 p.m. She was reportedly speaking to police from outside the driver’s door when the officer in the passenger seat pulled his gun and shot through the driver’s side door, striking Damond, sources familiar with the incident told the Star Tribune. No weapon was found at the scene.

The officer who fired has been identified as Mohammed Noor, the first Somali-American officer to join the Minneapolis Police Department’s 5th Precinct team, according to local CBS affiliate WCCO.

City records show Noor had three complaints on file, according to local ABC affiliate KSTP. One complaint against him was dismissed with no disciplinary action, though two remain open.

“Officer Noor extends his condolences to the family and anyone else who has been touched by this event,” Tom Plunkett, Noor’s attorney, said in a statement Monday. “He came to the United States at a young age and is thankful to have had so many opportunities. He takes these events very seriously because, for him, being a police officer is a calling.”

“The current environment for police is difficult, but Officer Noor accepts this as part of his calling,” the statement continued.

Zach Damond reacted to the incident in a video posted to the Facebook page for Women’s March Minnesota.

“Basically my mom’s dead because a police officer shot her for reasons I don’t know,” he says in the video. “I demand answers. If anybody can help, just call police and demand answers. I’m so done with all this violence.”

Minneapolis police faced intense pressure after authorities admitted there was no video footage from the officers’ body cameras.

The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which was leading the investigation, said body cameras worn by the officers were “not turned on at the time and the squad camera did not capture the incident.” The agency said it was seeking any other video that may have been taken.

Since 2016, Minneapolis has required all officers to wear and activate body cameras “at all times when they could reasonably anticipate that they may become involved in a situation for which activation is appropriate.”

The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension “will provide additional details of the incident once initial interviews with the officers are complete,” the agency said in a statement Monday. “Those interviews have been requested by BCA agents. The officers are working with their attorneys to schedule them.”

Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges said she had “questions about why the bodycams weren’t on” and was “heartsick and deeply disturbed by what occurred.”

“There are still many questions about what took place, and while the investigation is still in its early stages, I am asking the BCA to release as much information, as quickly as they are able to,” Hodges said in a statement.

Both officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave, the Star Tribune reported.

Personal Website Justine Damon was a motivational speaker and meditation teacher, according to her personal website.

Justine Damond, who had lived in Minneapolis for roughly three years, was a trained yoga teacher and worked as a motivational speaker and life coach, according to her personal website.

She grew up in Sydney, and completed a degree in veterinary science at the University of Sydney in 2002 before moving to the U.S., according to her LinkedIn profile.

Jo Grabyn, a friend and fellow Australian, told HuffPost on Monday that she was “in shock and totally confused” about the circumstances surrounding her friend’s death.

“She was such a shining light in so many ways,” Grabyn, 42, said. “She leaves a gaping hole in so many lives. [She] deserved three lifetimes, not less than half of one.”

The Lake Harriet Spiritual Community Center, where Justine Damond gave weekly talks on meditation, said in a statement to HuffPost that she preached and practiced “love and peace and non-violence.”

“She inspired us with example of how she chose to live her life,” the center said. “While this is a tragic event, Justine would want us to use this opportunity to develop greater love and compassion for each other, and look to find solutions by thinking differently.”

A neighbor reportedly told reporters the victim was critical of lenient American gun laws, compared with those in Australia.

Following a shooting rampage that left 35 people dead in 1996, Australia passed anti-gun violence measures that introduced lengthy background checks and required all firearms to be registered to a licensed owner and stored under strict conditions, separate from ammunition.

Australia, like countries such as Germany and New Zealand, has encouraged citizens traveling to the U.S. to be aware of high levels of gun violence. The country’s foreign affairs department website warns travelers to “be vigilant about possibility of gun crime in all parts” of the U.S.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was rocked by another police shooting last year, when a St. Anthony officer fatally shot Philando Castile in a St. Paul suburb just miles from the scene of Saturday night’s killing. An officer was charged in the death of Castile, who was black, but was acquitted last month. He has since left the St. Anthony police force.

huffpo45,huffpo,"['Jim T. Miller', 'Syndicated Columnist', 'Nbc Today Contributor', 'Creator Of Savvysenior.Org']",2017-10-23 08:58:13-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flu-shots-for-seniors_us_59ede649e4b034105edd503d,"Dear Savvy Senior,

What can you tell me about the flu shots made for seniors? I got sick last winter after getting a standard flu shot, and am wandering if the flu vaccine for older adults would provide me better protection this year.

—Almost 70

Dear Almost,

There are actually two different flu shots – the Fluzone High Dose and FLUAD – that are designed specifically for people age 65 and older (you only need to get one of them).

These FDA approved vaccines are designed to offer extra protection beyond what a standard flu shot provides, which is important for older adults who have weaker immune defenses and have a great risk of developing dangerous flu complications.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the flu puts more than 200,000 people in the hospital each year and kills, on average, about 24,000 – 80 percent of whom are seniors.

You also need to be aware that these senior-specific flu shots cannot guarantee that you won’t get the flu this season, but they will lower your risk. And if you do happen to get sick, you probably won’t get as sick as you would without it. Here’s more information on the two vaccines:

Fluzone High-Dose: Approved for U.S. use in 2009, the Fluzone High-Dose is a high-potency vaccine that contains four times the amount of antigen as a regular flu shot does, which creates a stronger immune response for better protection. This vaccine, according to a 2013 clinical trial, was 24 percent more effective than the regular-dose shot at preventing flu in seniors.

FLUAD: Available in the U.S. since last year, the FLUAD vaccine contains an added ingredient called adjuvant MF59 that also helps create a stronger immune response. In a 2012 Canadian observational study, FLUAD was 63 percent more effective than a regular flu shot.

The CDC, however, does not recommend one vaccination over the other, and to date, there have been no studies comparing the two vaccines.

You should also know that both the Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD can cause more of the mild side effects that can occur with a standard-dose flu shot, like pain or tenderness where you got the shot, muscle aches, headache or fatigue. And neither vaccine is recommended for seniors who are allergic to chicken eggs, or those who have had a severe reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.

Both vaccines are also covered 100 percent by Medicare Part B, as long as your doctor, health clinic or pharmacy agrees not to charge you more than Medicare pays.

Pneumonia Vaccines

Two other important vaccinations the CDC recommends to seniors, especially this time of year, are the pneumococcal vaccines for pneumonia. Around 1 million Americans are hospitalized with pneumonia each year, and about 50,000 people die from it.

The CDC is now recommending that all seniors, 65 or older, get two vaccinations –Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23. Both vaccines, which are administered just once at different times, work in different ways to provide maximum protection.

If you haven’t yet received any pneumococcal vaccine you should get the Prevnar 13 first, followed by Pneumovax 23 six to 12 months later. But if you’ve already been vaccinated with Pneumovax 23, wait at least one year before getting the Prevnar 13.

Medicare Part B covers both shots, if they are taken at least one year apart.

To locate a vaccination site that offers any of these shots, visit Vaccines.gov and type in your ZIP code."

Witnesses said the animal was shot two or three times before it collapsed.

“It was a very big tiger,” a witness told Le Parisien. “We heard two or three shots and saw police going down towards the tracks” of a nearby tramway. The tramway had been shut down “because of the presence of a tiger” on the tracks the Paris transit agency said.

The 450-pound, two-year-old tiger was shot before French firefighters arrived on the scene, L’Express reported. Authorities took the tiger’s owner into custody for questioning, according to French media. He appeared to be “in shock,” said L’Express. He was being held on suspicion of putting people’s lives at risk, according to Le Parisien.

The tiger had escaped from the Bormann Moreno circus, which recently set up in the city for shows slated to begin in about a week.

The animal had been free “for some time,” according to officials. The Paris police department announced later Friday the danger to the public was over after the animal had been “neutralized.”

No one was injured by the tiger or the shooter.

Captive animals that have escaped are sometimes killed because tranquilizer darts can take too long to take effect, and the animals may put people’s lives at risk.

Some area residents, conservationists and animal right activists were outraged that the tiger had been killed and posted gruesome photos of the tiger’s body on social media, calling for an end to the use of animals in circuses and for boycotts of events that exploit animals."
huffpo47,huffpo,"['Anna Almendrala', 'Senior Reporter']",2017-02-25 18:13:45-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-officials-to-decide-if-the-us-should-get-3-mmr-shots-instead-of-2_us_58b0dadde4b0a8a9b7828046,"Federal health officials are convening to discuss whether Americans should have three vaccines for the mumps instead of two, The Washington Post first reported this week.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ deliberation is expected to take a full year and is in response to the large number of mumps outbreaks in the U.S. in recent years ― most notably in 2016, when there were more than 5,000 cases, This trend appears to be continuing into 2017, and it’s occurring not in communities with pockets of low-vaccination rates, but instead in areas where vaccine coverage is robust.

ACIP liaison member Patsy Stinchfield, who represents the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, said the workgroup of experts would dive deeper into the mumps situation, “given we have had significant cases of mumps in 2006, 2010 and now again in 2016.”

These virus outbreaks could be a sign that the current two-shot schedule, which is given in combination with vaccines for measles and rubella between the ages of 12 and 15 months and then when children are between 4-6 years old, may not be strong enough to prevent an infection. Two doses of the MMR shot protects against mumps 88 percent of the time, while one shot is 78 percent effective. In contrast, two doses of the vaccine protects against measles 97 percent of the time, and just one shot is 97 percent effective against rubella.

“At present, mumps does not come as a single antigen vaccine and is available only as combined MMR vaccine so deliberating a third dose would also need to consider extra doses of measles and rubella,” said Stinchfield, who is Senior Director of Infection Prevention at Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.

Some of the questions the advisory group will consider include why the outbreaks only seem to be occurring among teens and young adults, but not older adults, Stinchfield said.

In general, receiving extra doses of MMR vaccine is not ideal but poses little to no medical problems. ACIP and National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioner representative Patsy Stinchfield

The committee will examine the context of the most recent outbreaks, which for the most part have taken place on college campuses, but not on military bases, which also house similarly aged people in close quarters. The committee will also consider if vaccine storage and handling techniques, or a shift in the mumps genotype compared to the vaccine, could explain the outbreaks.

And because the mumps dose is part of a combination vaccine, the committee will examine any potential adverse effects that may come with getting a third MMR shot ― although due to poor record keeping or a person’s uncertainty about their history, Stinchfield said she has often seen patients who have received more than two MMR shots.

“In general, receiving extra doses of MMR vaccine is not ideal but poses little to no medical problems,” she said.

“Multiple doses and adverse events will also be analyzed by the workgroup.”

Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has some guidelines in place for local public health agencies considering offering a third MMR shot to people in the face of a large-scale mumps outbreak, but these are not official recommendations because scientists need more evidence of its effectiveness.

In short, local health officials should consider a campaign for a third MMR shot if the outbreak is happening among people with a 90 percent or higher two-dose MMR coverage rate and if there are signs that transmission has gone on for more than two weeks. And an attack rate of more than five cases per 1,000 people could help local health leaders decide to encourage a third shot.

In January alone, there were 495 reported mumps infections. Last year there were 5,311 cases. In 2006, the last year there was a large spike in reports, there were more than 5,700 cases, many of which were among fully vaccinated college students.

CDC There have been several large mumps outbreaks in recent years in the U.S., prompting officials to consider recommending a third vaccine to prevent the disease.

*Cases as of Dec. 31, 2016; **Cases as of Jan. 28, 2017. Case counts are preliminary and subject to change.

“Remember, mumps is not just a cute chipmunk face associated with an upper respiratory illness,” Stinchfield said. “We vaccinate against it because mumps can cause encephalitis, meningitis, deafness, oophoritis (ovary swelling) and orchitis (testicular swelling).”

People with mumps can also experience fever, headache, fatigue and inflammation of the salivary glands, causing patients’ necks to swell, or even mastitis, inflammation of the breast tissue.

Once you’re exposed to the virus, it can take an average of 16 to 18 days for symptoms to set in, although some infections can cause very mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.

It is passed along through saliva and mucus, so kissing or sharing eating and drinking utensils with infected people puts you at risk. Simply living in close quarters with infected people could also put you in harm’s way, which explains why many of the most recent outbreaks in the U.S. have taken place at universities. In response, some of these universities held large-scale vaccination campaigns to give students a third shot of the vaccine. In 2014, there were also mumps outbreaks among several National Hockey League teams.

In one recent outbreak that spanned from 2015 to 2016, people at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign started getting mumps despite the fact that most of them had received two recommended mumps vaccines. In response, the university health center recommended that all students and staff born in 1957 and afterward receive a third MMR vaccine, and about 11,500 complied.

In total, 317 became infected with the mumps at that campus, even though 73 percent of them had received the usual two doses. In fact, another 45 of those who got the mumps had gotten three vaccines, with the third shot being administered during the outbreak, although experts suspect that they had gotten infected before the vaccine had a chance to kick in.

Lest you think this is evidence that the MMR vaccine isn’t worth the hassle, consider this: Before the mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967, the virus used to be considered a universal disease of childhood, according to the CDC. Most children got the virus by the time they were 14 years old. Outbreaks were also common in the military, especially at the most inconvenient of times — such as mobilization.

But once the vaccine became a national recommendation, the disease rates plunged. In 1968, one year after the shot was introduced, there were 152,209 reported cases. By the early 2000s, those reported cases had dropped 99 percent to an average of less than 270 annually.

And The Washington Post noted in its report this week that even though recent outbreaks spread among a population that was mostly vaccinated against mumps, the vaccine appeared to mitigate the severity of the disease. In Arkansas, where about 2,800 people have gotten mumps since 2016, only 17 people experienced inflammation of the testicles. Without vaccines, that number could have been as high as 700 or 800."

Nobody seems to know ― or if they do, they aren’t saying.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 1 shooting, President Donald Trump and Las Vegas police praised Campos for his actions, as he initially was reported to have taken a bullet to the leg before helping authorities locate the shooter, Stephen Paddock. But the story got murkier last week, when law enforcement adjusted the timeline of events. They first suggested Campos had actually been shot outside Paddock’s hotel suite minutes before Paddock began his attack on the thousands of concertgoers gathered 32 stories below. Then, police revised the sequence of events again, saying Paddock was shooting “at the same time, or within 40 seconds after” Campos had reported being shot.

Questions of Campos’ whereabouts first began to swirl last Thursday, when he abruptly canceled on a slate of interviews with major news networks in which he had been scheduled to publicly give his account of the night’s events for the first time. The next day, Campos’ union representative, David Hickey of the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America, told reporters he’d learned that Campos had been taken to a local clinic.

“We had a meeting with MGM officials, and after that meeting was over, we talked about the interviews, we went to a private area, and when we came out, Mr. Campos was gone,” Hickey said, according to Fox 5 Las Vegas. “Right now I’m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It’s highly unusual. I’m hoping everything is OK with him and I’m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something.”

Hickey has had “no contact” with Campos since, he told the Los Angeles Times on Monday. He maintained that “somebody knows where he is.”

MGM Resorts, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Tuesday that there was nothing unusual about Campos’ disappearance.

“Jesus Campos wants to tell his story at a time and place of his choosing,” they wrote. “He’s asked that everyone respect his request for privacy. We could not be more proud of Jesus.”

Hickey did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

With 58 killed and hundreds more injured, the Las Vegas mass shooting is the deadliest in modern U.S. history. It has sparked a storm of media coverage, and Hickey had been in Las Vegas helping Campos manage the spotlight. The two men were photographed together last week, as Campos received an “SPFPA Hero Award.”

But it seems unlikely that all of the attention directed at Campos is welcome.

Lt. Aaron Allan, a 38-year-old with the Southport Police Department, responded to reports of an overturned car in front of a house on Thursday afternoon. As Allan approached, he was fatally shot by a man hanging upside down from the vehicle.

Police identified the suspect Friday as 28-year-old Jason Brown.

“The Southport Police Department is mourning the tragic loss of Lieutenant Aaron Allan who was killed in the line of duty after he was shot while trying to help,” the department said in a statement.

While police haven’t released a potential motive for the incident, Traci Wagner, a longtime friend of Brown’s, said the shooting was “out of character” for him.

Instagram Jason Brown, 28, is accused of killing Allan.

“There’s no winner in this situation,” Wagner told Fox59. “There’s no winner. There just isn’t. So many lives were ruined last night, yesterday by all of this.”

Allan was with the Southport Police Department for six years and had more than 20 years of law enforcement experience. In 2015, he was recognized as officer of the year after he saved a man’s life at the Indiana State Fairground by performing chest compressions on the man for 10 minutes until help could arrive.

“I’m very surprised,” he told The Southport Times after being recognized for his heroics. “It’s part of the job. I’m overwhelmed.”"

Police suspect Cruz was armed with at least one AR-15-style rifle and “countless magazines” in the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

This adds to a disturbing trend. In many of the most deadly mass shootings in the last several years, including the Las Vegas massacre on Oct. 1 and the shooting at a Texas church on Nov. 5, the lone gunmen were armed with assault-style rifles like the one reportedly used at the Florida school.

There’s plenty of debate over what constitutes a mass shooting — as well as what drives those who commit them. But it’s increasingly clear that individuals who want to inflict mass casualties are taking advantage of the widespread availability of weapons of war.

These weapons are meant for use on the battlefield.

Renowned firearms engineer Eugene Stoner developed the first AR-15, or ArmaLite Rifle (hence the “AR”), in the late 1950s, using advances in technology and materials to revolutionize battlefield weaponry. Stoner’s rifle was marketed to national militaries interested in a lightweight firearm with precision accuracy and high lethality at long range. Colt Manufacturing Co. eventually purchased ArmaLite and convinced the U.S. military to replace the M-14 with its M-16, which employed many of the advances in the AR-15.

Many modern AR-style rifles are modeled off of these rifles and their successors, which have been the standard issue for the U.S. military since the Vietnam War. But there is one key difference: Battle-ready assault rifles have a selector switch that allows automatic fire (a continuous spray of bullets with a single pull of the trigger), or semi-automatic (one shot with each trigger pull). Civilian versions are semi-automatic only.

The AR-15′s influence is apparent on the .223 SIG Sauer MCX rifle reportedly used in the 2016 Pulse nighclub massacre in Orlando, according to Mother Jones.

SIG SAUER The SIG Sauer MCX is the assault-style rifle used in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in 2016.

Here’s how one reviewer described the SIG Sauer MCX:

SIG SAUER developed the MCX rifle for America’s special forces. Their goal: a firearm that’s as quiet as an MP5, as deadly as an AK-47, and more modular than anything ever designed.

The manufacturer touts the same qualities, saying the rifle is designed to be “silenced, light and short.”

These rifles are designed to kill as efficiently as possible.

These weapons are designed to fire off bullets very, very quickly. Some manufacturers boast that an experienced shooter could fire as many as 45 rounds in one minute. Magazines containing fresh ammunition can be swapped out in a matter of seconds.

The specifications of assault-style rifles vary depending on ammunition, but many tests put the muzzle velocity of a standard round from an AR-15 at 3,200 feet per second, making it accurate up to 500 yards ― more than a quarter-mile.

This makes rounds from an AR-15 or other assault-style weapons far more devastating than those fired from small-caliber handguns.

Here’s a video of a 5.56mm caliber round ― the kind used in many assault-style rifles ― being fired into ballistic gel meant to mimic human flesh. You can see how a single shot inflicts massive trauma, regardless of where it hits the target.

And that’s just one round. A standard AR-15 magazine holds 30 rounds. But in most states, the rifles can be legally outfitted with high-capacity magazines that can hold 60 or even 100 rounds. A gunman in Texas recently managed to fire off 212 rounds from an AR-15 during a standoff with police, though it’s unclear if he used high-capacity magazines. Six people were shot during this exchange, none fatally. If the shooter had chosen a more densely populated target, the outcome could have been much different.

AR-15 and similar weapons also are highly customizable, allowing for the addition of aftermarket sights, grips, suppressors and other accessories that make them more effective and easier to wield in combat situations.

Assault-style rifles are relatively cheap and easy to buy.

The average price of an assault-style rifle fluctuates somewhat with supply and demand. Online distributors currently offer versions for under $200, though the average price appears to be around $1,000. A SIG Sauer MCX like that used by the Orlando gunman retails for about $1,700.

In most states, anyone legally allowed to possess a handgun can also purchase an AR-15 or other assault-style rifle, with no further requirements. In Florida, for example, there is no waiting period for would-be buyers of rifles or other long guns.

Not even people on the terrorist watch list are barred from purchasing assault-style rifles. An attempt to close that loophole was voted down by Senate Republicans in 2015, and was blocked again shortly after the Orlando shooting the folllowing year.

These guns are already everywhere.

There are estimated to be millions of assault-style rifles already in civilian hands, according to recent manufacturer reports, with dozens of companies offering versions. Most of these weapons will never be used in crimes. But the threat is nonetheless present.

A suspect arrested in 2016 in Los Angeles had three of AR-15 rifles in his car, along with bags of ammo and explosive materials. He reportedly told police he was on his way to the city’s gay pride parade.

And it’s not just a matter of AR-15s and their higher-tech variants. Hundreds of thousands of new assault-style rifles flood the market each year. This includes high-powered weaponry like the AK-style rifles used in 2015 by the Planned Parenthood shooter in Colorado Springs, or the gunman who attacked a military recruitment center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Some states ban assault weapons, but manufacturers have found ways around the restrictions.

A number of states, including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, have laws limiting or banning the sale of assault weapons. California, for example, has banned AR-15s and other rifles with detachable magazines, which allow shooters to quickly reload. However a recent feature called a “bullet button” allows magazines to be quickly replaced, while still technically remaining fixed, rendering this law largely ineffective. State lawmakers attempted to close this loophole by introducing legislation prohibiting future sales of rifles with bullet buttons, but gun owners have found ways around the ban.

Gun manufacturers have also managed to easily circumvent other state laws by making small modifications to the weapons, such as replacing the grip or other components.

Federal attempts at banning assault weapons have been largely unsuccessful.

In 1994, then-President Bill Clinton signed a federal ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. The law specifically banned certain semi-automatic weapons, including the AR-15, as well as rifles that could accept detachable magazines. That ban lapsed in 2004, when Congress did not reauthorize it.

There’s been debate about how well the ban actually worked. It didn’t apply to guns manufactured prior to 1994. According to NBC News, more than 1 million assault-style rifles and 25 million guns with high-capacity magazines were grandfathered in. A 2004 study by the University of Pennsylvania found that while the ban did result in a measurable reduction in crimes involving assault weapons, crimes involving non-banned guns remained steady or increased.

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence,” concluded the study. “There has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury.”

Pro-gun activists say this shows a new assault weapons ban wouldn’t affect gun violence. But if the ban hadn’t expired, it’s difficult to imagine these guns proliferating to the point of becoming the weapon of choice of mass shooters.

After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut, some members of Congress sought to renew the assault weapon ban. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2013, but was excluded from a vote by the full Senate due to Republican opposition. An attempt to re-attach the measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), one of the ban’s most ardent supporters, was voted down 40 to 60.

House Democrats again pushed for renewal in late 2015, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and Feinstein reintroduced it in 2017 following the Las Vegas and Texas shootings. There’s been no action on it since.

An attempt to ban bump stocks, a device used by the Las Vegas shooter that effectively turns semi-automatic rifles into automatic ones, also failed to gain traction in Congress. (Massachusetts, however, became the first state to ban the add-on stocks earlier this month.)

Connecticut State Police via Getty Images The Bushmaster AR-style rifle used to carry out the 2012 rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

Every time a gunman carries out a massacre with an assault-style rifle, sales go up.

Gun sales, particularly those of assault weapons, tend to spike after each mass shooting, fueled in part by fears that lawmakers will crack down. Already immensely popular, AR-15s and similar rifles flew off the shelves after Sandy Hook. Gun shop owners saw a similar spike after San Bernardino.

This trend is so pronounced that gun industry executives have admitted mass shootings are good for business.

Families of gun violence victims are fighting back against this profit windfall. The parents of nine Sandy Hook victims and one person who survived the massacre are suing Remington, the manufacturer of the rifle used in that shooting. The suit accuses Remington of negligence in selling a military-grade weapon for civilian use, arguing that the guns were purposefully marketed to young men as personal weapons of war.

“Remington took a weapon that was made to the specs of the U.S. military for the purpose of killing enemy soldiers in combat ― and that weapon in the military is cared for with tremendous amount of diligence, in terms of training, storage, who gets the weapon, and who can use it,” the families’ attorney, Joshua Koskoff, told CNN in February of 2016. “They took that same weapon and started peddling it to the civilian market for the purposes of making a lot of money.”

Handguns are common in single-victim gun violence, but military-style rifles are becoming the weapon of choice for mass shooters.

Tens of thousands of people die in gun violence every year, and the overwhelming majority involve handguns, not assault-style rifles or other long guns. At least 64 percent of the gun-related homicides in 2016 were committed with pistols, according to FBI data.

When shooters do turn to heavy weaponry, however, the results can be catastrophic.

Weapons of war have been used in some of the deadliest shootings over the last several years. In addition to Las Vegas, AR-15 style rifles were used during mass shootings in California, Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Texas and Colorado.

The gun industry is trying to convince you these weapons are just for fun.

Gun advocates insist assault-style rifles are ideal for hunting and target shooting. A fact sheet published by the National Shooting Sports Foundation in 2013 condemned the “assault weapon” label, claiming the term was “conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie.” The group has repeatedly argued that the guns are useful for marksmanship competitions and hunting large game. The NRA champions the AR-15 as ”America’s rifle.”

The industry has coined the term ”modern sporting rifles″ to describe assault weapons, and the term is used by major gun retailers like Cabela’s, and manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Remington.

That message may resonate with gun enthusiasts. The weapons are versatile and efficient, and if you like the idea of shooting things for sport, the appeal is obvious. Assault-style weapons look cool. Shooting one might even make you feel like a badass.

But the very same traits that have made them the preferred weapon for military personnel and sport shooters are what make them a natural choice for those who want to inflict senseless violence with maximum casualties.

It now seems the toll of mass killers is limited only by their choice of weapon, their training and their target. The political response to that terrifying reality has been to hope that people will choose not to kill. That plan clearly isn’t working."

Joseph Houseman, a 63-year-old ""Open Carry"" advocate, prompted multiple calls to 911 when he stood in front of a Kalamazoo Dairy Queen with a rifle and shouted at traffic and passersby.

At least one 911 caller was concerned that Houseman may have been intoxicated.

When police responded to the scene, they found Houseman wearing what appeared to be pajama pants and carrying a rifle. When they tried to talk to him, Houseman gave the middle finger to the officers, grabbed his crotch and shouted about revolution, according to video of the incident obtained by the Kalamazoo Gazette and placed online at MLive.com.

A police officer repeatedly asked Houseman to put down his gun so they could talk, but he refused and accused the cop of ""acting like a prick"" and being in a gang.

At one point, when asked his name, Houseman identified himself as ""Joe Schmoe.""

After 40 minutes, Houseman put down his rifle, which was then confiscated by police. He also offered his real name and said he was sorry.

""I apologize. I have a bad attitude because we're losing our rights,"" he said.

When Houseman refused a breathalyzer test, officers decided not to give him his gun back. Instead, he was told to come to the police station and claim it the next day. He did, and his gun was returned.

Although the incident occurred in May, the video of the standoff was just obtained by the newspaper under the state's Freedom of Information Act.

During a confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday, Dr. Dean Winslow broke with his boss’ line on guns, telling the panel how nonsensical it is for people to be able to purchase semi-automatic rifles like the one used by the shooter at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

“I may get in trouble with other members of the committee,” Winslow said,” [But I’d also like to say] how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy a semi-automatic assault rifle like an AR-15.”

Shortly after he made the statement, an unidentified senator cut him off before he could elaborate, interjecting, “I don’t think that’s in your area of responsibility or expertise.”

Dr. Winslow is a former U.S. Air Force colonel who served two tours in Afghanistan and four tours in Iraq after 9/11. He went on to serve as the vice chair of medicine at Stanford University.

Law enforcement officials say the shooter in Texas used a Ruger AR-556, a variant of the AR-15. Similar semi-automatic rifles were also used to carry out mass shootings at a country music event in Las Vegas last month, an Orlando nightclub last year, and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.

Winslow offered the line in response to a question about whether the Sutherland Springs shooter should have been dishonorably discharged from the military, instead of merely receiving a “bad conduct discharge” after he was convicted of domestic violence.

The former U.S. Air Force colonel didn’t offer a direct response, instead choosing to highlight the Air Force’s failure to properly record the shooter’s domestic violence conviction in a federal database, one that would have otherwise prevented him from buying the gun."

Brian Mast (R-Fla.), a combat veteran and gun-carrying National Rifle Association member, is supporting a ban on “assault-style weapons” in the wake of a deadly mass shooting earlier this month.

“Our Second Amendment is an unimpeachable, God-given right to defend ourselves ― one of the most basic rights,” Mast said Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day.” “But we recognize that there is balance between what is the level of lethality, what is that level of firepower, and does that fall in line.”

Mast has recently flipped his stance on certain gun laws, distancing himself from other Republican legislators. He first publicly announced his endorsement of an assault weapons ban ― something the NRA opposes ― on Friday in an op-ed for The New York Times.

GOP Rep. Brian Mast, who is calling for an assault weapons ban, says ""our Second Amendment is an unimpeachable, God-given right ... but we recognize there is a line somewhere that we say, here is the Second Amendment and here is public safety"" https://t.co/416HcbNs1F — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 27, 2018

He said Tuesday that people shouldn’t be allowed to buy weapons like the AR-15-style rifle used earlier this month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“Let’s pause, let’s assess, let’s see what’s going on in the system,” he said. “Do a ban on purchases of these assault-style weapons ... so that we can assess the whole situation and get back to the American people in a responsible way.”

The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, the NRA’s political action committee, contributed $4,950 to Mast’s 2016 congressional campaign ― more than any other Florida member of the House during that election cycle.

In his op-ed, the Republican lawmaker called for several legislative steps to be taken, including defining and prohibiting the purchase of “an assault or tactical firearm” and improving the federal background check system. He also favored banning firearm accessories like “bump stocks,” the device that enabled Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire hundreds of rounds into a crowd at a country music festival in October.

“No firearm is evil,” Mast wrote. “Guns are tools that fulfill the intent of their users, good or bad. But we’ve seen that the rifle of choice for many mass shooters is the AR-15. ... I cannot support the primary weapon I used to defend our people being used to kill children I swore to defend.”

President Donald Trump announced his support for banning bump stocks and expanding background checks, but has not embraced an assault weapons ban. Instead, he has suggested raising the minimum age to purchase such weapons from 18 to 21.

Mast has argued that that’s not enough."

Think about that number: 147. That's three busloads, two completely-full Amtrak passenger cars. The New York Times, in a nearly unprecedented front-page editorial, calls it a ""moral outrage and national disgrace."" The purpose of this column is to explain why we agree and why the editorial board's call for a ban on civilian ownership of assault weapons deserves to be supported in the strongest possible terms.

The gun industry has been promoting assault rifles by advancing a big, fat lie; namely, that assault rifles are just another type of 'sporting' weapon, no more dangerous than the old Remington or Winchester that Grandpa and then Dad used to lug out to the woods. Most sporting rifles load ammunition by the manual use of a bolt or lever, which considerably slows the speed at which the gun can fire multiple rounds. Semi-automatic sporting rifles like the Remington 742 increase the speed at which the gun can shoot more than one round, but the standard semi-auto hunting rifle still only holds 4 or 5 rounds.

What makes the AR so different, so lethal, and so non-sporting is not the fact that it looks like a military gun (which it is); not the fact that it might be fitted with a laser which makes it extremely accurate, particularly in indoor, low light; not the fact that the stock can be folded so that the gun can be easily carried or even concealed; not even the fact that the front barrel lug can also be fitted with a bayonet, just in case a little extra oomph is needed to finish the job.

What makes the AR an assault rifle and not a sporting rifle is one thing and one thing only, namely, that it fires ammunition specifically designed to kill or maim military combatants (who happen to be humans, by the way) and can easily fire 50 or 60 high-powered rounds in 30 seconds or less. This is not to say that mass shootings involving scores of victims can only be accomplished with an AR; Seung-Hui Cho killed and wounded 56 people at Virginia Tech in 2007 using a Glock 19. But Cho's attacks were spread over more than three hours; Adam Lanza killed 26 with an AR in five minutes or less. Better coordination and communication might have saved many lives at Virginia Tech; in San Bernardino the carnage was over almost as soon as it began.

What the Times calls a moral outrage and national disgrace is more than that; the ability of private citizens to get their hands on these highly-lethal weapons fitted out with high-capacity magazines is a risk to the nation's health. When two cases of Ebola occurred in the same hospital where a patient stricken with the virus had previously died, it wouldn't have taken more than one or two more confirmed cases and the city of Dallas would have ceased to exist. But the risk was recognized by the CDC and the threat was quickly brought to an end.

We are suggesting that the same situation now exists as regards the ownership and use of AR-15s. How many more senseless slaughters are we going to endure while politicians dither around and pretend they are truly concerned about Constitutional rights? And if anyone wants to believe that banning assault rifles would be an infringement on the sacred 2nd Amendment, the recent decision by the 2nd Circuit upholding Connecticut's assault rifle ban lays that NRA-concocted nonsense to rest.

The Constitution wisely gives government the right to institute comprehensive public health measures when the community's health is at risk. If 147 dead and injured human beings in just three assaults with AR rifles doesn't constitute a risk, then it's time to save the taxpayers some money and close down the CDC."

During a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers on gun control Wednesday, Trump suggested guns should be taken away “immediately from people that you can judge easily are mentally ill,” alluding to the Florida shooter, who had undergone a psychiatric evaluation in 2016 but was ultimately not hospitalized.

“The police saw that he was a problem, they didn’t take any guns away,” Trump said. “Now that could have been policing, but they should have taken them away anyway, whether they had the right or not.”

He doubled down on the claim later in the meeting after Vice President Mike Pence spoke about due process and giving local law enforcement more leeway to obtain a court order to collect firearms from potentially dangerous people.

“Mike, take the firearms first and then go to court, because that’s another system,” Trump said. “A lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early.”

Trump often seemed to be more in agreement with Democrats than Republicans during the meeting, as was clear by Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-Calif.) delighted expression during much of the event.

Trump shot down Rep. Steve Scalise’s (R-La.) suggestion to add concealed carry reciprocity to a background check bill, telling him, “You’ll never get it passed.” He also chided Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) for being “afraid” of the National Rifle Association.

He was, however, on board with Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s (D-Minn.) request to provide domestic violence victims with more protections against gun violence, and Feinstein’s suggestion to add an assault weapons ban to legislation.

Trump also repeatedly questioned former President Barack Obama’s efforts on gun control on Wednesday. He kicked off the meeting by listing mass shootings that had taken place under other presidents, and called out Obama by name while discussing the Manchin-Toomey bill.

Trump didn’t appear knowledgeable about that bill, which failed in the Senate in 2013 despite widespread public support and has been debated regularly ever since.

He asked Toomey, who introduced the bill with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), if the bill had bipartisan support and suggested it “didn’t have a lot of presidential backing.” He also argued Obama “was not proactive” in trying to pass a bill to strengthen background checks, despite Obama’s push for gun control reform after the Sandy Hook massacre in 2013.

Politicization, according to the DCCC official, included talking about gun violence prevention policy.

“You and your candidate will be understandably outraged and upset, as will your community. However, DO NOT POLITICIZE IT TODAY,” DCCC regional press secretary Evan Lukaske wrote to candidates in the Northeast. “There will be time for politics and policy discussion, but any message today should be on offering thoughts/prayers for victims and their families, and thanking 1st responders who saved lives.”

The email, seen in its entirety below, reflects the careful balance that Democrats have tried to strike as they strive to advance modest gun safety regulations and shield candidates in swing districts from the political price that could accompany comments about guns.

HuffPost

But the cautious approach in Lukaske’s email is increasingly out of touch with what many party members, as well as gun violence prevention activists, would like to see from politicians ― especially in the wake of the recent deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Many of the surviving Parkland students waited almost no time before beginning to agitate for different gun policies, sparking a movement that has captivated the country.

Gun violence prevention activists said they were disappointed the DCCC was advising candidates not to aggressively talk about policy solutions as often as possible. Ladd Everitt, director of the gun violence prevention group One Pulse for America, described the DCCC email as “pathetic.” Mark Glaze, senior adviser to the group Guns Down, said it was “straight out of the NRA’s talking points.”

“If the DCCC is willing to give up a key issue and offend virtually every Democrat so as not to bother eight Independents in rural Missouri, they’re even more incompetent than we thought, and Democrats should be very worried about the midterms,” Glaze said.

Several Democratic lawmakers have taken to mocking the traditional practice of sending gun violence victims “thoughts and prayers” without any follow-up of policy solutions.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who became a leading advocate of greater gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, wasted no time after the Las Vegas massacre calling for greater action to prevent gun violence.

“To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,” he tweeted a few hours after Lukaske’s email went out.

Asked about the email on Tuesday, Murphy emphasized that it was a message from “one staffer.”

Still, he added, “No Democrat should be worried about talking about policy changes in the wake of these mass shootings.”

Former Democratic Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, retired Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, “led by example” the day after the Las Vegas shooting by demanding congressional action on the steps of the U.S. Capitol the day after it occurred, noted Katie Peters, of the former congresswoman’s group Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. (Giffords became a more aggressive gun regulation advocate after being gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting.)

“Following the tragedy in Parkland, we’ve seen the students show incredible leadership in demanding more than thoughts and prayers from their elected officials,” Peters said.

Meredith Kelly, the DCCC’s communications director, emphasized that Lukaske’s message was intended to discourage hasty responses before all information about the shooting was known, rather than silence opinions about gun policy. It was also general advice that candidates were free to ignore.

“A communications staffer who fails to provide immediate and thoughtful guidance after a national tragedy, based on the best available information at the time, is not doing his job,” Kelly said.

The DCCC would not say whether it sent candidates similar guidance after the Parkland shooting. However, Kelly said the group, which is responsible for getting Democrats elected to the House, continues to caution candidates to consider their words carefully in the immediate aftermath of major national tragedies.

The revelation that the DCCC advised candidates to avoid “politicizing” the Las Vegas shooting occurs as the House campaign arm struggles to fend off progressive criticism of its electoral strategy, particularly through its involvement in primary elections.

Waleed Shahid is a spokesman for the left-leaning Justice Democrats, which backs a variety of candidates, including some the DCCC opposes. He called Lukaske’s email “a slap in the face to the movement” against gun violence.

“Politics is exactly how people come together to make change and hold those in power accountable,” he said."
huffpo60,huffpo,"['Erin Schumaker', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-03-01 05:47:06-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-gun-violence-hipaa_us_5a95a39be4b0bef79e3086ab,"A person at risk for committing gun violence has a clear profile, but when doctors identify a patient who meets the criteria, there is often little they can do about it.

The U.S. has decided that doctors should play a role in assessing risk, but we’re not giving them the tools to act on that risk, and so these efforts are mostly futile. That’s in part because of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, which prevents doctors from reporting a patient as dangerous unless the specific threat they pose is both “serious” and “imminent.”

HIPAA is important ― it protects the privacy and security of Americans’ health information and prevents employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of their medical histories. It also provides the trust, in an ideal doctor-patient relationship, to share extensive personal information ― including family, medical, psychological and drug use histories, disease and gun ownership statuses.

But that same sensitive knowledge that allows for high-quality treatment can also put doctors in a difficult ethical situation.

One of the biggest tip-offs that a person will commit a violent act is if they make a violent threat, and it isn’t uncommon for such threats to happen in a medical setting.

“Sometimes the only person who is aware that there’s a serious and imminent threat is a physician,” said David Rosmarin, the director of forensic psychiatry at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital. “And that clinician is barred under HIPAA from disclosing that threat if it’s below serious and imminent.”

We’re there to treat people. Putting us in the position of being the gun snitches is a difficult position to be in. David Rosmarin, Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital

HIPAA constraints become even more complicated in cases when the risk of violence isn’t overt or immediate. A clinician can assess that the patient has two major risk factors for the potential to commit gun violence, but can’t predict the future.

The doctor is forced to make a quick judgment call: Is the threat the patient presents both serious and imminent enough to report him to the police? If the patient doesn’t meet both of those risk standards, the doctor could be violating patient privacy and breaking the law by speaking up.

As Dr. Christopher Barsotti, an emergency medicine doctor in Bennington, Vermont, puts it, there are many examples of violence with a gun that could be classified as “near misses” and go uncounted.

Barsotti listed a series of de-identified examples from a single Vermont emergency room, which he published on VTDigger, a Vermont-based nonprofit journalism website, in 2015:

...the abused woman whose husband put a handgun on the kitchen table “for effect” when he beat her; the out-of-control kid who grabbed an unsecured gun and faced down his parents when he was mad; the mentally unstable man who scared the hell out of his neighbors with an impressive array of high-capacity firearms; the woman who tried to shoot herself with a long gun, but jerked the stock when she pulled the trigger, missed and blew a hole through her apartment wall; the heroin addict who dropped a handgun out of his pocket before passing out on the gurney; the kid who could have been a school shooter, but someone got worried and brought him in for treatment; the woman who overdosed on pills after witnessing the shooting death of a loved one.

Generalized worry that someone is capable of committing gun violence doesn’t reach the threshold ― and neither do several other scenarios. What if the patient has Alzheimer’s and can’t remember how to lock his front door, much less his gun safe? If the threat’s not serious and imminent, there’s nothing a doctor can do without breaking the law.

Doctors also have to think carefully about whether reporting an at-risk person will ultimately do more harm than good to that patient and his family.

If, for example, a pediatrician calls child protective services because a parent reveals that there are unlocked guns in the home, it’s likely that the pediatrician would not see that child in her practice again ― and worse, the parent may take the child out of the health care system entirely.

The likelihood that a parent would reveal to a doctor he doesn’t store his gun safely is higher than you might imagine, according to research published in the journal Pediatrics earlier this month: Nearly 70 percent of gun-owning parents with children in the home reported that they did not properly store their weapon, even when they had a child in the home had been diagnosed with a mental illness that would put him at risk for suicide, such as major depression.

Doctors’ first responsibility is to their patients ― not the public.

Beyond doctor discomfort, there’s the potential that predicting future violence could infringe on patient civil liberties and unnecessarily insert law enforcement into situations in which an individual hasn’t committed any crime.

“We’re there to treat people,” Rosmarin said. “Putting us in the position of being the gun snitches is a difficult position to be in.”

Arthur Caplan, the founding director of New York University’s Division of Medical Ethics, said he wasn’t worried about degrading civil liberties by reporting at-risk patients. The bigger problem, he argued, is that there’s no system of interventions in place if doctors do decide to report patients.

“We don’t force people into treatment for threats,” he said. Caplan recalled posing a hypothetical question to a Philadelphia police officer. Caplan asked what the officer would do if he called 911 and reported a neighbor who regularly frequented the area with a gun.

“When he shoots somebody ― call,” the officer replied.

Angry men with guns are harder to disarm than people with mental illness.

Politicians and other public figures have frequently used mental health as a scapegoat for gun violence, simultaneously stigmatizing mental illness and damaging mental health care.

While mental health providers tend to agree that the mental health system is dysfunctional, identifying mental illness as the root of gun violence draws doctors and mental health experts into the conversation for the wrong reasons. The notion that we can prevent mass shootings by “fixing” mental health is an inaccurate representation of mental illness and a wildly ineffective gun violence prevention strategy.

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, New York State passed the NY SAFE Act to “stop criminals and the dangerously mentally ill from buying a gun,” according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).

In practice, the law requires medical doctors, registered nurses and mental health professional to report patients who have a mental health diagnosis and own a gun, and who are “likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others.” Some mental advocates have complained that the NY Safe Act violates HIPAA, while others believe it puts undue blame and stigma on those with mental illness, who are more likely be the victims of violent crime than to perpetuate it themselves.

“It was passed with some haste, in my opinion, without adequate input by the mental health community and specifically the New York State Office of Mental Health,” said Dr. James Knoll IV, director of forensic psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York."

“Ned’s Roach Away” has an innovative way to eliminate roaches: Arm the good roaches with teeny AR-15s to take out the bad ones.

“The only way to stop a bad roach is a good roach with a gun,” Barkley explains in the sketch. That’s the constant refrain from NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, heard most recently at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month: “To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.”

A horde of really bad roaches might require good bugs toting AR-15s with bumpstocks, notes Barkley’s Ned, who wears a cowboy hat.

Don’t worry, the armed roaches in “Ned’s Roach Away” are all “good character,” God-fearing bugs who regularly attend their tiny church. “And none of my roaches are gay,” says “Ned.”

Fans reactions were mixed on Twitter. Some found the sketch hilarious, while others thought it was insensitive so soon after the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.

The shooting, which took place around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, led to a frantic lockdown at Dalton High School. One student suffered a minor ankle injury while running down the halls, police said at a press conference.

Dalton police spokesman Bruce Frazier said the teacher, identified as social studies teacher Jesse Randal Davidson, 53, locked himself inside of the room and refused to allow students inside. “When the principal put a key in the door to try to unlock the classroom, Mr. Davidson apparently fired a shot from a handgun through an exterior window of the classroom. It does not appear that it was aimed at anybody,” Frazier said at a press conference.

UPDATE: The teacher is in custody. — Dalton Police (@DaltonPD) February 28, 2018

“Obviously at that point, [the principal] locked down the school, he called all the police in, the school resources in,” Frazier said.

Davidson faces charges of aggravated assault, carrying a weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of a gun during the commission of a crime, and disrupting public school, police tweeted.

School principal Steve Bartoo expressed surprise over Davidson’s behavior, describing him as an “excellent teacher” who loves his students.

“He said, ‘Don’t come in here. I have a gun,’” Bartoo recalled at an afternoon press conference. “It’s scary, real scary. It took me a moment to collect my thoughts after I heard the gunshot.”

Whitfield County Sheriffs Office Jesse Randal Davidson, 53, is facing a number of charges after accused of firing a gun inside of a high school classroom.

Bartoo said it took just a few minutes for law enforcement officers to arrive.

A school resource officer, who police initially said was on campus at the time of the shooting, was visiting the district’s junior high school and had to be called over. Bartoo said that officer, who police said is typically always at the high school during school hours, helped negotiate Davidson’s surrender.

“We’re very, very proud of this officer and everything that he did,” Bartoo said.

As far as I know, he was fit to be at work and I’m not aware of any depression. School principal Steve Bartoo

Police said they are still investigating a motive for the shooting.

“As far as I know, he was fit to be at work and I’m not aware of any depression,” Bartoo said when asked about Davidson’s mental health. Davidson has been employed by the school since 2004.

Dalton Assistant Police Chief Cliff Cason said his department had not had contact with Davidson prior to Wednesday’s event. Authorities said they are not aware of anything related to his personal life.

Jonathan Ernst / Reuters President Donald Trump last week met with survivors of this month's school shooting in Florida and suggested arming teachers and other faculty members to prevent such tragedies from happening again.

The frightening incident came the same day that classes resumed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a lone gunman killed 17 people two weeks ago.

It also followed heated debates on gun control across the country.

President Donald Trump, who met with survivors of the Parkland shooting last week, has suggested arming teachers and other faculty members to help prevent school shootings. As an incentive, he suggested giving faculty members extra pay if they agree to be trained to use firearms.

Trump repeated this idea during a meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday. He suggested hardening schools by “allowing people with a certified training, very talented people, to carry firearms.”

Florida’s House and Senate have also gotten behind the idea, with the state’s legislature advancing bills this week that would train teachers to carry guns in classrooms.

The idea of arming teachers and other faculty members to prevent school shootings led to renewed ridicule on social media following news of an armed teacher creating the kind of scare that the nation is trying to avoid.

Before the Revolutionary War, colonial Virginia passed a law barring black people from owning firearms — an exercise in gun control as racial control. In 1857, in his notorious Dred Scott decision, Chief Justice Roger Taney summoned the specter of black people freely enjoying the right to “keep and carry arms wherever they went.” Surely, he argued, the founders were not “so forgetful or regardless of their own safety” to permit such a thing. When black people armed themselves against white supremacist attacks following the Civil War, Southern state governments passed “black codes” barring them from owning guns. After the Black Panthers open carried to signal to California police officers that they would defend themselves against racial attacks in the late ’60s, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan signed a state ban on open carry into law.

In 2016, legal gun owner Philando Castile was shot after informing a Minnesota police officer that he was armed. Two years prior, Tamir Rice was killed by Cleveland police while holding a toy gun. John Crawford suffered the same fate in a Beavercreek, Ohio, Walmart.

So what does black gun ownership mean in a country so determined to keep its black populace unarmed? Since the 2016 election, interest in firearms has supposedly ticked upward in the black community. Gun shops and clubs link the interest to a desire for self-protection against the white supremacists emboldened by President Donald Trump’s election.

HuffPost spoke to 11 black gun owners about their reasons for owning a firearm. Trump was a non-factor. Instead, they talked about wanting to protect themselves out of fear that no one else would. They talked about their anxieties during interactions with the police and their complex views on gun regulation. Where gun advocates often adduce the imaginary heroics of a hypothetical active-shooter scenario to their arguments, the black gun owners we talked to referred to specific incidents, specific provocations — as if redlined, too, out of the fantasyland of American gun culture. And most of them returned to a sentiment as old as the nation itself: that owning firearms is a rebellion against a system bent on keeping them out of the hands of black folks.

The interviews have been condensed and edited for length and clarity.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost RJ Young, 30, poses with his handgun.

“I can’t view myself as just a gun owner. I have to view myself as a black gun owner.”

RJ Young, 30, Tulsa, Oklahoma

Young, a Ph.D. student at Oklahoma State, is writing a book called Let It Bang about his experiences as a black gun owner. He owns a Glock 17 9 mm and a Glock 26, which is his concealed carry weapon.

The first gun I ever touched was placed in my hand by my ex-father-in-law as a gesture of goodwill and good faith. He’s an old white man, and I was, at the time, dating his daughter. When he handed me this thing ― which I would come to find out was a Taurus judge, or a revolver you can cross-load with shotgun shells ― I was very scared to touch and hold it. It looked enormous, kind of like a Flaming Scimitar.

He was smiling about it. I thought that this was really weird at the time, like a scary “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.” And I found out later from my girlfriend, who’d eventually become my wife, that this was him saying: “Hi, I’m Charles. I’m a nice guy.”

He had guns around the house, and it wasn’t a big deal. There was another shotgun leaned up against the door. I asked him about the gun in his little fanny pack he carried around, and he went on for about an hour about this pistol. And I figured that was my in. So over a few years I got to know him through guns, and I got pretty good with them. I got a concealed carry license, and I ended up trying to figure out what it meant for me to have a gun as a black man. I slowly learned that we weren’t always allowed to have firearms. They were kept from us for a number of different reasons, but not the least of which is white folks feared violence from black people ― in particular black men. And I had this question in my head about whether or not I was safer if I had a gun knowing what had happened to Trayvon Martin and Walter Scott.

In the course of becoming an expert with a pistol, so much so the NRA certified me as a pistol instructor, I’ve come to find out that I’m not safer. In fact, I’m probably more likely to have harm done to me if I have a firearm on me because a cop stopping me is not the same as a cop stopping a white person. And I have a duty to inform any officer who stops me that I am carrying and that I have a permit for it. But how they react to that, I can’t say. And that scares me. So I would rather not have a firearm on me and give someone a reason, even in their minds, to shoot.

I believe in the right to carry a gun, so I own them, and they stay locked up. The ammunition stays in one room, and the firearm stays in the other. I go shoot from time to time to keep my skills and to keep my credentials, but I don’t carry one in public. For them to be for protection, they would have to be loaded. Even if I wanted to go get them from a closet, I don’t keep them loaded. I keep the slide lock open and a key lock through them. They’re paperweights in my house. If somebody broke into my place, either I’m going to let them do what they need to do and leave or I’m going to try to handle it with my hands.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost ""I believe in the right to carry a gun, so I own them, and they stay locked up. The ammunition stays in one room, and the firearm stays in the other,"" said RJ.

But the chances of someone breaking into my house are small. And if they broke in there, I want to believe that they believe they need something from me that would make them somehow feel whole or make them somehow get to a better place.

But if they shoot me or I shoot them, then nothing gets resolved. I’m just a cowboy who shot an outlaw. If that person is subdued or if I knock that person unconscious with one of the candle holders I keep around, and then that person is handcuffed and we go through this system of justice that we put into place; I feel much better about that. I don’t believe breaking into my house means that you need to die.

If I looked like Thor, I’d probably feel better about carrying a gun because the stigma is — I mean, I’m not just a black man. I’m a fit black man with, you know, 15 tattoos, sponge-brush hair and beard, and Malcolm X glasses, and I wear Jordans all the time.

If I could walk around Oklahoma and not count how many black folks were in the room, I’d probably feel better about firearms as a black man. I’d probably feel safer walking around with one. But the fact is, most people have a narrow view of who I am. I don’t get to wave my credentials in front of me and say, “Hey, master’s degree! Hey, Ph.D. student!” People have to take me as what they see, and they will immediately form an opinion about me. And most people who are white will have a bad opinion of me. That’s how I think this fits into my blackness. I can’t view myself as just a gun owner. I have to view myself as a black gun owner.

Ali Lapetina for HuffPost Courtney Cable was about 21 years old when she purchased her first gun.

“When you live in certain environments, you’re preconditioned to paranoia.”

Courtney Cable, 39, Detroit, Michigan

Cable works as a insurance sales agent. She owns a Smith & Wesson 9 mm.

I’ve lived in the inner city for years, and I’ve been a gun owner for over five years now. I don’t see anything wrong with it, to be honest. I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Sometimes I think we have post-traumatic stress. But we don’t know about these conditions that we live in. We just think this is the norm, and the norm is, you have to protect yourself before anyone else tries to harm you or rob you. You have that preconceived notion. You may not see it, but you’re living there. You know what goes on. You just have to protect yourself, pretty much, because everyone else probably has a gun.

My father was a gun collector, so he had Smith & Wessons. I was about 7 years old, and I had a stepfather who always had a gun in the home. And we knew not to touch it growing up. I got a little bit older, and my older brother had guns for protection because he was living not such a good life. Eventually, he ended up getting murdered in an act of gun violence. He was shot over 17 times.

If I’m going out any day or at night, I always carry it. If I’m coming in my house, I always have it out ready to walk into my home. You know, it’s just day to day.

I feel as though I’m more vulnerable than others. I’m an easy target. I feel like a lot of things do happen to females. I live alone so it’s just ― yeah, I’m an easy target, really. People watch you come and go, you know what I mean? And even though I’m 5’11”, that doesn’t mean anything. If people wanna target you, they’re going to watch your activities, who’s coming in and out of your home. Anybody could follow you. When you live in certain environments, you’re preconditioned to paranoia. It’s behaviors you don’t even know really exist. Even if I’m in a good neighborhood, I still have some of the same worries, though I’m probably not as alert as I am in other areas. For the most part, I’m watching my surroundings all the time.

I do feel safer with a firearm even though I’m still nervous, I’m scared, I’m afraid. When I am protected, and my gun is unlocked and loaded, I feel as though I have a chance. It’s either gonna be me or you ― and I can’t be afraid of whatever happens at that point.

Even though I’m a gun holder and I’m licensed to carry, being stopped by the police still worries me. It’s gotten to the point where I kind of don’t want to carry because it makes me more uneasy to drive while having my gun in my vehicle. For a while, I didn’t even carry it while driving ― whether I was out at a nightclub or whether I had a date. I didn’t even bother. I’d just take the chance because I was that afraid of the police.

Dustin Chambers for HuffPost Many of the gun owners spoke of their anxieties during interactions with the police and their complex views on gun regulation.

“I’m a guy who likes to do things by the book, and I want to be able to protect myself against people who don’t.”

Kendall Marr, 29, Topeka, Kansas

Marr works as a government spokesperson. He owns a SCCY 9 mm pistol and an AR-15 that he built himself.

I grew up in Texas. Guns are a part of life down there ― whether it be hunting or just going to the shooting range. It’s an everyday thing. I have guns because I enjoy shooting, and I also enjoy hunting. I’ve got family in Texas with a ranch, so I’m used to going out there and doing quite a bit of hunting.

My earliest experience with guns was growing up as a kid on a military base. You’d see people marching around the base with their M-16s, with the little orange or red plastic card in the tips. Both of my parents are in the military, so I saw weapons at home as well. My mom had a pink pistol as her side arm. Growing up with friends who wanted to hunt, we’d go out every now and then and do some shooting at the range or in the woods.

I was around 16 when I first shot a gun. I was at my buddy’s house and we’d gone out to his family’s ranch. They had shooting traps set up at 100 yards, 200 yards, 300 yards, and we’d put out pumpkins and watermelons and shoot them. This is how I found out that I like to shoot.

There are people who don’t have the right mindset to have handguns, people who aren’t responsible with guns. Those people shouldn’t have them. But, yes, I feel safer with a firearm. And changing the laws of what firearms you can carry isn’t going to change the mind of someone who wants to do something illegal. I’m a guy who likes to do things by the book, and I want to be able to protect myself against people who don’t.

I open carry but I don’t do it often. Being pulled over by the police is always a sticky situation in general. So when you’ve got a weapon with you, you’ve got to be prepared and extremely careful. You’re certainly more nervous. I haven’t been pulled over while I was carrying, but if I was, I would be extremely attentive. I’d have my hands on the wheel. I’d tell the officer I am carrying.

My grandfather was my first experience with guns. I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, and I grew up seeing him with rifles. They were just a part of life. They weren’t anything abnormal to me. I remember being in the country ― you can’t do this in the city limits ― and on New Year’s Eve, he would go out at midnight and shoot the gun off. And that was the highlight of New Year’s for me, seeing him go out and shoot his gun. I was in elementary school, and it was so cool. It stuck with me so much. And I never got that misconstrued. I didn’t think that guns were “so cool,” but this one act was just neat for me. It’s a regional, Southern, old way of life — I mean, I hope people still don’t shoot into the air on New Year’s. Looking back on it, that was dumb.

I purchased my first firearm in North Carolina, around 2005. I was about 26 or 27. It was a small .25 handgun that could fit in my purse. That .25 ended up being stolen, and I didn’t get another one for a while after that. But I would still go to the range every Friday. Friday was like date night at the range. The initial plan was for me to have a concealed carry permit, so I wanted something that was small that I could stick in my purse or keep in my glove compartment. Something that was easily accessible in the event that I needed it.

I moved shortly after the Philando Castile incident. Do I feel safer? It’s a mental thing. In my head I feel like I’m safer. But honestly, no, I know I’m not any safer. I keep my gun locked up. Getting to it is not going to be as easy as one would think. It’s not on my hip. This isn’t the movies. I don’t have it just ready to go. As far as driving around with it, I keep it locked up in my trunk. And the key is not usually with me.

I’m not as fearful as some of the recent shootings and incidents should make me feel. I’m not too terrified, and if I got pulled over, I wouldn’t even let them know I had a firearm since the gun would likely be in my trunk. I wouldn’t have access to it like I would if it were in the car beside me.

I am a Southern liberal. I’m not anti-gun, but I’m not regulation for all. I believe in responsible gun ownership. Because I’m a Southern liberal, I’m like, don’t take my gun. But don’t let people who don’t need to have guns have guns. I know the Second Amendment was created when we were shooting muskets and trying to keep redcoats from coming to take America. But things were different then. And I don’t cling to that as a crutch for having a gun. I know how I grew up. I know that I grew up with guns in my life. And I know that having them safely and the right people having them are OK.

Michael Starghill for HuffPost Thomas Moore poses for a portrait in his home with his LWRC .223/.556 MS Rifle with EOTech sights in Houston, Texas.

“I’ve rarely seen a situation where a firearm made it better.”

Thomas Moore, 35, Houston, Texas

Moore is a control systems engineer. He owns an American Derringer M1 .357 Magnum, a Derringer .38 Special, a .40-caliber Springfield XD, a Taurus Judge revolver, a Smith & Wesson Bodyguard .380 pistol and a LWRC .223/.556 M6 rifle with EOTech sights.

When I first moved down to Houston, I was 23 years old, and I would go in the house and not lock my door. And a guy came in my house in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. He was standing in my doorway looking at me, and I had nothing around me to defend myself with. After that, I went a bought a shotgun.

I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, and I had a bunch of buddies who banged and lived that kind of life. So my first experience with guns was from being around them. I’d never touch them, but I’d be around while they were shooting at the ground and acting stupid. I’ve been mugged before. I had a guy steal my bike with a pistol.

I also had a gentleman offer me an Uzi machine gun when I was 16. Me and my buddies were outside, just hanging on the corner. And this one guy comes up and he’s like, “You wanna buy a gun?” I’m curious, so I say, “What you got?” He pulls out an Uzi ― in the box and everything ― and says, “I’ll give it to you for $125 bucks.” I’m 16. I don’t have $125 to spare.

I don’t feel safer with a gun. I used to, but over the years my thought process on guns has changed. If someone comes and pulls a gun on you, you’re not gonna pull your gun out. I have a concealed carry license, but they teach you to remove yourself from situations before you have to use your weapon. Things happen in the blink of an eye. I’ve been in situations where my gun probably could have helped me, but I never even thought about grabbing it. I’ve also been in situations where me having a gun could have escalated the situation.

Michael Starghill for HuffPost Moore, shown here with his gun collection, says he doesn't feel any safer with a gun.

One time I was out with a friend at an after-hours club, and we got into an argument. This gentleman decided he wanted to step in. So I’m telling him, “Look, I don’t know you, and you don’t know me.” I guess he took that the wrong way, and he starts reaching for his hip, saying, “You don’t know me either.” It’s clear he had a firearm. If I reach in my pocket for my firearm, that’s where it could have gone wrong. I just walked away and left it alone.

I’ve been pulled over a few times, and it’s never been a problem for me. When you get pulled over, you have to hand them both of your licenses, and you have to tell them that you have a firearm and where it’s at. But with all the recent shootings, I am a little bit more leery now about police.

The older I get, the more my stance changes on firearms. I do believe that people should have one in their homes. But I’ve rarely seen a situation where a firearm made it better.

Down here in Texas, we can open carry. I did it one time, but I felt like the biggest jackass on Earth. It makes people uncomfortable, and it really doesn’t serve a purpose to let someone know you have a gun. And with all the recent shootings, that could have gone bad for me, too ― like the guy who got killed in Walmart for having a toy rifle. Or Tamir Rice. It’s things like that that make me feel like the laws aren’t really equal. I’ve not personally had a problem, but that doesn’t mean that that problem doesn’t exist.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Carlton LeFlore poses with an Armalite AR-10 rifle at his home in Orlando, Florida.

“I have a hammer for my home improvement. I have my gun for self-protection. They’re just tools to me.”

Carlton LeFlore, 30, Winter Garden, Florida

LeFlore works as an armed security guard, most recently for an abortion clinic. He owns a total of 18 guns, including four assault weapons. His assortment of tactical weapons includes a number of different brands ― mostly Glocks, Smith & Wessons and Springfields. LeFlore also has a variety of gun types, including semi-automatic and bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, revolvers and several semi-automatic handguns.

I grew up in one of the toughest neighborhoods in Miami: Liberty City. Violence and stuff like that was part of our everyday lives.

I always had a love affair with guns. I wanted to be a police officer. I always wanted to be a cop when playing cops and robbers with my friends. I bought water guns and toy guns. But I was always told that guns were bad. You shouldn’t have a gun, you shouldn’t own a gun ― especially for a young black male, you shouldn’t own a gun because you’ll be looked at as a thug, a criminal or a gangster. And, at first, I didn’t really want to own a gun. I thought that you should own a gun for self-protection, and at that time I didn’t feel like I was in any danger, even growing up in a bad neighborhood. As I got older, I started trying to understand the gun world. I’m a security officer now. I’ve had to incorporate guns into my work life.

In 2009, I bought my first gun. It was a shotgun. I started to see on the news that there were a number of home invasions happening around our city. That motivated me enough to get a gun at least for home protection. I started doing my research to see what was the best shotgun, the laws of the state, the laws of the city and what my Second Amendment rights were in regards to self-defense.

I’ve done armed security work, most recently for an abortion clinic. Every day, the clinic would get protesters ― religious fanatics or people who are just strictly against abortion ― so they needed security in order to protect the patients who visited the clinic. I was like the Secret Service for the doctor. He was the main priority. The clinic was located in a very conservative part of town. The clinic had gotten threats before ― people calling up threatening to blow up the clinic, to kill the doctors and stuff like that. I’ve even had protesters who were armed themselves show me their gun. They didn’t threaten me, but they were like, “I keep this for my protection.”

I always tell people who are thinking about getting into gun ownership that a gun is not an end-all, be-all. There’s a 50-50 chance that you can still die or perish at the hands of somebody else with a gun or a knife or a car or any other weapon. But it’s that 50 percent chance that I will take over a 100 percent chance of not being able to defend myself. I think what people don’t understand about guns is that if you practice responsible gun ownership, meaning that you follow the rules of gun safety ― keep your finger off the trigger, always treat your gun like it’s loaded, keep it pointed downrange at the shooting range and don’t point your gun at anything you’re not willing to destroy ― you won’t have accidents.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost LeFlore, who works as an unarmed security guard, is an avid gun collector.

I feel a lot safer than I did when I wasn’t a gun owner. When I wasn’t a gun owner, I used to fear leaving my house at night. I was living in a bad neighborhood, and you never know what people might do to you. I would wear jewelry or some expensive shoes and fear that somebody might rob me. I don’t want to have to shoot anyone. I would never want to use my gun on someone. It’s really a precaution, a way of being prepared in case someone wants to harm me. We live in a world where it’s becoming less and less safe.

I conceal carry. I’ve been stopped by police on three separate occasions ― two last year and once in 2015. When I was pulled over, it was a similar to the Philando Castile situation. I was with my cousin, but my gun was in the glove compartment. I was sitting in the passenger seat, and they stopped us because the headlight was out. They asked her for her license and registration. Now her registration was in the glove compartment with the gun. I told the officer that there’s a gun in the car ― which you don’t have to do in Florida. I just volunteered the information because I wanted to keep everyone safe. I told him the gun was in the glove compartment. He told me not to reach for it, and I complied. He ran my name, he asked me about the gun and if I had a concealed weapons license. I told him yeah. In Florida, if you’re traveling with a gun, it either has to be in a holster on you or in a locked box or in a glove compartment. Once he ran our names and everything came back good, he just sent us on our way.

I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with police, regarding me having a gun. Now being black, I am conscious of how I could get one of those police officers we’ve been hearing about on the news who treat this as a hostile situation. But I try to take extra precaution with the police to make it out the situation alive. I’m not saying every police officer is good and is going to treat me like those three separate occasions where I was pulled over ― now and then you will get one that is a little overzealous and doesn’t know the law. If they can’t see your hands, and they know you got a gun, then they probably will be a little bit uncomfortable.

Guns should be used only as a self-defense tool. I have a hammer for my home improvement. I have my gun for self-protection. They’re just tools to me. I don’t give them any power other than that. And I feel like most people give the gun so much power, but the gun can’t pull the trigger itself.

“I don’t give a fuck who they meant the Second Amendment for. It’s mine now.”

Maj Toure, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Toure, who declined to give his age, is an activist and entrepreneur who founded Black Guns Matter. He never discusses what firearms he owns.

My introduction was from a well-balanced perspective. Guys in my neighborhood would get drunk and shoot their guns into the air on New Year’s Eve. Bullets come down though, number one. Number two, you’re wasting ammo. And number three, that’s just not responsible. I had uncles who were in Desert Storm, I got uncles who were in Vietnam. And seeing their understanding of firearms and how they carried themselves, I immediately had what to do and what not to do.

Firearms are just as normal as your cell phone. You don’t drop your cell phone in water. You have a lock on your phone. It’s very private. It’s yours. You know how to operate it. It’s like a car. When you first start driving, you don’t know what the hell you’re doing. Then you start paying attention, being observant, looking around and being a responsible driver. Get drunk and shooting your gun is the same as getting drunk and driving. The difference is one is a right. A human right. One is a privilege.

I’m very careful in certain places now because you can’t carry. Black Guns Matter is doing trainings in different cities. And there are different rules for different states. So in some places I may not be able to lawfully carry, and I have to be mindful of that. That’s part of the responsibility.

We give classes free to all on firearm safety, on knowing the law, on how to apply state laws and for different permits, how to get a license to carry in your particular town, who are some trainers that you can work with. We work with trainers locally for whatever city, lawyers that know firearm laws, the Sanskrit, the basics, conflict resolution, de-escalation tactics. We give lessons on basics, so in essence it’s a class on the Second Amendment, on human rights, on civics, firearm safety and the cultural differences between communities.



And that’s to put people on the path to good citizenship. When you start paying attention to the Second Amendment, you start having more of a value for all of the other amendments. That creates good citizens: people who are politically active, who are going to their school board meetings, who are seeing what’s up with budgets, talking to their city councils, talking to their state representatives. We’re getting them involved politically on most angles.



America would not have even been created without firearms. Some people say it’s a contradiction for me as an African-American man to have a position: “When they wrote the Second Amendment, they didn’t mean it for you.” I don’t give a fuck who they meant it for. It’s mine now.

Dustin Chambers for HuffPost David White poses for a photo with his handgun in his home in Atlanta. He is a recent first-time gun owner.

“I am not worried about my interactions with the police.”

David White, 29, Atlanta, Georgia

White, a sales executive, only owns one gun ― a Glock 9 mm ― but has plans to buy more firearms in the future.

I remember like it was yesterday. I was with my best friend ― who’s now been my best friend for 23 years. His stepdad was drunk. We had just come in from playing basketball and his gun was on the kitchen table. We were just staring at it. And my best friend said, “That’s my stepdad’s gun. Don’t touch it.”

His stepdad came around the corner, stumbling, and just started hollering at us. He wasn’t upset or angry, but just realizing that he left the gun on the table and that he probably shouldn’t have. But he took it as an opportunity to talk shit to us, tell us about his background in the military and how experienced he was with guns. He asked us if we wanted to know a little bit more about the gun. And we said hell yeah. We were, what, 13- or 14-year-old black males in Atlanta. So he took us through what this part was, what that part was and how to load and unload it. He took the bullets out and let us practice ourselves.



I’m a new gun owner. I purchased my first firearm in late September. I wasn’t really looking to purchase a gun until I became a homeowner. And I started feeling more strongly as the months went by that I needed to be able to protect my home if I had to.



Having a firearm in the house is definitely an adjustment. I mean, it’s a weird type of feeling and experience. I don’t have any kids yet, but I’m constantly thinking about ― when we do have kids or when minors are in our house visiting ― where am I keeping the gun, how is it locked and safely put away. I feel a little bit more comfortable now knowing that if I hear something outside at night or if I hear gunshots at not a too far distance, I’m not going to feel vulnerable or completely at the whim or mercy of someone potentially running inside my home and having their way with my family. It’s a little bit easier to sleep at night.

Dustin Chambers for HuffPost White says he intends to openly carry his handgun.

I intend to open carry, because it’s a right. It’s an American right. Even though I don’t feel like the right is applied equally, I know it’s an American right. And I feel like I should be able to do it. ― not only to protect myself but also to protect, potentially, the lives of others in the rare situation that I could find myself positioned to do so. It’s not even just thinking about me, because I know I’m a healthy and physically able person. If I’m ever in a position where I can help or protect someone else, I’d want to be able to do that and not feel helpless.

I am not worried about my interactions with the police ― and I know that’s probably startling to hear given some of the recent events in our country. I’ve had some rough experiences with the police, but I feel like I know how to disarm a situation verbally, and I’m willing to do whatever is necessary to ease that situation. And I’m very keen on reading people.

Now, you flip that and talk about me potentially running into an officer while I have a weapon on me? That’s something that I haven’t really wrapped my mind around yet ― and I probably do need to do some thinking and talking out with my wife as to how to approach that situation.

Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost Increased interest in firearms within the black community has been attributed to a desire for self-protection against emboldened white supremacists.

“I worry about the repercussions of the wrong approach.”

David Cain, 33, Tampa, Florida

Cain, who works in the tech industry, owns an AR-15, a shotgun, a Glock, a Smith & Wesson and a Taurus Judge.

Previously, I was an active-duty Marine. I deployed in 2006, and that is how I got into firearms in general. I grew up with no firearms, but being in the military, you get accustomed to being around them. And I shoot purely for fun. I go to the range and I shoot a few different weapons.

I don’t have any childhood experiences with guns. My parents were pretty anti-gun to the point where we couldn’t even have toy guns. So I didn’t have any gun of any type growing up. When my grandfather passed away, I think I was 19 and my mom gave me his shotgun. I don’t really know how that transition happened. I think she didn’t know what else to do with it, so she gave it to me.



I grew up in the country in Michigan. So I took my grandfather’s gun to a friend’s house, and we shot in the backyard. And it actually jammed the second time I shot it, and I never got it fixed. I don’t think it had been oiled for however long it had been sitting in my grandfather’s closet. I ended up selling it because I couldn’t figure out how to fix it. I was young. I didn’t have the money to pay for a gunsmith at the time.

I carry almost everywhere I go, and when I’m carrying, I feel safer with it because I know what my training is. I feel confident enough that if I needed to, I could use it. Of course I would hope that never happens. But I do feel safer having the ability to defend myself and my kids. I don’t carry when I go to pick up my kids from school or things like that, because obviously you can’t have guns in school zones. There are some limitations to what I can do, but if I’m able to carry in that location, then I carry.

I have been fortunate enough to not have any interactions with the police but I worry about it daily. I almost bought a dash camera just to make sure that any action I take is recorded. I mean, I have friends who are police officers. I just try my best to make sure everyone’s at ease. But it hasn’t happened to me yet. I haven’t been pulled over while carrying. I just worry that, when you tell someone you have a weapon, you’re bringing their alert level higher. And my understanding of Florida law is that you don’t have to declare that you have a weapon on you. But I don’t know why you wouldn’t. I worry about if I didn’t tell them and they saw it or if I told them and then they felt more threatened. I mean, what’s the right approach? And I worry about the repercussions of the wrong approach.

My wife isn’t comfortable with guns. I have a safe, and I have to keep everything in the safe. And that’s just how it is. She’s nervous because we have small children. I have a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old, so you just want to make sure that the guns are always secured and unloaded. And I believe that children should know that they exist so that curiosity isn’t there. I’ve explained to the oldest one that they shouldn’t touch them. The youngest one is aware of them, but they’re in a safe. She can’t get to them. When she’s about 5, I’ll probably talk to her about them, too, and I plan on having my kids shoot when they’re about 10 or 11 just so they understand how a gun operates. Maybe it’ll scare them into not liking them or maybe it will take their interest. But either way, I want to make sure that I know their level of interest, that I can gauge that and see how to handle it.

That’s an important conversation that every gun owner has to have with their children. We try to be vigilant, but, unfortunately, access can happen. You forget to close the safe all the way or a kid can hit it with a hammer and it bumps open ― anything can happen. Who knows? But it’s better to have the conversation.

Allison V Smith for HuffPost Rodney Jackson holds one of his guns at his home in Plano, Texas.

“Anyone who wasn’t white and who had a weapon was considered a thug.”

Rodney Jackson, 46, Plano, Texas

Jackson works in IT security. He owns several handguns. He has two Springfields: the classic 1911 .45-caliber and a 9 millimeter. He also owns a Sig Sauer 9 mm and a Kimber 1911. He bought his wife a Sig Sauer P238 .380-caliber firearm.

I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, in the inner city. And during that time there was a lot of violence. I never was part of it. I was always a school boy. And then I attended college with a bunch of my friends who were like me, about 50 miles north. And that was our first interaction with another race, with white folks. I started learning that a lot of them believed in carrying guns, and I thought it was, at the time, just a gang activity. But I learned that a lot of folks go out and hunt, and they collect guns for a variety of reasons.

After I left college, I moved to Texas, and here, everybody has a gun. Everybody has a concealed carry handgun license. But I noticed that not many people who look like me had a concealed carry license. So at that point, I said, “How about if I get a gun and start using it, practicing, going to a range and so forth, and then look into getting a concealed carry license?” And I did that.

I just wanted to exercise my right. It was almost like I was witnessing people ― when I say people, I mean white Americans ― exercise theirs, but they didn’t want us to carry. Anyone who wasn’t white and who had a weapon was considered a thug. I wasn’t a thug. So I was gonna get one, and I was going to go through the proper classes and safely learn how to use it.

When I first visited a gun show I saw that it really wasn’t that many black people there at all. So I felt good about my decision, and I wanted to try to encourage more people to do it, too. And that’s how come I still, to this day, collect weapons and continue to motivate people to get their carry license.



I pitch potential black gun owners on the safety aspect and that it is actually our right to be able to carry a weapon because of the Second Amendment. I think we should practice all of our rights. They would prefer if you don’t have one for that reason alone. It’s almost like a rebellious type of front that I come at them from. Why wouldn’t you want to carry one?



When I first got the weapon, I was really into it. I was going to the range several times a week, and I really wanted to be a proficient shooter. And what I noticed is that I started feeling uncomfortable because it was all whites there, and they had all sorts of weapons ― like weapons that you just wouldn’t hunt with, but military-style weapons that they would practice with.



One day at the range, I decided I was going to change out a sight on one of my weapons. I went to the gunsmith, and while I was waiting, these white guys came up. One guy said to Joe the gunsmith: “Joe, I want you to meet my friend Mark. Mark, Joe is the best gunsmith in Texas. When Armageddon comes, I got a compound in East Texas. I’m getting Joe, and we gonna live on our compound and we gonna defend ourselves because Armageddon is coming and we’re going to take this place back.”

He said it right there in front of me, and that just made me feel like they’re gearing up for something, whether it’s going to come to fruition or not. And it made me want to always protect myself, always carry, always have something on me.



But I don’t feel safer with a gun. Here’s why: It’s almost like a fight. If you don’t pull yours first, you almost stand no chance. If you get hit first, you really stand no chance after that. Somewhat I feel safer. But, you know, if I’m at a gas station and someone is determined to rob me, I don’t really stand a chance against them. However, if I’m somewhere where there are a lot of people, and something breaks out, and it’s is not directed at me, I stand a better chance with a weapon of getting out of there.



There’ve been a couple times I’ve been pulled over, and, in carry class, they teach you how to handle a traffic stop. I always have my hands outside the car ― and I was taught that at a very young age. So when the officer comes up, I have my driver’s license and insurance card in my hand. Although I know now they don’t really need the insurance card ― they can look it up ― I still have it ready because I don’t want to reach in my glove box even though the weapon is not there. It’s normally on my person.

Allison V Smith for HuffPost ""I don’t feel safer with a gun. Here’s why: It’s almost like a fight. If you don’t pull yours first, you almost stand no chance,"" said Jackson.

When I have my hands out, when he sees the carry license, the first thing he asks is, “Are you carrying?” I hate that question. Because I don’t see what the purpose of the question is. If I say no, is that going to take you off guard? If I say yes, is that going to make you more on guard? So I’d prefer you don’t ask the question. If I gave you the carry permit, just assume I have it. If I have a carry permit, that means I went through all the background checks.



But I did have a friend ― a white friend ― and we were at QuikTrip. He was carrying. We were in line and there was a police officer in line as well. As we’re leaving, my friend, the officer stopped my friend and said, “You have a permit for that?” Now I don’t know how the officer saw it, because my friend had a shirt covering it. But I guess the gun was bulging out.

My friend said yes, and the cop said, “That’s what I thought,” walked away and let him go. I just found that to be interesting. I don’t think the officer would have assumed I had a permit. I don’t think he would have let me go just by saying I had a permit. And sometimes, I want to test it. I know I’m putting my life in jeopardy if I do it, but sometimes when I see police inside QuikTrip, I say, “I should carry in here just to see.”



This is what I really believe: If more of us actually got carry permits, I think they’d change the law. I really do. I think that would be the fastest way of getting more gun control. I joined the NRA when I first got my weapon. And I will never rejoin because the NRA doesn’t protect African-Americans who actually have their carry permit and did it the legal way.

“Police shootings are a factor and they have to be.”

James, 42, Western Pennsylvania

James, who asked to use a pseudonym for privacy reasons, is an educator. He owns a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun and a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson M&P compact handgun.

I’ve been around them all my life. The first firearm that I purchased was at the age of 22, 23. Up until then, I had always borrowed a firearm to go out and hunt. I hunted as a kid, and that’s how I got involved with firearms. Around 30, I got a handgun. But other than that, it’s been a shotgun or a rifle for sport.

As a teenager, I took a hunter’s safety course. That was the start. I didn’t get into yearly hunting until I started working a full-time job.

I wanted to carry for protection, obviously. Once I moved out on my own and was living in different areas, that was a form of home defense. Once I had a family, that was something we kept in the house until the boys were old enough that I didn’t want that around them. My oldest boy is 12. I haven’t hunted in years. We choose not to keep the rifle in the house. We keep it in another location.

He’s 12 now. He’s of age to where he wants to shoot but it’s going to be a process of taking him out to do that. I hate to use other events to shape how we parent, but he will learn the safety of it, he will get involved with it, but it isn’t the time to do that. We’re going to wait until he’s a little bit older before he takes the hunter’s safety course. But he will be taught the proper way to handle a gun.

He has two brothers who are a little bit younger than him. And it doesn’t take much. He’s seen what goes on and that’s why I no longer even think about applying for the concealed carry permit. Here in Pennsylvania, it used to be you’d go to the sheriff’s office, they’d take care of it, and that was it. But I will not carry a weapon on me even with a permit. That’s a safety issue. I know people who do, but that will not be me ― especially being African-American.

I hate to say that, but police shootings are a factor and they have to be. It’s not unheard of for kids to be outside with their NERF guns or paintball guns. However, we have specific rules. If you’re going to play with these, you have to be in the back of the house. We have to have that talk. You’re not walking around. You’re not going off the property or from our area with that. Someone may mistake the toy gun for something else, and something bad can happen. I hate for it to be that way, but that’s the nature of it.

When my boys have a home of their own, if they choose to own a gun and use it for sport, that will be fine. I have no issue with that whatsoever. But in no way do I want them to have their carry permit. That is not something I would like them to do at all.

Being in an area where it’s predominantly white, and going to some of these different places to shoot my shotgun, it gets uncomfortable at times. And some of my co-workers say they’re going out to shoot clay pigeons or whatever ― and that’s fine. But you gotta tell me about this area you’re taking me into. They’ve been great friends of mine. So they wouldn’t be involved in an area where my race would be an issue. But it’s always there when you talk about guns.

I haven’t been in any of those situations, but people from outside of my circle would look at me a little bit different. If you’re outside of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia can be anywhere down South. You go into one of these gun shops, or anywhere to shoot, and you’re likely to see Confederate flags. It’s pretty common.

I don’t feel safer with a firearm. A lot of people carry it for their own personal protection, but that’s not me any longer. I don’t feel that that’s going to save me one way or the other. There are other ways for me to get out of a situation. I think a gun might be more of an issue."
huffpo67,huffpo,"['Jonathan Cohn', 'Senior National Correspondent']",2018-02-24 08:01:13-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-control-policy_us_5a8f728fe4b03b55731a60af,"A serious debate over gun policy is underway in the aftermath of last week’s massacre in Florida, and one focus is the federal background check system ― a system that has existed for 20 years but which, by almost all accounts, isn’t doing enough to deter would-be killers from buying firearms.

In theory, almost everybody in Washington wants to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, as it’s known. That includes top Republicans, even though they have historically resisted or opposed efforts to control or limit gun access. It even includes President Donald Trump, who on Thursday tweeted support for improving background checks and on Friday said the same thing while answering press questions at the White House.

These vows may be meaningless. Recent history is littered with instances of Republicans dropping support for gun legislation as soon as public interest wanes. As for Trump, his own budget proposal, released earlier this month, proposed cutting funds for the background check system. It’s anybody’s guess whether Trump even understands the promise he has been making over the past few days, let alone whether he intends to keep it.

But if the student-led movement for stronger gun policies doesn’t let up, Trump and his allies may not be able to let go of this idea so easily. They might even decide that the political consequences of inaction are too serious to risk, that some kind of legislation on background checks is necessary.

The question, then, would be what kind of legislation.

On Capitol Hill, the current debate over background checks is focused on two very different proposals. One is an anodyne bill to shore up the existing system by feeding it information in a more timely and consistent fashion. The other is a more sweeping proposal to expand the reach of background checks so they include all sales, not just those that take place through officially licensed dealers.

But there’s another, even more ambitious idea out there ― one that Congress isn’t seriously considering now but that, according to many advocates and experts, could have a bigger impact. It’s a call for requiring would-be gun purchasers to first obtain licenses, which the government would grant only for people who go through a protracted process.

The process could entail any number of steps, but in the most ambitious versions it would include completing a gun safety course, paying registration fees, providing character references, and applying in person to local law enforcement. The goal is to reduce all kinds of firearm violence, including the everyday acts of homicide and suicide that account for the vast majority of this country’s gun deaths.

It might sound like a crazy idea wildly out of step with current practice. It’s not.

A dozen states plus the District of Columbia already have some kind of licensing program in place. There’s good reason to think these systems are having at least a mild impact in those places, and that they’d do a lot more if they existed nationwide. That’s especially true if licensing were part of a broader strategy that included bans on assault-style weapons, temporary restraining orders against gun ownership for people who pose likely threats, and other restrictions.

The Debate Taking Place Is About Background Checks

The existing background check system falls well short of such a licensing requirement. It is simply a mechanism for making sure prospective gun purchasers don’t have past convictions for serious criminal charges or domestic violence, prior judicial findings that the buyer was mentally unfit, or a handful of other conditions that, by law, would make somebody ineligible to own a gun.

But the system is only as good as the information it gets from states and other government agencies ― a weakness that became apparent after last year’s mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Years earlier, an Air Force court martial had convicted the killer, Devin Patrick Kelley, on a domestic assault charge. The Air Force failed to forward that information to NICS. If it had, Kelley would not have been able to obtain the guns he used in the massacre ― at least, not without violating the law.

A new bill would seek to fix that problem, by holding federal agencies to higher standards for supplying information and providing states with financial incentives to improve their reporting. The version in the Senate has as its chief sponsors John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). The idea generally enjoys bipartisan support, although Democrats are unlikely to go along with concessions on gun policy (like undermining state concealed carry laws) that House Republicans are demanding.

Whatever the bill’s ultimate legislative fate, Murphy himself has made clear that it is not enough. To really reduce gun violence, he says, Congress has to go a lot further ― at the very least, extending background checks to cover those private transactions, many of which take place at gun shows. (That’s why it’s come to be known as the “gun show loophole.”)

To put it plain terms, somebody with a domestic violence conviction, though legally prohibited from owning a firearm, can today get one by going through a private seller online or in person. Exactly how many sales take place through private channels is the subject of some debate. Research suggests it’s anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of the total, which, very roughly, means that at least 6 million sales a year ― and probably quite a few more ― involve buyers who haven’t passed a background check.

Closing the gun show loophole was a major focus of the legislative effort President Barack Obama led in 2013 following the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. That effort failed when a bill from Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) fell six votes short of the 60 it needed to pass that chamber. Murphy has a new bill calling for universal background checks and the idea seems, if anything, more popular than ever. Ninety-seven percent of Americans support it, according to one recent poll. It remains to be seen whether it will get a serious hearing in the Senate, to say nothing of the House.

The Debate Not Taking Place Is About Licensing

Critics of universal background checks note that the system fails to stop many killers, including confessed Florida shooter Nikolas Cruz, who obtained his firearms legally through a licensed dealer near his house. Advocates and experts acknowledge as much. But they say that’s an argument for imposing a licensing system that would subject prospective buyers to a longer, more thorough vetting process ― in a sense, demanding of gun owners something like what the government already demands of automobile owners.

Twelve states plus the District of Columbia have some kind of gun licensing in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The details differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, particularly when it comes to the kinds of gun purchases that require licenses, but they mostly include a few common elements: requiring the licensees to take a gun safety course, pay a fee, and wait for some period to get the license. Some states go beyond that. They require prospective buyers to obtain licenses in person, either from police or local officials, or supply fingerprints.

Typically licensing involves a more rigorous background check than the one federal law requires. The most aggressive states, like Massachusetts, require applicants to state their reasons for wanting guns, and give law enforcement officials discretion to deny a license if they believe an applicant poses a threat to public safety, even if nothing in the applicant’s history violates a specific prohibition. Applicants always have the right to appeal such denials and, ultimately, the vast majority of people applying for licenses get them.

Does licensing make a difference? Studies of several states by Daniel Webster, a widely cited professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, concluded that taking away licensing (as Missouri did) increases gun violence, while adding licensing (as Connecticut and Maryland did) reduces it. Webster told HuffPost he thinks “you could have much lower death rates” if licensing existed in every state alongside bans on high-capacity magazines and other firearm regulations. And he is by no means alone. In a survey of experts The New York Times conducted a year ago, licensing requirements were among the options they felt most likely to reduce firearm deaths.

The research on licensing has both its limits and its skeptics. (Conservative writer Robert VerBruggen, for example, has criticized Webster's Connecticut study.) When looking at the U.S., scholars must extrapolate from a relatively small set of states that have modified their laws in the last few years. The data is limited, and funding for more labor-intensive work, like sifting through police records on paper, is usually hard to find.

Still, anecdotal evidence, like interviews with criminals who say guns have become harder to get, supports the conclusion that licensing ultimately reduces violence. And then there’s all the research comparing the U.S. and other countries, showing pretty conclusively, as Vox’s German Lopez has argued, that by restricting access to guns, those countries have reduced gun violence and gun deaths."
huffpo68,huffpo,"['Chelsea Kiene', 'Senior Media Coordinator', 'Center For American Progress']",2013-01-25 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/25/firearms-freedom-act_n_2552385.html,"As the federal government begins its dive into the gun debate, GOP lawmakers across the country are introducing preemptive measures that seek to make those hypothetical future federal firearms restrictions unenforceable in their states.

Republican lawmakers in Arizona, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington state have all sponsored legislation this month prohibiting the enforcement of federal laws and regulations on firearms, ammunition and firearms accessories produced and sold within their state.

In Michigan, 13 GOP state senators have introduced the Michigan Firearms Freedom Act to protect Michigan gun and ammunition manufacturers from federal regulation. The bill passed the state Senate Judiciary Committee in a 3-1 party-line vote Wednesday, which means it will now receive a full vote on the Senate floor.

Sen. Steve Bieda (D-Warren), the only “no” vote on the committee, is concerned that the bill acts too soon and poses serious constitutional issues.

""The [new] federal regulations or laws aren't even out there yet,"" Bieda told the Detroit News. ""I feel like we're buying a lawsuit without even knowing what the lawsuit is for.""

Yet since 2009, legislators in at least 21 states have introduced their own version of the Firearms Freedom Act, arguing that the Ninth and 10th Amendments allow the states to treat the sale of firearms, ammunition and accessories as intrastate commerce, thus freeing those sales from federal oversight.

""The regulation of intrastate commerce is vested in the states,"" the Michigan bill reads. ""Congress has not expressly preempted state regulation of intrastate commerce pertaining to the manufacture on an intrastate basis of firearms, firearms accessories, and ammunition.""

Some states have taken their legislation a step further, threatening either monetary fines or imprisonment for any federal official who enforces federal gun laws within the states’ boundaries.

Arizona had already passed a measure to ward off federal gun restrictions on firearms sold and kept in the state in 2010, Now, a new bill proposed this month threatens to classify federal officials who enforce federal gun laws as Arizona Class 6 felons. Although this is the state's least severe felony classification, it can still lead to jail time for those convicted.

Similarly, Washington state's proposed Firearms Freedom Act could impose a penalty of five years' imprisonment or a $10,000 fine on federal employees enforcing federal gun laws and regulations.

One local government has also joined the fight against federal gun restrictions. The Franklin County Commission in southeastern Indiana unanimously passed an ordinance Tuesday excluding the county from any past, present or future federal laws pertaining to gun control.

""I think it's time to express our feelings,"" Franklin County Commissioner Tom Wilson said in an interview with the Connersville News-Examiner. ""It has to do with our Second Amendment, guns, gun control and infringement on our right to keep and bear arms.""

Although the latest bills may or may not gain enough traction to become law, eight states -- Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming -- have already passed versions of the Firearms Freedom Act. Unlike the current proposed measures, these laws were passed in 2009 and 2010, before the new gun control efforts inspired by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence made the constitutional argument against the Firearms Freedom Act -- and its interstate/intrastate distinction -- in a May 2010 court filing over the Montana version of the law. The center wrote, ""The Commerce Clause grants the federal government authority to regulate firearms because such weapons are easily and frequently sold and traded across state lines and used in crimes that affect commerce.""

The case of Montana Shooting Sports Foundation v. Holder is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit."
huffpo69,huffpo,"['Melissa Jeltsen', 'Senior Reporter']",2017-09-18 17:01:15-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/domestic-abusers-guns_us_59bfeba2e4b0edff971df198,"State laws that require people subject to domestic violence restraining orders to hand over their guns could save lives, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday.

Under federal law, individuals who are subject to permanent domestic violence restraining orders are banned from owning guns, and more than two dozen states have similar laws. But in many cases, such laws don’t explicitly require these people to surrender guns they already own. In practice, that means many abusers hold onto their firearms.

It’s a loophole that has been dubbed the “relinquishment gap.” According to Everytown for Gun Safety, only 16 states require people under final domestic violence restraining orders to turn in their firearms once they are prohibited from owning them.

Shannon Watts, Founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said the reason so few states require domestic abusers to relinquish their guns is because the gun lobby opposes it.

""As the body of research demonstrating the life-saving impact of these laws grows, I'm hopeful the list of states that have these laws will keep getting longer,"" she said.

Investigators from the Boston University School of Public Health examined 25 years of intimate partner homicides in all 50 states to examine the effect of firearm “relinquishment” laws, which specifically mandate that people subject to certain orders surrender their firearms to authorities. The researchers found that intimate partner homicide rates were almost 10 percent lower in states with these laws, compared with states without them, and that firearm-related intimate partner homicides were 14 percent lower.

“We really wanted to know does enforcement make a difference? As it turns out, it does,” said Michael Siegel, professor of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health, and the study’s senior author. “It’s logical that a law that relies upon the offender to voluntarily go to law enforcement and hand over their guns may not be that effective. But it was surprising to see the stark difference in the actual death rates.”

Guns and domestic violence are known to be a lethal mix. According to the study, more than 1,800 people are killed by their intimate partners in the U.S. each year. About half of those homicides are committed with firearms. The majority of victims are women.

If all 50 states had relinquishment laws in 2015, there would have been 120 fewer intimate partner homicides, the report says.

“Women who obtain restraining orders are at particularly high risk for partner violence, given that fear of violence (often created by threatened or actual violence) typically motivates the desire for a protective order,” the report concludes. “These findings seem to demonstrate the value of identifying high-risk situations based on known episodes of past violence and removing firearms from such situations to prevent future violence.”

Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said the findings align with what advocates have long seen on the ground.

“When domestic abusers are legally barred from owning guns, but aren’t actually required by the law or the courts to relinquish them, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that some of those guns are used to murder their victims,” Gandy said. “The lack of this basic protection for victims violates common sense and common decency.”

But while Australia has virtually eliminated mass shootings since the landmark 1996 firearms laws were enacted days after the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania ― in which 35 people were killed by a gunman wielding AR-15 and L1A1 rifles in what remains the worst single mass attack in modern Australian history ― gun control advocates say politicians and the general public have become “complacent,” allowing the gun lobby to push for a weakening of several important planks of protection as compliance with the laws has slipped across the nation.

“While Australians strongly support gun laws, many are of the view that everything was set in stone in 1996, but it wasn’t. Firearms laws are a political hot potato, and the Australian public isn’t aware gun laws are in trouble,” Sam Lee, head of Gun Control Australia, told HuffPost.

Following the Port Arthur massacre, the federal government swiftly passed new laws and state governments signed up to a new National Firearms Agreement, which all but banned semiautomatic weapons and pump-action shotguns.

Other parts of the legislation instituted far stricter rules governing storage of weapons and obligated people applying for guns licenses to demonstrate a “genuine need” to own a firearm ― self-defense was not permitted as a reason ― and to undertake a safety course. Also instituted was a new 28-day waiting period for licenses and new weapons, restrictions on the amount of ammunition that could be purchased and new conditions around “a mental or physical condition which would render the applicant unsuitable for owning, possessing or using a firearm.”

The gunman in the Port Arthur massacre was mentally impaired.

David Gray / Reuters Guns handed in during the 1996 buyback program in Sydney. More than 700,000 firearms were handed over in the government program.

The government also instituted a buyback system in which those who possessed the newly-banned weapons would be compensated for handing them in to be destroyed. More than 640,000 firearms were bought back from owners by the government from October 1996 to September 1997, while many tens of thousands of still legal weapons, such as handguns, were voluntarily surrendered, for a total of more than 700,000 firearms handed over to authorities.

In the 12 years before the new laws, Australia experienced at least 12 mass shootings in which at least five people died. In the 22 years since, only three incidents could be classified as mass shootings: an incident at Monash University in 2002, known as the only shooting at an Australian education facility, in which two people were killed and five were wounded; a siege at Hectorville in 2011, in which three people were killed and three wounded; and a domestic-related incident at a farm in Lockhart in 2014, when a man shot dead his wife and three children before turning the gun on himself.

After the 1996 laws, homicide and suicide by firearm decreased, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. From the 1995-96 fiscal year to 2013-14, firearm-related homicides dropped from 67 to 32 annually, the crime institute reported. Since 2003-04, no year has had more than 40 firearm-related homicides. In the U.S. in 2014, more than 11,000 firearm-related homicides were reported, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Images A memorial service is held May 19, 1996, at the Port Arthur historic site in Tasmania for the 35 victims of a mass shooting.

However, Gun Control Australia estimated in 2016 there were “as many guns in private hands in Australia as there was at the time of the Port Arthur massacre,” and in 2017, authorities estimated there were up to 260,000 illegal or unregistered firearms in the country. There are currently 730,000 licensed gun owners in Australia and 2.75 million registered firearms. Another gun amnesty, the first since Port Arthur, saw 26,000 firearms handed in last year.

A 2017 review of the National Firearms Agreement found no state had actually complied with all parts of the agreement and that most states had significantly loosened and weakened their gun laws in the two decades since Port Arthur.

“Every jurisdiction has slipped backwards by varying degrees. [New South Wales] is the most obvious example of compliance ‘slippage,’” wrote the report’s author, University of Sydney adjunct associate professor Philip Alpers.

New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, has recently permitted gun silencers, extended the availability of semiautomatic weapons and eased restrictions on licensing, the report said. Also of concern is that “every State and Territory allows minors to possess and use firearms,” with licensing ages ranging from 10 to 16 years, while some jurisdictions allow people to be trained in firearm use without first obtaining a license. Some states have relaxed restrictions on purchasing multiple firearms and ammunition, wound back licensing regulations, or relaxed rules on safe storage and background checks.

“Non-compliance from day one, and two decades of political pressure, have steadily reduced restrictions and undermined the NFA’s original intent,” the report said.

Gun control experts concur.

“Our gun laws are in a bit of trouble here. We can’t be complacent,” Gun Control Australia’s Sam Lee told HuffPost.

She said that, although background checks for an initial firearm license or purchase remained stringent, there were no further checks when someone wanted to purchase a second weapon, meaning that criminal offenses committed after the purchase of a first weapon might not be picked up. She said a national firearm registry, one of the recommendations of the National Firearms Agreement, was never implemented.

“We don’t know what happened in that time [between purchases]. People are falling through the gaps. We don’t have a national system to track the movement of firearms and licence holders, which is a problem with any criminal activity,” she said.

Lee Rhiannon is a senator for New South Wales and a member of the Greens party, the third-largest in the federal Parliament. Ond one of her portfolio responsibilities is gun control. Rhiannon told HuffPost she was trying to combat the complacency around firearms laws.

“The National Firearms Agreement hasn’t kept up with the modernization of guns,” she said, citing how dealers are attempting to import new rapid-fire weapons into the country, such as the Pardus shotgun (below), and technology that allows 3-D printing of weapons.

“I’ve been following the horror in the United States, and I’ve been impressed with the young people taking a stand and that they’re looking to Australia for laws. Hopefully they start having the conversation and moving toward gun control, and there are fine lessons to learn from Australia, but our system isn’t perfect. It can be tighter.”

On a political level, Rhiannon cited the rising power of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party in the New South Wales state parliament (it holds the balance of power in the upper house). The party supports gun rights and land access, and it has been working to slowly relax gun laws.

For example, in 2013, the Shooters Party negotiated exemptions to hunt feral animals in NSW national parks in exchange for its support for government plans to privatize the state’s electricity system.

Rhiannon said she was also concerned about the rising influence of gun lobbyists, along with moves to overturn a ban on the Adler 110 lever-action shotgun.

Former Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the 1996 laws, warned against voting for the Shooters Party at a recent NSW state election.

“The Shooters Party is standing and hoping to win seats in state elections, and they’re becoming important for major parties as the government will depend on them to get their legislation through. They’re making it easier for people to use a gun, which goes against the whole tenor of the NFA,” she said.

“The public hasn’t gone easy on guns. When there is a shooting, the public are deeply uneasy about the incidents, but when it drops out of the news and people aren’t paying attention, the major parties and shooters parties and gun industry are doing deals. At a federal level, the responsible minister has none of the gun control groups at the negotiating table, only the gun lobby.”"

The bill expands current gun-buying restrictions to include anyone who has voluntarily committed himself or herself for treatment.

Existing state law only prohibits those involuntary committed under Florida's Baker Act from buying a gun.

The new legislation closes a huge loophole, according to bill sponsors.

Only 1 percent of mentally ill patients are actually committed against their will, according to the Palm Beach Post, leaving 99 percent of those with a history of treatment to purchase guns.

“People with mental illnesses who are determined to be a danger to self or others are scamming the system. Many of them have been Baker Acted five, 10, 20 times. They never get into the system to prevent them from purchasing a firearm,” NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer said.

The 1 percent has amounted to 90,000 records in Florida's Mental Competency (MECOM) database, according to Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as court clerks are required to report when individuals are involuntary committed or ""adjudicated.""

If Gov. Rick Scott signs the bill into law, people who commit themselves for treatment will also be submitted to Florida's MECOM as well as to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which tracks mental illness on the federal level.

Yet Florida has been criticized for lagging behind other states in reporting mental health records to NICS, according to a report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

And even if the state's mental health records were comprehensive, there's another giant loophole in firearm sales: There is no federal or state law requiring background checks at gun shows or private sales -- just in retail stores.

Local governments like Miami-Dade County do require criminal and mental illness checks for all gun purchases -- including those at gun shows -- but the law often goes unenforced.

Meanwhile the NRA's focus on improving the U.S.'s mental health system has been called a ""smokescreen"" by critics.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called the belief that a mental-health system could pick out mass murderers before they strike a ""policy illusion."""
huffpo72,huffpo,['Brian Brueggemann'],2014-01-01 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/01/new-illinois-gun-laws-in-2014_n_4524967.html,"A new Illinois law requires private sellers of guns to verify that the buyers' gun permits are valid, but a State Police website for the verification process was not yet working as of New Year's Eve.

The law, in effect on New Year's Day, requires that all private firearm transactions in Illinois must be approved by State Police. Any non-federally licensed firearm dealer who sells or transfers a gun is required to contact ISP and provide the buyer's Firearm Owner's Identification Card number. The State Police will then determine the validity of the FOID card and issue a sale-approval number, which is valid for 30 days.

The seller is allowed to transfer the gun to the buyer after obtaining the approval number and waiting 24 hours for a rifle or shotgun or 72 hours for a handgun.

A sale-approval number can be requested around-the-clock through a page on the ISP website, at http://www.isp.state.il.us/foid/foidp2p.cfm, or during normal business hours by calling 217-524-3847.

State Police said the website and phone number were to be active when the law took effect. But as of New Year's Eve, the web page had a notice that said: ""FOID card status inquiry for private firearm transfer coming soon."" A recording on the phone line advised callers to call back because ""we are experiencing a high call volume.""

Sellers already were required in Illinois to keep records of private gun sales and to check if buyers had FOID cards. But if a buyer's card had been revoked, there was no way for a seller to know that. The new verification system is designed to provide up-to-date information to sellers on the status of buyers' FOID cards.

The overall goal of the law is to reduce crime. But the law's critics, such as Breese gun shop owner Jim Hummert, say criminals aren't too concerned about following laws.

""I think we need to enforce the current laws on the books regarding felons possessing firearms before we try another tax-and-spend idea from Springfield,"" said Hummert, a retired sheriff's detective and police chief.

It's unclear what the penalty will be for failing to check a buyer's FOID status. The law states that failing to do so ""shall not be punishable as a crime or petty offense.""

The law also requires gun owners to notify local police of any lost or stolen guns. The law requires an owner to report the loss within 72 hours of learning that a gun has been lost or stolen. Failure to report a lost or stolen gun is a petty offense for the first violation, and a misdemeanor for subsequent violations.

The dust is only beginning to settle in the wake of oral arguments heard before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 18 in the historic case of Heller v. District of Columbia. The day featured several lively exchanges, as both the justices and the attorneys for the two sides in the case sought to divine the historical context and present-day implications of the Second Amendment.

At issue in the Heller case are the District's tough gun laws, which effectively ban handguns and require those who own long guns (i.e., shotguns and rifles) to keep them unloaded and either trigger-locked or disassembled in the home. The lead Plaintiff in the case, D.C. resident Dick Anthony Heller, has argued that these restrictions preclude his right to self-defense in the home and violate individual rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. In the view of Heller and his attorneys, a firearm that must be kept unloaded and trigger locked is ""non-functional"" and of no use in a home invasion scenario.

Surprisingly, during Tuesday's oral arguments, several of the justices seemed to not only openly side with Heller's argument, but to stake out a stance on the storage of firearms in the home more laissez-faire than that advocated by the standard bearer for the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA).

One fascinating exchange occurred between Walter E. Dellinger III, the attorney arguing the case for the District, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia. Dellinger clarified that long guns in District can be kept either disassembled or trigger locked when stored in the home, and noted that releasing a trigger lock is a simple procedure. Justice Roberts pressed -- exactly how long does it take to disable such a lock? Dellinger, who had tested a lock on a gun he owned, answered ""three seconds.""

That apparently didn't satisfy Justice Scalia, who had envisioned a hypothetical home invasion scenario of ""somebody crawling in your bedroom window."" Addressing Dellinger, Justice Scalia sarcastically stated, ""You turn on the lamp next to your bed so you can -- you can turn the knob at 3-22-95."" Chief Justice Roberts followed with his own quip, which elicited laughter from the crowd: ""you turn on the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses..."" The two justices seemed to be implying that trigger locks eliminate the possibility of a firearm being used for self-defense. More disturbingly, they seemed to suggest that keeping firearms loaded and unsecured in the home was the most prudent storage practice. Also embracing this view was Justice Samuel Alito, who stated that D.C.'s firearm storage provisions could not survive ""under any standard of review.""

A quick look at the NRA""s Gun Safety Rules webpage reveals just how far out of the mainstream these justices are. One of the NRA's ""fundamental"" rules for safe gun handling is ""ALWAYS keep the gun unloaded until ready to use."" The NRA also tells gun owners to always ""store guns so they are not accessible to unauthorized persons,"" noting that ""dozens of gun storage devices, as well as locking devices that attach directly to the gun, are available."" In a ""Parents Guide to Gun Safety,"" the NRA also points out the potential dangers to children, stating ""a parent must, in every case, assess the exposure of the firearm and absolutely ensure that it is inaccessible to a child.""

Dellinger is undoubtedly aware of these dangers. His two grandchildren likely spend more time in his home than armed criminals. It is mystifying that Chief Justice Roberts, who has two young children, is not equally aware of why kids and guns are a bad mix.

The fact is that guns in the home are a far greater threat to one's family and intimates than to any imagined criminals. Living in a home where there are guns increases the risk of homicide by 40 to 170% and the risk of suicide by 90 to 460%. With its handgun ban and proactive safety and storage laws, the District of Columbia, in comparison with the 50 states, enjoys the 17th lowest accidental gun death rate and the second lowest suicide rate. Meanwhile, according to the FBI, firearms were used by private citizens in only 147 justifiable homicides in the U.S. in 2005. The total number of gun homicides that year? 12,352.

D.C.'s gun laws could live or die depending on what the Supreme Court defines as a ""reasonable restriction."" Given the firearm safety recommendations of the gun lobby, and the level of evidence pointing to the risks of having unsecured firearms in the home, it is disingenuous to argue that the city's trigger lock provision is unreasonable.

I would point to the words of Justice Stephen Breyer, who stated during the oral arguments that ""we give...leeway to the city and States to work out what's reasonable in light of their problems."" Or as he later summarized concerning the controversy over trigger locks: ""Do you want thousands of judges all over the United States to be deciding that kind of question rather than the city councils and the legislatures that have decided it in the context of passing laws?""

That question can be answered faster than the few seconds it takes to remove a trigger lock."
huffpo74,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter', 'Jessica Carro', 'Producer', 'The Huffington Post']",2017-03-13 19:02:24-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-silencers-hearing-protection-act_us_58c6b59fe4b0ed71826e1be0,"Gun silencers have been one of the most tightly regulated firearms products in the United States since 1934. Now Congress may eliminate those restrictions, which everybody agrees could mean millions more silencers in the hands of American gun owners.

The debate is whether the benefits of more silencers would outweigh the costs.

Silencers, also called suppressors, are restricted under the National Firearms Act, alongside weaponry like machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. Federal regulations impose a high barrier to purchase: Buyers must pay a $200 transfer fee, submit to fingerprinting and pass a federal background check, a process that can take up to nine months to complete.

Lawmakers say their push to end those requirements and thereby make silencers more easily available is about protecting the hearing of gun owners exposed to high-volume blasts while hunting or target shooting. They are calling their bill the Hearing Protection Act, and it is currently awaiting committee hearings in the House and Senate.

“This legislation is about safety ― plain and simple,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), one of the bill’s sponsors, in a January statement. “I’m very active in sport shooting and hunting, and I can’t tell you how better off the shooting sports enthusiasts would be if we had easier access to suppressors to help protect our hearing.”

A similar bill failed to make it out of committee in 2015, but now that Republicans are in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the measure has a much better chance of passing. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, has put his support behind the effort, saying in an interview with the CEO of manufacturer SilencerCo last fall that the current regulations were “just another rule the government wants to put in place for no reason.”

Advocates for gun violence prevention say the bill is a gift to the firearms industry, because it would massively expand the market for silencers, and to criminals, because it would make it easier to fire a gun undetected.

Silencers are “used to conceal the fact that you are firing a weapon,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “There will be more crimes committed, more people killed” if the current bill passes.

Illustration: HuffPost/Photos: Getty Images “This legislation is about safety -- plain and simple,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan, a sponsor of the Hearing Protection Act.

American engineer Hiram Percy Maxim patented the first silencer in the early 1900s, using technology that he would later apply in developing an automobile muffler. That basic concept hasn’t changed much since. The cylindrical device screws on to the barrel of a gun. Chambers within the silencer allow gases to dissipate and cool after escaping from the muzzle, which damps sound emissions.

Initial suppressor models were reportedly unpopular and controversial. Fearing they could encourage crime, states began cracking down on their use. The federal government placed them on a list of regulated devices under the National Firearms Act during the Great Depression, amid concerns that people might use them to avoid detection while illegally hunting for food.

Suppressor technology made substantial leaps in the Vietnam War era, thanks to a former CIA dark-ops contractor named Mitch WerBell. His silencers were more compact and effective than their predecessors. They attracted the attention of U.S. military and intelligence agencies, which reportedly began using them to carry out targeted killings. WerBell became known in some gun enthusiast circles as the “Wizard of Whispering Death.”

Most people today probably envision silencers based on their Hollywood depiction: An assassin fits the attachment to the end of his weapon, which he then fires with a muffled “pew” instead of a bang.

Silencer manufacturers emphasize this is an inaccurate representation. Depending on the weapon, unsuppressed gunfire typically ranges between 140 and 160 decibels ― volumes that can rupture eardrums and cause permanent hearing loss. Silencers make shooting quieter, but they don’t make it quiet, said Jason Schauble, chief revenue officer at Utah-based SilencerCo.

“Suppressors are really about taking shooting noise below 140 decibels, which is the OSHA hearing-safe level,” Schauble said. “Many suppressors end up around 130 or 120 decibels, so around the volume of a car door slamming.”

At the level, more hunters would likely choose to shoot without ear protection, making it easier for them to hear animals or have conversations with companions. Lowering the sound of gunfire would also reduce hearing hazards related to sport shooting and lessen noise pollution around shooting ranges.

Here’s a demonstration from SilencerCo:

Not everyone is convinced that shooting-related hearing loss is a problem that needs another solution.

“You already have the answer,” said Kris Brown, chief strategy officer at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “There are things available on the market to protect hearing.”

The people who want to make silencers more easily available point to a range of other tactical benefits. Silencers decrease a weapon’s recoil and improve its accuracy, the American Suppressor Association says on its website. This lets shooters fire in rapid succession without losing track of the target, as silencer manufacturers note. Suppressors also reduce muzzle flash, allowing shooters to better disguise their location in low-light settings.

Although supporters of silencers tout these latter advantages in terms of sport shooting, the same characteristics might also appeal to a mass shooter or other criminal.

“There could be some instance where somebody uses it for nefarious purposes,” said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police. “They don’t want a loud report or a muzzle flash or a blast ― say a sniper or someone trying to shoot at police officers or other people from a distance ― and they want to suppress that noise.”

The National Association of Chiefs of Police has not taken an official position on the bill.

Not Popular With Criminals ― Yet

About 1.3 million silencers are currently registered in the U.S., the Justice Department said in February, which is nearly 400,000 more than in 2015. Buyers have to go through the federal registration process to purchase them in the 42 states where they are legal.

Some data suggest that silencers are rarely used in crimes. Over the past decade, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has referred very few silencer-related cases for prosecution, according to a white paper proposal written by the ATF’s second highest-ranking official in January.

“Silencers are very rarely used in criminal shootings,” states the paper, which The Washington Post obtained last month. “Given the lack of criminality associated with silencers, it is reasonable to conclude that they should not be viewed as a threat to public safety.”

Rinchich noted that in his four decades in law enforcement, he doesn’t recall ever finding a gun used in a crime with a silencer.

Gun control advocates argue those statistics are proof of the effectiveness of existing regulations, not a reason to undo them. They point to a handful of known crimes committed with silencers to show there is at least some risk of criminal behavior.

Jim Urquhart/Reuters SilencerCo CEO Joshua Waldron fires a rifle with a suppressor in West Valley City, Utah, on Feb. 23, 2016.

But gun lobbyists argue that suppressors will never be a natural choice for criminals.

“The majority of firearms used in crimes are small, concealable handguns,” said Knox Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association. “Folks want to be able to put something in a pocket or hide it in a waistband. When you add a suppressor to that, you’re generally adding 6 to 8 inches to the length of a gun.”

On top of being unwieldy, silencers are also expensive, ranging from a few hundred to more than a thousand dollars depending on the category of firearm and type of suppressor.

“People don’t buy a thousand-dollar thing to add to another thousand-dollar thing so they have a really nice gun-and-silencer combination to commit crime,” Schauble said.

If silencers become more easily available, however, supporters admit that the current low levels of related criminal activity could rise.

“There are always going to be a couple people who misuse any tool contrary to its intended use, whether it be sound suppressors, whether it be firearms, whether it be motor vehicles,” Schauble said. “It’s an emotional issue, and like most issues that are emotional, it’s emotional because no one really knows what will happen.”

Silencers could also prove problematic for gunshot detectors, which use decibel levels to identify the sound of firearms. And that troubles some law enforcement officials.

“Cities all over the country have invested a lot of money in gunshot detectors because people shooting firearms in a community is a problem, and it allows the police to know that’s taken place and to respond even if nobody’s called,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.

Dreaming Of A Business Boom

With an estimated 300 million firearms in civilian hands in the U.S., silencer manufacturers see huge potential for their product. Even under the current restrictions, suppressors have grown more popular over the last several years.

SilencerCo’s business has increased 600 percent since 2014, with more than 100,000 sales last year, almost all to civilians, according to Schauble. He believes that with deregulation, the market could expand as much as tenfold, leading to the sale of more than a million silencers each year. After all, some 299 million guns don’t have silencers yet.

Lawmakers who oppose the bill say that is the real push behind the legislation. “The gun industry is faced with a declining number of Americans that are buying guns, so they have to target more weapons and more expensive weapons to that smaller number of Americans,” said Murphy.

That would fit a longstanding pattern of the gun lobby dismissing potential public safety consequences in its campaign to loosen gun laws, critics contend. Last month, congressional Republicans voted to repeal a measure that had blocked some Social Security disability insurance recipients from purchasing firearms. GOP lawmakers called it an undue infringement upon the rights of Americans with disabilities, but supporters said the rule was necessary to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill individuals. In recent years, state and federal lawmakers have also offered a number of proposals to roll back permitting and training requirements for those who want carry guns.

“It’s a continual process of making guns ubiquitous in America,” said Stephens."

That's right, tennis balls are deemed too dangerous to be allowed into the 1.7-mile event space surrounding the RNC. Not only that, but you have to leave your air rifles, water guns, umbrella, shovels, glass bottles, light bulbs and hammers at home. But if you want to bring your fully loaded AR-15 assault rifle, please, feel free.

Welcome to Ohio, where like in the majority of states, it is legal for an individual to openly carry a loaded firearm in a public place without a permit (2). Welcome to Cleveland, home of the RNC, where the head the city's largest police union is concerned to a point where he asked Ohio Governor John Kasich to temporarily tighten the state's gun laws via executive action. Kasich claimed that he did not have the power to ""arbitrarily suspend state or federal constitutional rights or state laws"" (3).

Hard to believe that a Governor can't temporarily issue an order to protect the public, especially when it would prohibit military-style weapons being carried into large public events attended by Presidential candidates. But that is not the primary problem. The issue is that no prohibition exists in the first place. The issue is that a state refuses to act and prevent open carry making it difficult for law enforcement officers, whose job it is to protect their community. It undermines the ability for an officer to do their job, because how are they supposed to determine who is a ""good person with a gun,"" and who is a criminal or terrorist with a gun? And as we know all too well, fear drives impulse decisions, and more guns result in more fear and more gun violence. This is abundantly clear when compared to states with common-sense gun violence prevention laws that restrict open and concealed firearm carry, that all have relatively low firearm fatality rates.

It is also legal to openly carry a firearm in Texas and Louisiana, where both states have recently seen tragedies affect their law enforcement officers. Texas law allows for open carry of rifles, but the display of a firearm in a public place in a ""manner calculated to alarm"" is prohibited (4). Objectively, a gun in a manner calculated to alarm seemingly means it is about to be used, and at that point hope of peaceful resolution is effectively lost. By this virtue, the open carry law represents inherent danger and subsequent violence, not protection.

The recent tragedies in Dallas and Baton Rouge highlight the misguided belief that open carry laws create a safer environment. At the Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas, police officers were out-armed not only by a sniper with the intent to kill police, but also by protestors who came equipped with AR-15's and bulletproof vests (5). As the initial shots began, law enforcement wrongfully, but blamelessly, suspected them to be the perpetrators of the violence (5). In the end, credit is due to the Dallas Police department that there were not more casualties due to the confusion created by the public openly carrying firearms.

In Louisiana, the murder of three police officers magnifies the scope of trepidation caused by heightened racial tensions. Access to military style assault rifles and the ability to openly carry one, augments that scope and adds deadly consequences. Gavin Long, the gunman, bypassed civilians as he hunted down law enforcement officers in a targeted attack (6). Were police officers supposed to know beforehand that this was a bad guy with a gun whose sole intent was to kill them? Was the gunman holding his weapon in ""a manner calculated to alarm""? Even still, this subjective measure of ""prohibition"" could be disregarded because it is not included in the Louisiana open carry law (7).

This brings us back to the divisive rhetoric surrounding the Republican National Convention and the consequent lowered sense of security and public safety. It is a scene where organizations like Citizens for Trump and Black Lives Matter have been marching and protesting simultaneously (3). A number of groups have explicitly announced their plans to exploit Cleveland's lenient gun laws and come armed with military-style assault rifles, because it is their right to do so in Ohio (8).

Dallas and Louisiana show the perils of this senseless law, now Cleveland and America are on edge because of it.

It is time to abolish the notion that the ability to openly carry a firearm makes our nation safer.

The recording star, whose legal name is Artis Leon Ivey, 53, could be sentenced to as much as three years in state prison if convicted, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement.

Prosecutors said it was illegal for the performer to carry a gun because of two prior felony convictions - in 2001 for carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle and in 2009 for possession of cocaine base.

Kai Pfaffenbach / Reuters Coolio, whose legal name is Artis Leon Ivey, could be sentenced to as much as three years in state prison if convicted on weapons charges.

The rap artist was scheduled to appear in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday for an arraignment, but the hearing was postponed until Oct. 26 after his lawyer told the judge that Coolio was out of state performing, district attorney spokesman Ricardo Santiago said.

Santiago said a warrant for Coolio’s arrest would be issued if he failed to appear for the later court date.

The rapper’s lawyer, Michael Aisen, declined to comment on the case.

Coolio, a Los Angeles-area native, is perhaps best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit “Gangsta’s Paradise,” the No. 1 U.S. chart-topper that year and one of the best-selling singles of all time.

According to Los Angeles police who arrested Coolio at the airport, a stolen, loaded pistol was discovered in the rapper’s backpack on the X-ray screening belt as his entourage was going through security to board a flight en route to a concert.

Another member of the entourage initially claimed ownership of the bag, but evidence in the backpack directed police to Coolio, who by then had boarded the plane, and police removed him from the aircraft, police spokesman Rob Pedregon said.

Pedregon said Coolio acknowledged under questioning that the bag and the gun were his, but said little else after he was taken into custody."

“Why am I giving away an AR-15 rifle? It’s just one way to thank you for defeating Obama’s anti-gun agenda this year,” said an email from Stockman's campaign arm. “But the battle for the right to keep and bear arms is heating up again. President Obama and Sen. Harry Reid [D-Nev.] are not happy that they didn’t pass any gun control yet, so they’re coming back for more.”

In order to draw pro-gun supporters to his campaign, Stockman will give away the free rifle on July 4, according to The Daily Caller.

“I hope you realize that the only reason Obama has not been able to ban semi-autos, magazines and gun shows is because of your activism,” the email continues. The message also refers to the Bushmaster as ""the firearm that Obama most wants to ban,"" and includes a video of an intern shooting the rifle, which can be seen above. The firearm has emerged as particularly controversial in the wake of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. last year, in which the shooter used a Bushmaster to gun down 26 people.

Authorities say the man originally entered the Kroger unarmed before returning to his car, getting the weapon, and re-entering the store, according to WVIR. The man was reportedly only in the store with the AR-15 ""briefly"" before making his exit.

After witnesses and store employees called 911, police arrived and questioned the man, the station reports.

But because the man legally owned the rifle and it was in plain view, he didn't actually break any laws, Charlottesville Police Lt. Ronnie Roberts said, according to The Daily Progress.

As to why the man brought a loaded assault rifle into a grocery store?

""It was most likely a demonstration of his Second Amendment rights,"" Roberts told The Daily Progress.

Virginia law allows gun owners to openly carry their weapons, but a permit must be obtained to carry a concealed gun, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

The AR-15 semi-automatic rifle is a lightweight, military-style weapon that can hold magazines of up to 100 bullets. It can fire more than 120 rounds a minute, depending on how fast its user pulls the trigger. More than three million Americans own an AR-15, according to CBS News.

The AR-15 has been used in several recent mass shootings in the United States, perhaps most notably by Adam Lanza, who killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14.

James Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 at a Colorado movie theater on July 20, also allegedly used an AR-15.

In an obviously staged video posted on Tuesday, the dancers, known professionally as Mary Jane Watson and Miss Pepper Pots, offer a potential “customer” couch dances for $15 or an AR-15 rifle for $1,100.

The young man, standing in front of the table the two women set up outside the club where they perform, asks if the gun sale is even legal.

Watson explains that, yes, yes it is.

“We can do a private firearms transfer,” she says.

Pots adds that they don’t need to see I.D. or do a background check on the man.

“You just give us $1,100 in cash and we give you the gun,” she says.

The customer acts shocked at how easy it is to get the gun ― the same type of weapon used in the Feb. 14 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 students and staff members ― and Watson agrees.

“That’s just how loose the privatized gun transfer law is in Tennessee,” she said. (State law does prohibit a person from “knowingly” selling a gun to someone “prohibited by state or federal law from owning, possessing or purchasing” a firearm.)

The man then asks about the couch dance option, and Watson and Pots detail the legal hoops they have to jump through to become exotic dancers.

“First of all, we have to get a background check,” Watson says.

“Then we have to go get our fingerprints done,” Pots adds.

Dancers in Tennessee are also required to supply two recent passport photos to the State’s Sexually Oriented Business Licensing Board. along with other paperwork, and then wait through a two-week background check period.

“And only then are we deemed safe to give you a [fully clothed] couch dance,” Watson says.

Watson and Pots don’t actually sell the AR-15 in the video, which was made to protest what they and their employer, Deja Vu Showgirls, deem to be excessive regulation of their business.

The video has been viewed on Facebook by less than 900 people as of Wednesday afternoon, but one of those was Joe Carr, a former Republican member of the Tennessee House who’s now running for the state Senate.

He’s not happy.

Andy Holt (R) said he plans to give away two AR-15 rifles -- the same kind of weapon used in the massacre -- as a ""door prize"" at an upcoming political fundraiser.

Holt, a self-described conservative Christian, had announced last week that he would give away one AR-15 at ""Hogfest,"" a barbeque fundraiser on his farm that has a petting zoo and hay rides. But when reporters asked him after the Orlando, Florida, shooting on Sunday whether he still planned to give away the assault weapon, he told reporters that he now wants to give away two instead of one.

""I'm furious that I get phone calls from the media asking me if I'm still going to give away an AR-15 at our HogFest, rather than asking me how many extra firearms I'll be handing out to ensure people can protect themselves,"" Holt wrote in a Facebook post on Monday. ""After all, it was a bullet that stopped the terrorist. Amazing how so many seem to miss that fact.""

Holt went on to write that people ""should not focus on the gun itself"" but instead on ""the depravity of the heart of the person who's pulling the trigger."" He encouraged people to buy more guns to protect themselves.

""I want you to arm yourselves and learn to shoot with deadly accuracy should the need arise,"" he wrote. ""Protect your family. Protect yourselves. Protect your friends. Our government has made it quite clear that it is incapable of doing so. At the end of the day, it's your responsibility anyways.""

Early Sunday morning, a shooter armed with a 9mm handgun and a .223 caliber AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle stormed into Pulse, a popular gay nightclub in Orlando. He began firing, killing 49 people and injuring 53. The gunman, Omar Mateen, passed a full background check and purchased the firearms legally the week of the shooting, despite the fact that he had a history of domestic violence and was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2013 for possible ties to terrorism.

While an armed security guard was present at the nightclub and traded fire with Mateen, the guard was not able to stop the massacre before police arrived.

The massacre has already reignited a debate about guns in Washington. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton renewed her call to limit the purchases of certain assault weapons.

“Some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism,” Clinton told a crowd in Cleveland Monday. “In Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons, the AR-15, and they used it to kill Americans. That was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in Sandy Hook. We have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war, and that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack. But it will stop some and it will save lives.”

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, echoed Holt's sentiment and called for more ""guns on the other side"" in a CNN interview Monday morning."
huffpo85,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-03-01 20:32:07-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/assault-rifle-deaths-ar-15_us_5a96de5ae4b0e6a52304248a,"The school shooting last month in Parkland, Florida, has sparked another passionate debate about the dangers of assault-style rifles, such as the AR-15 used to kill 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The conversation has understandably run high on emotions, but it has also lacked a concrete answer to a question at the core of this issue: How frequently are these weapons actually used in fatal shootings around the U.S.?

Supporters of gun reform believe it’s far too easy to get these semiautomatic rifles, which can be equipped with magazines that hold 30 rounds or more and have been used to quickly inflict mass casualties in numerous horrific shootings over the past few years. They argue that these worst-case scenarios are reason enough to restrict access to this sort of weaponry.

But defenders of assault-style rifles note that these firearms appear only rarely in the more than 11,000 firearm homicides around the U.S. each year. The overwhelming majority involve handguns, according to federal data and other counts, including one done by this reporter in 2016. Because of that fact, gun enthusiasts argue that banning assault-style weapons would do very little to drive down overall levels of gun violence while unfairly targeting the millions of people who use them legally.

That may be a fair argument considering the available evidence. But a closer look at the most commonly cited data reveals serious deficiencies that make it impossible to determine exactly how many people are killed each year with assault-style rifles ― or with any kind of firearm, for that matter. By relying on this system, we’re almost certainly undercounting these types of deaths, though by how much is unclear.

Right now, our best idea of total slayings by assault-style rifles comes from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, which compiles general crime statistics from police departments across the country. Individual law enforcement agencies typically report their UCR data to state authorities, who pass them to the feds. Many departments also provide supplementary homicide reports, which offer additional information about the crimes, including the type of firearm used.

But reporting to UCR is voluntary, as are the supplementary homicide reports. Although the FBI says 18,000 law enforcement agencies participate in the UCR program, many agencies do not. Some departments contribute to UCR but don’t provide the additional homicide data.

The process is imperfect even among agencies that do provide this supplementary data. For one, police can’t give details on homicide cases until they have officially declared them to be homicides. That process can take take months or longer, which can lead to a lag in the data. Some agencies may also provide supplementary homicide reports only to have the FBI exclude them because they don’t meet federal guidelines.

As a result of these gaps, the FBI’s baseline numbers on overall gun homicides often end up being inaccurate. The FBI recorded 9,778 murders by firearm in 2015, compared with the 12,979 ultimately tallied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 2016, the FBI recorded 11,004 gun homicides. Cases from Florida and Alabama were not included, according to annual supplementary homicide data provided to HuffPost, omissions an FBI spokesperson attributed to state reporting practices and data that didn’t meet federal guidelines. The CDC hasn’t released its final count for 2016, but if previous years are any indicator, its number may end up being substantially higher.

Matters only get more complicated when trying to determine the nature of each gun death in this limited set. According to FBI data, there were 7,105 homicides by handgun in 2016, about 65 percent of the total, alongside 374 homicides by rifle, just over 3 percent of the total. Although there are plenty of rifles that aren’t assault-style, AR-15s and other similar weapons have become the most popular firearms in this category, according to the gun industry.

But even here, there are glaring holes in the data.

The type of weapon is not specified in 3,077 of the FBI’s 11,004 gun homicide cases, about 28 percent of the total. There are likely a few reasons for this ambiguity. Many of these cases haven’t been solved when police fill out supplementary homicide reports, meaning they may not know what kind of gun was used. Some departments may also document cases generally as gun homicides, without providing additional details on the type of firearm.

There’s not necessarily any reason to believe there are a huge number of rifle homicides hiding in this category, but if the breakdown is similar to those cases in which the weapon has been identified, it would account for about 100 additional homicides by rifle. We’ll probably never get a definitive answer as to the nature of these cases, because police departments don’t typically go back and adjust supplementary homicide reports when more information comes to light.

The FBI’s data on rifle homicides also come up short in other ways. By excluding reports from Florida, its 2016 figure doesn’t include the 49 people killed in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, for example. The gunman in that incident used an assault-style rifle modeled off the AR-15.

Nor does it include any of the 848 gun homicides that Florida agencies reported to the state’s Department of Law Enforcement in 2016. Among those were 405 cases that involved handguns and 443 homicides that involved “other firearms,” a broad category that includes rifles, shotguns and other firearms that weren’t specifically identified. A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for more detailed data.

MICHELE EVE SANDBERG/AFP via Getty Images Two days after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a vendor sets up his display of AR-15 assault-style rifles for the South Florida Gun Show in Miami.

There were an additional 396 homicides in Alabama in 2016, none of which are included in the FBI’s data. Although handguns were used in 64 percent of those cases, 4 percent involved rifles, shotguns or “other firearms,” according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Again, this imprecise itemization offers little insight into exactly how many of these cases involved rifles, let alone assault-style rifles.

After all of this, what we’re left with is only a vague understanding of the problem we’re hoping to solve. It’s safe to say that handguns, not rifles, are used in the vast majority of fatal shootings ― a reminder that any comprehensive gun violence prevention policy must not focus exclusively on assault-style weapons. And regardless of how frequently AR-15s and other similar firearms are used in routine gun violence, it’s also increasingly clear that just one of these weapons can cause immense harm in the wrong hands.

But with no solid accounting of how many gun deaths these assault-style rifles are currently responsible for, we can’t establish a benchmark to determine the true scope of the problem and see if it’s becoming more or less pronounced over time."

During orientation of our Summer Immersion Program, I sat across from six brave students as we discussed issues of injustice in America and a young woman asked me what I would do if Trump won; and I didn't really answer her question. My honest thought was that I would buy a gun because I need to protect my wife and child from whatever violence this ignorant windbag catalyzes with his hate-laden speeches masquerading as a legitimate political platform.

Now what does my reaction say about me? It says I believe at some level that I actually can protect ""us"" from ""them"". That somehow the powerlessness that I feel will be alleviated by a barrel, ammunition and my willingness to pull the trigger. And that's simply not true.

A gun won't save me from feeling like a target. Instead it takes the dehumanization I feel every day and twists it into empowerment that isn't real.

So where does that leave me?

How did love your enemy turn into shoot them if they threaten you? How did bless those who persecute you turn into God bless me and no one else? How can the same Jesus who went to the Cross be used as fuel to execute gross injustice against those in power? I have internalized my fear and now turn my intimidation outward towards those who would dare come against me. How ignorant and misguided I have allowed myself to become.

Somehow instead of leaning into Him I want to get an AR-15. That if I don't take up arms against Trump, I've somehow let my wife and daughter down. Love my neighbor turned into shoot them if I have to because gunshots will dispel the potential hatred coming toward us. Somehow my new conceal and carry permit turns me into a person made into image of God and that police officer, stranger or neighbor needing a cup of sugar just might not be.

I lay in bed with my pregnant wife beside me trying be like Jesus, without thinking I am the Messiah. And that is profoundly difficult because this world desperately needs a savior. Praise God that He already sent one and His name is not me. So I can go to sleep knowing He holds everything together, He is Our Sword and Shield and I am no coward for putting my trust in His love. For it drives out all my fears and His hope will not disappoint us."

FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave also told reporters that Alexis only had the shotgun -- not an assault rifle, as many news outlets reported -- when he walked into Building 197 at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday morning. But it may not be the only gun he used.

""We have no information that he had an AR-15 assault rifle in his possession,"" she said at a press conference. ""He may have gained access to a handgun ... after he began shooting.""

An initial investigation indicates that Alexis bought a Remington 870 shotgun at a Lorton, Va., gun shop last week, according to the Wall Street Journal. State law in Virginia allows for an individual to buy rifles or shotguns even if that person is not a state resident.

The Glock handgun found on his person after Monday's shooting rampage was likely picked up from a victim, authorities told the Washington Times.

There's still plenty of room for debate about whether Alexis should have been prohibited from making a legal gun purchase, given his criminal history. In May 2004, he was arrested in Seattle for firing three shots into two rear tires of a Honda. At the time, Alexis claimed he had an ""anger-fueled blackout"" and could not remember the shooting. Still, he did not commit any felonies that would bar him from making a gun purchase.

In 2010, Alexis was charged with a misdemeanor in connection to a shooting at his apartment complex in Fort Worth, Texas. A resident reported that Alexis, who lived below her, shot at her through the floor.

The WSJ also notes his mental health history. Although Alexis recently sought mental health treatment through the Veteran's Administration, a court must decide whether someone is ""mentally unfit"" to own a gun under federal law.

The ballistics investigation at Building 197 is still fluid, so it remains unclear how many or which guns Alexis used in the shooting."

Seeing the video and images of dead or helpless Syrian civilians struggling for life reminds me of another terrible weapon of war -- depleted uranium.

It is no secret that the U.S., with the assistance of other governments, used depleted uranium in the Gulf and Iraq War. A simple Google search of this topic can produce dozens and dozens of credible reports or stories to confirm these war crimes. For example, an important report on Harvard University's website discusses the fallout of depleted uranium contamination in Iraq. Dr. Souad N. Al-Azzawi, who authored the report after the Gulf War, wrote that:

""Depleted Uranium (DU) weaponry has been used against Iraq for the first time in the history of recent wars. The magnitude of the complications and damage related to the use of such radioactive and toxic weapons on the environment and the human population mostly results from the intended concealment, denial and misleading information released by the Pentagon about the quantities, characteristics and the area's in Iraq, in which these weapons have been used.""

Similarly, as Democracy Now! reported in an interview with Al Jazeera reporter Dahr Jamail, ""the U.S. invasion of Iraq has left behind a legacy of cancer and birth defects suspected of being caused by the U.S. military's extensive use of depleted uranium and white phosphorus."" Democracy Now! wrote:

""Noting the birth defects in the Iraqi city of Fallujah, Jamail says: 'They're extremely hard to bear witness to. But it's something that we all need to pay attention to ... What this has generated is, from 2004 up to this day, we are seeing a rate of congenital malformations in the city of Fallujah that has surpassed even that in the wake of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that nuclear bombs were d' pped on at the end of World War II.'""

Moreover, Robert Koehler, a HuffPost blogger, has written extensively about the U.S. government's use of depleted uranium in Iraq. The following passage from Koehler's blog ""The Suffering of Fallujah"" gives us an idea of the immense impact that depleted uranium has had on Iraqi civilians:

""Thus last November, a group of British and Iraqi doctors petitioned the U.N. to investigate the alarming rise in birth defects at Fallujah's hospitals. 'Young women in Fallujah,' they wrote ... are terrified of having children because of the increasing number of babies born grotesquely deformed, with no heads, two heads, a single eye in their foreheads, scaly bodies or missing limbs. In addition, young children in Fallujah are now experiencing hideous cancers and leukemias.'""

Koehler continues:

""The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health has just published an epidemiological study, ""Cancer, Infant Mortality and Birth Sex-Ratio in Fallujah, Iraq 2005-2009,"" which has found, among much else, that Fallujah is experiencing higher rates of cancer, leukemia and infant mortality than Hiroshima and Nagasaki did in 1945.""

Although Iraqi civilians have born the brunt of this awful weapon, American soldiers that served in the Gulf and Iraq War are also suffering from the fallout of depleted uranium. This issue is discussed in-depth by the Campaign Against Depleted Uranium, which campaigns to ""ban on the use of uranium in all conventional weapons and weapon systems and for monitoring, health care, compensation and environmental remediation for communities affected by their use.""

Countries around the world have called for the ban of depleted uranium, but unfortunately this demand has fallen on deaf ears. When asked in 2003 about Iraq's complaints about depleted uranium shells, Colonel James Naughton of U.S. Army Material Command stated in a Pentagon briefing that ""They want it to go away because we kicked the crap out of the them.""

Last week, UK foreign secretary William Hague, said that the use of chemical weapons in Syria is ""not something that a humane or civilized world can ignore."" Ironically, Western countries such as the UK and their allies have appeared to ignore the use of weapons that are equally vicious.

When ""non-Westerners"" make use of weapons of mass destruction, there is outrage and calls for military intervention from ""the West,"" but when ""Westerners"" themselves use them, it is totally permissible, and the world can hardly react."

How does a weapon go from one of the most feared to being banned? And what happens once the weapon is finally banned?

With tensions increasing between various nuclear-armed countries, and with the potential for a new arms race of lethal autonomous weapons, these questions seem more timely than ever. For answers, I turned to security and disarmament experts Miriam Struyk, programs director at PAX, and Richard Moyes, managing director of Article 36, both of whom have participated in efforts to ban landmines, cluster munitions, nuclear weapons and autonomous weapons.

The following interview has been heavily edited for brevity, but you can listen to it in its entirety here.

The United Nations is about to complete negotiations that are expected to result in an international ban on nuclear weapons as early as July 7. Why is this ban important, even if nuclear weapons states don’t sign?

Moyes: The use of a single nuclear weapon would potentially kill hundreds of thousands of people. The use of multiple nuclear weapons could have devastating impacts for society and the environment as a whole. These weapons should be illegal because their effects cannot be contained or managed in a way that avoids massive suffering. By changing that legal background, we’re potentially in position to put much more pressure on [the nuclear] states to move towards disarmament as a long-term agenda.

Struyk: For too long nuclear weapons were mythical, symbolic weapons, but we never spoke about what these weapons actually do and whether we think that’s illegal. This treaty brings back the notion of what do these weapons do and do we want that? It also brings democratization of security policy. This process was brought about by several states, by NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] and other actors. It’s so important that it’s actually citizens speaking about nukes and whether we think they’re acceptable or not.

These weapons should be illegal because their effects cannot be contained or managed in a way that avoids massive suffering. Richard Moyes

What is an autonomous weapon system and why are you worried about them?

Moyes: Autonomous weapons are really an issue of the challenges that new and emerging technologies present to society, particularly when they’re emerging in the military sphere — a sphere which is essentially about how we’re allowed to kill each other or how we’re allowed to use technologies to kill each other. Autonomous weapons are a movement in technology to a point where we will see computers and machines making decisions about where to apply force, about what objects to destroy, or about who to kill.

One of the ways we’ve sought to orientate to this is by thinking about the concept of meaningful human control. What are the human elements that we feel are important to retain? We are going to see more and more autonomy within military operations. But in certain critical functions around how targets are identified and how force is applied and over what period of time — those are areas where we will potentially see an erosion of a level of human, essentially moral, engagement that is fundamentally important to retain.

Autonomous weapons are a movement in technology to a point where we will see computers and machines making decisions about where to apply force, about what objects to destroy, or about who to kill. Richard Moyes

Struyk: It depends a lot on your definition of course. I’m still, in a way, a bit of an optimist by saying that perhaps we can prevent the emergence of lethal autonomous weapon systems. But I also see some similarities between lethal autonomous weapons systems and what we had with nuclear weapons a few decades ago — this can lead to an arms race, to more global insecurity, and also to warfare.

An argument in favor of autonomous weapons is that they can ideally make decisions better than humans and potentially reduce civilian casualties. How do you address that argument?

Struyk: We’ve had that debate with other weapon systems, as well, where the technological possibilities were not what they were promised to be as soon as they were used.

It’s an unfair debate because it’s mainly from states with developed industries who are most likely the ones using some form of lethal autonomous weapons systems first. Flip the question and say, ‘what if these systems will be used against your soldiers or in your country?’ Suddenly you enter a whole different debate. I’m highly skeptical of people who say it could actually be beneficial.

What if these systems will be used against your soldiers or in your country? Suddenly you enter a whole different debate. Miriam Struyk

Moyes: I feel like there are assertions of “goodies” and “baddies” and our ability to label one from the other. To categorize people and things in society in such an accurate way is somewhat illusory and something of a misunderstanding of the reality of conflict.

Any claims that we can somehow perfect violence in a way where it can be distributed by machinery to those who deserve to receive it and that there’s no tension or moral hazard in that — that is extremely dangerous as an underpinning concept because, in the end, we’re talking about embedding categorizations of people and things within a micro-bureaucracy of algorithms and labels.

Violence in society is a human problem, and it needs to continue to be messy to some extent if we’re going to recognize it as a problem.

Violence in society is a human problem, and it needs to continue to be messy to some extent if we’re going to recognize it as a problem. Richard Moyes

What is the process right now for getting lethal autonomous weapons systems banned?

Struyk: We started the international Campaign to Stop Killer Robots in 2013 — it immediately gave a push to the international discussion, including the one on the Human Rights Council and within the [Convention on] Conventional Weapons (CCW) in Geneva. We saw a lot of debates there in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the last one was in April.

Unfortunately, we’re in a bit of a silence mode right now. But that doesn’t mean there’s no progress. We have 19 states who called for a ban, and more than 70 states within the CCW framework discussing this issue. We know from other treaties that you need these kind of building blocks.

Handing more and more violence over to such processes does not augur well for our societal development. Richard Moyes

What is most important for people to understand about nuclear and autonomous weapon systems?

Struyk: Both systems go way beyond the discussion about weapons systems: it’s about what kind of world and society do we want to live in. None of these — not killer robots, not nuclear weapons — are an answer to any of the threats that we face right now, be it climate change, be it terrorism. It’s not an answer. It’s only adding more fuel to an already dangerous world.

Moyes: Nuclear weapons — they’ve somehow become a very abstract, rather distant issue. Simple recognition of the scale of humanitarian harm from a nuclear weapon is the most substantial thing — hundreds of thousands killed and injured. [Leaders of nuclear states are] essentially talking about incinerating hundreds of thousands of normal people — probably in a foreign country — but recognizable, normal people. The idea that that can be approached in some ways glibly or confidently at all is I think very disturbing. And expecting that at no point will something go wrong — I think it’s a complete illusion."

It is also about prestige, and it is also about respect, both of which Iran believes it is entitled to, and neither of which it feels it sufficiently has.

Remember that Iranians are the inheritors of the great Persian civilization, of cultural treasures such as famed Persian poetry and paintings, jaw-dropping architectural feats and, today, thirteen UNESCO World Heritage sites. From the dynasties of Achaemenid (550 BC) to Safayid (1722 AD), Persian empires once stretched from the Indus River to the Mediterranean Sea.

Fast forward nearly a millennium, and the descendents of this once mighty empire find their nation listed on the ""Axis of Evil"" by the world's most powerful country, which then proceeds to invade and occupy a neighboring country, also on that Axis. Remember also that this same invading country, not half a century before, had overthrown Iranians' democratically elected leader and replaced him with an unpopular monarch whose repressive regime sowed the seeds for the eventual takeover of power by an oligarchy of different, yet arguably no less ruthless, despots.

To develop a nuclear weapon requires a country's smartest scientists and a chunk of its wealth. The five Permanent Members of the Security Council have them, in droves. What greater demonstration of a country's resources, both human and capital, than the development of a nuclear weapon? If the world won't give Iran the respect its Persian forbears merit, then they will solicit the respect by other means, seemingly, necessary.

Nuclear weapon-yielding countries have tried -- and continue to try -- to persuade Iran to relinquish its nuclear capabilities by promising that they would enrich uranium for them. This solution, of course, is premised on the acceptance of Iran's dubious claim that it seeks nuclear power only. It is also premised on Iran's faith in promises made by countries that have overthrown their regime in the past, and which are possibly plotting similarly, if less overtly, today.

It does not help, of course, for Iran's president to find it domestically useful to lambast against the West's staunchest ally in the region and calling for its destruction, however vaguely veiled the rhetoric, or its translation, may be. It is certain, no matter how shocking or unbelievable this may seem to war-weary Israelis, that the Israel element is not a driving motivator in Iran's nuclear weapon program. It's just a handy distraction.

Quasi-red herrings such as the Iranian nuclear energy program, or Israel's nuclear weapons capability, prevent us from finding a solution to this impasse, since they obfuscate the core objectives of Iran's program: respect and prestige, from which influence and prosperity flow.

It is a dastardly shame, a mark of our collective embarrassment that, over 60 years since the destruction of Hiroshima, and nearly 40 years since countries agreed, by law, to eliminate them, nuclear weapons are still perceived as the best guarantor of respect, prestige and influence. This is the fault of the only five legal nuclear weapon possessors, whose membership in the closed nuclear club is the only consistent commonality behind their shared, coveted permanent seats on the Security Council.

With full, cognizant recognition that nuclear weapons are genocidal, ecocidal and, to a high degree, suicidal, it is time that world leaders heed the desperate calls from their populaces and find another, more modern and useful source of national prestige and respect.

It is possible that such 21st century leadership will not emanate from the same corners of the world that led the 20th century down such a horrifically self-destructive course. The countries that lead the way in renewable energy systems, in innovative education and technology, will express the insights, priorities and values that will earn it the respect of peoples the world over.

Nearly ten years of political posturing, both within Iran and without, over the Iranian nuclear weapon issue, have layered the issue with a multitude of complicating factors. For Iran to give up its program now would result in the exact opposite of its primary goal; Iran's ""capitulation"" to the West would amount to losing face, not garnering respect.

The onus is perhaps on the peace-loving, forward-looking, globalized youth, whose own values and behaviors are free, in ways unprecedented from past generations, from provincial dictates and norms, enabled by, of course, the much-heralded new arsenal of social media tools. The Twitter revolutionaries of Egypt and Tunisia found global respect and admiration, not from their wielding 1950s technology or their savvy use of force. Until the leaders of all countries learn that respect and power no longer stem from the antiquated vectors of yesteryear, we may continue to ignore the true impetus of Iran's nuclear program, at our collective peril."

New Hampshire already permitted open carry, but local law enforcement long had discretion to deny individuals a license to carry a concealed weapon. The system, in place for 94 years, let police prevent people who they knew had a violent history from getting license.

On Wednesday, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) signed a law that simply allows residents to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Similar legislation had been twice vetoed by former Gov. Maggie Hassan (D).

“SB12 ensures New Hampshire citizens are guaranteed the fundamental right to carry a firearm in defense of themselves and their families, as prescribed by Article 2a of our state constitution,” Sununu said in a statement. “This common sense legislation aligns our concealed carry laws with that of our neighboring states of Vermont and Maine and states across the country. This is about safety. This is about making sure that the laws on our books are keeping people safe while remaining true to the Live Free or Die spirit that makes New Hampshire the great state that it is. This is a commitment I made to the people of New Hampshire and I am proud today to fulfill that commitment, signing SB12 into law.”

Law enforcement groups across the Granite State had spoken out against the measure. Pat Sullivan, executive director of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, told The Huffington Post last month that the law already in place once allowed him to deny a concealed carry license to a man who came to his station in a tinfoil hat. Under the new law, that man won’t need to get a license to carry a concealed weapon.

“There are many people that carry concealed weapons that are doing good, that aren’t doing bad things. However, there is an element that we deal with as law enforcement, in terms of a regular basis, that are no good,” Sullivan said. “They are committing crimes, violent crimes, and we don’t know whether or not they do or do not have a weapon on them. With the permits, you at least have an idea as to whether or not they have a legal weapon on them. You encounter someone roadside, you don’t know what you have. It kind of just gives that little bit of added security and safety.”

Deidre Reynolds, a volunteer with the New Hampshire chapter of the gun safety group Moms Demand Action, said the measure would make the state less safe.

“Shame on you, Governor Sununu. By signing SB 12 into law, you have made Granite Staters less safe. You and the state lawmakers who rushed this through are compromising public safety standards and making it easier for dangerous people to carry hidden, loaded weapons in public. In doing so, you have put politics over public safety, kowtowing to the extreme agenda of the national gun lobby,” she said in a statement. “Local law enforcement agencies now no longer have the ability to deny permits to potentially dangerous people.”

New Hampshire becomes the 12th state where it’s legal to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Similar legislation to roll back licensing requirements is pending in Texas, Kentucky, Utah and North Dakota."
huffpo92,huffpo,"['Michael Mcauliff', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",2017-06-10 23:40:51-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-census-bureau_us_593aefcae4b0b13f2c6a2dbc,"WASHINGTON ― When most people think of the U.S. Census Bureau, they probably don’t think of an agency that supercharges the profitability and efficiency of American businesses.

Nor do they realize that one of the economy’s best secret weapons is facing its greatest crisis since James Madison and Thomas Jefferson created it in 1790.

But then again, most people haven’t built a $4.5 billion fortune based on Census data, the way Jack and Laura Dangermond have.

The Dangermonds, sweethearts since high school, had an epiphany about data while they were graduate students at Harvard in 1967, a time when the university was awash in protests and political strife. They were both working in a lab developing the nascent field of computerized mapping, now better known as geographic information systems.

Their revelation was that good data, clearly presented ― in their case, with maps ― could help people better understand the world and make decisions without all the ruckus roiling their campus and nation.

“We didn’t want to be political. We didn’t want to go to the right or to the left,” Jack Dangermond recently told HuffPost. “We wanted to go forward with science and try to make all these institutions who are our customers better by driving with quantitative methods and science.”

He didn’t realize at the time how valuable their idea would be. But these days, the vast majority of the country’s 1,000 largest businesses use the software that the Dangermonds’ company, Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), creates. Numerous state, local and federal government agencies also use the software, and the company reaps revenues north of $1 billion a year.

Businesses use Esri’s programs to figure out where their customers are and what they want. If Starbucks, Walmart or Target opens a new store, it’s because the data and maps have suggested where it has the best chance to succeed. Governments use the maps for everything from improving policing and disaster response to planning new schools, roads and untold numbers of other services.

“I like to call my work the science of ‘where,’” Dangermond said.

Much of the data his approximately 100,000 U.S. customers use comes from the Census Bureau ― the largest, most important source of the raw information that businesses and governments need to function.

“The world today is all about analytics, and the Census Bureau provides systematic and science-based information about the demographic profile of Americans,” Dangermond said. “Census data is in many ways the lifeblood of these kinds of organizations.”

That’s not an exaggeration ― and it’s why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spends a lot of time trying to persuade Congress and the White House to keep the bureau and its data production well-funded.

“Policymakers need the information arising from these federal activities to formulate sound policy,” said J.D. Foster, the Chamber’s chief economist. “Many Chamber members use this information more directly in their own business planning as they attempt to identify trends in consumer behavior and preferences, resulting in better business decisions and ultimately a stronger overall economy.”

Indeed, the businesses that use this government data generate up to $220 billion a year in economic activity, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce study.

But Congress and the White House don’t seem to share the same high estimation of the Census Bureau, judging by the money they are willing to spend as it gears up for two of the most challenging statistical counts on the planet ― the constitutionally mandated 2020 enumeration of every person in America, and the 2017 Economic Census. The Economic Census surveys the nation’s businesses every five years, and underpins all the government’s reports on things like unemployment and the gross domestic product.

Historically, when the bureau is preparing for the decennial census and starting the Economic Census, it gets a dramatic funding boost to address the enormous tasks. From 2007 to 2008, Congress increased the agency’s budget by nearly $500 million to cover prep work that year alone.

Nothing of that sort is happening this year, and the agency’s funding was already lower than its estimated need. The outgoing Obama administration had recommended a 2017 allocation of $1.63 billion. But Congress never got around to passing a regular budget for this year, instead pushing through a string of stopgap bills that gave the Census Bureau $1.47 billion ― a shortfall of about $160 million. The Trump administration’s proposed 2018 budget would only barely boost it, to $1.5 billion.

The stakes for the Census are especially high this time around. Counting every person in a country with a population of more than 300 million is difficult and expensive; the 2010 count cost about $12.3 billion over several years, or about $92 per housing unit. That was about 30 percent more than it cost in 2000. Part of the escalating cost is simple arithmetic ― the population had grown by 27 million people over that period.

But another factor is the declining percentage of Americans who respond to the Census by mail, forcing the bureau to open offices around the country and hire tens of thousands of people to go out and get that data by going door to door. According to the Government Accountability Office, that follow-up to non-responses is the agency’s largest, most costly field operation.

A failed attempt at using new, hand-held devices to automate more of the work also complicated the 2010 Census. When the costly machines didn’t function properly during tests, the bureau had to abandon them.

Based on a population that is now over 325 million ― and seems to be even more distrustful of the government ― doing the 2020 Census the same way it was done in 2010 would cost about $17 billion, according to the GAO. But Congress, angered by the failures of last time, mandated that the bureau figure out ways to save enough money to carry out the 2020 Census for the same $12.3 billion it cost a decade ago.

The bureau crafted a plan that it estimates will save $5 billion through new counting methods that include using smartphones, gathering internet and phone responses, and mining existing government records to fill out its tabulations. Every one of those new methods, though, is supposed to be developed through scientific consultation and thorough, peer-reviewed testing. That requires more spending from Congress on the front end, not less.

That process is not going well.

The GAO had already labeled the 2020 Census as “high risk,” noting that the bureau was treading into a lot of new territory that it was not especially well-equipped to handle, especially on the technological front. At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, Census Bureau Director John Thompson admitted he was already facing cost overruns of about $400 million in building the new Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing system, known as CEDCaP. He also acknowledged that the bureau has canceled or delayed various test runs of new methods because it doesn’t have the money to do them. It has likewise abandoned planned advertising efforts that were supposed to support comprehensive dry runs of the new methods next year.

Thompson tried to put a brave face on it, and even praised President Donald Trump’s historically skimpy budget request. “We’re glad we’re a priority in the president’s budget,” Thompson told an appropriations subcommittee. “We’re very, very happy about that.”

In a sign that he was not actually very happy, however, Thompson followed up his testimony by abruptly handing in his resignation just five days later. He said he did so in order to give the Trump administration plenty of time to find a replacement, although he had been expected to stay on for the rest of the year to oversee the critical planning stages of the Census.

As of June 30, the bureau will have no director. There isn’t a deputy director in line to replace Thompson, because that person left in January. There isn’t even a political appointee in place who is directly responsible for overseeing the bureau at its parent agency, the Department of Commerce.

Even before the sudden leadership vacuum, Dave Powner, the GAO’s head of IT management oversight, saw trouble looming.

“Historically, if you look at the previous decennials, there’s been a lot of money thrown at this late to bail out late starts and mismanagement and other things,” Powner said at the same hearing where Thompson spoke. “And I think you’re potentially heading down that path again.”

At a June 8 Senate hearing on the Commerce Department’s budget, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross ― a billionaire who was once a Census enumerator ― fielded complaints about the cost overrun, and said the department and Trump’s Office of Management and Budget were undertaking a “crash review of what has been going on.” None of the senators asked about the flatlined budget.

An inadequate Census is a good friend of alternative facts. Jared Bernstein

There are historical examples of what happens when the Census Bureau collects bad or incomplete data. In 1930, after the stock market crash, the estimates of unemployed Americans were so far off that Congress had to order a second unemployment count the following year. The recount finally revealed how severely the Great Depression was biting into America, and allowed policymakers to stop guessing about the effects and actually deal with them.

When both the outgoing George W. Bush administration and the incoming administration of Barack Obama were trying to assess the severity of the Great Recession in 2008, they faced a similar data failure. Employment data was vastly better than in the ’30s, but there was a lack of statistics on key parts of the economy, especially the service sectors.

As Obama’s transition team met in Chicago to start the job of putting together policy responses, the plummeting stock market and escalating job losses had them plenty frightened.

But the gross domestic product ― the big economic indicator that says whether the country’s economy is growing or contracting ― proved to be way off, telling them the recession was not nearly as deep as it turned out to be.

The most recent data available, when economists Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein began working on a rescue package, suggested the economy had shrunk by about 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008. Initial estimates for the fourth quarter found the recession accelerating, with a 3.8 percent drop at the end of the year.

Later accounts of those frantic days revealed that Romer ― based on those numbers ― thought it would take a $1.8 trillion stimulus package to make up the shortfall in the economy. She, Bernstein, and the rest of the Obama transition team didn’t think Congress would be willing to pass such a large package, however. The plan they settled on was for less than half that amount, and Congress ultimately passed a package for $787 billion.

When the economic data was finally fully tallied, the economy had actually shrunk 3.7 percent in the third quarter of 2008 ― not the 0.5 percent the Bureau of Economic Analysis initially estimated. And the final data for the fourth quarter showed one of the worst quarterly collapses in U.S. history ― down 8.9 percent.

NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images Jared Bernstein, chief economist and economic policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, speaks at the daily White House briefing on June 8, 2009.

There’s debate about why such economic estimates were so wrong, but one acknowledged problem is that follow-up surveys were not done frequently enough. There were no quarterly updates measuring the sectors hit hardest by the housing collapse in 2007 and 2008 ― the finance and insurance sectors ― leaving the bureau to extrapolate from private data sources that are simply not as good. And the reason there were no quarterly updates for those sectors is because Congress had not funded them, despite repeated requests from multiple administrations.

Scott Hoyt, a senior director with Moody’s Analytics, said the government still collects data as if manufacturing were as important as it was 40 years ago, rather than putting the emphasis on services.

“We need much better understanding of the service side of the economy, and we’re only just getting there,” he said.

That flaw in the data left Congress and two White House teams blind to the full extent of the financial crisis. In retrospect, Bernstein says the Obama economic team probably couldn’t have pushed for more stimulus, even if they’d had a more accurate picture, because Congress would not have agreed to it regardless of what the data said. “It’s a little bit of a heavy lift to say if only these foresightful legislators had better data, they’d have made better choices,” he said.

At the very least, though, with better information, his team would not have predicted ― as they did on Jan. 9, 2009 ― that passing the stimulus package would keep unemployment under 8 percent. (It eventually hit 10 percent.)

“If we had known things were going to be as bad as they were, of course we wouldn’t have made rosy predictions,” Bernstein told HuffPost.

Perhaps a more important effect of the inaccurate data, he added, was that it convinced policymakers to ease off on the stimulus too soon. By late 2009, when some Democrats on Capitol Hill were pushing for more stimulus spending, the White House criticized such efforts and shifted its focus to austerity plans and ways to trim mounting debt.

“Where I think we ran into trouble was in seeing green shoots that weren’t really there,” Bernstein said. “But that’s an example of confirmation bias and wanting ― there were people in the administration who really wanted to pivot to deficit reduction, and that’s what happened.”

Congress did eventually come up with $8 million to fund the more robust collection of data that could have helped economists understand the recession sooner, although Congress did not fund analysis and publication of that data until Obama’s second term.

The underfunded stimulus isn’t just of interest to economists and historians. It’s a cautionary tale as Congress and the White House are on course to underfund the Census Bureau as it launches its two most important undertakings.

“The problem is that if you cut funding, if the data gets worse, then you’re going to have more of those types of situations, or they could be worse,” said Hoyt. “Our understanding of the economy could be further from what we later recognize to be the truth.”

Of course, the decennial Census covers much broader ground than the economy. It is the basis for creating political districts to make sure Americans are represented evenly; it is the foundation for demographic research in America, and for dozens of other government surveys; and it is key to distributing up to $700 billion from the federal government, according to new estimates from George Washington University’s Institute of Public Policy.

The pervasive impact of Census data explains why the bureau spends years trying to develop and test new counting methods ― and why it’s so troubling to observers that funding is not flowing to meet the demands.

“It’s not looking great. I think it’s all correctable, but the money should be coming at a much higher rate than it is,” said Andrew Reamer, a research professor at GWU. “They’re really doing the biggest reinvention of the Census in decades, and they’re being nickel-and-dimed on the process.”

Jack and Laura Dangermond hoped to transcend politics with facts when they launched Esri nearly 50 years ago. If their business’ dominance is any indication, they were successful.

But in 2017, facts have become political. Trump regularly denigrates basic, verifiable facts, such as unemployment statistics, as phony ― unless he happens to like them. He invents crowd sizes. One of his top advisers infamously defended that invention as an “alternative fact.”

Therein lies yet another danger of a poorly done Census. If people are already prone to disbelieve data based on their politics, what happens when the actual data is not all that accurate?

“An inadequate Census is a good friend of alternative facts,” said Bernstein, who now works with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities."

While Facebook is getting a lot of the credit for making last weekend’s Women’s March happen, a somewhat obscure tech platform called the Action Network was critical to organizers’ efforts. And in the wake of that worldwide protest, the platform is already helping to push the movement forward.

A nonprofit created by progressives who hoped to build a political movement with staying power, the Action Network offers tools for sending emails, organizing marches and events, fundraising, creating petitions, conducting surveys and connecting with other organizers. Activists who use the tools can keep all the email lists and other data they gather ― a feature that Facebook and most other platforms don’t offer.

More than 650 women’s marches in more than 50 countries were organized using the site’s tools last Saturday, according to the network’s own data.

“This was the largest mobilization we’ve ever seen,” Brian Young, the Action Network’s co-founder, told The Huffington Post. Millions of people around the world turned out to march, according to multiple estimates.

Many of the Women’s March organizers used the Action Network’s tools to create embeddable sign-up widgets and maps, like the ones below, that helped spread the word about the events.

Now they’re using the site’s tools to get marchers to sign on for the next things:

The Action Network

As organizers plan new events over the next 100 days, tools like these may help keep the momentum going in a way that Facebook cannot.

Facebook was crucial in mobilizing women after Trump’s election, to be sure. But it can only take activists so far. Theoretically, it’s possible for the pages of one-off events to turn into organizing tools going forward. But it’s much harder for one-off events to connect with each other, as happened in the Saturday marches ― and to stay connected. Plus, Facebook’s algorithms might keep news about future events or marches off your feed.

The Action Network, by relying on email, gives activists a more consistent way to reach local organizers. If you can reach organizers, you can reach the marchers, and you can bring them back to the streets ― or the ballot box.

“The marches that happened all over the world and in the U.S. are a great example of where grassroots organizing and technology combined can mobilize many,” Ceci Hall, who worked to organize sister marches this past weekend, told HuffPost in an email.

“As each march formed, we had the tools and support for them to take ownership of their march on the website,” Hall said. “This was way more effective and powerful [than] would have been possible even 5 years ago.”

Organizers like Hall also made use of Eventbrite, the chat tool Slack and an app called Rally, which helped people organize transportation.

Brian Young, who’d worked on digital campaigns for John Kerry and Howard Dean, co-founded the Action Network in 2012. At the time, progressives were frustrated with how Occupy Wall Street had waned as a movement after the protesters packed up. The idea was to create something that would give activists an infrastructure that could help build lasting movements.

For those tracking progressive politics closely, it may not be surprising that the Action Network became the platform of choice. (It can also be used by journalists: One of the authors of this article uses the Action Network to send his newsletter to subscribers, which is how we noticed the platform’s ubiquity during the Women’s Marches.) It was used to organize rallies against the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, and to arrange the 2012 Black Friday protests against Walmarts around the country, which stunned observers with their breadth.

“But all of those were just road testing the tools for the moment we’re in now,” Young said.

While the pipeline and wage battles advanced under President Barack Obama, the Trump administration is now vowing to reverse that progress. Whether the infrastructure built during the initial protests is able to withstand this renewed pressure will to some extent determine how far Trump is able to push.

Following the outpouring of support, Women’s March organizers are brimming with confidence, though it remains to be seen where the movement goes from here.

Sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, a leading expert on the relationship between social media and political movements, has found the former to be both a blessing and a curse for the latter.

While Facebook and Twitter enabled protest movements to scale up rapidly in places like Tahrir Square in Egypt, the Maidan in Ukraine and Gezi Park in Tufekci’s native Turkey, she has found that such easily organized networks tend to prove fragile ― that they can be broken by a combination of government pressure and bitter internecine fights among allies within Facebook threads.

In the days before social media, nascent movements took much longer to grow to serious scale. But once they did, their bonds were stronger than much of what exists today."

After the United States had its first successful nuclear test in 1945, the nuclear club was soon expanded to include tests by the Soviet Union (1949), the United Kingdom (1952), France (1960), China (1964), India (1974), Pakistan (1998), and North Korea (2006).

As of today, there are nine countries generally recognized to own nuclear weapons, with Iran actively seeking to join this group. In order of the estimated size of the nuclear arsenal, from largest to smallest, are: Russia, the United States, France, China, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. Notably, the five members of the Security Council (Russia, the United States, France, China and the United Kingdom) were the first developers of nuclear weapons and currently have the five largest nuclear stockpiles in the world.

While these nine countries are generally recognized as owning nuclear weapons, that doesn't mean that they are the only countries that possess nuclear weapons. Countries that are not officially recognized as being part of the nuclear club, such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the Netherlands, deploy and store American nuclear weapons as part of NATO agreements. Other non-nuclear countries such as South Korea, Canada and Greece previously had similar arrangements with the United States.

For those tracking the volume of nuclear weapons, the American nuclear stockpile peaked in volume in 1966 and has been dramatically reduced since then. A total of around 67,500 nuclear weapons had been developed by the United States but currently there are only about 8,500 due to dismantling programs. The Russian arsenal is also currently about one-third of the level of its all-time peak volume.

Thank you so much. Thank you for this wonderful welcome. Thank you to the people of Prague. Thank you to the people of the Czech Republic. (Applause.) Today, I'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city, in the center of Europe. (Applause.) And, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, I am also proud to be the man who brought Michelle Obama to Prague. (Applause.)

To Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality. And to the people of the Czech Republic, thank you for your friendship to the United States. (Applause.)

I've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the Czech people in my hometown of Chicago. (Applause.) Behind me is a statue of a hero of the Czech people -- Tomas Masaryk. (Applause.) In 1918, after America had pledged its support for Czech independence, Masaryk spoke to a crowd in Chicago that was estimated to be over 100,000. I don't think I can match his record -- (laughter) -- but I am honored to follow his footsteps from Chicago to Prague. (Applause.)

For over a thousand years, Prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place. You've known war and peace. You've seen empires rise and fall. You've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politics and in poetry. Through it all, the people of Prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and defining their own destiny. And this city -- this Golden City which is both ancient and youthful -- stands as a living monument to your unconquerable spirit.

When I was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances. Few people would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the President of the United States. (Applause.) Few people would have predicted that an American President would one day be permitted to speak to an audience like this in Prague. (Applause.) Few would have imagined that the Czech Republic would become a free nation, a member of NATO, a leader of a united Europe. Those ideas would have been dismissed as dreams.

We are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could not change.

We're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a right for all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like.

We are here today because of the Prague Spring -- because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty and opportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people.

We are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of a new day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long. Sametová Revoluce -- (applause) -- the Velvet Revolution taught us many things. It showed us that peaceful protest could shake the foundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology. It showed us that small countries can play a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts. (Applause.) And it proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.

That's why I'm speaking to you in the center of a Europe that is peaceful, united and free -- because ordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not. They believed that walls could come down; that peace could prevail.

We are here today because Americans and Czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible. (Applause.)

Now, we share this common history. But now this generation -- our generation -- cannot stand still. We, too, have a choice to make. As the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected. And we've seen events move faster than our ability to control them -- a global economy in crisis, a changing climate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons.

None of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily. But all of them demand that we listen to one another and work together; that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences; and that we reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart. That is the work that we must carry on. That is the work that I have come to Europe to begin. (Applause.)

To renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders. That means investments to create new jobs. That means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth. That means a change in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis. (Applause.)

And we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to those emerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have had very little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the International Monetary Fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance. (Applause.)

Now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy. (Applause.) Together, we must confront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of new sources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part. And I pledge to you that in this global effort, the United States is now ready to lead. (Applause.)

To provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance. NATO was founded 60 years ago, after Communism took over Czechoslovakia. That was when the free world learned too late that it could not afford division. So we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known. And we should -- stood shoulder to shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an Iron Curtain was lifted, and freedom spread like flowing water.

This marks the 10th year of NATO membership for the Czech Republic. And I know that many times in the 20th century, decisions were made without you at the table. Great powers let you down, or determined your destiny without your voice being heard. I am here to say that the United States will never turn its back on the people of this nation. (Applause.) We are bound by shared values, shared history -- (applause.) We are bound by shared values and shared history and the enduring promise of our alliance. NATO's Article V states it clearly: An attack on one is an attack on all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time.

The people of the Czech Republic kept that promise after America was attacked; thousands were killed on our soil, and NATO responded. NATO's mission in Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people on both sides of the Atlantic. We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have struck from New York to London, and helping the Afghan people take responsibility for their future. We are demonstrating that free nations can make common cause on behalf of our common security. And I want you to know that we honor the sacrifices of the Czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost.

But no alliance can afford to stand still. We must work together as NATO members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from. We must strengthen our cooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangers that recognize no borders. And we must pursue constructive relations with Russia on issues of common concern.

Now, one of those issues that I'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to the peace of the world -- that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century.

The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclear war was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.

Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up. More nations have acquired these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.

Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city -- be it New York or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be -- for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.

Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction. Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.

Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. (Applause.) And as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it.

So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. (Applause.) I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, ""Yes, we can."" (Applause.)

Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including the Czech Republic. But we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.

To reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians this year. (Applause.) President Medvedev and I began this process in London, and will seek a new agreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold. And this will set the stage for further cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor.

To achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. (Applause.) After more than five decades of talks, it is time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.

And to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the United States will seek a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons. If we are serious about stopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons-grade materials that create them. That's the first step.

Second, together we will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation.

The basic bargain is sound: Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. To strengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles. We need more resources and authority to strengthen international inspections. We need real and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause.

And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation. That must be the right of every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially developing countries embarking on peaceful programs. And no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules. We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and to advance peace opportunity for all people.

But we go forward with no illusions. Some countries will break the rules. That's why we need a structure in place that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences.

Just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to address this threat. North Korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long range missiles. This provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.

Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons. Now is the time for a strong international response -- (applause) -- now is the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through threats and illegal weapons. All nations must come together to build a stronger, global regime. And that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the North Koreans to change course.

Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon. My administration will seek engagement with Iran based on mutual interests and mutual respect. We believe in dialogue. (Applause.) But in that dialogue we will present a clear choice. We want Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically. We will support Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections. That's a path that the Islamic Republic can take. Or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nuclear arms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all.

So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven. (Applause.) If the Iranian threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in Europe will be removed. (Applause.)

So, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the most immediate and extreme threat to global security. One terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction. Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of purpose without delay.

So today I am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years. We will set new standards, expand our cooperation with Russia, pursue new partnerships to lock down these sensitive materials.

We must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade. Because this threat will be lasting, we should come together to turn efforts such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism into durable international institutions. And we should start by having a Global Summit on Nuclear Security that the United States will host within the next year. (Applause.)

Now, I know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda. There are those who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences among nations. And there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worth setting a goal that seems impossible to achieve.

But make no mistake: We know where that road leads. When nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where human progress ends.

There is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted. We must confront it not by splitting apart but by standing together as free nations, as free people. (Applause.) I know that a call to arms can stir the souls of men and women more than a call to lay them down. But that is why the voices for peace and progress must be raised together. (Applause.)

Those are the voices that still echo through the streets of Prague. Those are the ghosts of 1968. Those were the joyful sounds of the Velvet Revolution. Those were the Czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire without firing a shot.

Human destiny will be what we make of it. And here in Prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a better future. Let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world more prosperous and more peaceful than we found it. (Applause.) Together we can do it.

Thank you very much. Thank you, Prague. (Applause.)"
huffpo97,huffpo,"['John A. Tures', 'Political Science Professor', 'Lagrange College In Georgia']",2016-04-20 13:39:19-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-a-tures/did-the-assault-weapons-b_b_9740352.html,"On the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, it's worth asking whether the assault weapons ban, which was in effect during the time, actually worked. Analysis of 108 shootings with five or more deaths showed that the ban was more successful than in years where there wasn't a ban, and such mass shootings have dramatically increased since the ban expired.

The Columbine shooting by a pair of students which killed 13 at the Colorado school, has been held up by assault weapons ban opponents as a reason why the ban didn't work, listing each case of a shooting (whether they involved assault weapons or not). But focusing on cases from a decade doesn't tell us much about all of the shootings over years before and after the ban, to see if the ban actually reduced such mass killings.

To analyze the issue, I look at all rampage killings, school shootings, workplace shootings, family massacres and mass killings over religion, race and politics, from 1973 to the present. Each case analyzed had five or more deaths, with many wounded.

In this study of 108 mass shootings, 92 of them occurred before the assault weapons ban, and after it as well, with only 16 mass shootings in the ten years in which we had an assault weapons ban. If you divide those by the number of years (34 for non-ban years and 10 for ban years), you find that we had 2.71 shootings per year in non-ban years, and 1.6 shootings per ban year. That means we had 1.69 times as many mass shootings in non-ban years.

Let's break it down by the timing of the shooting. Before the assault weapons ban, there were 2.04 mass shootings per year (1973-1994). So the ban did reduce the number of mass shootings.

What's even more frightening is what happened in the 11 years after the assault weapons ban was allowed by the GOP Congress to expire. We had 46 mass shootings per year from 2005 to 2015, or 4.18 mass shootings per year. That's more than 2.61 times as many mass shootings as when we had the assault weapons ban.

Critics are likely to claim that other means of killings were frequently employed during the years of the assault weapons ban. That isn't supported either by the evidence. There were four cases of vehicular killings with three or more dead and 10 or more injured between 1973 and the present. None happened during the assault weapons ban. The same can be said of causing deadly fires and plane crashes (four cases, none during the ban). There was the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building by a domestic terrorist, of course.

Those who support gun control have hyped each shooting. But it hasn't translated into support for restricting firearms. Instead, it's had the opposite effect, making people more willing to support gun rights, or go out and buy a firearm. Gun control advocates need to show how laws like assault weapons ban worked, in America, Europe, Australia, etc.

Yes, there were tragedies during the ban, like Columbine. Perhaps more draconian punishments and civil suits against those who helped provide the weapons for the killers might deter future straw purchases. But even with the horrible event of 1999, the data shows that the assault weapons ban reduced mass shootings in America, and letting the ban expire dramatically increased the number of mass shootings in the United States.

On Thursday, December 28, police responded to a report of gunfire on Adrian Street, just south of G Street. They arrived at 7:30 p.m. and found a vehicle on fire. After the fire was put out, officers found a woman unconscious and suffering from gunshot wounds in the trunk. Police said, by the time D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services arrived, they found “no signs consistent with life.”

WJLA The car fire behind the 800 block of Adrian Street SE, D.C.

Neighbors said they heard multiple gunshots in the alley behind the 800 block of Adrian Street, SE, and moments later they saw a raging fire. Kerrice Lewis was reportedly heard screaming as she tried to escape from the trunk.

Lewis was orphaned at the age of 11 and raised by her grandparents.

Her grandfather, William Sharp, told Fox 5 DC he feels as though his heart has been ripped out. He said “her mother died of a brain aneurysm and her father was tragically murdered up in the D.C. area.” Lewis struggled deeply with the loss of her parents. She recently served time in jail. Her grandfather said she was striving to turn her life around — Lewis worked on construction sites and Sharp said she “was very excited because she had just finished taking some classes and was looking forward to taking some more.” He said she was a “free spirit” and “full of life” and that “she would light up a room, just talking and laughing.”

Mercedes Rouhlac, the victim’s best friend and ex girlfriend, told WJLA she “talked to her everyday.” Rouhlac said she “just kept calling her” and wondering why Lewis wasn’t answering her phone.

Heartbroken friends of the victim are disappointed by the lack of media coverage. When lesbians are murdered the distinct media bias keeps the general population in the dark. This bias is multiplied where “butch” lesbians are concerned, and compounded if you’re a woman of color. Lesbian relationships are typically downplayed, sexuality is often omitted, and there’s a resulting lack of focus (with both investigations and media) on potential hate crimes — even where the murder is exceptionally horrific (as in this case).

In Washington DC a 20 lesbian women was tied up in her trunk after being kidnapped. Shot then burned alive in her car. My friend who knew her is broken atm. — Bob’s Pancussy (@LilaBoBina) January 2, 2018

The vaccine can keep you from getting influenza, but on the off-chance that you end up with the flu anyway, it can lessen its severity. And the shots are free for anyone with health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and they’re available at doctors’ offices, clinics, pharmacies and even many schools and businesses.

However, flu vaccination rates have plateaued. Last season, only 43.3 percent of adults got the vaccine and only 59 percent of children. Among health care workers, only 78.6 percent got shots, similar to the 2015 to 2016 season’s 79 percent rate.

Public health officials at the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases’ annual flu news conference were at a loss to explain the stagnant rate.

But Patsy Stinchfield, senior director of infection prevention and control at Children’s Minnesota, had an idea: Nobody likes shots.

“People don’t like needles,” she said at Thursday’s conference. “And health care professionals actually have needle phobia just like the general population does.”

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Flu vaccine rates have plateaued in recent years.

It’s safe to guess that most people don’t enjoy getting jabbed. But for a small minority of the population, it can grow into trypanophobia, or fear of needles, when the aversion to injections is so severe it produces a physical response, even fainting. Researchers estimate it affects 3 percent to 10 percent of the population.

Sometimes the phobia is so intense that it prevents a person from getting much-needed medical care. In an article for the British Journal of Anaesthesia, clinical psychologist Kate Jenkins writes of three patients she worked with to overcome needle phobia: a 24-year-old man whose fear was so extreme he refused to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a pregnant woman who refused blood tests and a woman who had avoided medical care for so long she ended up with a 9-pound breast tumor.

Addressing needle fear is the driving force behind efforts to research other methods of delivering vaccines, including patches and sprays. But until a reliable alternative for flu vaccine hits the market, people are going to have to rely on psychological coping strategies to get through their doctor’s visit.

Jenkins writes that breathing exercises, relaxation strategies and controlled exposure to the thing they fear most are good ways to help people with milder needle phobias. But those who usually faint may need a more intense course of therapy.

Stinchfield’s advice? Breathe through the mouth, let your arm hang limp like a “spaghetti noodle” and then “imagine your favorite place in the whole wide world.”

Because needle phobia is so common, and because there are so many ways to approach the problem, we asked HuffPost readers what helped them get over their fear of needles. Here are four tips from readers that mirror doctors’ suggestions to dull pain, practice mindfulness or engage in immersive therapy.

1. Numb your skin with ice

After having to receive and give myself a shot every day for 34 weeks and twice a day for four weeks, I’ve learned that if you take a deep breath and count to three, I can handle it. Numbing the skin with an ice cube helps too. Can’t even feel it. ― Morgan A. Flannery

2. Listen to your favorite music

I have them lay me down, I don’t look, I relax because tensing makes it worse, and I usually have my favorite music in my headphones. I have had a lot of needles in the last two years (chemo, iron infusions, high risk pregnancy, etc.), and that combination has helped me a lot. Lastly I’m a hard stick and letting the staff know ahead of time is beneficial! Don’t let anyone dig around for a vein ― have them find a phlebotomist who is good at sticking!!! ― Julie Conant Wallace

3. Eat a snack before and after

I’m a fainter. I’ve started eating something, at least a granola bar, before AND after shots. I have to make a conscious effort to breathe in and out and to not hold my breath during the injection. I’ve also started telling the people drawing my blood or giving me shots that I’m a bleeder and I faint. It makes them be extra careful with me even if it’s been over a year since my last fainting spell. 💁🏼 ― Taylor Stoner

4. Face your fear head-on

Got over my fear of them in College when my friends made me type my blood for biology class, donate blood at the Red Cross, get my ears pierced and get my vaccinations all updated (had not been done since I was in grade school). This was all accomplished in the space of 4 hours! I used to break out in hives and get hysterical if the doctor even mentioned using a needle on me. Now I could care less. ― Nancy Foulke

Of course, there’s also the question of why some children grow up to develop extreme aversions to needles in the first place. A few studies suggest there are some risk factors, and they include parents’ anxiety about needles, painful past experiences with injections and a high number of same-day injections from ages 4 to 6.

It’s worth it to get over the phobia to get that flu shot each year, though. It’s especially important for people with chronic conditions including diabetes, lung disease and heart disease; those who are more susceptible to the illness; and people who are in frequent contact with others who are too young or medically compromised to be vaccinated.

And despite the myths, the vaccine doesn’t cause the flu, but it can come with some mild side effects, including fever, nausea and soreness at the injection site."

Grimm had reportedly left the newspaper’s office at around 10 p.m. to take photographs of lightning.

In a 10:16 p.m. post to a New Carlisle Facebook group, Grimm reached out to locals for suggestions for a “good spot to watch the storms.”

Grimm was driving along the town’s Main Street when he noticed a traffic stop ahead, according to New Carlisle News. He said he pulled into a nearby parking lot “in full view” of the police officer on duty, intending to take photographs there.

Grimm said he was shot without warning when he emerged from his vehicle and began setting up his tripod and camera.

New Carlisle News identified the officer who shot Grimm as Deputy Jake Shaw.

In body cam video of the incident obtained by The Associated Press, Grimm can be heard wailing in pain as Shaw rushed to his aid.

“Andy, I’m sorry, brother,” Shaw said in the clip. “Oh please let him be alright. I thought it was a gun.”

Following the shooting, Grimm told the New Carlisle News that he didn’t want the deputy to “lose his job” over the shooting.

“I know Jake. I like Jake. I don’t want him to lose his job over this,” Grimm said.

Shaw was later placed on administrative leave following the shooting, reported AP.

Posts on the New Carlisle Facebook group — the one Grimm had commented on before the shooting — indicate that the town is home to a tight-knit community. Following Grimm’s shooting, residents referred to the photographer and the officer by name. Many offered their well wishes to Grimm, and several defended Shaw’s actions.

“I’m sure Shaw didn’t shoot Andy on purpose,” wrote one resident.

“Andy ... [we] are up praying for you right now. Shaw ― your a good person and a good cop. Your job is not easy ... Your both in my prayers tonight,” wrote another.

Some locals, however, called for Shaw to face punishment over the shooting.

“Cops need to wake up!” wrote one commenter. “I call for Shaw’s Badge,” said another. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is looking into the incident, according to the Dayton Daily News.

A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help cover Grimm’s medical expenses."

Shemel Mercurius, 16, was watching over her 3-year-old cousin in a Brooklyn apartment on May 31, 2016, when Taariq Stephens, now 25, allegedly barged in and shot her after a brief argument, according to authorities.

Former New York Police Officer Kyle Thomas Daly, who was among those responding to the shooting, gave an account of what Mercurius told police in testimony at Stephens’ murder trial on Monday.

“I put on gloves, laid her down and began rendering aid,” Daly said, according to The New York Daily News. “She regained consciousness and gave me her name and date of birth.”

Daly, who now works for a Long Island police department, said that the teen told a detective that Stephens wanted to date her but she wasn’t interested. She said she had met and exchanged numbers with Stephens at a child care center a week earlier, according to Daly.

Russia called the allegation “absurd.”

Former MP Denis Voronenkov was killed by an assailant who was armed with a pistol. The assailant was wounded by Voronenkov’s bodyguard and later died in hospital, police said.

Voronenkov fled to Ukraine last year and was helping the Ukrainian authorities build a treason case against Yanukovich, Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin former president.

Voronenkov had also spoken out against Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, although he voted for the move at the time.

President Petro Poroshenko said the killing “is an act of state terrorism on the part of Russia, which (Voronenkov) was forced to leave for political reasons.”

“Voronenkov was one of the main witnesses of Russian aggression against Ukraine and, in particular, the role of Yanukovich regarding the deployment of Russian troops to Ukraine.”

Relations between Kiev and Moscow are at an all-time low after Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of separatist fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people.

Poroshenko said it was “no accident” that Voronenkov was shot on the same day as a warehouse storing tank ammunition was blown up at a Ukrainian military base.

Moscow denied any involvement Voronenkov’s murder .

“We believe that all the falsehoods that can already be heard about much-hyped Russian involvement are absurd,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying about the killing.

Voronenkov, 45, had been placed on a Russian federal wanted-list in connection with an alleged $5 million property fraud. He came to Ukraine with his wife, opera singer Maria Maksakova, who was also an MP.

Voronenkov was gunned down on his way to meet another former Russian parliamentarian, Ilya Ponomarev, who was the only member of the Duma who voted against the annexation of Crimea.

“There’s an obvious theory - I’ve said that Voronenkov wasn’t a crook, but a deadly dangerous investigator for Russian officials,” Ponomarev wrote on Facebook.

Television footage showed Ponomarev and Maksakova leaving the scene in a car together with Ukraine’s General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.

Lutsenko called the shooting a “cynical murder.”

“He had provided investigators of the military prosecutor’s office with highly important (witness) testimony for the case. This was a typical show execution of a witness by the Kremlin,” Lutsenko said.

Yanukovich fled Ukraine during the 2013-2014 Maidan street protests, which he said were tantamount to a “coup” organized by armed nationalist radicals. The former leader has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving his life by helping him escape from Ukraine."

The on-duty officers had asked the 38-year-old to get on the ground and he complied, but then they recognized him and told him to stand up and walk toward him.

“At this time, a responding officer (36-year old white male with over 8 years of service) just arriving in the area observed this and fearing for his safety and apparently not recognizing the off-duty officer, discharged a shot, striking the off-duty officer in the arm,” the statement says.

The victim was treated in hospital but has since been released, police confirmed. His lawyer, Rufus J. Tate Jr., told local news outlets that he considers the incident more severe than an accident. The police department has given no description of a threat, he said.

“This is the first time that we are aware, that a black professional, in law enforcement, himself being shot and treated as an ordinary black guy on the street,” Tate told Fox News. “This is a real problem.”

Police have launched an investigation into the incident during which one of the three suspects in the car theft was also shot in the ankle.

The officer who fired his gun has been placed on administrative leave, along with six other officers, according to the police statement.

Neither the victim nor his fellow officer have been publicly identified. St. Louis Police Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The news comes after authorities released dash cam footage on Tuesday of Philando Castile’s shooting by St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez in Minnesota. Footage showed that Castile, a black man, also complied with the officer’s orders before being shot and killed.

Yanez was found “not guilty” of manslaughter by a jury but has been fired from his police department. The Castile case has highlighted a fear that there may be no justice for black Americans killed in police shootings, advocates say.

“It’s just like, a punch in my stomach, it’s a punch in the gut,” Castile’s friend, John Thompson, told HuffPost Tuesday. “Look what happened to Philando for doing all the right things. It hurts. Every time I talk about it, it hurts.”"

InStyle published the interview on Thursday.

“I’ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not,” Oprah said during the interview. “And so it’s not something that interests me. I don’t have the DNA for it. ... That’s not for me.”

Speculation about a potential Oprah 2020 presidential campaign began swirling this month following her Golden Globes speech.

Members of Oprah’s inner circle, including her longtime partner Stedman Graham and CBS’ Gayle King, hinted that she might consider running.

“It’s up to the people,” Graham told the Los Angeles Times when asked about a possible campaign. “She would absolutely do it.”

While there has been an outpouring of support for a President Oprah, the media mogul suggested during the InStyle interview that it wouldn’t be a good move for her personally.

“Gayle ― who knows me as well as I know myself practically ― has been calling me regularly and texting me things, like a woman in the airport saying, ‘When’s Oprah going to run?’” Oprah told Brown. “So Gayle sends me these things, and then she’ll go, ‘I know, I know, I know!

The man credited with firing the shots that chased off the gunman who killed 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday is speaking out.

And Stephen Willeford wants people to remain focused on the victims.

“All I want to stress today is the people in that church, they’re friends of mine, they’re family,” Willeford told 40/29 News, an ABC-affiliated station in Arkansas.

He said:

“And every time I heard a shot I knew that that probably represented a life. I was scared to death. I was. I was scared for me. I was scared for everyone of them, and I was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away.”

Willeford said he grabbed his rifle from a safe and ran barefoot to the church when his daughter told him about the shooting. Once there, he confronted 26-year-old gunman Devin Patrick Kelley and the two traded gunfire.

“I know I hit him,” Willeford said.

When Kelley fled the scene, Willeford flagged down a pickup truck belonging to local resident Johnnie Langendorff.

“The gentleman with the rifle came to my truck as the shooter took off, and he briefed me quickly on what had just happened, and said that we had to get him and so that’s what I did,” Langendorff told KSAT.

Langendorff said the chase eventually reached speeds of 95 mph. En route, the pair of good Samaritans contacted 911 to update authorities on the direction the gunman was heading.

During the pursuit, Kelley reportedly made his own call.

“The suspect used his cellphone, notified his father that he had been shot and didn’t think he was going to make it,” Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told NBC News.

The chase ended when Kelley’s vehicle flipped into a ditch.

“It’s like he just gave up,” Langendorff told KSAT. “He just kind of went off in the ditch, hit a hay bale from what I could see and then he just never moved after that.”

Police said Kelley was found dead with three gunshot wounds: two likely from Willeford and a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Despite the gunfight and pursuit, Willeford insisted that he was not a hero.

“I’m no hero. I am not,” he told 40/29 News. “I think my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done and I just wish I could’ve gotten there faster.”"

Dionisio Garza III, 26, fatally shot his first victim, 56-year-old Eugene Linscomb, with a pistol, before picking up an AR-15 assault-style rifle and spraying bullets into responding police cruisers and a Houston Police Department helicopter, officials said at a press conference.

By the time the mayhem ended, Garza had shot and injured six people, including two officers. All six are expected to survive.

Amazing no officer was seriously hurt or killed. Just look at this HPD vehicle. Thankful 4 our officers #khou11 pic.twitter.com/x9izldUAt1 — Marcelino Benito (@MarcelinoKHOU) May 29, 2016

The tragedy was among the more than 150 mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people -- not including the shooter -- are shot and/or killed in a single event, at the same general time and location. Other media outlets use a stricter definition of mass shooting, only counting higher profile, less common episodes in which three or more victims are fatally shot in a public space.

Regardless of how we characterize this outburst of gun violence, the incident again highlights problems in our mental health care system and easy access to the military-style firearms used in a number of recent deadly massacres.

It's still unclear what led Garza to travel from his home in California to Texas, but authorities say he arrived in Houston on Saturday with plans to meet friends. Police believe he may have camped out overnight at Memorial Auto and Tire before ambushing Linscomb shortly after he arrived at the shop.

Houston Police Lt. John McGalin said at a press conference Tuesday that he thought Garza had chosen his specific location because it offered a tactical advantage to shoot at responding officers.

""He had access to three corners. He was backed up against a fence, so he didn't have to worry about anyone getting behind him,"" said McGalin.

Garza opened fire on the first responding officer, forcing him to retreat and call for backup.

""Our primary responding officer is lucky to be alive and ... unhurt,"" the Houston Police Department wrote in a Facebook post.

In the nearly hour-long firefight that ensued, Garza shot two constables, hitting one's bulletproof vest and the other in the hand. Another bullet struck a gas pump at a nearby station, starting a fire.

A civilian later identified as John Wilson, 30, also reportedly attempted to stop the shooter with his own firearm, but, like police, appeared to be overpowered by Garza.

“What he did was very brave, but officers are trained in these active shooter situations, and obviously he wasn’t able to engage,” said acting Houston Police Chief Martha Montalvo. “He was outgunned and probably outmaneuvered, and as far as his tactical training, wasn’t at the same speed as our suspect. Just call the police and let us do what we have to do, and [do] not put yourself in a situation where you become a victim.”

Wilson was shot in the leg but survived.

A SWAT sniper was able to get a clear shot at Garza after a local resident let officers enter a house that overlooked the location.

Citizens in the area allowed one of our SWAT officers access to their house that enabled the officer to stop the threat #HouNews — Houston Police (@houstonpolice) May 31, 2016

Garza's family members believe he suffered from PTSD after returning from active duty in 2013, and say that something in him ""snapped"" in the weeks before the shooting.

""He did two tours in Afghanistan. I think he was proud to be in the military, but I know he went through a lot,"" Garza's stepmother told ABC 7. ""I think he was always haunted by everything that happened, what he saw.""

When Garza returned from duty, he began posting anti-Islamic comments on social media, his cousin, Ahmad Alkuteifani, told ABC 13. In recent months, Garza had tweeted comments condemning Muslims, touted conspiracy theories about the end of the world and expressed support for presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Alkuteifani also suggested his cousin may have chosen to carry out his attack in Texas because of its loose gun laws, which allow people to openly carry firearms like the AR-15 he used.

Authorities have not yet said how Garza obtained his guns. But semi-automatic weapons like the ones used by mass shooters in San Bernardino, California, Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado, are widely available across the U.S., except in a few states that have passed legislation restricting certain types of assault weapons.

AR-15s are modeled off the standard-issue U.S. military rifle that's been in use since the Vietnam War. Their magazines typically hold 30 rounds, but can be legally outfitted with high-capacity magazines in most states. They're accurate at a range of hundreds of yards, making them a preferred firearm for sport shooters and hunters. In fact, they're the ""most popular rifle"" in the U.S., according to the National Rifle Association.

With millions of AR-15s in civilian hands and hundreds of thousands of new military-style rifles flooding the market each year, according to recent manufacturer reports, the overwhelming majority of these weapons will never be used in a crime. But when they are, it's clear that their firepower can make the results especially devastating."

As you would expect -- there are those on the right calling for teachers to now be armed, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) believes that ""the mass slaughter would have gone differently if Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung had been armed."" Then there are those on the left who advocate the polar opposite; Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) ""said Sunday that she plans to introduce an assault weapons ban bill on the first day of the new Congress."" Some also cite mental illness and the lack of access to good mental health care as the main factor in the Sandy Hook killings. Respecting the collective and individual rights of the second amendment should also recognize proportionate and rational means in exercising the right to bear arms. Debates centering on whether (or not) assault rifles have a place within a civilian context should not be presupposed by partisan dogma. This is not the time for compartmentalized political arguments (a la fiscal cliff) but a very real opportunity, created by a tragic set of circumstances, to reflect on the relationship that assault weapons have with American society.

As a British veteran of twenty years and with over ten operational tours of duty spanning Northern Ireland, Macedonia, Bosnia, and three tours in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo -- the assault rifle has provided me with personal protection and security for over two decades. On operations, the assault rifle is your protective blanket, it is your most important possession and it does not leave your sight. You train, fight, eat and sleep with this weapon. It is the soldier's holy grail -- it is not the business of day-to-day citizens let alone a mother bringing up children in a family environment.

Security landscapes that justify assault rifles reside within power vacuums; countries where civil law and order is broken, where police and security forces are dysfunctional or cease to exist for the protection of society; where asymmetric and irregular warfare is being prosecuted by militias and terrorists on a daily basis and where we, as the occupying forces, frequently find ourselves in the crosshairs of an insurgents rifle. These semi-automatic weapons are designed to enable soldiers and law enforcement personnel to deliver a magazine of ammunition (around thirty bullets) onto a target with precision and lethal effect. This is not America or other parts of the Western civilized world -- these are conflicts and contexts that I would wish upon no decent human being. A man was arrested yesterday in Indiana for owning 47 guns and ammunition and demonstrating threatening behavior towards an elementary school. Why does a member of society in a civilized country require such an armory of weapons?

Pulling the trigger on an assault rifle is but the last action of a long chain of events and regulation for a soldier. Health and sanity checks are completed on new recruits well before they are permitted anywhere near a weapon -- loaded or not. That is not to say later down the road some may fall victim to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or become psychologically damaged due to combat experience. We rely on the esprit de corps and close relationships developed within military units to identify behavior that maybe impair future judgment amongst our brothers in arms -- not fail safe -- but amelioration to some extent. Many hours are spent training on 'dry' weapons involving no ammunition; dismantling the weapon hundreds of times and rebuilding it; cleaning and learning the function of all its components; being professionally educated in the rules of engagement and conflict; understanding ballistic theory and the devastating lethal effects that a high velocity round has on flesh and bone -- then maintaining this level of expertise throughout your service life. Then there is the firing range, and many hours spent honing marksmanship, learning the 'combat pause', dealing with malfunctions and stoppages and refining safety procedures. All it takes is for one negligent discharge to be pointing in the wrong direction and the consequences are deadly -- no one wants to be the perpetrator of a blue-on-blue. Such intense training and education, paralleled with close relationships only brought about by battle and mission experience, should not be expected of civil society, but then owning and operating assault rifles outside of high threat environments, law enforcement agencies and the military, shouldn't be expected either.

And once the training has ensured the necessary preparedness, the assault rifles and unexpended ammunition are carefully accounted for and returned to the armory, a secure building that is usually manned twenty four hours a day by experienced individuals, monitored by close circuit television and encompassing at least two layers of safety procedure required to access weapons. If such security requirements to keep semi-automatic weapons are deemed necessary by the military and law enforcement agencies, why have the same standards not been applied to civil society?

The right to bear arms should not be forgotten at this juncture. The second amendment stating: ""a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"" was adopted on December 15, 1791. America has armed herself successfully to ensure its security as a free state and in the twenty first century, boasts the most ""well regulated militia"" in the world, with an exemplary record in protecting its citizens and homeland. Collectively, assault rifles are an appropriate and necessary weapon for the military and law enforcement agencies to exercise and uphold the second amendment with conviction and effect. The right to bear arms as a general matter is part of the fabric of American culture. In addition, it would be impossible to completely disarm and demobilize those individuals seeking to exercise that right. Collective versus individual rights remain the focal debate and both should be acknowledged and respected but at the same time, proportionality should be applied. Individuals in the US do not exist in a security vacuum; it is therefore unreasonable and disproportionate to argue that a semi-automatic weapon is required for domestic self-defense.

I have a brother who suffers from severe learning disability or what used to be labeled 'mentally handicapped.' He is a very vulnerable boy but would not know what a semi-assault rifle is, let alone what to do with one. There is still a stigma in Western society, even today, about confronting those that do not fit into the norms associated with accepted behavior. We all have our part to play in affording these vulnerable individuals a little of our time and support - especially when they are at a young and influential age. Those with aggressive or potentially threatening tendencies should be nurtured and cared for by society. More importantly, the families that best understand and identify the changes of behavior, like soldiers that form closely developed relationships with their brothers in arms, need to have access to education and medication as preventative notion, not a cure. Mental health is not just an issue for the government; we are all responsible for increasing our own awareness and compassion for those vulnerable members of our society less fortunate than ourselves. The answer does not reside in arming our teachers with semi-automatic rifles and training them to be lethal marksman. It would, however, be sensible to increase the restrictions on access to assault rifles with immediate effect, whilst a plan to remove these weapons from civil society was hatched.

There is an unfortunate requirement to operate assault rifles as a measure of personal security in certain locations around the globe. High threat landscapes that house enemies with ideologies that do not respect human or civil rights qualify for such extreme measures -- schools, cinemas or other public facilities in civilized countries do not. Assault rifles demand highly tuned and experienced operators educated in all facets of semi-automatic weapons. Soldiers and law enforcement personnel qualify -- mothers, fathers, hunters and every member of domestic civil society do not. Moreover, access to existing semi-automatic weapons should encompass stringent measures with layered security procedures to ensure breeches in public safety are minimized. Revisiting aspects of gun ownership should not be divisive or politically charged. Continued debate should exist when massacres are still occurring and children cannot learn in schools without fear of being gunned down. From experience, disarming and demobilizing a population or militia is complex and requires time, significant resource and careful policing. Arming public servants with semi-automatic weapons is not the answer, and the aspiration to improve support for those vulnerable members of our society should be disconnected from debates on gun law. In the short term, significantly improved security regulation constraining easy access to assault rifles that already exist amongst American society should be implemented. In the long term -- I hope that common sense will prevail and individuals that exercise the right to bear arms can do so without resorting to the use of semi-automatic weapons."

From the founding of the organization in 1871 to the early 1970s, they were heavily regarded as an honorable coalition. By the mid 1970s, they became immersed in turmoil when outside factions revolted against the high ranking officials and took over the organization. Their focus drastically switched from conservation, marksmanship and hunting to political mobilization and protecting second amendment rights.

Former notorious leaders Harlon Carter and Neal Knox formulated a strategy to expand their organization's membership and develop strong allies with numerous representatives within the Republican Party. Knox assiduously worked to undermine the strength of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). They made their legislative breakthrough in 1986 when the Volker-McClure Act was passed by Congress. During this juncture, the NRA's membership increased to 3 million members.

Despite their successes, there was bitter divisiveness between members and the leadership. It became a revolving door for several executives, but in 1991, at their national convention, Wayne LaPierre became their executive vice president. As a former staff lobbyist for the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA), LaPierre was familiar with the inner workings of the government. The Institute for Legislative Action is the lobbying arm for the NRA. By the mid 1990s, the organization had become an influential force with an obscene amount of power in Washington, D.C.

The topic of gun control rose to the forefront of the nation's conscience due to the plethora of deaths from incessant gun violence recently. President Obama and then presidential candidate Governor Mitt Romney refused to take on questions regarding gun reform measures during the 2012 presidential campaign. The Trayvon Martin tragedy among others reintroduced the public to the NRA because of their steadfast defense in favor of the Stand Your Ground laws in various states across the nation. But one incident left the organization eerily quiet.

On December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook Elementary School was the site to one of the most gruesome mass-murders in U.S. history. A deranged gunman killed 20 innocent children and 7 adults including his own mother. One week after the tragedy, NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre finally held an infamous press conference where he blamed everything under the sun except for his own organization's destructive practices. Since that moment, the NRA's outright defiance has been a spectacle for the world to see.

Their asinine solution to the problem of school shootings has been to arm faculty members and tell communities to have a rotating force of armed policemen at individual schools. They refuse to address the realities facing their organization and the nation as it pertains to guns and gun ownership. Their latest missteps have been creating a video game where kids as young as the age of four can shoot guns and crafting a commercial featuring President Obama's daughters referencing how they have armed guards with them at all times.

There have been 61 mass-murders at schools since Columbine High School in 1999. The issues of war weaponry being available for public consumption, high capacity magazine clips, and background checks for gun purchasers have been at the forefront of the national conversation surrounding gun reform. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) as well as President Obama and Vice President Biden have expressed their urgency in compiling comprehensive legislation around gun reform in the nation. Some congressional members have introduced the idea of reenacting the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) that expired under President Bush in 2004.

Retired General Stanley McChrystal during a conversation on the MSNBC morning program Morning Joe stated, ""I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look -- I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want -- but we have to protect our children and our police and we have to protect our population. And I think we have to take a very mature look at that."" This same sentiment is shared by the majority of the nation, but the NRA is sticking to their guns.

President Obama dispatched Vice President Biden to assemble a taskforce to develop gun control proposals. Vice President Biden and his collaborators returned yesterday with a set of proposals to legislate gun control policy. Some are calling it the most sweeping gun control policy in a generation. Now it is on Congress to proceed in the right direction to ensure these measures become the law of the land. At this point, it may be easier said than done.

GOP and Democratic congressmen, congresswomen and senators are quite reluctant to even welcome the notion of gun control because they're worried about losing their seats in Congress. Their inaction could have disastrous ramifications in the present and future if they continue putting our children and adults at risk on a daily basis. Every day that passes, more people are dying in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Oakland among others due to gun violence.

It is time to act now.

There are over four million members in the NRA today. They've been successful in brainwashing some of their members through foolhardy rhetoric and propaganda. As a result, gun sales have exponentially soared throughout the nation.

Memo to the NRA leadership: If you're the civil rights organization that you claim you are, stop defending the indefensible before more innocent lives are taken."

""The damage that would be done by [Clinton's] policies and her Supreme Court picks would destroy individual freedoms, and therefore destroy the America we all love,"" said the group's top lobbyist, Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Affairs. ""We cannot let that happen. We have to unite, and we have to unite right now.""

The endorsement came after a fiery speech by NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, the group's longtime leader. LaPierre railed against Clinton, promising that she would strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights. Trump took the stage after Cox.

The NRA's Trump endorsement came earlier than previous NRA presidential endorsements, which typically take place later in the election cycle. And it wasn't always a sure thing. Unlike most Republican candidates for national office, Trump endorsed a ban on assault weapons earlier in his career.

“I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,” Trump wrote in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve.

But at the gun rights group's 2015 annual meeting, Trump offered a preview of his future platform, telling the crowd, “I love the NRA. I love the Second Amendment.”

Trump took the opportunity of Friday's endorsement to denounce gun-free zones, saying that they contributed to the carnage in the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino and Paris. But Trump himself has a mixed record on this policy too. The Huffington Post called up a few of Trump's properties to see if someone could carry a firearm there.

His private resort at Mar-a-Lago said it was a gun-free club. A receptionist at his hotel in Chicago said the same thing about that property. Officials at Trump's hotels in Miami and Las Vegas did, however, say that you could bring a licensed firearm to their locations under certain security specifications.

The rifle is the same type of weapon used last week in the Florida school shooting that killed 17 people.

The raffle was launched before the shooting, but Levi Patterson, the coach of the team in Neosho for boys 9 and younger, told The Kansas City Star he plans to continue with the fundraiser.

Patterson said he decided to “turn it into a positive thing” after “getting the hate” in the form of angry Facebook posts after the raffle was first reported.

The weapon was donated as a prize by a team father and co-founder of Neosho gun manufacturer Black Rain Ordnance Inc., which is currently pitching a Spec15 AR pistol on its Facebook page.

“Are you all tone deaf?” a Facebook user asked in a since-deleted post on Patterson’s Facebook page. “AR15 kills seventeen so you raffle a gun for child sports? Lord, people wake the hell up.”

There was also some criticism on Twitter:

Patterson said “our hearts break” for the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. But he added that gun raffles “have been going on for years. Evil has and will always exist.”

Patterson said none of the children on his team will be forced to sell raffle tickets for the weapon if they’re uncomfortable doing so.

“I just think they have feelings to this specific type of gun [that are] different than people around here do,” he told the Star.

Patterson said supportive donations have been pouring in as well.

Kansas Republican Tyler Tannahill, who is running for a congressional seat, and Missouri GOP U.S. Senate candidate Austin Peterson have also been criticized for each offering an AR-15 giveaway to draw attention to their campaigns, KMOV-TV reported.

Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik also used assault rifles to carry out the shooting in San Bernardino in December, which left 14 dead.

It makes sense considering the weapon’s capacity.

Initially invented in the 1950s by firearms engineer Eugene Stoner, the ArmaLite Rifle was branded as a lightweight firearm with precision accuracy and high lethality at long range.

They fire off bullets quickly. So quickly that an experienced shooter could fire many as 45 rounds in a minute.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images A Rock River Arms AR-15 rifle is seen on December 18, 2012 in Miami, Florida. The weapon is similar in style to the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle that was used during a massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.

Yet, despite its lethality –- and popularity among mass murderers -- assault rifles remain readily available and nearly immune from policy change.

Two days after the nightclub shooting, it took two HuffPost editors 38 minutes to purchase an AR-15, a gun similar to Mateen's, at a store in Orlando. This, despite the fact that the city was under a state of emergency following the attack.

The salesman told HuffPost that it would typically take five minutes. But because of the surge in sales following the shooting, which is pretty standard, the queue for background checks was longer than usual.

While President Barack Obama has called for bans on such guns, the general public isn’t all that interested in seeing one passed.

According to a December Washington Post/ABC News poll, 45 percent of those surveyed said they want to see assault rifles banned. That’s down from 80 percent in 1994.

And courts continue to side with gun rights advocates on this issue.

In February, for example, a federal appeals court ruled that a ban in Maryland on specific kinds of semi-automatic firearms was unconstitutional.

Outlawing such firearms would “substantially burden this fundamental right” to bear arms, Chief Judge Traxler wrote in his ruling.

Protecting gun rights over actual human lives spurred the Onion, a satirical news outlet, to write a letter of thanks from the perspective of an assault rifle on Tuesday."

The minute-long clip, posted on the NRA’s FB page earlier this month, features Dana Loesch of TheBlaze who begins: “They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.”

The ad continues with Loesch declaring that “their” former president advocated resistance, leading to protests that “bully and terrorize the law-abiding.”

“The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country, and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth,” the spokeswoman concludes. “I’m the National Rifle Association of America and I’m freedom’s safest place.”

Many commenters, including some who say they are gun owners, blasted the ad for being “incendiary” and “divisive” while “encouraging violence.”

A 50-year-old former Republican from the Midwest replied to the video on Facebook, calling it “Orwellian nonsense designed to make you cheer and fist pump for your ‘freedom’ like dogs drooling when the bell gets rung.”

The commenter, who asked not to be named because he feared for his safety, said he owns firearms for his own protection and for occasional target practice. He told HuffPost that despite the negative reaction to the video in some corners, he suspects it won’t damage the NRA.

“I don’t think much of anything can actually backfire on them, to be honest,” he said. “Much of their core membership seems impervious to logic and reason, sadly.”

The NRA did not immediately return a request for comment on the criticism."

Massachusetts-based company Bullet Blocker told HuffPost on Wednesday that sales of its Kevlar-enforced book bags have increased about 30 percent since a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Guard Dog Security, based in Sanford, Florida, also told HuffPost there was a “significant increase” in sales of its bulletproof backpacks ― something both companies say they now expect after a mass-casualty attack.

“The last time we had an upswing like this one was after Sandy Hook and the truck attack in France,” Joe Curran, founder of Bullet Blocker, told the Boston Herald, referencing the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and a 2016 attack in the south of France.

“Any violent occurrence gets people thinking in survival mode,” he said.

Bullet Blocker This backpack by Bullet Blocker is designed to shield people from handgun bullets.

Guard Dog Security’s president, Yasir Sheikh, declined to specify the exact number of backpacks it had recently sold, but described a roughly 150 percent increase in sales to Tampa-based station WFTS. As of Wednesday, all the company’s bulletproof backpacks were sold out.

“People want their bags faster than we can provide them,” he told HuffPost.

Both companies’ products offer Level IIIA ballistic protection, as rated by the National Institute of Justice. In an email to HuffPost, Bullet Blocker’s Amanda Curran described that rating as the highest level of soft body armor available.

Bullet Blocker Soft body armor panels, manufactured by Bullet Blocker, are capable of blocking bullets from a handgun.

That means it’s capable of stopping a bullet from a handgun, but not from a rifle like an AR-15 ― a semi-automatic civilian version of the military’s M16 that has become the recent gun of choice for mass shooters.

Authorities suspect that weapon was used in last week’s mass shooting in Florida, as well as in the November church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which left 26 people dead. It was also one of several guns a shooter used in October to kill 58 people and injure hundreds more at a music festival in Las Vegas. The gunman who killed 49 people and injured more than 50 others at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, used a similar semi-automatic rifle, a Sig Sauer MCX, in June 2016.

UltraONEs via Getty Images Semi-automatic rifles, like the AR-15, have been the most common firearm of choice during recent mass shootings.

The mass shooter who killed 20 elementary school students and six teachers in Newtown, Connecticut also used an AR-15. Shortly before that, a shooter used an AR-15 to kill 12 people and injure 58 others at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.

When tested against these bulletproof backpacks, the AR-15 blows clean through them.

“That’s a whole other level of ballistic protection,” Joe Curran told the Boston Herald of the rifle’s firepower.

It would take a Level III shield or greater to protect someone against an AR-15, which Bullet Blocker and Guard Dog Security don’t sell, Amanda Curran said.

WFTS Bullet holes from an AR-15 rifle appear in the back of Guard Dog Security's bulletproof backpack.

Sheikh said he isn’t aware of anything on the market that would protect against an AR-15, though his company is working to find a solution.

“We’re exploring all options to see what we could do,” he told HuffPost.

Jeffrey Kimball, a former police officer and firearms instructor at Arms Room in League City, Texas, told Houston-based station KTRK that rifle-proof shields are currently only used by the military or SWAT officers. Equipping a backpack with one would mean outfitting the bag with metal plates that would dramatically weigh it down, he said.

Though the bags can’t shield their owners from a rifle, Kimball expressed support for the products, reasoning that some protection is better than none."

Unfortunately, a narrative that should be shocking is starting to sound more like a tired trope. Before the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter was identified, we could have guessed who he'd be.

In the wake of the heartbreaking Newtown shooting, as we collectively mourn the loss of 20 young children and 7 adults, a lot of very necessary conversations have begun -- about gun control legislation and about greater federal funding for and access to mental health care. In addition to these indisputably important topics, we need to talk about this country's twisted vision of masculinity.

Of the 62 mass shootings that have occurred in the United States since 1982, 61 have been committed by men. The average age of these men was 35, and 44 of the 61 male shooters were white, according to Mother Jones. I don't believe that men are necessarily genetically predisposed to violence or that men are ""worse"" people than women. (In fact, recent numbers on violent crime indicate that women are slowly beginning to close the gender gap for violent crime arrests.) I do think, however, that the statistics on men who massacre say something upsetting about the way we equate masculinity with physical power. That sentiment has never been so clear as in an advertisement for the .223-calibre semiautomatic Bushmaster rifle -- the gun that 20-year-old Adam Lanza used to murder 27 people, and the civilian version of the assault rifle our troops have used in Afghanistan and Iraq. This morning author and activist Jessica Valenti tweeted an image of the ad:

The tagline reads ""Consider Your Man Card Reissued."" In a press release for the marketing campaign, distributed in 2010, Bushmaster Firearms explained how one becomes a ""card-carrying man"":

...visitors of bushmaster.com will have to prove they're a man by answering a series of manhood questions. Upon successful completion, they will be issued a temporary Man Card to proudly display to friends and family. The Man Card is valid for one year. Visitors can also call into question or even revoke the Man Card of friends they feel have betrayed their manhood. The man in question will then have to defend himself, and their Man Card, by answering a series of questions geared towards proving indeed, they are worthy of retaining their card.

The fact that a company is selling deadly weapons based on the premise that it will up the purchaser's ""man cred"" is disturbing in itself. The message that it sends about what it means to be a man in America is even more so -- especially because, as Gawker reported, this campaign has been running for more than two years. Guns may not kill people (on their own), but disaffected men with easy access to guns and little understanding of how to safely and sanely express their frustrations with the world certainly do. These same men grew up in a country that glorifies male violence as entertainment. We need to start asking ourselves why we've let 30 years of mass shootings overwhelmingly committed by men occur without bothering to really question the pattern that emerges.

Of course, I'm far from the first person to point out this connection. AlterNet's Chauncey DeVega asked two days ago why we're so reluctant to ""delve deeper into the relationship(s) between whiteness, masculinity, and gun violence."" And in a press release for his 2008 book on the subject of hypermasculinity and violence, UCLA professor of education Douglas Kellner said: ""The school shooters and domestic terrorists examined in this book all exhibit male rage, attempt to resolve a crisis of masculinity through violent behavior, demonstrate a fetish for guns or weapons, and represent, in general, a situation of guys and guns amok.""

As we struggle to make sense of Friday's massacre, we need to begin bringing masculinity into our conversations. And we need to teach boys that being a ""real man"" means using your words instead of your fists ... or your knives ... or your semiautomatic rifles.

The demonstration was organized by Teens For Gun Reform, an organization created by students in the Washington, D.C., area in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Protesters participated in what they said would be a three-minute lie-in, which began around 12:30 p.m. on Presidents Day. They lay down in front of the White House “in representation of the victims of school shootings,” according to a post on the group’s Facebook page.

“By doing this, we will make a statement on the atrocities which have been committed due to the lack of gun control, and send a powerful message to our government that they must take action now,” the group wrote on Facebook.

Following the lie-in, protesters continued to hold signs in support of stricter guns laws and shouted phrases including “Shame on you” and “Disarm hate” toward the White House. The group also chanted “No more deaths,” “Am I next?” and “Hey, hey, NRA, how many kids have you killed today?”

Last week’s massacre at the South Florida high school, in which a 19-year-old former student opened fire using an assault-style rifle, sparked protests and calls to action from students nationwide.

A group of students who survived the Parkland shooting have been outspoken in their criticism of Trump and lawmakers who receive financial contributions from gun lobbying groups such as the National Rifle Association.

On Sunday, the students announced plans for a march on Washington to demand congressional action on gun violence. The event, dubbed “March For Our Lives,” is scheduled for March 24.

Whitney Bowen and Eleanor Nuechterlein, both 16-year-old high school students from the D.C. area, started Teens For Gun Reform just two days after the Parkland shooting.

We might be 16 now and we might not be able to vote, but we can protest and we can use social media and we will make our voices heard. Whitney Bowen, co-founder of Teens For Gun Reform

“You never wake up thinking it’s going to be your school or it’s going to be your friends or family,” Bowen told HuffPost. “The Parkland kids didn’t either. ... They woke up and went to school for the last time because there’s not enough gun control.”

Monday’s protest at the White House was planned on Presidents Day for symbolic reasons, Nuechterlein said. It’s not enough for President Donald Trump and other politicians to say “sorry” after school shootings, she said, they also need to start taking real legislative action to prevent them from happening.

Both Bowen and Nuechterlein said they plan to attend next month’s march on Washington.

“We might be 16 now and we might not be able to vote, but we can protest and we can use social media and we will make our voices heard,” Bowen said. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t come down to politics. It comes down to kids dying in classrooms.”

Elodie Camus, a 15-year-old student at the British International School of Washington, D.C., participated in the White House protest Monday with her mother.

U.S. gun laws “have put so many people in danger over the years in this country and there needs to be reform,” Camus told HuffPost, adding that she no longer feels “safe at all” at school.

“Something needs to be changed so not as many people are harmed,” she said.

Felicia Garber, whose two daughters survived the Parkland shooting, was in D.C. with her family when she heard about Monday’s protest and decided to attend the demonstration.

“We felt it was important to be present and thank the people who felt it was worth coming out here on this cold, dreary, rainy holiday to help let whoever is in this beautiful White House know that we will not take this any longer,” Garber told HuffPost.

“These legislators need to step up for our children and not just for these lobbyists,” she continued. ”[Parkland] kids are smart, educated, savvy ... and they are outraged. These are young adults who are ready and unforgiving, and I can only hope this is the beginning of the change they can create for our country.”

Several other student-led protests against gun violence erupted across Florida on Monday. Students staged a walk out at Olympic Heights Community High School in West Boca Raton, while parents joined their kids in front of American Heritage School in Plantation just 30 miles to the south.

It also reignited fierce debates on gun control across the country.

Lawmakers, often split along party lines, have debated whether strengthening restrictions on guns would curb America’s all-too-common mass shootings, or whether it would be more effective to increase the number of guns in schools and other soft targets. At the federal level, President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he’d ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take steps to ban bump stocks, a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire as quickly as a machine gun.

Here’s what some states have done, and not done, in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Florida

State lawmakers on Tuesday refused to debate a gun control measure that would have banned any “selective-fire firearm capable of fully automatic, semiautomatic or burst fire,” including the AR-15 rifle, the type used in the Parkland shooting. State Rep. Kionne McGhee (D) pushed to bring the bill out of committee and to the floor, but the proposal was rejected in a 36-71 procedural vote. A Florida Senate committee, however, endorsed a proposal to put law enforcement officers in every school in the state.

Hawaii

Lawmakers in Hawaii are considering a bill that would make it a felony to own or sell multi-burst triggers on firearms and other trigger modifications. H.B. 1908, introduced in January, has passed out of the state House Judiciary Committee, and a second hearing took place on Wednesday before the House Committee on Consumer Protection and Commerce. The bill would amend existing state law such that anyone who manufactures, imports into Hawaii, sells, or owns a bump stock could be charged with a felony.

Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania lawmakers have introduced 11 bills meant to curb gun violence in the week since the Parkland shooting. The measures covered by the bills range from making it harder for citizens to get access to assault-style weapons, like the one used in Parkland, to requiring background checks for all gun sales. State Rep. Warren Kampf (R) introduced seven of the 11 bills, including one to ban bump stocks. Several of the bills would make it possible for individuals to petition a court to remove someone’s guns if they show signs of violence.

Illinois

Illinois state Rep. Marty Moylan (D) introduced a bill two days after the Florida shooting to ban the manufacture, sale, purchase, and possession of “rate of fire enhancements,” a category of devices and accessories that includes bump stocks. Moylan and state Sen. Julie Morrison (D) have also doubled down on their calls to move forward gun control bills introduced before the Parkland shooting, including one to ban assault weapons and one to ban unregistered, often home-manufactured weapons known as “ghost guns.”

Wisconsin

Republican lawmakers on Tuesday blocked Democrats’ attempt to vote on a bill that would implement universal background checks for gun purchases in Wisconsin. Democratic lawmakers had attempted to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, but Republicans used a procedural tactic to avoid the vote and replace the measure with one to fund school grants to provide firearms to safety officers and curb illegal firearm purchases. Lawmakers approved that measure by a 71-24 vote.

Arizona

Republican state lawmakers on Tuesday blocked their Democratic colleagues’ attempt to push for a vote on a bill to ban bump stocks and other rate-of-fire modifications. Nearly a dozen other gun-related measures have stalled in the state legislature recently, only one of which has received a hearing. That bill, which passed out of a state House committee on the same day as the Parkland shooting, would end gun safety requirements previously imposed on foster parents; in other words, it represents an attempt to erode gun restrictions, not strengthen them.

South Carolina

Republicans and Democrats in South Carolina debated measures to curb gun violence in the wake of the Florida shooting. House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford (D) said he planned to introduce a bill to ban the sale of AR-15 rifles to anyone under the age of 20 ― a measure that Republican lawmakers in the state largely oppose. Instead, Republicans have pushed measures to arm teachers and allow concealed-weapon permit holders to carry their firearms in more locations.

Ohio

State Sens. Michael Skindell (D) and Charleta Tavares (D) this week proposed a ban on “assault weapons,” defined in the bill as any automatic or semiautomatic firearm with the capacity to accept 10 or more cartridges. The measure would require owners of assault-style weapons to dispose of the firearms, and would make it a felony to own such a gun.

Oregon

Gov. Kate Brown (D) spoke before the state Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, throwing her support behind a proposal to expand an existing ban on the purchase or possession of firearms or ammunition by people convicted of stalking or domestic violence or who have a restraining order against them. The state House approved the legislation on Feb. 15, a day after the Florida shooting. It is now being considered by the state Senate.

New Jersey

Gov. Phil Murphy (D) signaled his support on Tuesday for a number of bills currently moving through the state legislature, including measures to reduce the permitted size of ammunition magazines, require background checks for private gun sales, and ban certain types of firearms and ammunition.

Illegal firearms are indeed a piece of America’s gun violence epidemic. But new research suggests that many legal gun owners aren’t as responsible as they claim.

The new study, published in the journal Pediatrics last month, found that as many as 44 percent of homes with children also had firearms. In those homes with guns, only 35 percent of parents or caretakers stored the weapons according to American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations that they be unloaded and locked in a safe. The gun storage responses were similar, regardless of whether a child in the home had a mental illness, such as depression, which is a risk factor for suicide.

“Parents may really misjudge or discount their child’s underlying risk,” said Dr. Matthew Miller, study author and professor at Northeastern University, as well as an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “They have too much confidence in the instructions they’ve given their kids or how they’ve hidden their gun.”

Joe Skipper / Reuters A young man views memorials on a fence surrounding Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, U.S., February 23, 2018.

It’s not a negligible risk. Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for kids ages 10 to 17 in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And firearms are a particularly deadly suicide method, which explains why, for children in this age group, 40 percent of suicides involved guns. The CDC said 633 children died in suicides involving firearms in 2016, and 53 kids were killed in accidental or unintended firearm incidents.

Republican politicians, the National Rifle Association and gun companies push the message that a firearm in the home keeps Americans safe. But scientific research doesn’t support this messaging.

Instead, studies show that that a gun in the home creates more risk than benefit, and drives up occupants’ chances for firearm accidents, suicide and intimate-partner homicide. Moreover, an analysis of 16 gun violence studies found that adolescents are at the greatest risk for suicide.

Though the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, has rightly garnered national attention and public sympathy, firearm suicide is a bigger threat to kids than mass shooting. While about 600 kids die by firearm suicide annually, 176 children and teenagers have been killed in mass shootings since 1966, according to The Washington Post.

“This is a day-in and day-out problem in our country,” Dr. David Wesson said of gun violence.

Wesson, a pediatric surgeon at Texas Children’s Hospital not affiliated with the new study, treats children with gunshot wounds regularly. (Wesson said he’s more likely to treat kids caught in crossfire than suicide cases, in part because many kids who attempt suicide with a gun die before they reach the ER, and because nonfatal gunshot wounds are so common. The CDC recorded 6,473 nonfatal gunshot wounds in children ages 10 to 17 in 2015.)

“Incidents [like Parkland] that involved large number of fatalities are newsworthy, but just a small fraction of people who are harmed and killed every year,” Wesson said."

Young'],2018-02-24 08:01:13-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-young-nra-history_us_5a907fbee4b03b55731c2169,"On Thursday, Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association and unofficial leader of America’s largest cult, took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting in Washington, D.C.

In another universe – or maybe even just in another nation – one might imagine that the leader of the country’s largest gun organization giving an address less than one week after yet another school shooting had left 17 people dead would appear circumspect, contrite, even ashamed.

Railing against the media and the “growing socialist state,” LaPierre vowed that the NRA would not retreat from its defense of gun rights. And as a student-led movement for gun control continued to build in Florida and across the nation, LaPierre depicted the NRA as the best protector of vulnerable children. “Evil walks among us,” LaPierre said, “and God help us if we don’t harden our schools and protect our kids.”

This is the fantasy that the NRA has peddled for decades and that has created our current nightmare. But the NRA’s delusion exposes not only its moral rot, but also its continual turn from its own history. Begun as an organization devoted to education and safety, it’s only in the last 50 years that the NRA has instead dedicated itself to preserving the very circumstances that most endanger Americans’ lives today, especially the nation’s schoolchildren.

In 1871, the NRA was founded by William Church, a lawyer, and George Wingate, a former newspaper reporter. Wingate explained his new organization’s purpose as working to “promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis.”

To that end, the NRA operated mostly as a sporting club and hunting association for its first 100 years. It put a heavy emphasis on gun safety education and training, especially for young people. Church and Wingate had been inspired to create their organization in part from their experience as soldiers during the Civil War, where they had been appalled by the poor marksmanship skills of their fellow fighters. Guns were dangerous, especially in untrained hands, the two men understood. The NRA organized safety clinics and target-shooting competitions to teach young men (and later women) proper gun use and the obligations of responsible firearm ownership.

Talk of rights, freedom, and self-defense ... has given cover for the modern NRA’s real work as the craven lobbyist of gun manufacturers.

Guns were also dangerous in the wrong hands, so the NRA often supported gun control laws in the first half of the 20th Century. It backed the National Firearms Act of 1934 and, four years later, the Federal Firearms Act, plus a host of measures at the state level. These various laws, among other things, required licenses for gun dealers, levied heavy taxes on machine guns, instituted waiting periods for buying handguns and mandated permits for concealed weapons.

All of this work – education, safety training and gun control advocacy – represented the NRA’s sense of the limits of gun ownership and the organization’s obligation to protect Americans from gun violence in all its forms. Occasionally, the NRA also opposed gun control laws it saw as unnecessary or excessive, but it rarely invoked “gun rights” as the basis for doing so. As one scholar has noted, any mention in the NRA’s publications and pronouncements of the Second Amendment “was glaringly absent before the early 1960s.”

All of that changed during the cultural upheaval of the late 1960s and 1970s. Citing rising crime rates and social unrest as their rationale, a band of gun rights hardliners wrested control of the NRA from the old guard safety and sporting advocates.

Amid the era’s “rights revolution,” the NRA’s new leaders put forward a new right of their own, one they claimed had been there since the nation’s founding. (It’s no small point that the NRA promotes itself as “America’s longest-standing civil rights organization.”) The Second Amendment, the NRA now argued, gave individuals an absolute right to gun ownership, one that the federal government couldn’t limit in any way. It was a radical reinterpretation of what had been the common perception of the amendment for nearly two centuries.

With its talk of rights, freedom and self-defense, the NRA has presented itself as the tireless defender of embattled gun owners for nearly half a century. The truth, however, is that such language has given cover for the modern NRA’s real work as the craven lobbyist of gun manufacturers.

Americans buy more firearms when they believe their guns are about to be taken away, a paranoia the NRA has been all too eager to exploit. (In the perverse pattern that now plays out after nearly every mass shooting in the United States, gun sales have increased in the week since the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, for exactly this reason.) While the NRA warns gun owners that the Second Amendment is under attack, it stokes fears that help line the pockets of their gun manufacturing friends.

In return, gun manufacturers generously reward the NRA with vital funds. Those dollars represent a significant departure from the organization’s early years when it routinely touted its independence from corporate interests, but it’s a necessary arrangement now as the NRA experiences decreasing membership. A 2013 report found that gun makers had given the NRA between $20 and $52.6 million in the previous eight years alone. The NRA also regularly makes money from some gun companies that give a portion of their sales to the organization.

When politicians argue that the only solution to mass shootings is arming more Americans, they play directly into the hands of the NRA and gun companies alike. They also reveal how completely the NRA, supported by self-interested gun makers, have limited Americans’ imaginations about what is politically possible when it comes to gun violence.

All of this is a result of the symbiotic relationship that has been highly profitable for both the NRA and for gun makers. But for thousands of Americans, it must be remembered, the cost has been deadly."

In the wake of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last week that left 17 people dead, the group has put forward a petition that uses the language of the anti-abortion movement to encourage fellow Christians to fight for gun reform.

The signers claim it’s their “Biblical responsibility” to urge America’s lawmakers to pass common-sense gun legislation that will “protect life.” Though the meaning of “common-sense” varies for individuals in the group, they’re generally looking for tighter background checks, ensuring that certain high-risk individuals are prohibited from purchasing firearms, and potentially banning certain high-capacity and semi-automatic weapons.

The petition has the backing of at least 16 evangelical leaders, including Max Lucado, the best-selling Christian author, Lynne Hybels, co-founder of the Illinois megachurch Willow Creek Community Church, and Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition.

Because of his background as a militant anti-abortion activist, Schenck is a controversial figure in progressive circles. Some have questioned his commitment to gun control, given his past statements and lifetime membership in the National Rifle Association ― which Schenck justifies by saying it was a gift from a financial supporter of his ministry and something he uses to “listen and learn” about the ideologies of those involved in popular gun culture.

But he says he’s modified his stance on gun legislation and become an ally in the fight for stricter gun laws. For years, he’s tried to encourage his faith community to break from its longstanding support of gun rights.

It’s a difficult task, but Schenck is optimistic. “I believe there is a change happening among evangelicals,” the preacher told HuffPost. “We will see a tipping point when many evangelicals will begin advocating for sensible gun safety measures.”

The ‘Prayers And Action’ Campaign

Schenck’s petition for gun reform started circulating in the evangelical community after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November. It was released widely on Monday and has gathered over 200 signatures by Friday, according to the campaign’s site. Only a handful of those names are publicly listed on the site. The rest of the signatures are being funneled into a database that will be used to keep signers up to date with future actions, Schenck said.

The pastor told HuffPost that he wants to keep the petition an “evangelical family matter” and is hesitant to expose the signers to criticism from the larger faith community. His first purpose is to “find friends” in the community who care about gun reform.

And he thinks framing gun reform as an effort to “protect life” could help swing the conversation for evangelical Christians.

“Evangelicals believe deeply in the sanctity of every human life. Any public policy that contributes to a disregard for human life is a violation of this tenet,” Schenck told HuffPost. “The lives of children are especially precious to God and should always be for Christians.”

A Deep Loyalty To Guns

The task of rallying evangelical support for stricter gun control legislation is bound to be an uphill battle. As a whole, white American evangelicals are some of the strongest supporters of gun rights. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 41 percent of white evangelicals own guns, more than members of other faith groups.

Pew could not break out black evangelical Protestants in the survey, due to a small sample size. However, the researchers did conclude that only 29 percent of a larger category, black Protestants, own a gun. (An estimated two-thirds of black Protestants identify as evangelicals.)

White evangelicals are more likely than most Americans to say that their right to own guns is essential to their sense of freedom (70 percent vs. 47 percent). Twenty-four percent of black Protestants said the same. White evangelicals also said that they are satisfied with gun laws in this country (44 percent). Sixteen percent of black Protestants agreed.

In addition, a 2013 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute found that many evangelicals don’t see a contradiction in labeling themselves “pro-life” while opposing gun control. In fact, among the white evangelical Protestants who said the term “pro-life” described them very well, a majority (64 percent) also said they opposed stricter gun control laws.

Schenck’s experiences have taught him that for many evangelicals, guns are a “volatile issue.” He believes evangelicals’ loyalty towards guns stems from deep-seated distrust of the government.

“Evangelicals have long felt like a persecuted minority, even though we enjoy some of the largest, most influential, and wealthiest churches and institutions in the country. This misperception makes many in my community fearful of government oppression,” he said.

“There is a deep emotional and psychological bond between people that are fearful and the instruments they feel will protect them, their loved ones, and their way of life,” Schenck told HuffPost.

A Broader ‘Pro-Life’ Movement

At the same time, Schenck senses that a change is brewing in some communities ― people are becoming increasingly concerned and anxious about gun violence, particularly mass shootings.

“More and more voices calling for restrictions on gun access are being heard. We are trying to curate those voices and give them a united platform to speak from,” Schenck told HuffPost about his campaign.

“We’ve been actively reaching out to evangelical leaders, mostly behind the scenes, and are finding many that are distressed by our seemingly unrestrained enthusiasm for easy gun access — and the perception that all evangelicals have a kind of bloodlust for firearms,” he added. “That’s not true, particularly when it comes to under-40 evangelicals and their pastors.”

Kathryn Freeman, director of public policy for the ethics commission of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, is one of the evangelical leaders who publicly signed Schenck’s petition (although she pointed out she is not speaking on behalf of her organization). Freeman says she believes in working to support human flourishing “from the womb to the tomb.” For her, that includes supporting “common-sense gun legislation.”

“I am concerned about gun violence in this country, because I think to do nothing is to devalue human life, to treat that which God deems of ultimate value as of no value at all,” the Baptist leader told HuffPost. “Reducing gun violence is part of what it means to love God’s people and want them to flourish.”

For These Strange Bedfellows, The Ends Justify The Means

Over the years, Schenck has gone through an evolution in his views about gun reform. When he first began speaking up about this issue, he didn’t think the answer to gun violence would be found in more federal laws. In 2015, he claimed it wasn’t an issue about “gun control, but of self-control.”

Today, Schenck says he’s still hesitant about the phrase “gun control,” since it suggests to gun owners that the government is seeking to “control” their personal behavior. He prefers the phrase “gun regulation.”

He’s also hesitant about pushing for more federal controls, preferring that local and state governments take the lead. But he told HuffPost he now realizes that there are important instances when federal laws are needed ― such as when it comes to closing the gun show loophole and making sure all firearm purchases are routed through federal background checks.

“You have to deal with reality and the reality is that in many of these instances, the only remedy is on the federal level. I’ve acquiesced to that,” he said.

Lucy McBath is a faith and outreach leader for the gun control advocacy groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She told HuffPost she’s known and worked with Schenck for about four years. The pair were the subjects of the documentary “Armor of Light,” a 2015 documentary about the evangelical response to gun violence.

McBath identifies as an evangelical Christian herself, but supports women’s right to make their own choices about their reproductive health. Although she and Schenck don’t see eye to eye on abortion, McBath said she supports Schenck’s efforts to rally the evangelical community around gun control. Not everyone in her movement is going to be happy with that stance, she said, but she believes people on opposite ends of the political spectrum are going to need to come together to try to solve the issue of gun violence.

“What I like to say to people is we need everybody,” McBath told HuffPost. “We need gun owners, we need non-gun owners, we need people of faith, people of no faith. We need everybody because gun violence is a nonpartisan issue. We all have to be able to come to some common ground to work together to make sure we’re changing this dangerous gun culture.”

We need everybody because gun violence is a nonpartisan issue. Lucy McBath

Other gun control advocates seem to agree. The Rev. Jim Atwood, a board member of Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and a retired Presbyterian minister, said that he would welcomes the activism of Schenck and other evangelical Christians who want to fight for gun reform.

“I can’t speak for everybody but I would think that’s what we need to do,” Atwood told HuffPost. “We need to cross boundaries, cross lines of different political entities and work together.”

Looking at the list of prominent evangelicals who have publicly signed Schenck’s petition, McBath said she’s excited about the potential in that group. In her years as an activist, she said she’s never seen this level of support from evangelical leaders.

McBath hopes to see more of it.

“We need to see this kind of solidarity across denominational lines,” she said. “Because the end goal is saving lives.”

A Growing Sense Of Urgency

Dr. Jamie Aten, one of the signers of Schenck’s petition, is the executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian institution. In that role, Aten helps churches prepare to respond to disasters in their communities, including mass shootings.

In the past, he said that he tried to avoid controversial topics like this. But now he believes that “silence only divides people further.”

“I think we owe it to the victims and survivors of mass shootings, and to each other, to do what we can to try and prevent this from happening again and prioritizing that in our policies,” Aten said.

After the shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs, congregations around the country grew increasingly worried about security. But unless sensible gun laws are passed, Aten worries that churches’ preparedness efforts will fall short. As it stands, he believes evangelical Christians’ affinity for gun culture “does more to protect our fear than it does the lives of innocent people.”

Rev. Dr. Joel Hunter, a former megachurch pastor from Florida who served as one of President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers, also signed Schenck’s petition. He believes that a “pro-life ethic” is the key ingredient needed to move the needle on evangelicals’ beliefs about gun control. Hunter is optimistic that more members of his faith community will sign on to Schenck’s campaign after witnessing teenage activists protesting against guns since the Florida school shooting.

“I think the connection will be made, the more carnage that is accumulated,” Hunter said. “I think people will begin to see this as a life and death issue.”

Schenck said that as a pastor, he understands the strong emotions that evangelicals associated with gun rights ― particularly the fear they have about any supposed threats to those rights. But in the end, he hopes that his community will be patient and “listen before they judge.”"
huffpo125,huffpo,"['Igor Bobic', 'Politics Reporter']",2018-02-27 17:12:02-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gun-control-immigration_us_5a95c31ce4b09c872bae8e19,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has been all over the place on guns, but he hasn’t yet done the one thing that helps move votes in Congress: publicly support specific legislation to address gun violence.

In the days since the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida, the president has suggested arming teachers, toughening background checks, opening more mental hospitals and increasing the age limit to buy some weapons to 21. Last week, he directed his administration to regulate bump stocks, the gun accessory used to simulate automatic fire in the 2017 Las Vegas attack.

Trump has even urged state governors not to be afraid of the National Rifle Association, the nation’s most powerful gun lobby, as they seek to address school safety ― a remarkable thing for a Republican president to say.

Yuri Gripas/Bloomberg via Getty Images President Trump appears to prefer talking about gun control over passing it.

“Don’t worry about the NRA. They’re on our side,” Trump told a bipartisan gathering of governors on Monday during a White House meeting. “If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That’s OK. They’re doing what they think is right.”

It’s not hard to understand why Trump has tried to move to the middle on guns. Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to its highest level since 1993, according to a recent CNN poll, with 70 percent of Americans now saying they support more gun control. That’s up from the 52 percent who said they supported stricter gun laws in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, where 58 people died. Trump’s approval rating, meanwhile, has slumped again to match the lowest of his presidency.

Yet Republicans in Congress, many of whom are facing competitive primaries ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, seem no more willing to tackle the issue of gun control. Without clear direction from the leader of their party, it’s unlikely they’ll do so in a substantial way this year.

“If President Trump weighs in ― and leans in ― we could see some reasonable changes on things like bump stocks and age restrictions. If not, the status quo will largely remain,” said Doug Heye, a veteran Republican operative and former Republican National Committee communications director.

Trump’s tactics on guns so far have mirrored his handling of the immigration debate. Early in conversations with lawmakers over the legal status of young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, the president expressed a desire to pursue comprehensive immigration reform and even said he’d be willing to “take the heat” from his supporters if Congress decided to act. He also told lawmakers that he would sign any bill they sent him that would institutionalize President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, buoying activists’ hopes that Congress would reach a compromise.

Yet his vague promises and platitudes on immigration were quickly followed by intense lobbying from immigration hawks in the White House and the Department of Homeland Security against a bipartisan measure in the Senate that would have paired $25 billion for border security with a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Neither that bill nor other competing ones received enough votes to advance.

With more Republicans expressing skepticism this week about additional restrictions on guns, Trump seems to be heading toward a similar backtrack. The president, per CNN, appears to be softening his position on raising the age at which people can purchase AR-15 rifles, the weapon used in the Parkland massacre, and similar weapons. But a White House spokesperson insisted Tuesday that the president still supported the idea.

It’s also unclear what kind of bill toughening background checks Trump is willing to endorse. Democrats are calling for universal gun background checks, while Republicans support more modest efforts to beef up the national background check system. Trump is scheduled to meet with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a top gun control advocate, to discuss the matter on Wednesday.

“We expect to have some specific policy proposals later this week,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Tuesday.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) called on the Senate the same day to “immediately” pass a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, which he co-sponsored with Murphy. The measure, called Fix NICS, would require states to produce an implementation plan focused on uploading all gun purchaser information to the federal background check system and penalize federal agencies if they failed to record that information.

Democratic senators support Cornyn’s bill but call it a “tiny” effort to curb gun violence. They would also like the Senate to consider more gun-related initiatives, such as an assault weapons ban, magazine restrictions and stricter background checks ― all ideas opposed by Republicans and the NRA.

“My sense is Republicans aren’t going to move here on serious gun legislation unless the president pre-endorses it, so what he says in the next few days and what he says tomorrow will be important,” Murphy said Tuesday.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) agreed that it would be helpful if Trump said what he preferred Congress to do on the issue of guns."

“Amen,” an off-camera voice answered.

Robertson, who suffered a stroke earlier this month, asked for a ban on “bump stocks,” which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire as rapidly as machine guns. Weapons with bump stocks were used last year by Stephen Paddock during the Las Vegas shooting, which left 58 people dead and hundreds injured.

Robertson also called for more thorough background checks, including a medical check.

“If somebody is seeing a psychiatrist, is on medication, he or she needs to be prohibited from being turned loose on the general population,” he said. “It’s just got to be, y’know, sensible.”

A gun owner and a hunter, Robertson hasn’t exactly been a voice of moderation in the gun control debate. In 2014, he encouraged churches to arm worshippers.

“Blessed are the fully armed,” he said then.

Last year, Robertson linked the mass shooting at a Texas church to antidepressants and urged people not to use the attack to push for gun control.

“I hope and pray they don’t politicize this thing and start talking about gun control and all that because it won’t be necessary,” he said at the time, according to Media Matters.

Now, however, the 87-year-old seems to have altered his stance.

“I think we can ban those things without too much trouble,” Robertson said on Tuesday, referring to automatic weapons. “We can stop that.”

The AR-15-style rifle used in the Florida school shooting, as well as several other mass killings, is a semiautomatic. Since it is not an automatic weapon, it would not be affected by the ban Robertson suggested."

CHICAGO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The FBI performed a record number of instant background checks on would-be firearm buyers in 2011 as Americans went on an apparent gun-buying spree, according to new government data.

The FBI said it fielded nearly 16.5 million queries from firearms sellers last year, checking that customers buying guns did not have criminal records or other red flags that made them ineligible to purchase weapons.

That was up 15 percent from 2010, when the FBI performed 14.4 million screenings using its so-called National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and the highest number of annual screenings performed since 1998, when the checks went into effect.

The FBI cautioned that each background check did not necessarily represent an individual firearm sale, in part because some would-be buyers fail to pass the screening.

But FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer said the background checks are correlated with weapon purchases. So the uptick in screenings last year suggests that an increase in gun sales the agency has been tracking for several years was continuing.

Fischer declined to analyze or comment on the jump in firearms purchases, saying the bureau's responsibility was only ""to operate and maintain the NICS system.""

But Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, said he believed the political uncertainty surrounding next year's general election was prompting would-be gun buyers to accelerate purchases.

Arulanandam said the jump in sales since 2006 largely reflected concern that the Democrats swept into office in recent years, including President Barack Obama, would curb the right to bear arms.

BUYING SURGE SINCE 2006

Purchases of handguns and rifles, which had held steady throughout the early part of the decade, began to surge in 2006 and have nearly doubled since then, FBI data showed.

Kentucky, which ranks 26th nationally in terms of population, topped the state rankings for pre-purchase background checks in 2011, the FBI said.

Gun sellers in the Bluegrass State, which has just 4.3 million residents, generated almost 2.3 million instant background checks in 2011 - accounting for roughly one of every seven the FBI processed during the year.

But Fischer said Kentucky's numbers were distorted because the state runs a fresh background check every month on gun owners with state-issued concealed weapons permits.

Texas, which ranks No. 2 in population according to the Census Bureau, ranked No. 2 in the background checks as well, with 1.15 million screening requests in 2011.

Texas was followed by Utah, which accounted for nearly a quarter of the overall increase in checks and sales in 2011.

Utah is an increasingly popular place for gun owners from all over the country to get a concealed-firearms permit because it is cheap, easy to apply for even if buyers do not live in Utah, and recognized in nearly three dozen other states.

'PACKING HEAT'

The FBI data for 2011 was released close to the Jan. 8 anniversary of the shooting rampage in Tucson, Arizona, that killed 6 people and injured 13, including Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords.

That incident raised serious questions about the background checks after it emerged that Jared Lee Loughner, the accused shooter, had legally purchased the gun he allegedly used in the attack from a sporting goods store - despite having engaged in bizarre, disruptive behavior well before the shooting.

While the FBI data show the number of background checks have risen, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says there has been no progress on legislative efforts to tighten gun control following the Tucson shooting.

Dennis Henigan, the group's acting president, told Reuters the only gun bill that has come for a vote in Congress since Tucson has been the so-called ""Packing Heat On Your Street"" bill, officially known as ""National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011"" (H.R. 822).

That measure, which has passed the House of Representatives but stalled in the Senate, would make it easier for people to carry concealed handguns across state lines.

""Really it is a national disgrace that the only piece of gun-related legislation to come to a vote since Tucson was this legislation that would have enabled dangerous concealed carriers like Jared Loughner to carry their guns across state lines,"" Henigan said.

But the National Rifle Association says H.R. 822 would only require states to recognize one another's concealed carry permits the same way they recognize one another's driver's licenses, eliminating confusion and potential legal problems for traveling gun owners.

Smith, University of Minnesota

Another week in America, another week of sadness and hand-wringing prompted by gun violence.

While the most recent incidents are tinged by race, they also point to a country awash in guns and the too many deaths that result from their use (or abuse). But are these shootings any more likely to lead to some kind of meaningful action to address the problem?

Unfortunately, probably not. As long as the debate continues to be one of constitutionality (the right to bear arms) and control (regulation), little meaningful change is likely to address the 16 million new guns entering the U.S. market each year or the nearly 34,000 annual gun deaths.

A new dialogue is desperately needed among policymakers and the public. And it could begin by shifting our focus away from the regulation of guns toward understanding (and mitigating) the social costs of firearm fatalities.

My research examines ways to assess the social, environmental and health effects of new technologies to inform policymakers and companies. Though my focus at the University of Minnesota is on sustainability, similar analyses may also be useful for the political debate over gun control.

Firearm fatalities

The current congressional debate focuses on the most violent actors (terrorists or those whose background check may not check out) and the most lethal guns (military-style rifles) -- not necessarily the deadliest guns or those creating the greatest risks to society.

Despite the headlines, most guns never kill anyone, and military-style rifles are some of the least frequently used guns in firearm deaths. Each year, fewer than one firearm-related death occurs in the U.S. for every 10,000 guns in circulation, or 33,636 fatalities for an estimated 357 million guns. And about two-thirds of those deaths are suicides.

Gun deaths associated with mass shootings have surged dramatically in recent years, but are still rare compared with other gun violence. In just the first four months of 2016, 70 mass shootings have been reported (more than all of 2015), with 129 victim fatalities, according to Stanford University's Mass Shootings in America. Adding in Orlando and Dallas, mass shooting deaths in the first half of 2016 equal those of 2015 and are four times the annual average in recent years.

While this is alarming, such deaths represent just a fraction of the number of firearm-related homicides, about 1.6 percent. And military-style rifles were used in just 10 of the 136 mass shootings reported since January 2015.

Any policy to reduce the likelihood of these events should, therefore, reflect the very small probability of a military-style rifle being used in a mass shooting that targets the public -- just one in 575,000 (about 50 deaths out of about 29 million rifles).

New regulation would need to be very restrictive. Millions of these guns would have to be removed from circulation to see any measurable effect on public safety, a politically impossible lift.

Price tag of saving a life

A potential reframing of the issue might be to estimate the social cost of gun deaths, establish the burden borne by each weapon and seek policies that reflect it in the market for firearms.

Across many different areas of government, this kind of analysis is applied all the time when examining the benefits and costs of potential policies. When considering food handling or tracking systems, benefits of reducing the risk of illness and premature death are compared with the costs of implementing the policy. Policies to reduce harmful pollution, improve the safety of automobiles or add bicycle lanes to roads are evaluated in similar ways.

To get at a social cost of mortality, measures have been developed to assess how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying. In aggregate, these values are referred to as the ""value of a statistical life"" (VSL).

This is not how much an actual individual life is worth, but it is an estimate of how much, in total, a large group of people would be willing to pay to save one statistical life. For example, if the average response from a sample of 100,000 people indicated a willingness to pay US$100 to reduce their risk of dying by 0.001 percent, than the VSL would be $10,000,000. So, the total economic cost of mortality in a particular year equals the VSL times the number of premature deaths. Similarly, the economic benefit of a mitigating action becomes the same VSL multiplied by the number of lives saved.

That said, different federal agencies use various valuation methods and assumption. The Environmental Protection Agency's adjusted VSL for 2013 is $9.4 million, the Department of Transportation set its 2013 base year value at $9.1 million and the Department of Agriculture provides a midpoint estimate of $8.66 million.

From a purely economic perspective, the social costs of gun deaths likely exceed $300 billion annually. This is a staggering number, more than what the federal government spent on Medicaid in the same year. And that's not including the more than 80,000 nonfatal firearm injuries each year.

A gun's burden

Identifying guns' overall mortality risk burden doesn't exactly help inform legislation targeting certain types of guns used in certain types of homicides.

But, based on the previous analysis of military-style rifles used in mass shootings, these guns (in these situations) are some of the least costly from a VSL perspective. In fact, the social burden of a single military-style rifle is likely to be as little as $15.77 a year (or $455 million for all rifles based on 50 deaths and a $9.1 million VSL).

It is hard to see how this valuation could deter gun sales enough, or support the implementation of a robust screening and background check system, to make a difference. By comparison, handguns - which are implicated in nearly 70 percent of gun-related homicides - bear a disproportionate burden on society of $401 annually per handgun in circulation.

Policies reducing the burden of gun deaths (e.g., by reducing the number of guns or improving their safety) need to be compared against the additional costs of implementing them. These costs could come as regulations, increased taxes/fees or price increases.

In other words, applying a mortality risk valuation to handguns might cost as much every year as the initial cost to the gun owner. In the current climate, any form of tax or fee approaching this valuation would be a political nonstarter.

A way forward

So, if this analysis leads to societal burdens that are both so low (the case of rifles) and so high (the case of handguns) that neither are politically viable, one can easily understand the paralysis in Congress.

The automobile insurance market, where risks are pooled across geographies, types of vehicles and driving behavior, may provide some insights and a way forward.

Similar to guns, nearly 250 million personal vehicles (or their drivers) were associated with 27,507 deaths in 2013. These premature fatalities tally social costs of $250 billion.

For illustrative purposes, if we assume that half of these damages are associated with no-fault third parties, the social burden for non-policy-holder deaths might be about $502 per vehicle, on average.

Unlike with guns, a robust system of vehicle registration and mandatory insurance requirements exists in this market. If we also assume that about half of each auto's liability policy (estimated at $519 in 2013) covers bodily injuries (not property), these insurance premiums represent about half of each vehicle's societal burden.

I'm not suggesting that these premiums are effective deterrents to poor driving or cover all an accident's damages to society. Rather, incorporating the external costs of mortality risks into the cost of ownership alters the number of cars on the road and how they are used.

Applying this relationship to firearms, an annual social price tag of $140 per gun might go a long way toward mitigating the mortality costs of gun-related homicide. This estimate is a weighted average of different types of guns, ranging from $15/year for rifles to $200/year for handguns.

Nobody likes new taxes or additional fees, and the gun lobby will certainly oppose even the hint of a disincentive on gun ownership. But there may be enough Republican and Democrat lawmakers open to the idea of market-based policies that don't directly restrict gun access, progressively impose higher costs to more dangerous guns and generate resources to improve the safety and security associated with guns in America.

Gun reform doesn't have to be gun control

This back-of-the-napkin analysis may be crude, but it does highlight the need and potential for shifting current arguments away from regulating guns to mitigating the social costs of gun-related deaths.

The devil is always in the details, and important debates will be needed around the imposition of new taxes, registration fees or mandatory insurance. It is unclear who should be affected (owners, retailers, manufacturers) or how to include all of the estimated 357 million guns in the U.S., not just the registered ones.

Policymakers should even consider the impact of these types of economic mechanisms on equity of gun ownership -- maybe gun subsidies would be needed for low-income or first-time gun buyers. Most importantly, policymakers should have much-needed arguments about how to reduce gun deaths.

An $140 annual registration fee, applied only to the 23.1 million guns transacted each year, could generate over $3.2 billion in revenues annually. If nothing else, these resources could bolster local police and security budgets, improve access to gun safety training and education, incentivize new technologies that make guns less dangerous and compensate victims' families.

Anything to break the logjam and actually address the real costs of gun violence.

(Reuters Health) - U.S. teens report easy access to firearms, even when they have mental health problems that put them at an increased risk of suicide, according to a new study.

Overall, 41 percent of teens who reported being in a home with a firearm had easy access to it. Among teens with a history of mental illness or suicidal acts, researchers found that percentage was the same.

The American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics advise healthcare providers to talk about firearm safe storage with parents - especially those with at-risk youths at home.

""Our goal of this study was to find out if those recommendations were being implemented effectively in the community,"" said Dr. Joseph Simonetti, the study's lead author from the University of Washington School of Medicine's Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

Simonetti and his colleagues write in JAMA Psychiatry that suicide is the second leading cause of death for U.S. teens. Having a firearm in the home is one risk factor for suicide, they add.

Previous studies have found a lower suicide risk among residents of homes that practice safe storage of firearms.

For the new study, the authors used data collected between 2001 and 2004 from 10,123 U.S. teens between ages 13 and 18 years.

A third of the teens reported living in a home with a firearm. Of those, about 41 percent said they had easy access to that firearm and the ability to shoot it.

Older, male and non-Hispanic teens were more likely to report being able to access firearms. Those living in rural or wealthy households were also more likely to report access.

Among the teens with histories of mental illness or suicidal actions, such as thoughts or attempts, the researchers found they were just as likely as those without such histories to report firearm access.

""There is a disconnect between these generally agreed upon storage methods and what's happening in the community,"" Simonetti said.

He cautioned that the data included in this study is old. ""One of the limitations of this study is we're using data that was collected from 2001 to 2004,"" Simonetti said, adding that he and his colleagues can't say how practices may have changed since then.

""We need better studies on how to promote safe firearms storage especially in households with children and children with mental illness,"" he said.

Simonetti said some effective safe storage methods include using gun locks and gun cabinets and hiding the keys from children.

This is a common refrain heard in the gun debate. Gun control advocates fear -- and gun rights proponents sometimes hope -- the Second Amendment will transform our cities into modern-day versions of Dodge.

Yet this is all based on a widely shared misunderstanding of the Wild West. Frontier towns -- places like Tombstone, Deadwood, and Dodge -- actually had the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation.

In fact, many of those same cities have far less burdensome gun control today then they did back in the 1800s.

Guns were obviously widespread on the frontier. Out in the untamed wilderness, you needed a gun to be safe from bandits, natives, and wildlife. In the cities and towns of the West, however, the law often prohibited people from toting their guns around. A visitor arriving in Wichita, Kansas in 1873, the heart of the Wild West era, would have seen signs declaring, ""Leave Your Revolvers At Police Headquarters, and Get a Check.""

A check? That's right. When you entered a frontier town, you were legally required to leave your guns at the stables on the outskirts of town or drop them off with the sheriff, who would give you a token in exchange. You checked your guns then like you'd check your overcoat today at a Boston restaurant in winter. Visitors were welcome, but their guns were not.

In my new book, Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, there's a photograph taken in Dodge City in 1879. Everything looks exactly as you'd imagine: wide, dusty road; clapboard and brick buildings; horse ties in front of the saloon. Yet right in the middle of the street is something you'd never expect. There's a huge wooden billboard announcing, ""The Carrying of Firearms Strictly Prohibited.""

While people were allowed to have guns at home for self-protection, frontier towns usually barred anyone but law enforcement from carrying guns in public.

When Dodge City residents organized their municipal government, do you know what the very first law they passed was? A gun control law. They declared that ""any person or persons found carrying concealed weapons in the city of Dodge or violating the laws of the State shall be dealt with according to law."" Many frontier towns, including Tombstone, Arizona--the site of the infamous ""Shootout at the OK Corral""--also barred the carrying of guns openly.

Today in Tombstone, you don't even need a permit to carry around a firearm. Gun rights advocates are pushing lawmakers in state after state to do away with nearly all limits on the ability of people to have guns in public.

Like any law regulating things that are small and easy to conceal, the gun control of the Wild West wasn't always perfectly enforced. But statistics show that, next to drunk and disorderly conduct, the most common cause of arrest was illegally carrying a firearm. Sheriffs and marshals took gun control seriously.

Although some in the gun community insist that more guns equals less crime, in the Wild West they discovered that gun control can work. Gun violence in these towns was far more rare than we commonly imagine. Historians who've studied the numbers have determined that frontier towns averaged less than two murders a year. Granted, the population of these towns was small. Nevertheless, these were not places where duels at high noon were commonplace. In fact, they almost never occurred.

Why is our image of the Wild West so wrong? Largely for the same reason these towns adopted gun control laws in the first place: economic development. Residents wanted limits on guns in public because they wanted to attract businesspeople and civilized folk. What prospective storeowner was going to move to Deadwood if he was likely to be robbed when he brought his daily earnings to the bank?

Once the frontier was closed, those same towns glorified a supposedly violent past in order to attract tourists and the businesses to serve them. Gunfights were extremely rare in frontier towns, but these days you can see a reenactment of the one at the OK Corral several times a day. Don't forget to buy a souvenir!

The story of guns in America is far more complex and surprising than we've often been led to believe. We've always had a right to bear arms, but we've also always had gun control. Even in the Wild West, Americans balanced these two and enacted laws restricting guns in order to promote public safety. Why should it be so hard to do the same today?"

Remarkably, lawmakers have done worse than nothing on this issue. Both Democrats and Republicans have gone out of their way to block efforts to prevent so many tragic deaths. Here's how:

We have gutted funding for research on preventing firearms deaths and we have silenced experts who could help prevent accidental gun deaths, suicides and homicidal firearm deaths. Since 1996, appropriations bills have gone out of their way to make sure that, ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.""

As a result the CDC website provides no information on how to prevent firearm violence, despite providing links to info on preventing falls, passenger safety, fireworks, wearing seatbelts and preventing accidental poisonings. Guns are off limits, with no funding for research, no recommendations on how to use them safely or keep them out of dangerous hands.

Shockingly, even the Accountable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) didn't miss an opportunity to specifically prohibit health care providers from preventing gun deaths. An amendment was introduced and co-sponsored by senate majority leader Harry Reid that states

A. ""Wellness and health programs... may not require disclosure or collection of any information"" on gun or ammunition ownership;""

B. ""The Secretary of Health and Human Services (or Medicaid/Medicare programs)... has no authority ""to collect information on ownership or use of firearms and ammunition;""

C. Nor can the Act authorize health providers to maintain records of individual firearm ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition.

As a physician, it's unsettling to be told by politicians what questions are appropriate to ask. Its even more concerning that if we are concerned about our patient's mental health or safety around firearms, there is no reliable way to identify whether the patient has access to firearms. Gun violence is a public health issue. It accounts for more than 30,000 deaths annually. That's slightly fewer than the number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents, which we research extensively. We've saved lives by studying the traffic deaths and mandating airbags, seatbelts and making informed changes to traffic laws. Gun deaths deserve similar attention.

Firearms result in more deaths than the annual number of deaths from Prostate cancer, Leukemia, Pancreatic, Brain or Oral cancer. While we actively support research to save lives of people with cancer, we systematically block any investigation or intervention into ways to slow deaths from firearms. We need to study and be open to public health interventions to limit handgun deaths and violence.

Even staunch N.R.A. gun advocates argue that we should keep guns away from ""evil"" people or people who appear unstable and at risk of homicide or suicide. Doctors have a responsibility to assess our patient's risks for death and disability. This includes inquiring about smoking, seat belt use, bike helmets, and yes, gun ownership. Preventing health providers from asking and recording this information is creating a double standard for guns that is different from anything else in our society. This blind protectionism is both irrational and dangerous. Nurses, doctors and voters should speak out. The National Physicians Alliance has issued a call on behalf of health providers for sensible gun control and a ban on assault rifles.

We need research to guide these decisions. Otherwise how can we judge any plan, even one to place armed guards in schools? We can all start by demanding a plan, but lets also demand some research and thoughtful guidance."

We'd never thought of it until now, but the unexpected artwork of former US Navy Corpsman Andrew Tuohy has us intrigued.

Tuohy runs a blog called Vuurwapen (the Dutch word for firearm), where he provides photos, videos and accounts of testing various gun-related gear. During one such test -- an underwater examination of several different gun shots -- Tuohy was left with jacketed hollow point bullets that resembled flowers.

The avid gemstone collector went even farther with his surprisingly beautiful results, affixing topaz, sapphire and peridot to his aptly named ""tactical flowers."" The finished products, which Tuohy describes as a ""sort of evil beauty"" on his website, makes us wish he could design the next cover for a Guns N' Roses' album.

Commenting on the process of underwater art making, Tuohy writes on his blog: ""As pretty as this stuff is to look at, it is also painful -- I have plenty of scars from being sliced and poked by metal objects, but holding those bullets in my hand almost made me shiver. I would definitely not want to get shot by any of that stuff (duh)."" In other words, don't even think of trying this at home, folks.

After all, firearm-related injuries remain one of the leading causes of death among U.S. children, with close to 3,500 killed a year. The small and seemingly simple step of securing firearms in a locked cabinet makes a huge difference in protecting young children. By our estimates, approximately 5 percent of preschool age children live in homes in which their parents reported that they owned guns but did not store them in a secure and locked place. To address this problem, many states have implemented Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws. This collection of legislative approaches range from suggestive guidelines for storage behaviors in families with minors to more stringent requirements and harsher penalties for noncompliance, holding gun owners criminally liable regardless of whether someone gets hurt.

Unfortunately, little research exists to test whether these laws are actually associated with family firearm safety behaviors. A primary goal of our study, just published in the American Journal of Public Health, was to understand how gun storage behavior in families with young children varied across states with different CAP laws, controlling for a wide range of parent, family, and state-level factors that are often associated with gun ownership, generally, and gun safety behaviors, specifically. We found that the efficacy of state CAP laws seemed to rely on the general firearm legislative climate in each state. CAP laws were only associated with decreased likelihood of unsafe gun storage behaviors in states that had strong firearm legislation overall. Although we cannot infer causation from these findings, we hypothesize that parents may not be aware of the specific laws in their states but are more generally aware that their state has many laws that regulate gun use, prompting them to be more careful about the purchase and storage of firearms. We also think that having stronger general state laws could potentially affect which families own firearms -- parents who own guns in a state without any regulation may constitute a very different pool of people than those who own firearms in a state in which they have to jump through hoops, such as a background check, to get them.

Overall, these findings highlight that a significant proportion of children in the U.S. are living in homes where they can potentially access firearms, and these estimates are likely conservative due to underreporting arising from not wanting to share private or potentially embarrassing information or from parents' loose interpretation of what constitutes a 'safe' or 'locked' gun. Moreover, even laws that do not directly target the types of behaviors that result in young children accidentally accessing firearms could have potential spillover effects for the safety of children.

This is why comprehensive firearm legislation -- even legislation that doesn't seem to necessarily solve the immediate public health issue that politicians are responding to (such as a school massacre) -- could potentially be important.

Take, for example, proposed federal legislation on background checks that would have closed loopholes in firearm purchases at gun shows. Recent polls show broad bipartisan public support for this type of legislation, and, although it likely won't stop school massacres, it has potential spillover effects that may affect minors' access to firearms. Parents who do not keep their guns safe at home probably will not show up in a database of people with a diagnosed serious mental health illness, but having a mandated background check or waiting several days to return to a store to purchase a gun may create enough friction that could stop some parents who may be less able or inclined to take heed of their pediatrician's recommendations or abide by their state's CAP laws.

Year after year, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) continue to push stories about ""record-setting"" sales and reporters -- always looking for a sensational lead -- print/air these claims as gospel without actually fact-checking them.

What makes this so remarkable is that the gun lobby blocks both the public and media from gaining access to actual data on gun sales. Instead of sales data, the NRA and NSSF offer reporters data on background checks conducted through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). For a multitude of reasons that I chronicled in my earlier blog, this data does not represent gun sales. As the FBI made clear to Reuters on Saturday, ""An increase in the number of NICS transactions, for a given time period, should not be used to indicate an increase in the number of firearms sold.""

Angered over being exposed as peddlers of bogus data, the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) responded to my blog in a January 13th alert on their website (""Gun Control Activists Fire Squib Loads""). With their NICS ruse foiled, they are now offering yet another separate and distinct body of information as ""hard data"" on gun sales.

For starters, the NRA-ILA seems to now fully acknowledge that NICS checks are not gun sales. ""As Horwitz points out, not all firearm-related NICS checks are for firearm acquisitions, and the number of checks does not reflect the number of firearms acquired in conjunction with the checks,"" they write. ""Among other things, he also points out that some NICS checks are for acquisitions of second-hand firearms."" And yet they can't quite let go of their bogus data, saying that increases in the number of NICS checks from 2007 to 2011 ""almost guarantee[s] that sales of new firearms have been increasing during that time frame.""

Almost guarantees? Or perhaps it's merely an ""exact estimate""? Whatever the case, the NRA was ready to introduce its latest iteration of ""hard data"" on gun sales:

There's a much better indicator of new gun sales that Horwitz ignored: U.S. firearms manufacturers' production data and firearm importation statistics, both reported by the BAFTE [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]. Horwitz accuses NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation of not providing reporters hard data, but reporters can get the BAFTE's data the same way the NRA and the NSSF do -- by visiting the BAFTE's website.

Allow me to interject here for just a moment. The NRA and the NSSF are claiming they wait two years for (embargoed ATF) data on firearms manufacturing and imports? The NSSF is the trade association for the gun industry! Their job is to tell American consumers and investors what's going on in their industry, what's hot and what's not, what's selling and what's sitting in inventory. They're either lying or grossly incompetent. This type of information is routinely reported by other industries up to the current month, as seen in this example. But I digress; let me get back to the NRA-ILA's latest ""hard data"" on gun sales:

The BATFE's data show that the number of firearms made in the U.S.A. and not exported, plus the number of firearms imported, increased from 5.1 million in 2005, to 5.7 million in 2006, 6.5 million in 2007, 6.9 million in 2008, and almost 9 million in 2009. Figures for 2010 and 2011 have not been released, but based on the trend in NICS checks, it's likely that they will follow a similar pattern.

But are firearms manufactured in the U.S. and not exported, plus imported firearms, really ""a much better indicator"" of gun sales? First of all, we don't have any data at all for 2010 and 2011, so (once again) we can't have an adult conversation about these figures. More importantly, firearms are some of the most durable products you will find, with extremely long life spans. How do we know these products aren't simply sitting on the shelves?

That theory is certainly plausible because the ATF data shows a multi-year trend of rising firearm imports. Are these foreign imports a threat to domestic firearm manufacturers? If so, U.S. manufacturers could be increasing production to try to compete. Let's remember that the domestic automobile industry overproduced itself right into bankruptcy.

If that's not enough, the NSSF added even more ""evidence"" of increased gun sales in a recent press release: ""Another indicator pointing to robust gun sales is the federal excise taxes collected on the sale of new firearms and ammunition, which have risen 48.3 percent over the last five years."" Yes, the excise tax receipts have gone up, but since this includes ammunition and a long list of bow-hunting products it offers little insight into how many firearms are being moved off retailers' shelves. Additionally, the federal excise tax is based on the value of the product and is not a set tax per unit. Increased tax collections could reflect many things, including the rise in the price of raw commodities that make firearms more expensive. Purchasers might also be passing on less expensive items in favor of more expensive ones. Finally, it certainly reflects the high cost of ammunition due to wartime shortages as well as general inflation. In conclusion, aggregate excise tax data does not tell us anything about firearm sales.

The NSSF has even stooped so far as to offer reporters social media searches as evidence of what brands of firearms sold the best during the 2011 holiday season. Facebook and Twitter hits? This is literally laughable.

Let's be perfectly clear here. Virtually every other industry in America offers the media actual data on sales. Click here to see industry data on pharmaceuticals, motorcycles, and ever-popular Mac products, for example. So why do the NRA and NSSF continue to block access to this information?

Because the industry has something ugly to hide.... If the NSSF did make sales figures public, it would then be possible to compare gun sales data to aggregate data on crime gun traces and identify with specificity the volume of firearms being diverted to criminals and traffickers in the illegal market. Researchers could also divine which firearm manufacturers are failing to use effective safeguards to stop the illegal diversion of their products.

It's no secret that the gun industry knows that their distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals. Bob Ricker, the former executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council (then the leading gun industry trade association), made that patently clear when he became a whistleblower in 2003. Ricker participated in a series of high-level meetings with NRA and gun industry executives from 1992 to 1997 in which it was acknowledged that ""the diversion of firearms from legal channels of commerce to the black market"" takes place ""principally at the distributor/dealer level."" Ricker proposed strict standards and guidelines to help stem the flow of guns to criminals. But his proposal was rejected by industry attorneys, who concluded that, ""You can't change operating procedures, because if you do, then you're going to be admitting sort of liability.""

And is it simply a coincidence that the same year Ricker came forward with these details, the NRA pushed for amendments to the ATF appropriation bill in Congress that prohibited lawmakers, the media, the public, and researchers from gaining access to crime gun trace data? The pattern couldn't be clearer.

The smoke and mirrors game the gun lobby plays with bogus ""sales data"" allows them to promote the infamous ""More Guns, Less Crime"" mantra of now-discredited ""researcher"" (and current Fox News commentator) John Lott while cloaking a far darker truth. Namely, that -- faced with a stagnant customer base that has declined precipitously over the past 35 years -- the gun industry has purposely and continuously manufactured firearms for one of its most important market segments: traffickers and prohibited purchasers (i.e., children, criminals, the dangerously mentally ill, domestic abusers, etc.). And all in the name of profit.

What's remarkable is that anyone in the media is still willing to play their game with them.

Their ""mock mass shooting"" was met with a much larger counter-protest and derision by many onlookers in the left-leaning city of Austin who saw the group pushing a position that could increase the danger brought by firearms at the university that saw one of the worst mass school shootings in U.S. history.

One of the mock mass shooting organizers, the group Come and Take It Texas, said allowing gun-free zones on campuses eliminated a human right to personal protection.

""Our goal is to instill the importance of everyone to be able to defend themselves in any way they choose,"" the group said in a statement posted on its website.

The actual mock shooting was a small-scale event that went mostly unnoticed and culminated with about half a dozen people faking their deaths on a sidewalk in a pool of simulated blood.

Ahead of the event, about 20 pro-gun activists walked near the university, some with military-style weapons over their shoulders.

The group was far outnumbered by media, police and students in the middle of final exams, many wondering what the small group of flag-waving, gun-toting people was doing.

""There is always something crazy going on in Texas,"" said student Zena Brown, a junior at the university.

The school threatened to arrest the group with trespassing if they tried to do their mockshooting on campus.

""I don't know what is wrong with these people in that they feel the need to show off their big guns,"" she said.

The mock mass shooting comes days after a university panel grudgingly acknowledged that it will have to allow guns in the classrooms under a new law that goes into effect next year, dubbed ""campus carry.""

The law allows people 21 and older with a concealed handgun license to carry handguns in classrooms and buildings throughout the University of Texas system, one of the nation's largest with an enrollment of more than 214,000 students."

It is a freedom that the roughly 20 percent of Americans who own guns cherish, and most other Americans believe it should remain one of our freedoms. No legislative proposal has been made -- or would be tolerated -- that would remove the right to ""keep and bear arms."" Despite some of the hyped rhetoric of recent days, none of the proposals under consideration to address gun violence would abolish or even severely restrict the right to purchase multiple types of firearms.

But, in society, freedom comes with responsibility. Free speech comes with the responsibility not to defame others or yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater. Freedom of religion comes with the responsibility to protect the ""free exercise"" of those who believe in a different deity. Freedom to buy goods and services comes with the responsibility to pay for them. Freedom to drive a car comes with the responsibility to operate it safely. Freedom to make, sell, own or use firearms comes with the responsibility to do so responsibly -- and to help others do so.

The debate we are having in America should not be about gun ownership. That is a protected freedom that (except possibly for future purchases of ""assault rifles"") is not being challenged. The debate should be about how to balance that right with responsibility -- not only for individuals but for the society that authorizes and supports personal ownership of firearms.

Pillorying the NRA should not be part of this debate. They have the Constitutional right to express their views. Many of their programs and services help people of all ages use firearms responsibly. They have not caused the mass murders that horrify us. It is fair to ask if they are acting responsibly in the debate about gun violence (and we will come to that), but irresponsible gun manufacture, sales and use is the core problem, not the NRA.

Since owning guns is a right, what are the corresponding responsibilities that we as individuals who make, sell, buy, or use firearms must accept? Some of these seem clear; there will be debate about others. First, no one should be able to purchase a gun who is neither mentally nor legally fit (due to age, mental condition or previous criminal record) to do so. Since some who are not fit will try to obtain firearms nonetheless, society -- including all those who make and sell guns -- has a responsibility to make sure they do not do so. This has implications for responsible behavior needed from parents to mental health professionals to law enforcement to gun makers and sellers.

Second, those who make and enforce laws respecting firearms must have objective and accurate information with which to do so. Since this requires scientific research, that research should be both permitted and supported. Gathering scientific data does not prevent anyone from owning a gun.

Third, gun owners have a responsibility to store and use their firearms safely, and to ensure that others (especially children and the mentally ill) do not have unauthorized access to the use of them. Those who make guns have a responsibility to help make that possible. The technology exists to do so.

Fourth, law enforcement and other safety personnel have a responsibility to protect the public against gun violence -- and to be protected against heavy weaponry in the performance of their duties. When they are prevented from doing their jobs or faced with overwhelming firepower, they cannot act responsibly and the public safety is threatened. This means that communities have the right and responsibility to take those actions they deem essential -- and that are Constitutional -- to protect children, adults, and public safety personnel from gun violence. Stationing law enforcement personnel in schools is one action they have every right to consider, though they should consider both the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.

Beyond at least these responsibilities, we need as a society to discuss the responsibility that needs to be taken by parents as they raise their children and by the media (whose Constitutional right to make electronic games and movies that show and, in some cases, glorify gun violence) to create an environment healthy for children and the broader society.

There is also a responsibility we all have -- and that applies to the debate itself about gun violence, gun rights, and gun control. We must act responsibly in that debate. When gun rights advocates, including the NRA, charge that banning assault weapons or high capacity magazines will lead down the slippery slope to confiscating all privately held guns in America, that is using fear to stoke hatred and avoid a reasonable conversation about gun responsibility. Sensible laws about guns will no more prevent gun ownership than sensible laws about the use of automobiles prevent driving. On the other side, when gun control advocates act as if the NRA is the enemy of America and that gun control itself will rid the nation of gun-related mass murder, that is also acting irresponsibly in the debate we need to have.

Like so many other questions in American politics today, this issue has become polarized. The way we talk about it -- as either ""gun rights"" or ""gun control"" -- tells us that. Instead of compromise, too many are looking for total victory. Moral courage among politicians, who either wish to climb on one side of the fence or duck the issue entirely, is lacking. That, too, is an evasion of responsibility. We owe ourselves, and especially the children and adults we have lost to gun violence, both reasonable debate and sensible action."

I have known Dave since 2004 or 2005 when he opened a small gun shop in Connecticut just over the Massachusetts line. Dave had previously been in the car business as a broker, he had done quite well, but, being a gun nut, once he had some dough in his pocket he did what we all do, he bought some gun inventory and opened a shop.

One thing led to another and within three or four years Dave had moved to a much larger location and now had a gun shop that was maybe the second largest store in the whole state. And since Connecticut is a fairly small state and Dave’s store was situated right off an exit of Interstate 91 ― “easy on, easy off” ― he got customers from as far away as the Danbury area, one of whom was Nancy Lanza, who showed up some time in 2011 or 2012 with her young son, Adam, and purchased an AR-15.

Two days after the Sandy Hook massacre, as Dave was about to close for the night, a squad of helmeted ATF agents carrying rifles and wearing body armor drove up in two Humvees and charged into the shop. Oh yes, they were immediately followed into Dave’s store by some media folks who had been alerted by the ATF that something connected to the Sandy Hook mess was about to go down.

Let me interject one point here that needs to be understood. I heard about Sandy Hook while I was standing behind the counter of my gun shop; I closed the shop immediately and went home. But later that night after the shooter was identified, I went back to the shop and pored through my records to find out whether or not I was the dealer who had sold the gun. Since it was a rifle, Nancy Lanza could have come into Massachusetts and bought the gun from me. I would have been required to ship the gun to a Connecticut dealer, so I was able to quickly check and I knew that the gun hadn’t come from me. I can guarantee you that every gun dealer in Connecticut and Massachusetts was looking through their books that same night in the hopes that the AR wasn’t sold by them.

The ATF spent the next several weeks examining every gun sale that Dave ever made. They also suspended his license which he never got back. Eventually they found a sale of a hunting rifle which was improperly made, but it was still a violation of 4473 law so they could now build a case. A year later, having absorbed the loss of his entire business, Dave took a misdemeanor plea for the sale of the hunting rifle and also agreed never to go back into the business of selling guns. All the result of a legal sale of an AR-15.

Back in 1995 my good friend in Fairfax, Wayne-o LaPierre, took a lot of flak for calling the ATF a bunch of ‘jack-booted thugs.’ Wayne-o has never been known to be as a master of the understatement, but when I think about how Dave LaGuercia was treated by the ATF, I have to say that Wayne-o was right. And by the way, every, single gun-shop owner throughout the Northeast knows what happened to Dave because every shop is visited on a regular basis by the sales reps for S&W, Ruger and Glock, so news gets around."

A Field & Stream sales associate confirmed to The Huffington Post that AR-15s and so-called modular sniper rifles are available for purchase at the store in Cranberry Township, Pa. The store, the first of two Dick's has said it plans to open in 2013 focusing on hunting and fishing gear, had its grand opening on Friday, according to the Pittsburgh Business Times.

Adam Lanza used his mother's Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to kill 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14. Lanza also killed his mother and himself.

Dick’s Sporting Goods, the largest U.S. sporting goods retailer, issued this statement after the killings:

Out of respect for the victims and their families, during this time of national mourning we have removed all guns from sale and from display in our store nearest to Newtown and suspended the sale of modern sporting rifles in all of our stores chainwide.

Modern sporting rifle is the firearm industry term for military-style rifles that fire a single shot with each pull of the trigger.

The news that Field & Stream is selling AR-15s and sniper rifles suggests that the company's period of mourning is over. A salesman at Dick's in Homestead, Pa., said neither that store nor any Dick's sells AR-15s. Dick’s did not respond to questions from HuffPost on why it's selling semi-automatic weapons at the spinoff store and whether it will resume selling them at Dick's locations.

Assault-style weapons like the AR-15 are extremely profitable for retailers. The Sandy Hook shootings appear to have boosted gun sales and industry profits, as enthusiasts rushed to purchase guns before federal legislative action, which fizzled. The New York Times points out that before the Newtown killings, AR-15 rifles sold for about $1,100. But by February, some retailers were charging as much as double.

Update -- 12:15 p.m.: Shares of Dick's fell Tuesday morning as the company reported lower-than-expected earnings. A Reuters report blamed the weak sales on the summer's cool and wet weather, as well as higher payroll taxes and the job market.

Erik Lowry, owner of Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms in McKeesport, Pa., claims his store's Facebook page was shut down following an AR-15 giveaway launched earlier this year, according to ABC's WTAE Pittsburgh. On Friday, he received a message from Facebook informing him the page was deactivated, but he received no further explanation.

Back in February, Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms made headlines when the store gave away hundreds of rounds of ammunition, dozens of high-capacity magazine clips and an AR-15 assault weapon. Prospective contestants had to ""like"" the Facebook page and share with friends to be entered in the contest.

Lowry explained to radio station NewsRadio 1020 KDKA that an AR-15 could come in handy for customers to ""defend themselves from a tyrannical government,"" a right provided by the Second Amendment.

It began as a Christmas contest, but many later construed it to be a protest of President Barack Obama's push for gun control following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on Dec. 14, Lowry previously told The Huffington Post.

The owner, who claims his business is losing thousands of dollars each day because of the alleged blockade, thinks misinformation regarding the giveaway is to blame for Facebook shutting down his page.

“People were thinking if you won, I was just going to send a gun to your front door. It just doesn't work that way,” he told WTAE, saying that winners had to to pass background checks. “If you win a firearm from us, you come to the store, and as long as you pass a background check, you walk out with your gun.”

News platform Vocativ recently contacted the social network about gun giveaways within the Facebook community. A spokesman for the social network said that, since such pages can be considered ads, they are in violation of the site's terms. Vocativ provided Facebook with the names of multiple stores participating in such contests, and the pages were subsequently removed.

""Our Ad Guidelines prohibit promotion of the sale of weapons and the Ad Guidelines apply to Pages with commercial content on them,” a Facebook rep said. “Ads may not promote the sale or use of weapons, ammunition, or explosives.”

Still, Lowry is angry about what happened.

""This kind of censorship is unconstitutional,"" he told The Blaze regarding Facebook shutting down his page. He plans to reach out to the National Rifle Association (NRA) for legal council.

Facebook could not be reached for comment at the time of publication."

Bright, who is challenging Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the Republican primary, announced in an email to supporters Thursday that he will give away a Palmetto Armory AR-15 as a part of his campaign.

“I know the political talking heads may sneer as they continue blaming guns and law-abiding gun owners for the acts of thugs and madmen. But I am the pro-gun, pro-Constitution candidate in this race for the U.S. Senate -- and I can’t think of a better way to get that word out than by giving away a brand new AR-15,” Bright said in the email. “My hope is this AR-15 giveaway will also help me get my message of liberty out to tens of thousands of South Carolinians.""

On his campaign website, Bright notes that ""one lucky Second Amendment Supporter will be the winner,"" in the raffle scheduled for Feb. 15.

The contest's winner must be 18 years of age or older and will have to pass a criminal background check in order to be eligible.

Bright's email began with a reference to the mass shooting of 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. A drive for gun control after the shooting ultimately failed in Congress.

“In the wake of the horrific tragedy in Newtown, Conn., gun-grabbers were sure they had the votes to ram gun control into law,” the email read. “Thanks to the action of Second Amendment supporters all over the country, their schemed failed -- even despite my Republican primary opponent, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.”

Graham voted to allow debate on the legislation but ultimately voted against the legislation itself, as Politico notes.

Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) made a similar campaign move last year when he also chose an AR-15 to raffle off.

Bright introduced a bill to create a guns, shooting and Second Amendment awareness class for South Carolina's high schoolers last January.

""I believe the more guns we have the safer we are, because had there been someone in Newtown with a weapon, had it been a teacher, they could have stopped it early,"" Bright told WSOC.

Bright is one of four Republicans planning to run against Graham in the June 10 primary.

huffpo142,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-02-16 10:57:41-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-purchase-age_us_5a8606fee4b00bc49f424c9e,"This week’s mass shooting at a Florida high school, where a lone gunman opened fire on students and staff, killing 17 and injuring 15, has distressingly similar details in the profile of the suspect and his weapon. A 19-year-old former student with a history of disciplinary issues had gotten his hands on an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle capable of firing highly lethal rounds in rapid succession. And he’d done so completely legally.

Under federal law, and in almost every state, the minimum age for purchasing a long gun from a licensed dealer is 18. This category of firearms encompasses shotguns and rifles, including the assault-style weapons that have become popular in mass shootings. Federal law provides no minimum age for the possession of long guns, and in some states, it’s legal for children younger than 18 to own these weapons as long as they have parental consent.

For handguns, the age limit increases to 21 under federal law. Just two states, Hawaii and Illinois, have laws specifically raising the minimum purchase age for long guns to 21, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

This system gives millions of young Americans the right to buy the deadliest civilian weaponry three years before they can legally drink alcohol. It dates back to the Gun Control Act of 1968. Although civilian firepower has changed dramatically over the past half-century, these distinctions have not.

“Back in the day, you had a lower gun age for rifles because they were often used for hunting,” said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law. “Young men would have valid reasons for hunting, and they could even have it for self defense, but it was primarily for recreation.”

Back then, many popular civilian rifles were bolt-action, or lever-action. They typically featured lower-capacity magazines, and required the shooter to manually chamber each round, firing more slowly than modern semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15, the now-popular civilian rifle platform modeled off military-issue weapons of the past and present.

In this technological landscape, lawmakers in the 1960s regarded handguns as a much bigger threat in the hands of young people, who can tend to be more erratic and prone to violence.

“This all stems from the idea that handguns were usually weapons of self-defense and criminal misuse, and neither of those two things were seemingly appropriate for most kids.” said Winkler. “So, the idea was that because handguns were thought to be more dangerous than long guns, that they had stricter rules.”

Handguns are still used in the majority of gun violence today. Handguns were involved in about 65 percent of the 11,000 gun homicides recorded by the FBI in 2016. Rifles were used in just 374 of those slayings, though the murder weapon wasn’t specified in 3,077 cases, likely due to inconsistent reporting by law enforcement agencies.

Although shootings involving military-style rifles may be aberrations in the steady stream of daily U.S. gun violence, it’s becoming increasingly clear that they can inflict mass casualties in the wrong hands. Yet state and federal regulations on the purchase of handguns often don’t extend to long guns. For example, gun stores must report to law enforcement any sale of multiple handguns to a single buyer over a five-day period. This requirement doesn’t exist for long guns. Many states also have waiting periods for handgun purchases, which don’t extend to long guns. And state open-carry laws regarding the public display of firearms tend to be far more permissive toward long guns than handguns.

This discrepancy makes some gun violence prevention groups uneasy.

“These highly lethal weapons really have no other purpose other than to kill people fast and efficiently, and to kill as many people as possible,” said Laura Cutilletta, legal director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “Handguns may be more typically used in crime, but these types of assault weapons can actually do more damage.”

The firearms industry doesn’t share this concern. Over the past decade, gun groups have rebranded assault-style rifles as “modern sporting rifles” in an attempt to highlight their increasing popularity for recreational shooting. In 2012, there were an estimated 20 million to 30 million of these weapons in civilian hands, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade group. Gun companies have sold millions each year since then, and they’ve become a significant part of the business.

“The idea of marketing military-style long guns to civilians is something that came about in more recent decades, because the gun industry needed a new way to make money,” said Cutilletta. “People aren’t hunting as much as they did in the past, so this is something they can market to people. It’s marketed as a bit of a toy, something that you might not hunt with, but that you take to the range.”

There have been a number of shootings and failed plots involving people under the age of 21 who have legally purchased their weapons, including both assault-style rifles and shotguns. In 2016, a 19-year-old in Washington state opened fire at a house party with his legally purchased AR-style rifle, killing three people, including his ex-girlfriend, and injuring one.

Winkler said it’s time to institute a uniform gun age nationally for all types of firearms. He also advocates raising the minimum age to buy or possess a firearm without supervision to 25. He noted that people younger than that are responsible for a disproportionate amount of U.S. gun violence, including almost half of all gun homicides.

Winkler suggested following the example of drinking laws, which have led to national incentives encouraging states to implement a 21-year-old limit. But he’s not optimistic about that effort being replicated with firearms, largely because lobbyists from the National Rifle Association and other groups have a stranglehold on the gun debate."

Regardless of the event, the solution remains the same: buy a gun. And if industry and gun fan mags are any indication, it should be an AR-15 assault rifle.

A fact left unstated by the gun lobby (and virtually unnoticed by the news media) is the fact that after gun sales rise, they eventually drop--sometimes precipitously. Sometimes, as Michael Kassnar, president of AR-15 manufacturer KBI/Charles Daly, explains, there's a ""market collapse."" Kassnar should know--he's just shut his business' doors.

According to the March 1, 2010, edition of theNew Gun Week:

One factor that contributed to the company's closure was what Kassner called a ""collapse"" of the market in mid-2009 for semiautomatic sport utility rifles, the so-called ""black guns"" designed on the AR-15 platform.

In other words, AR-15 assault rifles, but let us continue.

He said the rush to purchase those firearms came to a halt in about July, leaving him with a ""warehouse full of guns nobody wanted."" Orders for about $8 million worth of firearms were canceled, he said, leaving KBI/Charles Daly essentially high and dry for the second half of the 2009 sales year. It appeared that the public became less fearful that the Obama administration was going to come after semi-autos, so the panic buying came to an end, Kassnar said.... ""The consumer just stopped buying,"" he said....the ""sales blitz lasted about eight months.""

Not to worry. Despite the long-term trends of declining gun ownership in America's boom and bust gun manufacturing economy, the NRA and gun industry are always on the lookout for another manufactured crisis to exploit and reel in the ""panic"" buyer."

Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and a vocal gun control advocate, told CNN Monday that he had recently purchased an assault weapon to demonstrate the need for stricter gun laws.

Kelly, who in January launched Americans for Responsible Solutions with Giffords, took to Facebook on Friday to express concern over the nation's lax background check requirements, stating that it was ""scary"" to think that people can buy assault weapons ""without a background check at a gun show or the Internet.""

""I just had a background check a few days ago when I went to my local gun store to buy a 45,"" Kelly wrote. ""As I was leaving, I noticed a used AR-15. Bought that too.""

Kelly added, ""Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes ... We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole.""

In Arizona, where Kelly purchased the assault weapon, gun dealers must perform background checks through the Arizona Firearms Clearance Center and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. According to RB Investigations, which offers defensive firearms training in Arizona, this process can take less than a minute to complete.

Kelly wrote on Facebook that he intended to turn over the assault weapon to the Tucson Police Department.

He told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday that it was ""important for me to have firsthand knowledge about how easy it is or difficult it is to buy a weapon like that."" He also stated that he was ""looking forward at some point to buying a gun at a gun show [and] also possibly selling a gun so I know really the ins and outs of this issue.""

Kelly -- who, in addition to increased background checks, has also advocated limits on high-capacity magazines -- has repeatedly noted that he and Giffords are proud gun owners before arguing that it is past time for Congress to respond to gun violence.

""Gabby and I are both very strong supporters of the Second Amendment,"" Kelly told CNN's Anderson Cooper in January. ""Gabby owns a gun, I own a gun. This really isn't about the Second Amendment, I don't believe it is -- this is about gun safety and it's about safety of the public.""

On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a bill that would require background checks for nearly all gun purchases. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), will receive a full vote on the Senate floor, although it lacks bipartisan support."

But, before I show and tell you why it made me feel invincible... Let's back up.

According to a recent NIH report, 14 percent of boys conceived on Long Island in 1966 were born missing the gene for ""how mechanical stuff works."" I believe the medical literature refers to this malady as: Being Jewish.

Regardless of the study's veracity, I was born without the gene for understanding how the internal combustion engine works, how to install a new light switch, and how to hang a curtain rod without drilling 17 ""test"" holes first.

My deficiency is easily overcome in most cases. When I need curtain hung or a switch installed, I just suffer with either too much or too little light. And when my car makes a funny noise... I pretend I can't hear it, because I got the gene for ""ignoring stuff"" in triplicate.

Anyway -- guns are another thing I knew nothing about.

I didn't know the difference between a .9mm bullet and a .223. I knew nothing about muzzle velocity. No idea how the projectile comes out the front when a weapon is fired... and how the shell spits out the side. Clueless why one gun is considered more dangerous than others, and I'm stumped how mobsters keep a gun tucked in their waist stop it from falling down the inside of their pant leg. My guess: velcro?

To me, all guns are made for just one purpose: to kill.

And to compensate for a small penis. Okay, two things. (That's a joke, NRA.)

As the debate over guns became more intense in the last four weeks, I discovered myself in a number of situations discussing the subject and I realized... I don't know enough facts on which to base a cogent opinion.

On one hand, I believe Americans have a right to defend ourselves from well, whoever might come for us, our family, our things or our guns. Heck, I think it's okay to shoot the guy who knocks on my door to sell me magazines -- as if anyone is still reading. On the other hand, guns kill people and well, lots of people are dying. Which I'm against.

Much of the media -- and even many of the people I know -- have made it seem like this issue is black and white. Some say: Get rid of guns... people won't die. Others say: Ban assault weapons, people won't die. While still others say: The Second Amendment says my right to own a gun will not be infringed. And a few people said, ""Muzzle velocity. What the?"" Side note: most of my friends were born on Long Island in 1966.

This debate is not black and white. Answers aren't easily found, ""problems"" aren't easily identified, and band-aids won't cure the horrible plague of gun violence.

It's this murky combination of difficult questions and my own selfish interest in facts that lead me to a gun range in Torrance, Calif., on January 17.

Gathering facts. You may remember ""facts."" Facts are things that are true and incontrovertible. Facts are what media types, reporters and even politicians used to gather before ""talking points"" were invented.

Note to media: Yes, it's possible to find some facts sitting at your computer. However, there's another way to get them as well: Get off your manicured fat ass, get out of the news studio and go out into the world and talk to people. Ask questions. Turn over rocks. Ask more questions. Pick up a gun. Fire it.

It my case, finding some vital gun facts took two hours... leaving me plenty of time in the afternoon to update my Facebook page. Or in your case, media, have your ass manicured.

(Note: I'm not so naïve as to think that two hours at the gun range has given me all the facts... but it's a decent start if you're interested in forming an opinion on guns.)

Anyway, at the Torrance Gun Range I met with an NRA member and former U.S. Army paratrooper who is also a 40-year gun specialist/instructor. He answered my questions and supervised as I fired the AR-15 -- an assault weapon, as well as the Glock 9mm.

So, what was it like firing the AR-15?

It made me feel very powerful. It made me feel invincible. It made me feel like I could very easily kill someone. It made me feel safe.

And, what was it like firing the Glock 9mm?

It made me feel very powerful. It made me feel invincible. It made me feel like I could very easily kill someone. It made me feel safe.

Actually, rather than me explaining it all... you can see my trip to the gun range and get the same answers I did yourself, by clicking here.

Wittner']",2016-01-03 21:21:16-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/american-casualties-of-th_b_8908530.html,"When Americans think about nuclear weapons, they comfort themselves with the thought that the vast, nuclear destruction of human life has not taken place since 1945 -- at least not yet. But, in reality, nuclear weapon-related destruction has taken place, with shocking levels of U.S. casualties.

This point is borne out by a recently-published study by a team of investigative journalists at McClatchy News. Drawing upon millions of government records and large numbers of interviews, they concluded that employment in the nation's nuclear weapons plants since 1945 led to 107,394 American workers contracting cancer and other serious diseases. Of these people, some 53,000 judged by government officials to have experienced excessive radiation on the job received $12 billion in compensation under the federal government's Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. And 33,480 of these workers have died.

How could this happen? Let's examine the case of Byron Vaigneur. In October 1975, he saw a brownish sludge containing plutonium break through the wall of his office and start pooling near his desk at the Savannah River, South Carolina nuclear weapons plant. Subsequently, he contracted breast cancer, as well as chronic beryllium disease, a debilitating respiratory condition. Vaigneur, who had a mastectomy to cut out the cancer, is today on oxygen, often unable to walk more than a hundred feet. Declaring he's ready to die, he has promised to donate his body to science in the hope that it will help save the lives of other people exposed to deadly radiation.

Actually, workers in nuclear weapons plants constitute only a fraction of Americans whose lives have been ravaged by preparations for nuclear war. A 2002 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services maintained that, between 1951 and 1963 alone, the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons -- more than half of it done by the United States -- killed 11,000 Americans through cancer. As this estimate does not include internal radiation exposure caused by inhaling or swallowing radioactive particles, the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research has maintained that the actual number of fatal cancers caused by nuclear testing could be 17,000. Of course, a larger number of people contracted cancer from nuclear testing than actually died of it. The government study estimated that those who contracted cancer numbered at least 80,000 Americans.

Who were these Americans? Many of them were ""downwinders"" -- people whose towns and cities were located near U.S. nuclear testing sites and, thus, were contaminated by deadly clouds of nuclear fallout carried along by the wind. During the 1950s, the U.S. government conducted close to a hundred atmospheric nuclear explosions at its Nevada test site. Nearly 30 percent of the radioactive debris drifted over the towns to the east, which housed a population of roughly 100,000 people. The residents of St. George, Utah recalled that a ""pink cloud"" would hang over them while they worked amid the fallout, walked in it, breathed it, washed their clothes in it, and ate it. ""Even the little children ate the snow,"" recalled one resident. ""They didn't know it was going to kill them later on.""

During subsequent decades, leukemia and other cancer rates soared in the counties adjoining the Nevada test site, as they did among the 250,000 U.S. soldiers exposed to U.S. nuclear weapons tests. From the standpoint of U.S. military commanders, it was vital to place American soldiers close to U.S. nuclear explosions to get them ready to fight in a nuclear war. Subsequently, as many of these soldiers developed cancer, had children with birth defects, or died, they and their family members organized atomic veterans' groups to demand that the federal government provide medical care and financial compensation for their suffering. Today, atomic veterans receive both from the federal government.

Uranium miners comprise yet another group of Americans who have suffered and died from the U.S. nuclear weapons program. To obtain the uranium ore necessary to build nuclear weapons, the U.S. government operated thousands of uranium mines, often on the lands of Native Americans, many of whom worked as miners and died premature deaths. The U.S. Public Health Service and the National Institute for Public Safety and Health conducted studies of uranium miners that discovered alarmingly high rates of deaths from lung cancer, other lung diseases, tuberculosis, emphysema, blood disease, and injuries. In addition, when the uranium mines were played out or abandoned for other reasons, they were often left as open pits, thereby polluting the air, land, and water of the surrounding communities with radiation and heavy metals.

This American nuclear catastrophe is not only a matter of the past, but seems likely to continue well into the future. The U.S. government is now beginning a $1 trillion program to ""modernize"" its nuclear weapons complex. This involves building new nuclear weapons factories and labs, as well as churning out new nuclear weapons and warheads for firing from the air, land, and sea. Of course, if these weapons and their overseas counterparts are used, they will destroy the world. But, as we have seen, even when they are not used in war, they exact a dreadful toll -- in the United States and, it should be noted, in other nations around the world.

How long are people going to tolerate this nuclear tragedy?

huffpo148,huffpo,[],2018-03-01 12:13:25-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vladimir-putin-new-nuclear-weapons_us_5a9832f7e4b09c872bb238ca,"MOSCOW, March 1 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin unveiled an array of new nuclear weapons on Thursday, in one of his most bellicose speeches in years, saying they could hit almost any point in the world and evade a U.S.-built missile shield.

Putin was speaking ahead of an election on March 18 that polls indicate he should win easily. He said a nuclear attack on any of Moscow’s allies would be regarded as an attack on Russia itself and draw an immediate response.

It was unclear if he had a particular Russian ally, such as Syria, in mind, but his comments looked like a warning to Washington not to use tactical battlefield nuclear weapons.

His remarks were greeted with skepticism in Washington, where officials cast doubt on whether Russia has added any new capabilities to its nuclear arsenal beyond those already known to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.

The Pentagon, which recently unveiled a nuclear policy revamp based partly on the bellicose posture from Moscow, said it was not surprised by Putin’s presentation.

“We’ve been watching Russia for a long time. We’re not surprised,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White.

“These weapons that are discussed have been in development a very long time,” she said, without addressing any of Putin’s specific claims of new capabilities.

Putin has often used militaristic rhetoric to mobilize support and buttress his narrative that Russia is under siege from the West. His 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea boosted his ratings to a record high and he has cast his military intervention in Syria as a proud moment for Moscow.

On Thursday, he sought to back his rhetoric with video clips of what he said were some of the new missiles. The images were projected onto a giant screen behind him at a conference hall in central Moscow where he was addressing Russia’s political elite.

“They have not succeeded in holding Russia back,” said Putin, referring to the West, which he said had ignored Moscow in the past, but would now have to sit up and listen.

“Now they need to take account of a new reality and understand that everything I have said today is not a bluff.”

Among weapons that Putin said were either in development or ready was a new intercontinental ballistic missile “with a practically unlimited range” able to attack via the North and South Poles and bypass any missile defense systems.

Putin also spoke of a small nuclear-powered engine that could be fitted to what he said were low-flying, highly maneuverable cruise missiles, giving them a practically unlimited range.

The new engine meant Russia was able to make a new type of weapon - nuclear missiles powered by nuclear rather than conventional fuel.

“Nothing like it in the world exists,” Putin told the audience. “At some point it will probably appear (elsewhere) but by that time our guys will have devised something else.”

Other new super weapons he listed included underwater nuclear drones, a supersonic weapon and a laser weapon.

In one of his video clip demos, a weapon appeared to be hovering over what looked like a map of the state of Florida.

The audience, made up of Russian lawmakers and other leading figures, frequently stood up and applauded his presentation, which culminated with the Russian national anthem being played.

Earlier in the speech, he had struck a very different tone, ordering officials to halve the number of Russians living in poverty by sharply boosting social and infrastructure spending in an obvious pre-election pitch to voters.

NATO MEASURES “USELESS”

Putin, who has dominated his country’s political landscape for the last 18 years, said the technological advances meant that NATO’s build-up on Russia’s borders and the roll-out of a U.S. anti-missile system would be rendered useless.

“I hope that everything that was said today will sober up any potential aggressor,” said Putin.

“Unfriendly steps towards Russia such as the deployment of the (U.S.) anti-missile system and of NATO infrastructure nearer our borders and such like, from a military point of view, will become ineffective.”

Steps to contain Russia would also become unjustifiably expensive and pointless, he forecast.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said in a statement after the speech that the new weapons Putin had unveiled meant that NATO’s missile defense shield, in Poland, Romania and Alaska and planned elements in South Korea and Japan was like an umbrella that was full of holes.

“I don’t know why they would now buy such an ‘umbrella’,” Shoigu said, referring to Seoul and Tokyo.

NATO declined immediate comment.

The United States has long asserted that U.S. missile defenses are incapable of halting a large-scale attack by a major nuclear power, like Russia or China, due in part to the limited number of U.S. missile interceptors.

Instead, the technology is aimed at what the U.S. views as “rogue” states, like Iran or North Korea.

“They know very well that it’s not about them. Our missile defense has never been about them,” White said.

She added that the U.S. focus in addressing Russia’s nuclear modernization was strengthening America’s own nuclear forces to serve as a deterrent.

Lisbeth Gronlund, senior scientist and co-director of the Global Security Program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Putin’s announcement of a missile with a nuclear-powered engine, even if true, would change little when it came to the Russian threat since Russia already has large numbers of ICBMs.

Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the IISS think-tank in London, said he was skeptical about some of Putin’s statements.

“It’s a mix of things that are still in the lab, things that are in tests, and things we knew they had. We’ll have to unpick a lot of this to sort out what is really new.”

Putin also voiced concerns about a new U.S. nuclear doctrine, saying Russia’s own doctrine was defensive and only envisaged the use of nuclear weapons in response to an attack.

Russia has repeatedly said it is keen to hold talks with the United States about the balance of strategic nuclear power and Putin put Washington and other nuclear powers on notice.

“We will view any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies, be it of small, medium or any force, as a nuclear attack on our country,” he said.

“Our response will be immediate. Nobody should have any doubts about that.”

Putin said that Russia did not plan to attack anyone, however. Russia’s growing military might was a guarantee of world peace, he said, designed to preserve a strategic balance of power on the planet."
huffpo149,huffpo,"['Liv Tørres', 'General Secretary', 'Norsk Folkehjelp', ""Norwegian People'S Aid""]",2013-09-26 08:30:20-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/liv-torres/nuclear-disarmament_b_3988288.html,"The horrors of the attack in Syria have shown the danger inherent in the continued possession of weapons of mass destruction. The global outrage in response to the carnage caused by the use of chemical weapons is proof that until they are eradicated, there is a significant risk that one day they will be used, whether by intention or by accident. Nuclear weapons, for all their status and symbolism, are not exempt from this stark reality, and the cost of neglecting to recognize this would be disastrous.

Nuclear weapons are designed to destroy cities. They are indiscriminate weapons, whose effects cannot be limited or controlled. Furthermore, the use of even a small fraction of existing arsenals -- more than 17,000 warheads -- would disrupt the climate and threaten agricultural production, leading to the starvation of up to two billion people.

As was made clear by the Hiroshima Committee of Experts in their analysis of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima, ""It is not possible to protect civilians from a nuclear weapons attack. To protect civilians, there is no measure other than to prevent a nuclear weapons attack from occurring, whether it be deliberate or accidental. To prevent the use of nuclear weapons, there is no way other than to abolish nuclear weapons themselves.""

Study upon study has pointed to the inability to prevent or care for civilian casualties on a mass scale. Mitigation is simply impossible for a weapon capable of producing temperatures comparable to the centre of the sun.

Nuclear weapon possessors are, of course, not ignorant of the true effects of nuclear weapons, just as they are not ignorant of the double standard that is afforded these weapons compared to other weapons of mass destruction. The truth is that, for decades, nuclear weapons have been given an almost mythological status: they are seen as 'keepers of the peace' or 'necessary evils.' They have been transmuted into symbols of power and prestige for the political and military elites of nuclear possessor states.

By keeping the focus on their humanitarian impact, we acknowledge that nuclear weapons are weapons -- not policy tools. No security doctrine or theory can completely obscure the fact that any use of nuclear weapons would entail catastrophic humanitarian consequences -- massive civilian casualties and irreparable damage to the environment, public health and the world economy.

Nuclear disarmament is not solely the province of nuclear weapon possessors. Nuclear weapons are a global humanitarian threat, and the responsibility to eliminate them lies with nuclear free states as much as it does with nuclear weapon possessors. On September 26, the UN General Assembly will hold the first ever High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament, which will be attended by heads of state and foreign ministers. This is an opportunity for nuclear free states to seize the day and steer their own course toward a world free from nuclear weapons.

Images and reports from Syria have reminded us of the reason why international standards must be set. Weapons that cannot discriminate between military targets and civilians, between armed combatants and infants, are anathema to any sense of human dignity. Chemical and biological weapons have been banned through legally binding international instruments. Nuclear weapons are, therefore, an anomaly among weapons of mass destruction. The acceptability of this status quo must end, and this starts with a treaty banning nuclear weapons. While armed conflicts persist, international norms that condemn civilian casualties and demand the preservation of human dignity must respected, and where there are gaps, we must fill them.

Recognising the catastrophic humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons means taking a clear position against the acceptability of these weapons. It means clearly articulating that the possession and threat of use of nuclear weapons are directly opposed to humanitarian principles and formulating that stigma into a legally binding instrument which bans them outright.

huffpo150,huffpo,"['Cristian Farias', 'Legal Affairs Reporter']",2016-02-04 18:06:18-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/assault-weapons-constitutional-protection_us_56b38ec7e4b08069c7a65c21,"In a major victory for gun rights advocates, a federal appeals court on Thursday sided with a broad coalition of gun owners, businesses and organizations that challenged the constitutionality of a Maryland ban on assault weapons and other laws aimed at curbing gun violence.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the state's prohibition on what the court called ""the vast majority of semi-automatic rifles commonly kept by several million American citizens"" amounted to a violation of their rights under the Constitution.

""In our view, Maryland law implicates the core protection of the Second Amendment -- the right of law-abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home,"" Chief Judge William Traxler wrote in the divided ruling.

Provisions that outlaw these firearms, Traxler wrote, ""substantially burden this fundamental right.""

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who recently suspended his Democratic presidential campaign, signed Maryland's Firearm Safety Act of 2013 in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, which spurred similar initiatives in other Democratic-leaning states.

The legislation mostly targets specific kinds of semi-automatic firearms -- such as AR-15s and AK-47s -- and large-capacity magazines, and adds certain registration and licensing requirements.

But gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, quickly moved to challenge these laws in the courts, claiming that the restrictions they imposed on lawful gun ownership were overly broad and weren't proven to save lives.

""This case was a major victory for the NRA and gun rights advocates."" Adam Winkler, UCLA law professor

The legal attacks have largely failed. Last October, a federal appeals court in Manhattan upheld the most iconic of these laws -- those passed in New York and Connecticut in direct response to the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. And in December, the Supreme Court declined to review a ruling out of Illinois that upheld a similar ban on assault weapons.

The high court's reluctance to intervene in these disputes has left the Second Amendment in a bit of a state of flux. Since the Supreme Court established in 2008 and 2010 that the amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for self-defense within the home, judges have struggled to apply those decisions to the newer spate of gun legislation. And inconsistent rulings and standards across the country have left the scope of the law unclear.

When the Supreme Court refused to take up the Illinois case, Justice Clarence Thomas complained that the Second Amendment was being relegated to ""a second-class right.""

""If a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the Second Amendment guarantees nothing,"" he wrote, and added that those earlier decisions enshrining the right to gun ownership shouldn't be expected to ""clarify the entire field.""

The lack of clarity since then underscores why Thursday's decision may be a boon to those who want to see a broader interpretation of the Second Amendment, setting the stage for the next Supreme Court confrontation.

""This case was a major victory for the NRA and gun rights advocates,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA who specializes in Second Amendment law. ""This opinion is an important one because it subjects important gun control laws to the most strict form of judicial scrutiny.""

Indeed, the biggest surprise in Chief Judge Traxler's 66-page opinion is the words ""strict scrutiny,"" a stringent constitutional test that most government laws and regulations fail. Other courts have applied more forgiving standards to similar gun legislation and upheld it.

The 4th Circuit's decision didn't outright strike down the Maryland legislation. Instead, it instructed a lower court to subject the provision to the higher legal standard, meaning more litigation and the possibility of a future showdown at the Supreme Court -- though maybe not yet, according to Winkler.

As if to illustrate the volatile politics and legalities of gun control, dissenting Circuit Judge Robert King all but declared that the court's ruling would lead to the next mass shooting.

""Let's be real,"" King wrote. ""The assault weapons banned by Maryland's [law] are exceptionally lethal weapons of war.""

Tahera Ahmad, director of Interfaith Engagement and associate chaplain at Northwestern University, has accused United of ""Islamophobia"" after an encounter with a flight attendant Friday that left her in tears.

Ahmad wrote in a Facebook post that she asked for an unopened can of Diet Coke during beverage service on her flight. When she was brought an open can, she requested a new beverage for sanitary reasons but was told, ""I'm sorry I just can't give you an unopened can so no diet coke for you.""

A man sitting near her was later brought an unopened beer, and Ahmad, who wears a hijab in her Facebook profile photo, asked the flight attendant again why she wasn't able to have a similar can.

""She said, 'We are unauthorized to give unopened cans to people because they may use it as a WEAPON on the plane,'"" Ahmad wrote.

I am sitting on a United airlines flight in the air 30,000ft above and I am in tears of humiliation from discrimination.... Posted by Tahera Ahmad on Friday, 29 May 2015

Ahmed also wrote that after the encounter, she asked her fellow passengers if the experience was discriminatory, but no one responded aside from one man who said, ""You Moslem, you need to shut the f** up ... yes you know you would use it as a WEAPON so shut the f**k up.""

When asked about the incident, a representative for United emailed The Huffington Post this statement:

The flight attendant onboard Shuttle America flight 3504 attempted several times to accommodate Ms. Ahmad's beverage request after a misunderstanding regarding a can of diet soda. The inflight crew met with Ms. Ahmad after the flight arrived in Washington to provide assistance and further discuss the matter. Additionally, we spoke with Ms. Ahmad yesterday to get a better understanding of what occurred and to apologize for not delivering the service our customers expect when traveling with us. We look forward to having the opportunity to welcome Ms. Ahmad back.

Ahmad's story has quickly spread on social media, with some people adopting the hashtag #UnitedForTahera, calling for a boycott of the airline. Despite the statement from the airline, Ahmed wrote on Twitter that she has yet to receive a ""sincere apology"" from United and is ""disappointed at [the] dismissal.""

Ahmad told the Chicago Sun-Times she's been targeted because of her hijab before. She said she's been spat on and had the covering ripped off, but the airplane incident was particularly troubling because she was “publicly targeted as a threat to people.”

Ahmad did not immediately return a request for comment from HuffPost."
huffpo152,huffpo,"['Ben Hallman', 'Senior Editor For Projects', 'Investigations', 'The Huffington Post']",2014-02-11 00:00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/guns-in-bars_n_4768884.html,"South Carolina on Tuesday became the latest state to allow concealed weapons in bars, making it the most recent victory ground for gun rights activists who have peeled back more than a dozen state-level gun restrictions in recent years.

The new law, signed by Gov. Nikki Haley a week after a man was fatally shot in a South Carolina bar parking lot, allows people holding concealed-weapon permits to carry firearms in places that serve food or alcohol, as long as they don't drink while inside. The law has a significant exemption: Establishments may enact their own weapon bans, provided they post a large sign in their window warning customers of their policy.

That bar and restaurant owners are now forced into the unpleasant position of potentially alienating some portion of their clientele by either posting a sign -- or not posting a sign -- is a win for gun groups that for decades have pursued local strategies for rolling back gun laws in states. Thanks to their work, it's now easier than ever before to carry guns in many public places in the U.S. South Carolina is their latest conquest.

Oklahoma, for example, recently made it easier for residents to openly carry guns in public, and a movement is underway in Texas to enact a similar measure. (It even has the backing of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis). Tennessee, Ohio, Arizona, Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina have all enacted laws similar to the one just adopted in South Carolina, allowing for concealed-carry in bars and restaurants. Kentucky is also considering legislation.

The advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, formed in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre, has attempted to counter this momentum. Its strategy, thus far, has hinged on persuading business owners that it is in their best economic interest to enact gun bans.

In recent days, volunteers for the South Carolina chapter of Moms Demand Action have gone door-to-door to dozens of establishments, including national chains, said Erin Dando, the chapter leader.

""So far this is mostly about education,"" Dando said. ""Most business and bar owners don't even know that there has been a drastic change in state policy. We are telling them that they still have the right to ban concealed firearms.""

But once educated, Moms Demand Action expects establishments to take their side, or face repercussions.

""We are letting them know we will only go to places that have gun bans,"" Dando said.

So far, this type of approach has yielded some limited success. Last summer, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote an open letter to customers asking that they not bring guns into the coffee chain's retail locations, a position the moms' group had lobbied to bring about. But a recent effort to convince Staples stores to ban guns hasn't gained much traction.

A current fight underway in North Carolina between the Moms Demand Action and gun rights supporters suggests that the organization can achieve some victories at the local level, but that they are hard-fought. After a law similar to the South Carolina one passed in the state last year, dozens of businesses hung ""no guns allowed"" signs in windows at the urging of gun-control activists. Some, though, later took down their sign after they received angry calls and emails from gun rights supporters.

South Carolina bars and restaurants will likely soon face the same choice.

Dando said she is encouraged by what she has heard so far. Some bars, she said, have already hung signs, which under the new law must be uniform: 8-inches by 12 inches, with the words ""NO CONCEALABLE WEAPONS ALLOWED"" in black, 1-inch-tall, uppercase type, with a black silhouette of a handgun inside a 7-inch circle with a diagonal line through it. The law also forces businesses to abide by strict rules in placing the signs.

The rollback of the bar gun ban could be followed by even more drastic action. At the signing ceremony, Haley said she supports another bill currently under consideration by lawmakers that would completely eliminate all permitting, fees and training requirements for carrying weapons, according to The State, a newspaper in Columbia, S.C.

Gov. Haley signed the measure allowing concealed-carry in bars and restaurants around midday on Tuesday, while the attention of most of the state was on a snow and ice storm barreling down on the South.

""She signed it right after she declared a state of emergency, which I find ironic,"" Dando said."

I count myself among the many Americans who at various points in their lives have owned and used long guns -- hunting rifles and shotguns -- for hunting and target shooting. No one I know in politics seriously proposes that ordinary Americans be denied the right to own those kinds of weapons.

But guns used for hunting have nothing in common with assault weapons like the ones that were used last week in the mass murder of 20 first-graders -- except the fact that they are referred to ""guns.""

Rapid-fire assault weapons with large clips of ammunition have only one purpose: the mass slaughter of large numbers of human beings. They were designed for use by the military to achieve that mission in combat -- and that mission alone.

No one argues that other combat weapons like rocket-propelled grenades (RPG's) or Stinger Missiles should be widely available to anyone at a local gun shop. Why in the world should we allow pretty much anyone to have easy access to assault weapons?

Every politician in America will tell you they will move heaven and earth to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. Yet we have allowed the ban on this particular weapon of mass destruction to expire. As a result, a terrorist named Adam Lanza was able to have easy access to the assault weapons he used to kill scores of children in minutes.

Let's be clear, Adam Lanza was a terrorist just as surely as he would have been if we were motivated by an extreme jihadist ideology. It makes no difference to those children or to their grieving families whether their loved ones were killed by someone who was mentally deranged or by someone who believed that by killing children he was helping to destroying the great Satan.

When an individual is willing -- or perhaps eager -- to die making a big ""statement"" by killing many of his fellow human beings, it doesn't matter what their motivation is. It does matter whether they have easy access to the weapons that make mass murder possible.

And after last week, can anyone seriously question whether assault weapons are in fact weapons of mass destruction? If Lanza had conventional guns -- or like a man in China who recently went berserk, he only had knives -- he would not have been physically capable of killing so many people in a few short minutes.

Of course you hear people say -- oh, a car or an airliner can be turned into a weapon of mass destruction -- many things can become weapons of mass destruction. And there is no question after 9/11 that we know that this is true. But cars and airliners have to be converted from their primary use in order to become instruments of mass death. It takes an elaborate plot and many actors to take over an airliner and it isn't easy to methodically kill 27 people with a car.

More important, assault weapons have no redeeming social value or alternative use whatsoever. The only reason to purchase an assault weapon, instead of a long gun used for target practice or hunting, is to kill and maim large numbers of human beings.

And it is not the case that if assault weapons were banned ordinary people would get them anyway. We certainly don't take that attitude with nuclear weapons or dirty bombs. We make it very hard for a terrorist to get nuclear weapons or dirty bomb. It used to be hard to get assault weapons.

When the former President of Mexico visited the United States some time ago to discuss the drug-fueled violence on the Mexican border, he pointed out that the end of the assault weapons ban in the U.S. had resulted in an explosion of smuggling of assault weapons from the United States to Mexico. Weapons that were previously unavailable in large numbers, became plentiful. He begged the United States to re-impose the assault weapons ban.

Allowing easy access to assault weapons guarantees that terrorists, criminals and mentally unstable people will use them to commit future acts of mass murder -- it's that simple. There are seven billion people on the planet. Try as we may, we are not going to prevent some of those seven billion people from becoming terrorists, criminals or mentally unstable. Why make it easy for them to do harm to their fellow human beings by giving them easy access to a weapon of mass destruction?

Since this tragedy, there have been calls for greater restrictions and background checks on those who can buy guns -- and there should be. But from all accounts, the weapons used in the Connecticut murders were purchased legally by the shooter's mother -- who herself appeared to be perfectly sane right up to the moment that Lanza used those same weapons to end her life.

The NRA will no doubt repeat its mantra about the ""slippery slope."" ""If we ban assault weapons, shotguns will be next,"" they say. Really? By banning anyone from buying Stinger Missiles that are used to shoot down airplanes do we make it more likely that the government will one day prevent people from hunting ducks?

The simple fact is that no right is absolute because rights come into conflict with each other. Your free speech does not give you the right to cry ""fire"" in a crowded theater.

Is the NRA's concern that banning assault weapons will put us on a ""slippery slope"" more important than the lives of those 20 first graders? Should it really take precedence over the fact that today in Newtown, Connecticut there are 20 families with holiday presents on a closet shelf, that were purchased for an excited six-year-old who will never open them?

Are the NRA's fears more important than the terror faced by children in the Sandy Hook Elementary school last week?

Does the right to own an assault weapon take precedence over the right of those parents to see their children grow up, and graduate from college, and stand at the alter to be married, and have children of their own?

The bottom line is that there is no reason why weapons of mass destruction of any sort - chemical weapons, biological weapons, RPG's, improvised explosive devices (IED's), missiles, dirty bombs, nuclear devices, or assault weapons -- should be easily accessible. For 10 years there was a ban on the production, ownership and use of assault weapons in the United States until Congress and the Bush Administration allowed it to lapse when it sunset and came up for reauthorization in 2004.

A serious response to the tragedy in Connecticut requires that Congress act to reinstate the assault weapons ban before the children of other families fall victim to the fantasies of some other mentally unbalanced individual -- or the ideology of a terrorist who has been empowered by our failure to act.

Not that the longtime actress’s power is unknown. She’s been hailed widely for her roles in Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” and HBO’s “The Leftovers” ― and she’s appropriately nominated for a 2017 Emmy Award for both. (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Best Drama Guest Actress, respectively.) But whether she was playing the wickedly devout Aunt Lydia in Bruce Miller’s critically acclaimed adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s book, or the largely speechless, yet wildly intimidating cult leader, Patti, in Damon Lindelof’s series based off Tom Perrotta’s 2011 novel, she delivers something more than just a statue-worthy performance.

Across her many roles on TV (not to mention her beloved parts in films like “Compliance”), Dowd seems to bottle all the necessary elements of prestige entertainment into one body. Toss her into a series mix ― preferably, as the quasi-villain to the storied anti-hero of your dystopia ― and she’ll provide the pitch-perfect acting your well-lit drama needs. The best part is that her effectiveness doesn’t rest on scripted violence or gratuitous nudity; rather, her unrivaled elocution and unmissable grimaces are capable of captivating your senses for just as long as those other prestige fallbacks. Forget the 13 rules, just get yourself an Ann who can emote like millions of regularly engaged fans are watching.

Need further proof of her power? Here are just a few more prestige shows and miniseries she’s graced with her presence: “Masters of Sex,” “Olive Kitteridge,” “True Detective,” “Girls.” (If you need a reminder, Dowd’s turn as an emotionally-stunted woman in an incestuous relationship with the series’ killer on “True Detective” Season 1 is fantastically distressing.) Before that, she was featured on fan-favorite shows like “Freaks and Geeks,” “X-Files” and “The Baby-Sitters Club.” Ann is everywhere.

Ahead of the 2017 Emmy Awards, airing on NBC on Sept. 17, we spoke to Dowd about her banger of a year, the possibility of learning more about Aunt Lydia in “Handmaid’s Tale” Season 2, and the undeniable empathy of “The Leftovers.” While she might be more humble when it comes to her star capacity, she’s willing to explain how feeling like “the one who just does not fit in” helped her to stick her landings.

Hulu

Hi, Ann! I was just on hold with some ominous music playing, and I wish I was more fluent in classical music, but I feel like it was very appropriate to talk to the actress behind Lydia and Patti.

Oh, my god, yeah. I bet that was intentional. No, I’m kidding. Wow.

So you have had quite a year in two very different, but two very culturally relevant television shows. So I wanted to ask you about both of them. But I’ll start with “Handmaid’s Tale”: Have you started shooting Season 2 yet?

No we don’t start until, I believe, mid-September. Yes, it’s nice. I’ve finished a series called “Good Behavior,” which is wonderful. And that was in North Carolina. It’s with Michelle Dockery, do you know it? And Juan Botto and Terry Kinney? It’s a terrific show with TNT, but I hope people see it because they’re so darn good. Anyway, and then we go into “Handmaid’s Tale.”

I was pretty excited to read Bruce Miller tell The New York Times that Aunt Lydia is one of his most fascinating characters and that he would like to explore her backstory more in Season 2. During the filming of Season 1, did you start to come up with your own theories about Lydia’s origins?

That’s a great question. I asked Bruce early, before we began shooting, how did he see her life before Gilead? And he said, “Well, I think she was a teacher.” And that made tremendous sense of course ― huge sense. And I thought, wow, I can just imagine her in a Catholic girls school or, say, a public school, watching the world go to hell. Meaning ― the disrespect, the promiscuity, the drug use, the pollution, religion having gone out of the lives of young people. You can imagine her just watching all this go down and thinking there’s got to be a way to salvage this world.

I think of her as having kind of a lonely life, really. She’s a loner, I think. Not a lot of friends, not a lot of social life. I think her church is her refuge. When you think of someone who has such a narrow view of life ― a rigid holding onto the Bible in its most extreme ― you wonder, where does that person come from? What creates that level of rigidness? Did she herself suffer a loss, did she have a baby, did she have an abortion, did she have men who mistreated her, that she had to absolutely shut down and promise God that she wouldn’t abandon him? Do you know what I mean? Going on those lines of, what brought her to this place of extreme beliefs? When you look around and you meet people in your life and think, wow, how did you get there? How did you get to that place where you exclude so much of what is evident in the world? Surely you can’t think that all people are going to fit into your way of thinking. But it’s a serious question, and I always think there’s got to be some level of ... there’s a reason why things are oppressed, let’s just put it that way. And I’m sure Lydia has her reasons.

I think what makes her so fascinating is that she’s a complex villain on the show. We see her preside over these vicious scenes like the salvaging, but we also see her in these pretty stunning moments of gentleness, particularly when it comes to the character of Janine. Did you ever think about the more gentle, mundane parts of her backstory, like what hobbies she might have been interested in?

That’s interesting. I think she loves, loves, loves to teach students and give them a level of understanding. And so she is very drawn to them and isn’t there to hurt them. I think she takes that very seriously and wants to protect them. As to what her hobbies might have been, well, maybe she’s a gardener. You know, and I kind of think of her with a sort of solitary life. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was probably a very fine Mahjong player or bridge player. I think she’s very, very bright and has her church circle. I think these are relatively solitary endeavors, you know? Trips to the country, explore the Vatican.

HBO

One of the last times we saw Lydia, she was in a pretty exasperating situation. She’d just ordered the handmaids to stone Janine only to have them band together and refuse. At this point, do you think Lydia is starting to see the light a little bit? Or do you think this is sort of the beginning of her doubling back down on her devotion?

I think she’s in some form of panic and wondering how in the world this could have happened. How did they miss the boat? How did they not realize the severity of what was happening, and the shift that was underway? I think that she’s going to reinvest, for sure. This just is not acceptable on any level. I mean, things in life are hard. I imagine her feeling, you know, the stoning and so on and so forth. She was very, very conflicted about it herself. But in the end, you don’t just change the plan because something is difficult. And I think the reaction of the girls was unacceptable to her, and I think it really threw her, completely threw her. And she’s regrouping and I think she’s panicking.

Obviously you’ve all been asked a lot about the show’s relevance throughout the series’ first season, and we’re seeing a lot of religiously motivated legislature popping up in state congresses across the country since, particularly related to reproductive rights. For you, did sitting with the story of “The Handmaid’s Tail” over the past year influence the way you digested current events?

Yes. You know, it’s just so hard to believe that people could make a choice to control others and to repress others and then all in the name of God. I am baffled by that. Those who claim to be pro-life. When I think of those in the “far right” or those who are pro-life to the extreme, and at all costs protect the unborn, the thing that enrages me is you want to ask everyone of them: How many foster children are in your home now? What children who have no family, who have no one supporting them, or sticking up for them, or educating them, or loving them ― how many are in your home? How dare you picket and repress, and take into your own or try to take into your own hands others’ rights. Why don’t you pay attention to what is around you? To the issues that surround you? I find it baffling, and really deeply upsetting.

The show has inspired more than a few women across the country to dress up in handmaid robes and protest in congresses in Missouri, Ohio, Texas and California. Was it surprising to you that the show had such an impact on activism?

I was so thrilled. And that was the hope, you know? When someone puts a name and a face to something and says here’s what, it just opens the door to more. That would be the hope. Yes, you can speak up, there is a way! I love that about it so much and that certainly doesn’t surprise me. It just thrills me, actually.

While Handmaid’s Tales had more of a direct connection to current affairs in the U.S., I think that “The Leftovers” has had a different kind of cultural relevance. For me, its relevance was a bit more emotional. It sort of captured this feeling of desperation and anguish that seems to dial into something universal about our present day. Did you feel that or consider that at all when you were playing Patti?

Yes, yes, I agree with you. Because haven’t we all been in that place of panic, and repression? How can I move forward here, what am I going to do? Oh yes, and to see that there is a way to survive, there is a way always to move forward. I don’t say always ― think of those who have lost their lives, think of what goes on all over the world for refugees. It’s so desperate. But yes, I do think [“The Leftovers”] gets right to the core of it. And there’s something, if you’ll forgive the term, that entertainment provides ― something beyond a way to forget your life for a moment. It offers you a chance to think more deeply about your life. To just connect to it, and sit with it, and say, “Wow, how can I move forward with this?”

That to me was a gift in “The Leftovers,” as well. How do you sit with grief? How do you sit with loss and not run from it? How do you let go? And with “Handmaid’s,” [how do you] identify the repression, stay awake, stay alert? Don’t think someone else is going to do it for you. Look up from your phone. Take action. Fight for the small rights, because they build very quickly into the difference between life and death.

The characters that you play in “Handmaid’s” and “Leftovers” ― they have some similarities to varying degrees. They’re both part of cults, and they’re portrayed as villainous or counters to the protagonists. Were you drawing any parallels between the characters of Lydia and Patti?

Well, of course they’re very different human beings, and they come from different lives. Of course, don’t we all? What they have in common, I think, is that they found their true strengths and agency in committing to these various beliefs. Patti, for the first time in her life, became the leader she was meant to be. I think she lived an entirely repressed life, an abusive life, and no one gave her any credit for anything. And she knew something was going to happen, and when it did actually happen, that woke her right up and she stepped straight into her place of power and strength and confidence and leadership. And she was able to commit fully to the end, which was taking her life. Lydia similarly, she was in it for the long haul. She will, I think, go to the mat and stay there until the job is done.

Do you think that you’re personally drawn to acting in roles like these ― strong, agency-driven women ― or do they sort of just find you?

Well, it’s a good question. It would seem that way, that these roles have come to me. And how phenomenal; they’ve fascinated me and you jump on board quickly. I guess I could say I’m drawn to the loner, the outside, the one that just does not fit in, never has, probably never will. I think they’re beautiful creatures, and they move me every time. So to be able to participate in the life of someone like that, it just means the world to me, honestly.

If you could take on a role in TV or film that’s outside the realms of Patti and Lydia and these beautiful outsiders, do you have an idea of what that would be?"

Dwan Diondro Wakefield, 17, Byron McBride, 19, and D’Allen Tyreek Washington, 17, were booked on the charges hours after Kingston Frazier’s body was found inside his mother’s stolen car on Thursday, jailhouse records show.

The child’s mother had said that she left her son asleep in her car when she ran into a Jackson Kroger supermarket around 1 a.m. that morning. When she returned, her car and son were gone, state police have said.

The Madison County coroner said the boy had been shot multiple times, conflicting with previous reports that he had been shot once in his head, Mississippi News Now reported.

MBI Kingston Frazer, 6, was found dead inside of his mother's car after it was stolen outside of a grocery store on Thursday, police said.

“We do believe he was shot in the back of the car,” District Attorney Michael Guest told the local Jackson news outlet. “Whether he was asleep or awake, I don’t have any idea.”

Surveillance video captured the suspects pulling up to the car Kingston was in just moments after his mother, Ebony Archie, entered the store. A suspect left the group’s vehicle and got into Archie’s car. Both vehicles drove off, Jackson police said.

Guest told The Associated Press on Friday that investigators were still looking for the weapon used to kill the child, but that they are confident that his killers are behind bars.

Madison County Sheriffs Office Suspects Dwan Diondro Wakefield, 17, DAllen Tyreek Washington, 17, and Bryon McBride, 19.

Mississippi Bureau of Investigation special agent Rusty Clark said in a sworn statement the AP obtained that Wakefield implicated McBride in interviews as the one who stole Archie’s vehicle and shot and killed her son.

“Other than it just being somebody being mean and evil and cruel, I’m not seeing a motive being developed as to why these individuals would have killed this child,” Guest told the Clarion-Ledger. “That’s probably something we’ll never get. We’ll probably never learn a motive as to why this occurred.”

Though capital murder convictions carry the chance of the death penalty in Mississippi, only McBride would be eligible because of his age. The Supreme Court abolished capital punishment as a sentence for crimes committed by someone younger than 18 in 2005."

A judge has denied bond to a Chicago man who shot himself in the penis after allegedly robbing a hot dog stand.

Terrion Pouncy has been charged with two counts of armed robbery stemming from an alleged robbery that happened Tuesday morning at Maxwell Street Express, according to CBS Chicago.

Police said the 19-year-old suspect held a gun up to two employees and robbed them of their cellphones, wallets and cash, according to NBC Chicago.

At one point, Pouncy allegedly pressed a .38 caliber pistol to the head of a 39-year-old worker who had been passing a bucket filled with grease over the counter.

The victim told his co-worker to hand over the cash from the register. When the two employees gave Pouncy their wallets and a stack of singles, the grease bucket tipped and bills went flying, Assistant Cook County State’s Attorney Erin Antonietti said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Pouncy allegedly bent over to collect the cash and then shifted the gun in his waistband while running away from the restaurant.

At that point, he apparently pulled the trigger and fired a bullet that struck him in the penis, Antonietti told the court. The 39-year-old victim wrestled briefly with Pouncy before he staggered away from the restaurant.

Pouncy called 911 from the steps of a house across the street and reported being shot. He was taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for his injuries before being arrested.

Police said surveillance cameras captured video and audio of the robbery, and showed Pouncy struggling to make it across the the street.

Police recovered the wallets he allegedly stole, as well as the .38 caliber pistol. They said his blood-stained boxers had a particular pattern that matched underwear seen in the surveillance video when he bent over to collect money off the floor."

gofundmecom/help-for-chey In a photo shared on a GoFundMe page after Cheyanne Willis claimed she had a miscarriage, she appears to be pregnant. Police now say she was not pregnant.

But she apparently faked not only her pregnancy but also a miscarriage after a mass shooting at her gender reveal party, according to police in Ohio.

“We were led to believe an unborn child was murdered in this incident only to find out that was not the case,” Colerain Township Police Chief Mark Denney said in a news release this week.

Willis, 21, was shot in the leg on July 8 when two gunmen showed up at a party on Capstan Drive and fired at least 14 rounds at the guests. Autum Garrett, 22, of Andrews, Indiana, was killed in the volley of gunfire. Eight others, including three children, were wounded, police said.

“The purpose of the party was to disclose the gender of Cheyanne Willis’ unborn child,” the police report said.

The next morning, Willis claimed the shooting caused her to have a miscarriage, Cincinnati’s WCPO-TV reported.

Denney didn’t say how investigators determined Willis wasn’t pregnant, but he did say “hours and days have been wasted following leads” that were based on lies.

“From the very beginning of this investigation, we have met significant resistance that is uncommon from victims of crime wanting a resolution,” the police chief said. Police would not comment further on the investigation of the shooting.

Willis made headlines in 2015 when a video was uploaded to Facebook that showed her being assaulted by a group of women. The video showed the women brutally beat her, shave her head and write “I got my ass whopped” on her forehead. Willis was reportedly hospitalized after the attack.

Facebook A screenshot from the 2015 Facebook video of Cheyanne Willis' alleged beating and humiliation.

In regard to the fake pregnancy, police spokesman James Love told People magazine that Willis cannot be charged. Charges will likely only be considered if the falsehood is somehow linked to the shooting.

“As ridiculous as it might be, it’s not a crime to lie, [and] it’s not a crime to have a party over that lie,” Love said. “Now if she lied and put everyone in the danger — of course, the shooters would be the main focus, but [to press charges] would be a decision up to the local prosecutors.”

A GoFundMe campaign, titled “Justice for Cheyanne,” is no longer accepting donations. It’s unclear if monies donated before the campaign was closed will be refunded. There was no immediate response from GoFundMe about the status of the account.

As of Wednesday, authorities had not identified any suspects in the shooting.

It can be jarring to see placards advertising ""Flu Shots Today"" in late July or early August in 80-degree weather.

But those signs may be more than just an unwelcome reminder that summer's days are numbered. Mounting scientific evidence is raising questions about whether vaccinating people that early may actually be undermining the effectiveness of the nation's massive flu vaccination program.

Studies from the US and Europe have detected a steady decline in vaccine protection in the months after vaccination. The most recent research, published just last month by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showed that the vaccine's effectiveness was reduced by more than half for a couple of strains of flu, and had diminished almost entirely for another by five or six months after vaccination.

More research is needed to confirm the findings. But Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said there's enough evidence now to suggest early vaccination efforts -- part of an attempt by commercial pharmacies to capture a bigger piece of the flu vaccine pie -- should be discouraged.

""I have been concerned for some time that we have gotten into the marketing of influenza vaccine versus the effective use of influenza vaccine. And we've got to reconsider that,"" Osterholm told STAT.

""Until we get more data, frankly I think the very best approach is to try to make sure we get flu vaccine into people just before flu activity starts, not something convenient to when the marketers want to get people in the door of department stores and grocery stores.""

Other scientists say it's too soon to jump to a conclusion that would require changing recommendations. The CDC currently advises people should be vaccinated by the end of October.

""Is there waning [of protection] within a given season? I do think the evidence is growing and it's growing in a way that suggests that there is something there. But we need more information,"" said Jill Ferdinands, an influenza epidemiologist at the CDC and the lead author of the most recent article on this question.

Influenza vaccination programs are a major public health endeavor. Although the annual effort always falls short of vaccinating everyone -- the CDC estimated that only 40 percent of people had been vaccinated by early November, its most up-to-date data -- the US uses more than 100 million doses of flu vaccine every year. So far this year, manufacturers have shipped nearly 148 million doses.

Once people are vaccinated, it takes about 14 days for the immune system to generate a protective response, a factor in the debate over timing.

""It is hugely disruptive to try to immunize millions of people in a six- to eight-week period beginning in October or November. So I understand in the context of a universal immunization program, to get the vaccine into all those arms it's nice to be able to start earlier,"" said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a flu epidemiologist at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control.

Canada starts its flu vaccination efforts after the US, generally in late October or early November. But Skowronski said at this point that's mainly because it can't get the vaccine from the suppliers sooner.

The biggest challenge for those who plan flu vaccination campaigns is the mercurial virus itself. Flu season is not like fishing season; it does not have a fixed start date.

The fact is health authorities know a flu epidemic will occur sometime between late November and late March, and that the epidemic will spike, then decline, roughly over a 13-week period.

But which strain of the flu will be the major cause of illness? How harsh or mild will the outbreak be? And most crucially, for planning purposes, when will the annual epidemic start? Even the best flu experts can only guess.

(If you're wondering about flu activity this year, it's definitely heating up across the country. If you've been meaning to get a flu shot but haven't gotten around to it, you can still get one -- but you'd be ill-advised to wait much longer. Flu has arrived.)

Some years the worst of the action is in late January and early February. Other years an early season will hit before Christmas. And many years after an initial peak caused by one of the influenza A viruses, H3N2 or H1N1, there will be a second wave of illness triggered by influenza B, in March and April. ""It's part of the complexity of the question,"" acknowledged Ferdinands.

An unusually late flu season in 2011-12 in Europe sparked the latest round of questions about how best to time flu vaccination campaigns. Scientists who study how well the vaccine protects year after year saw a lot of cases of flu among people who had been vaccinated.

A flurry of studies have since followed. A big one from Europe, published last April, looked at data from five flu seasons. It saw protection against the influenza A virus H3N2 decline to virtually nothing by four months after vaccination. By contrast, protection against influenza A H1N1 did not erode and the vaccine's effectiveness against flu B viruses waned substantially, but didn't reach zero.

The CDC study, which looked at data from four flu seasons, showed a more consistent pattern. Protection against all the two influenza A families and influenza B viruses all declined steadily in the months after vaccination, at a rate of about 7 percent per month. (The decline was a bit steeper for protection against H3N2 viruses.) That might seem small, but people aren't starting from 100 percent protection. On average, flu vaccine is estimated to cut the risk of flu by about 50 percent or 60 percent -- and some years, the protection is less than that, when the strains in the vaccine aren't well-matched to those making people sick.

Ferdinands said given the way the studies are designed, one can't be certain the increasing cases late in the season are due to waning protection. For one thing, the circulating viruses might have evolved, which can diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Additionally, people who get vaccinated early may be more vulnerable to flu than those who get vaccinated later. They may have chronic diseases that make them worry more about flu -- but that also could also diminish their immune systems' ability to respond well to a flu shot.

While the evidence is starting to mount, many flu experts appear wary about a change. Ferdinands noted that very few people actually get vaccinated in the summer.

Though summer vaccinations have increased slightly over the past few years, only about 2.4 percent of Americans get a flu shot before September, data from the CDC show. And over the past six years, less than 10 percent of people were vaccinated by the end of September. The peak month for flu shots was October, with between 16 percent and 18 percent of people getting vaccinated then.

Osterholm said public health officials should try to get those people who are getting vaccinated in July, August, and September to delay their shots. ""I think that trying to move vaccination back to mid-October to mid-November catches almost even the earliest flu season and it may give us another couple of months of protection on the other end, when flu season continues on into early spring,"" he argued.

At this point, many researchers, like Dr. Arnold Monto, an influenza researcher at the University of Michigan, don't advocate for changing the recommendations; pushing too close up against the start of early flu seasons doesn't seem wise to them. That said, if you asked Monto when to get your flu shot, based on the emerging studies, you'd get this reply: ""I would say: Don't get it too early."""
huffpo161,huffpo,"['Priscilla Frank', 'Arts', 'Culture Reporter']",2017-04-07 09:04:55-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kathy-shorr-shot-photography_us_58e63de2e4b0fe4ce088a0d2,"One day while picking up her daughters from daycare, Shirley Justice was attacked by her ex-husband. She was shot 14 times, and she survived.

Since 2013, photographer Kathy Shorr has chronicled people like Justice, survivors of gun violence in America. In her portrait, Justice stands near a window wearing a bra, revealing the scars writ across her chest and stomach. The expression on her face reads as mournful, even incredulous, yet at peace.

“Fourteen bullets entered my body that day,” Justice recalled in her interview with Shorr. “Fourteen bullets that ripped through every major organ and artery. Fourteen chances to die. ‘I will live for you,’ I promised my girls as I lay on the ground watching my ex-husband flee the scene.”

Shorr’s photo book, simply titled Shot, features 101 portraits accompanied by interviews and descriptions of her subjects, all of whom survived instances of gun violence in America. Shorr first began thinking about the project after she and her daughter were held up at gunpoint during a home invasion.

Neither Shorr nor her daughter were physically injured during the encounter, but the experience and the subsequent emotional trauma left the artist agonizing over the thousands of Americans each year whose lives are irreparably changed by virtue of a loaded gun.

Kathy Shorr ""Ambushed by her ex-husband, Shirley was shot as she got her daughters from nursery school. Her ex-husband used two guns and struck her 14 times. The former military man was released on $25,000 bail."" (Indianapolis, Indiana, 2014.)

According to CNN in 2016, there are more mass shootings in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. That same year, The New York Times reported that gun homicides are a common cause of death in America, killing about as many people as car crashes. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that between 2001 and 2014 alone, 440,095 people died at the hands of a firearm on U.S. soil.

“People don’t always think about the survivors,” Shorr told The Huffington Post. “Gun violence survivors are here and have a voice, a very important voice. They have experienced something that is kind of indescribable to someone that hasn’t experienced it.”

To begin her project, Shorr reached out to a man named Antonius, whose story she’d learned while listening to the NY1 news. She approached him on Facebook, they emailed back and forth and eventually met in person. After talking through the details, Shorr and Antonius returned to the Brooklyn street corner where he had been shot only seven weeks prior. Antonius took a Xanax to stay calm.

The shoot, according to Shorr, was overwhelmingly positive. People from the community came by to shake Antonius’ hand. He pulled up his shirt and Shorr photographed his scar. Antonius told the photographer how cathartic it was to return to the site and take back the space. “At that point I realized this was a project I could really do,” Shorr said.

“I always saw it as a book,” she continued. “I just felt that once I started there was no turning back. Especially once I started talking to people and learning their stories, I felt an incredible amount of responsibility to complete the project.”

Kathy Shorr ""Eight-year-old Taniya was shot by another third-grader in their classroom. The boy had found the gun in his home and brought it to school."" (Augusta, Georgia, 2015.)

Shorr’s subjects adhere to no single age, gender, ethnicity, class or occupation. Their stories are equally as far-ranging. There is 8-year-old Taniya, accidentally shot by a fellow third grader who brought his father’s gun to school, and Greg, a Georgia-based police sergeant shot by a drug dealer during a bust. There are victims of robberies, domestic abuse, hate crimes and stray bullets. The physical impact of the violence manifests in wheelchairs, prosthetic aids, purple contusions or scars of gauzy flesh. The emotional impact the viewer can only attempt to imagine.

Shorr describes her style as part street photography, part documentary portraiture. Some images zoom in on the physical residue of where bullet met flesh, while others are more straightforward portraits, focusing more on the person than the tragedy that shattered their sense of normalcy. Many photos were captured at the location where each subject was wounded, which the artist described as a way of saying, “You didn’t get me, I’m here.”

“The project was always meant to bring a face to an abstract situation,” Shorr said. “To show how gun violence affects everyone, not only certain groups of people. Anyone can be shot, anywhere. Many of the people in the project are gun owners themselves; one is even a member of the NRA.”

Shorr hopes her portrait series serves as a non-partisan foil to the polarizing shouting matches on the subject of gun violence. “It’s time to start talking about these issues so we can grow and learn from each other,” Shorr said. “When people can see both sides of an issue, and both sides have valid points, we can talk to each other rather than at each other. It’s not a black and white issue.”

According to police spokesman Capt. Bo Mathews, neighbors told Sgt. Chris Barnes that 35-year-old Magdiel Sanchez could not hear his commands. It remains unclear whether Barnes heard those warnings before discharging his weapon multiple times.

“He can't hear you!” – what witnesses yelled to police before an officer shot and killed a deaf man in Oklahoma City. pic.twitter.com/8uA0yL7rYs — AJ+ (@ajplus) September 20, 2017

Barnes and Lt. Matthew Lindsey went to Sanchez’s home to investigate a hit-and-run that had occurred earlier in the evening, Mathews said. Sanchez’s father was allegedly the driver of the car that fled the scene.

The two officers found Sanchez, who did not have a criminal record and was not involved in the hit-and-run, on the porch of the house holding a 2-foot-long metal pipe. The pipe had a small loop on one end, which is meant to be worn around the wrist, NBC reported. A neighbor told The Associated Press that Sanchez often carried the pipe to scare off the neighborhood’s many stray dogs.

When Sanchez approached, the officers ordered him to drop the pipe and “get on the ground,” Mathews said. Sanchez allegedly did not follow their commands and continued to move towards them.

Hearing the commotion, witnesses began yelling at the cops, telling them about Sanchez’s hearing disability.

“He can’t hear you,” they shouted, per Mathews.

Neighbors told KOCO 5 News that Sanchez was deaf and nonverbal.

When Sanchez got within 15 feet of the officers, Barnes fired his gun and Lindsey deployed his Taser. Mathews said Barnes discharged his firearm more than once. A witness told AP she heard “five or six gunshots.”

Sanchez was later pronounced dead at the scene.

“They killed an innocent man,” neighbor Julio Rayos told KOCO. “He was never aggressive to nobody. He was a real nice guy. I don’t think he deserved to die like that.”

The shooting is being investigated as a homicide, and Barnes has been placed on paid administrative leave.

Mathews said he wasn’t sure why the officers had not taken heed of the neighbors’ shouts about Sanchez’s disability, but said “tunnel vision” may have prevented them from processing the warnings.

“In those situations, very volatile situations, you have a weapon out, you can get what they call tunnel vision, or you can really lock into just the person that has the weapon that’d be the threat against you,” Mathews said. “I don’t know exactly what the officers were thinking at that point.”

The Oklahoma City Police Department is in the process of obtaining body cameras for its officers, NBC News reported. Neither Barnes nor Lindsey was wearing one at the time of Sanchez’s shooting."

Hikers found the elderly alpha female abandoned in the woods near the northern boundary of the park near Gardiner, Montana, on April 11. They called for help, but she was so severely injured that she had to be euthanized.

Necropsy results released Thursday show that the 12-year-old — who was twice as old as the average wolf in the park — had been shot with a rifle.

“The death of this wolf is another tragic loss in the trend of illegally poaching iconic species,” said Jaimie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife.

“Yellowstone National Park’s wolves are unequivocally prized. These wolves are valued globally, and local communities reliant on tourism benefit significantly from their presence. Returning wolves to their natural habitat has a beneficial effect on the entire ecosystem.”

The canine was one of three white wolves in the park. She was the alpha female of the Canyon Pack for more than nine years with the same alpha male, and had at least 20 pups. She was one of the most recognizable wolves in the park,

Yellowstone offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer or killers. The wildlife advocacy group the Wolves of the Rockies in Montana doubled the reward.

Some conservationists believe the wolf was shot by someone angry about the reintroduction of the animals into the park 20 years ago — otherwise they would have likely taken the “trophy.”

“People take matters into their own hands and feel they are above the law and they kind of flaunt that fact that they can do what they want to do and there’s no repercussions,” Wolves of the Rockies President Marc Cook told The Associated Press. There are now close to 100 wolves in the park, despite the complaints of many ranchers and hunters.

It’s illegal to shoot animals in the park — or to discharge a firearm.

Yellowstone accepts anonymous tips to its phone line at 888-653-0009. “You don’t have to tell them who you are, but please tell them what you know,” said the park statement. You can email information to nps_isb@nps.gov or submit it online at www.nps.gov/isb.

Walker Daugherty and Edwin Roberts were wounded in the incident on January 6, The Associated Press reported.

Daugherty and his fiancee told police they were shot by undocumented immigrants from Mexico, per CBS 7 in Odessa, Texas. However, the station said police now believe Daugherty actually shot Roberts and another member of the party, Michael Bryant, shot Daugherty.

“There were no bullet casings or projectiles from weapons other than those belonging to the individuals hunting on the ranch nor in the RV belonging to the hunting party,” the sheriff’s department told Big Bend Now last month.

The incident took place near Candelaria, about 250 miles southeast of El Paso.

Bryant and Daugherty, both hunting guides with Redwing Outfitters, were indicted last Wednesday on charges of deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others, local radio station KTSA reported.

A message on Redwing’s Facebook page claimed the two were shot “ambush style,” but thirty investigators searched the area and found no evidence of anyone approaching the camp, AP reported. Police believe the hunters fired on each other by mistake.

“I mean border patrol are experts in tracking in this area, we trust what they say because that’s all they do on a daily basis, and they didn’t find no sign, no indication that there was anybody in or out of that area that night,” Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez told CBS 7.

Daugherty, who is uninsured, raised $26,300 on GoFundMe to pay for his care.

The story of the shooting was widely shared on social media, with some politicizing the incident:

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller cited the shooting as “proof” that the border wall proposed by President Donald Trump was needed.

When confronted about previous inaccurate Facebook messages, Miller said his social media posts shouldn’t be held to the same standard as those of a news organization ― but then cited a news organization in defense of himself."

The Best Time to Get a Flu Shot Is Now

As a specialist in infection prevention and control, I have often fielded the question, ""When is the best time to get a flu shot?"" Usually peaking in November, December, or January, flu season typically runs from September 1 through April 30. I got my flu shot in September, and urge anyone who hasn't been vaccinated this season to do it now.

Why Get a Flu Shot?

With rare exceptions, everyone who is six months of age or older should get a flu shot this year. Getting vaccinated can prevent you from coming down with this very serious, sometimes fatal, disease. It also keeps you from transmitting the virus to people who are vulnerable to life-threatening complications, including infection of the heart, lungs, or even the brain.

Vaccination is especially important for those at high risk for severe illness from flu, including pregnant women, young children, people with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions like heart disease and asthma, and those ages 65 and older (the immune system weakens with age).

When to Get a Flu Shot

Generally, the best time to be vaccinated for flu is September because it takes two to three weeks to develop immunity. You can get vaccinated anytime during flu season, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends doing so at least by the end of October. This will ensure protection as the weather gets colder and forces people to spend more time indoors and in close contact.



Advice for Older People

People 65 years of age or older should get a high-dose vaccine specially designed for their age group, as it induces a stronger immune response. Some older people are under the impression that they should wait until the end of October or even November to get vaccinated. But this is neither necessary nor recommended because it might result in missing chances to be vaccinated, or forgetting altogether.

The way flu shots work is another reason not to wait. The vaccine protects against the flu virus by establishing ""memory"" cells, which start to develop two to three weeks after you are vaccinated. When you are later exposed to flu, these memory cells make the antibodies that your body needs to protect itself. In theory, immunity wanes three to four months after vaccination, but that's only if you're not exposed to the flu virus during that time. In practice, if you are vaccinated in September, say, and the flu virus is circulating from November through February, your memory cells are constantly being reminded to maintain immunity, extending the vaccine's effectiveness.

However, memory cells don't remember forever, and flu viruses change from year to year. That is why the vaccine formulation is updated each year and why it's important to get vaccinated annually.

Get the Shot, Not the Spray

In recent years, a nasal spray flu vaccine called FluMist was offered as an option to people ages 2 to 49 as an alternative to the injectable vaccine. This year, however, getting the shot is essential because the nasal spray will not be effective and is not recommended by the CDC. During last year's flu season, those who got the spray did not have immunity, while those who got the shot did.

Vaccination Concerns

If you are allergic to eggs and concerned about receiving a flu vaccine produced with egg-based technology, you can request an egg-free vaccine. And if you are concerned about preservatives in vaccines--despite the lack of scientific evidence that they cause any harm--you can ask for preservative-free vaccine. A very small group of people, including those with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine, should not receive flu shots.

It is important to note that flu vaccine cannot cause the flu; the shots are made from dead influenza virus or no virus at all.

Staying Healthy During Flu Season

An annual flu shot is the number-one way to prevent flu, but getting lots of rest and eating a healthy diet are essential, too, as is washing your hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer gels. If you are sick, don't go to work, where you might spread illness to others. And keep sick children home from school.

The three most important things to remember are: First, the flu vaccine is safe; second, getting vaccinated can save your life or someone else's; and finally, don't wait until November or December -- get vaccinated now."

Weisser']",2015-06-08 13:14:21-04:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-weisser/assault-rifle-ban-support_b_7536608.html,"In the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook tragedy, public opinion polls appeared to show widespread support for strengthening gun laws that would make it more difficult for 'prohibited persons' to gain access to guns. In particular, support was strongest for an extension of the NICS background check system to cover most secondary transfers of firearms beyond the initial, counter-top transfer that is covered now. It was this public sentiment which led to the crafting of such legislation, known as Manchin-Toomey, which nevertheless fell short of the votes needed to move the bill through the Senate in April, 2013.

One of the post-Newtown polls showing wide, public support for expanded background checks was conducted by researchers at the Bloomberg Public Health School at Johns Hopkins University, and now that I've mentioned the unmentionable, those readers in the pro-gun community will please do everyone a favor and keep their comments to themselves. The bottom line from this survey was that gun owners and non-gun owners expressed similar degrees of support for universal background checks, prohibitions on ownership for persons convicted of violating domestic restraining orders and mandatory sentences for gun traffickers. Where significant differences appeared between the two groups, however, involved 'bans' on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; the word 'ban' being toxic to gun owners but much less concerning to those who don't own guns.

The Bloomberg group has just released a new poll which, in terms of methodology and sampling, more or less replicates the same poll that was published in 2013. It will shortly appear in the journal Preventive Medicine, but I was able to examine an advance copy of the text. The authors note that in the intervening two years since their last survey, public opinion appears to have shifted away from more gun regulations and is now swinging towards stronger support of 'gun rights.' But comparing such data to the more specific policy-oriented questions which comprise this new survey is really oranges versus apples, since such phrases as 'gun rights' and 'gun control' are simply too vague and too loaded to explain much about public opinion at all.

The new Bloomberg survey shows that there remains a basic bedrock of public opinion that expanding background checks to secondary gun transfers is a good thing to do. In 2013, support for this measure among gun owners and non-gun owners was above 80 percent, both numbers shifted only slightly in the current survey and the difference between gun owners and non-gun owners was negligible at best. On the other side of the ledger, i.e., banning assault rifles and high-capacity mags, there was again a decisive difference between gun owners who said 'no' and non-gun owners who said 'yes,' although in this case the percentage of non-gun owners who favored weapon and ammunition bans appears to have slipped.

What I find significant is that 45 percent of gun owners in both surveys support bans on the sale of assault rifles and high-cap mags. Researchers who focus on policy issues traditionally look for majority opinion as a guide to what may or may not be possibly changed in the public domain. But the fact that slightly less than half of all gun owners support the ban on assault rifles is a finding which needs to be considered on its own terms.

I can't think of a single issue that has generated more noise and more hype in the gun community than the issue of assault rifles over the last several years. From the phony attempt by the NSSF to dress up these guns as 'modern sporting rifles,' to the prancing around by Colion Noir, the industry has done everything it can to promote these guns as akin to motherhood and apple pie. That nearly 50 percent of gun owners don't buy this nonsense should give pause to those who still regard the NRA as a behemoth when it comes to influencing public opinion about guns. To me, it's more like a case of the emperor without clothes."

Douglas Rudman, an attorney for the owners of Sunrise Tactical Supply, described the owners as distraught. Per the Herald, the store itself has been “closed indefinitely.”

That's how Jax Mercantile President Jim Quinlan feels three weeks after making a controversial decision to stop selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines throughout his outdoor gear retail chain, including the store in Lafayette.

He doesn't deny that a fair number of customers were angry enough that they pledged never to shop Jax again, but Quinlan said the bulk of the reaction he has received has been from those applauding the stand he took in the wake of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn. The killer in the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting that left 26 people dead -- 20 of them students -- used a Bushmaster .223-caliber AR-15 rifle, classified by the federal government as an assault weapon.

Until mid-December, Jax sold the popular AR-15 model rifle. The chain also no longer sells magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds.

""The feedback that I've directly received has been overwhelmingly positive,"" said Quinlan, who estimates that of the 500 to 1,000 emails, letters and phone calls he's personally gotten since the policy was announced, 80 percent have been supportive of his decision. ""The common theme has been one of thanking us for having the courage to take a stand.""

A quick look at Jax Mercantile's Facebook page reveals a long list of visitor comments -- many impassioned -- from both sides of the issue. One supporter of the company's decision wrote that she would ""patronize Jax whenever possible"" while an opponent pledged to ""never walk through your door again.""

""Another worthless company giving in and giving up our 2nd Amendment rights. Might as well close your doors now,"" Trent Neutgens of Waconia, Minn., posted last week.

Chris Nugent in a late December post thanked the company, which has five locations in Colorado and one in Iowa, for its decision.

""It's refreshing to see a business owner act on their principles rather than on what's best for the bottom line,"" he wrote. ""Firearm owner and 30-year supporter of Jax here, and will continue to be.""

The gun counter at the Lafayette Jax did a steady business Thursday, with several men looking over the wide array handguns, hunting rifles and shotguns the store still sells.

Bob Towery, a hunter from Erie, walked out of Jax with several boxes of ammunition. He disagreed with the store's decision to discontinue the sale of certain firearms and magazines because he said it perpetuates the notion that guns are to blame instead of the person pulling the trigger.

""The problem with the Aurora shooting and the Connecticut shooting is not the firearm or the availability of firearms -- it's the problem of mental health,"" he said. ""All the signs were there (with Aurora theater shooter James Holmes). We've become a complacent society in that regard.""

But Towery said the store's policy wouldn't be enough to keep him out of Jax, which sells a wide selection of other outdoor gear, such as fishing rods, snowshoes and sleeping bags.

Travis Ness, a former Marine from Thornton who was looking for firearms accessories at the Lafayette store Thursday, criticized Jax for overreacting to the Connecticut shooting and feeding into the ""misguided concept that firearms are the problem and not the people who use them.""

Ness said he knows at least 10 people who will no longer shop at Jax because of Quinlan's decision. He said he hasn't entirely given up on Jax himself, but he won't make the store a priority stop for outdoor-related products going forward.

""It wouldn't be the first place I'd get something anymore,"" he said.

Quinlan understands the passion his decision has ignited. Aside from lost customers, he said an employee at the Lafayette store resigned after the policy against assault rifles went into effect.

But the father of three said the Newtown shooting, which he told the Camera in December left him feeling ""sick,"" was a pivotal moment for him.

""This isn't the type of thing that I want my company selling,"" Quinlan said of assault-style weaponry.

He takes heart at a recent proposal he received from a Lafayette resident, who offered to buy Jax's remaining inventory of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and destroy them. While appreciating the gesture, Quinlan was unable to take him up on it.

He had long ago sold out.

Slide Fire, a Texas-based manufacturer, announced plans this week to release its latest weapon, a $6,000 rifle that the company says ""sprays like a fire hose."" The new weapons employ the company's patented stock -- a rifle accessory that rests against the shooter's shoulder and uses a gun's recoil to trigger the next round -- and are belt-fed, allowing for huge strings of bullets to be fired at a rate of up to 800 rounds per minute.

(Watch the video above for a demonstration of Slide Fire's belt-fed rifle.)

""We recommend no more than 30 rounds on the belt, but one person could make it as big as they want,"" Brandon Renner, sales and marketing manager for Slide Fire told CNN Money of the latest product.

For all intents and purposes, Slide Fire's new SFS BFRs function like machine guns; much like the company's other rifles, which use magazines that limit their ammo load. But technically speaking, all of Slide Fire's weapons are semi-automatic, and therefore not beholden to the strict federal regulations on actual machine guns.

Slide Fire's bump stock, which can also be purchased separately to add on to other rifles, is the key to this loophole. The Associated Press broke down the technology in a February report:

A bump stock fits over a rifle's ""buffer tube,"" replacing the gun's shoulder rest. A ""support step"" attached to the pistol grip partially covers the trigger opening, preventing contact with the finger. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, ""bumping"" the trigger. So, technically, the finger is ""pulling"" the trigger for each round fired.

Because Slide Fire only modifies the trigger and the stock -- not the receiver, the only part regulated by federal authorities -- its products have been deemed legal. As Slide Fire proudly touts on its website, the ATF has determined ""the 'bump-stock' is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms act."" A representative for the ATF confirmed that statement to CNN.

While Slide Fire markets its products as easy to control, some gun enthusiasts like Tom Mannewitz of the TargetMaster store and indoor gun ranges in Garland, Texas, aren't convinced.

""If somebody was shooting a 'bumpfire' gun here they might be on their target; they’re more than likely going to be on somebody else’s target or the floor or the ceiling or whatever,"" he told CBS 11.

Washington lawmakers are also aware of the product's ability to effectively skirt broader bans on machine guns and have expressed concerns.

""This replacement shoulder stock turns a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of 400 to 800 rounds per minute,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a key proponent of gun control legislation, told AP earlier this year. ""I strongly believe that devices allowing shooters to fire at similar rates should also be outlawed."""

(See the initial report from ABCNews.com and the Nightline segment from Monday night.)

In a press release issued by Trijicon on January 21, the company stated that it will do the following to remedy what many view as an egregious mixing of religion and the military, as well as an offense to the Christian religion:

- Remove the inscription reference on all U.S. military products that are in the company's factory that have already been produced, but have yet to be shipped. - Provide 100 modification kits to forces in the field to remove the reference on the already forward deployed optical sights. - Ensure all future procurements from the Department of Defense are produced without scripture references.

Trijicon will provide the same remedy to foreign militaries that have purchased their products. Maj. Kristian Dunne, a spokesman for the New Zealand defense force, one of the foreign militaries currently using the sights, stated, ""We were unaware of it and we're unhappy that the manufacturer didn't give us any indication that these were on there. We deem them to be inappropriate.""

In a press release issued by CENTCOM, Gen. David Petraeus stated, ""The codes on the scopes are contrary to U.S. Central Command guidance.""

Another purchaser of Trijicon products, for use in Afghanistan, is the British military. The revelation that there were Bible verses on its country's weapons prompted the following statement from the Church of England, as reported by the The Guardian:

""It would be unfortunate if this practice by an arms manufacturer undermined the military effort in areas of the world where our forces are trying to bring long-term stability. People of all faiths and none are being killed and injured in these conflicts, on all sides, and any suggestion that this is being done in the name of the Bible would be deeply worrying to many Christians. The meaning of the Bible is to be found in reflective reading and prayer, not in sloganising and soundbites.""

In a statement to ABC News, Tom Munson, director of sales and marketing for Trijicon, a company that states on its website, ""We believe that America is great when its people are good. This goodness has been based on Biblical standards throughout our history, and we will strive to follow those morals,"" said that there was nothing wrong with adding the Bible references, and that Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), which initially raised the issue after receiving complaints about the sights from active duty service members, was ""not Christian."" Apparently, the Church of England must also be ""not Christian,"" given that they also find the Bible references inappropriate. Tom Munson might also be surprised to learn that 96% of the service members who reach out to MRFF for assistance are actually Christians, but just not Christian enough or the 'right kind' of Christians for today's military.

In addition to being called anti-Christian for exposing the Bible verses, two other criticisms have been leveled at MRFF, both in comments on the many articles and blog posts on the story and in hate mail received by MRFF.

The first is that MRFF should have just gone to the military rather than the media. Well, MRFF actually did try to go to the military first, and only went to the media after attempts to get the military to deal with the issue had failed. In fact, it was one of the military officers contacted by MRFF who suggested that going to the media might be the only way to get the Pentagon to take any action.

The second is that nobody would have found out about the Bible verses if ABC News hadn't exposed them. This is simply not true. Many of our troops already knew about them, and there have been plenty of message board postings, as well as online videos, pointing them out. Interestingly, although Trijicon has been putting the Bible references on its products for many years, the widespread discussion of these references began in 2006, not long after the sights were put into wide use by the military. On one message board, a soldier even provided instructions on how to remove the reference after removing it from his own sight. The other common misconception is that the Iraqis and Afghans would never see the Trijicon sights closely enough to see the Bible references. This is also untrue, as is clear from photos released by the Department of Defense.

People have only seen one of the photos uncovered by MRFF showing an Iraqi holding a rifle equipped with a Trijicon sight -- the close-up of the Iraqi police officer first used by ABC News, and then picked up by pretty much everybody else reporting on the story. If this was the only such photo, it might be reasonable to wonder if it is only occasionally that an Iraqi or Afghan might casually happen to see one of these sights. But this is not the only such photo, and the captions for the other photos make it very clear that the Iraqis and Afghans are not just casually or occasionally getting a glimpse of these sights, but being actively trained with and supplied with them. There is no question from these photos that the Iraqis and Afghans are regularly looking at these sights closely enough to spot the Bible references.

Here are some of the other photos, followed by their original captions.

As already mentioned, the investigation into Trijicon's rifle scopes was prompted by complaints received by MRFF from active duty service members. Here is an email received by MRFF founder and president Mikey Weinstein from one of those service members. Clearly, according to the account of this soldier, a very senior NCO not only knew about the Bible reference, but promoted it as making an ordinary rifle a ""spiritually transformed into the Fire Arm of Jesus Christ."" Worse yet, this brilliant NCO was yelling this out within earshot of Afghan civilians and military personnel.

To: Mikey Wenstein [sic] and MRFF: I am a U.S. Army infantry soldier with the rank of (rank withheld). I am married with children. I am stationed at Fort (installation name withheld). I have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan multiple times. I have been awarded medals for direct combat engagement as well as for injuries and wounds received in hand-to-hand combat. I am a Muslim American. My family converted when I was very young. I am caucasian and have a last name that does not sound ethnic. Therefore, few of my fellow soldiers know that I am a Muslim. My wife comes from a Christian tradition but rarely practices or attends church. I have witnessed terrible religious persecution in the my (number withheld) years in the Army. Most of it comes from ""angry"" conservative Christians in my unit chains of command and occasionally from my fellow infantry soldiers. I am very familiar with the Trijicon ACOG gunsights and have often had them as part of my personal weapons; both my M-4 and my M-16. In my first 2 deployments I saw and experienced no incidents regarding the New Testament bible quotes that are written on the metal casing of the gun sights. Many soldiers know of them and are very confused as to why they are there and what it is supposed to mean. Everyone is worried that if they were captured in combat that the enemy would use the bible quotes against them in captivity or some other form of propaganda. As an American soldier I am ashamed that those bible quotes are on our primary weapons. As a Muslim American I am horrified. As one who swore his oath to the Constitution, I am driven to fight this Christian insanity but I know if I try to do so in a visible way that I will suffer at the hands of my military superiors. I am of low enlisted rank and can be crushed easily. I am prepared to suffer, but I am not prepared for my wife and children to suffer. So I have reached out to MRFF because there is nowhere else safe to go to try to fight this thing of disgrace. There are many other soldiers who feel as I do. Many are Protestant and Catholic and they fear reprisal just as much as I do for trying to stand up to the Christian bullies in uniform who outrank us. But if you try to fight back, you are not ""asking"" for trouble, YOU ARE IN TROUBLE from the start. And if you are a Muslim American, the hatred is always just below the surface and ready to explode at a moment's notice. After the Fort Hood shootings, it was so bad, even for a low profile Muslim like me, that I had to ask MRFF for help. Nothing in my first 2 deployments prepared me for what happened with the Trijicon ACOG gun sights during my 3rd deployment to Afghanistan. I will never forget the day it occurred. It was morning and there was a mandatory formation of several companies. A very senior NCO was yelling at us which is not that unusual. He asked a private what it was that he (the private) was holding in his hand and the private said it was his ""weapon"" several times to which the senior NCO replied ""and what ELSE is it""? FInally, the senior NCO said that the private's rifle was also something else; that because of the biblical quote on the ACOG gunsight it had been ""spiritually transformed into the Fire Arm of Jesus Christ"" and that we would be expected to kill every ""haji"" we could find with it. He said that if we were to run out of ammo, then the rifle would become the ""spiritually transformed club of Jesus Christ"" and that we should ""bust open the head of every haji we find with it."" He said that Uncle Sam had seen fit not to give us a ""pussy 'Jewzzi' (combination of the word 'Jew' and Israeli made weapon 'Uzi') but the ""fire arm of Jesus Christ"" and made specific mention of the biblical quotes on our gun sights. He said that the enemy no doubt had quotes from the Koran on their guns but that ""our Lord is bigger than theirs because theirs is a fraud and an idol"". As a Muslim and an American soldier I was fit to be tied but I kept it in. There were many Afghans, both civilian and military, on base within earshot of what was being yelled at us and I can only wonder in shock what they must have thought. This senior NCO was apparently also the head person of a conservative, crazy Christian group called the ""Christian Military Fellowship"" and made a big deal about the importance of joining to everyone. He told us all that we MUST read a book called ""Under Orders"" in order to make it through this combat deployment and said he had many copies for everyone. Some of my friends went and got their copies. I refused. Finally, this senior NCO ended his yelling by warning us that if we did not ""get right with Jesus"" then our rifles would not provide spiritual strength despite the bible quotes on our ACOG gunsights and that we would be considered ""spiritual cripples"" to our fellow units and soldiers. He didn't say it in so many words, but the message was clear; if anything bad happened in a combat situation, it would be the fault of anyone who had not accepted Jesus Chris in the ""right way"". I have never felt so ashamed and scared in my life. I have never hated myself so much for not speaking out. So I thought of my wife and children and endured. Every time I looked at my rifle with that Trijicon ACOG gunsight/scope with the biblical quote from the book of John (8:12), it would make me sick. If I had tried to protest, it would have made me dead. And if I'm dead I'm of no use to my wife and children.

While Trijicon's decision to remove the Bible references is great news, it is only one step in the right direction. Back in September, I wrote a piece titled Top Ten Ways to Convince the Muslims We're On a Crusade, detailing the many ways in which our military has made us look like crusaders in a holy war against Islam. In the process of investigating the Trijicon issue, MRFF's research department uncovered even more examples. A photo of one of these examples was briefly shown during the Nightline report, and I want to end by explaining what that photo was.

The photo, taken in August 2009 at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Loyalty near Baghdad, was one of several photos released by the Department of Defense showing Iraqi Security Forces in training sessions conducted by the U.S. Army. The building where these training session were held appears to be used for a variety of purposes. And, what's on the wall right next to the screen on which the training presentation is being shown? A nice big cross, as tall as the soldier giving the presentation. Army regulations don't even allow symbols of any particular religion to be displayed in a chapel except when an actual worship service is in progress, yet here we have an impossible to miss cross not only being displayed, but being displayed in a multi-purpose building while the training of Iraqi troops is taking place.

Interestingly, as the following photo of another event held around the same time in the same building shows, the cross was not displayed while the Oakland Raiders cheerleaders were performing for the troops. Apparently, that would have been inappropriate."
huffpo174,huffpo,"['Steve Bell', 'Follow Steve Bell On Twitter', 'Www.Twitter.Com Stevebelldc', 'Senior Director', 'Economic Policy Project', 'Bipartisan Policy Center']",2012-12-20 14:15:51-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-bell/bushmaster-rifle_b_2331024.html,"I am a life member of the National Rifle Association. My family has owned guns for generations and has sent men to military service for more than a century. I strongly support the Second Amendment to the Constitution.

But, I have a simple question: what does a civilian need with a .223, a caliber developed by and for the military for small arms combat situations?

This question occurs to me for three reasons: the late mother of the Newton, Ct., killer owned and practiced with a .223; the .223, reports have it, is the single biggest seller among rifles in the United States; finally, the .223 serves no civilian or hunting purpose, in my view, that other calibers serve at least as well and with less opportunity for deadly mistakes.

Please know that I am not talking about the silly argument about the physical configuration of ""assault rifles."" The changes brought about by the now-lapsed assault rifle ban were almost entirely cosmetic. It was at least interesting, if not amusing, to listen to lawmakers who didn't know an assault rifle from Aunt Mamie's goat pontificate about how outlawing assault rifles would lead to some nirvana. Let's disregard for this discussion that kind of ignorance.

Let's concentrate instead on the essentials. What does this caliber do that cannot be done in hunting and personal defense better by other weapons in other calibers. Perhaps this argument can be best illustrated by a heated series of exchanges among serious gun-owners after the post-Hurricane Katrina violence.

What weapon(s), gun owners were asked by a highly-respected gun magazine, would you choose if you had had to defend yourself and your family in the violent aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. As one might expect, thousands of suggestions flooded in. A few opted for the .223 in semi-automatic, rifle configuration. Others suggested a variety of handguns in different calibers and different kinds of bullets. Some offered hunting rifles used widely for deer and other larger animals.

What seemed to me to be the dispositive comment came from an elderly man who noted: ""My son has been an emergency room physician for many years. He reports to me that he has never seen anyone survive a .12 gauge, double ought buck shot wound to the upper torso."" In short, if you want to protect your home and family from intruders, don't buy an AR-15. If such a situation occurs, you are going to be full of adrenaline, your heart beating 150 bpm or so, and you will panic. If you are a member of a SWAT team, or have just left military combat, you are likely to be able to hit a target, often in the dark and in the matter of seconds you have to react properly. If you are almost anyone else, the odds that you will hit your target with an AR-15 in .223 are small.

Do you really want to protect home and family from intruders? Go out and buy a .12 gauge or .16 gauge shotgun. Load it with buckshot. Make sure the gun has a fully open choke. That way, when that mysterious figure breaks into your house and begins marching up the stairs, and your hands are shaking almost uncontrollably, you can fire in the general direction of the intruder with some certainty of disabling him. Throw out the .223; it will likely be more dangerous to you than the intruder.

Let's get serious. Many states, including those in our region, demand that anyone who wishes to use a long gun to hunt deer or similar prey pass a hunter safety course before being allowed to get a license to hunt. Long guns' records reveal that they are vastly safer than hand guns or semi-auto AR-15s. If we require a license and training for long guns, it makes eminent sense to require at least as much training and licensing to own an AR-15 or similarly configured semi-automatic rifle.

Finally, for those who like the AR-15 as a varmint gun, here's what we used on the ranch I used to own in very rural, southwest Colorado -- a single shot .22 long rifle. We used a .300 WinMag for big deer and elk. We had our trusty .12 gauges for home protection.

We in the NRA should demand licensing and training certification, especially by an NRA certified instructor, before we allow purchase of handguns and semi-auto rifles. It is sensible, will save accidental deaths as well as mass murders, and it will lead to much safer homes and hearths."
huffpo175,huffpo,['Lauren Sandler'],2018-02-22 05:45:51-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-sandler-guns-men_us_5a8dafefe4b0273053a70938,"Women have long fought gun violence. They’ve fought it as mothers, as feminists. Indeed, many have said that gun violence is a feminist issue, noting that mass killers are usually abusers of women. This refrain has emerged once more in the aftermath of the grievously preventable massacre of 17 high school students and faculty members in Parkland, Florida.

This time, men are publicly insisting that women need to wage this war against arms.

But this is one hideous mess we can’t just clean up on our own.

Not because gun violence doesn’t affect us. There’s a reason women take this so personally, and it’s not just because our children are getting murdered in their classrooms. Four and a half million of us have survived threats at gunpoint from our intimate partners. Those partners kill another 50 of us each month.

And it’s not because it’s unfair that we’re asked to do this work. The losses are so tragic, enormous, so consistent, that fair doesn’t have a damn thing to do with it. We can, and must, keep fighting. But men, we need you — and you need you — to win this war.

Guns are synonymous with masculinity, and it’s men who need to organize to lay them down. There is no winning strategy in women hectoring men about what masculinity they can be afforded ― even if we’re right, which we are. That leads to deeper emasculation, which scholars have found to be at the root of so much gun ownership and violence.

If we want men with guns to stop killing our kids, our friends, our partners and our parents, we need to make damn sure men are out in front.

As the middle class has slipped into the welfare class, and housing and health care costs have surged, men have gripped those guns even tighter as protectors of their own power.

Even the American Psychological Association is aghast at the murderous marriage of masculinity and firearms. “Any account of gun violence in the United States must be able to explain both why males are perpetrators of the vast majority of gun violence,” a recent APA report says in summary, and must “aim to change gendered expectations for males that emphasize self-sufficiency, toughness, and violence, including gun violence.”

Misogynists — which can mean both sexist men and their female allies —habitually train their ire on women with the power to change policy. It has been a constant feature of Nancy Pelosi’s tenure in the House. It lost Hillary Clinton the damn presidency. And, due to our gun laws, it nearly killed Gabby Giffords.

Do we really think that our “shrill” voices will convince American men to lay down the always steel-hard phalluses that shoot raw murder-power? This is not a battle for women to wage alone.

RHONA WISE via Getty Images Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Cameron Kasky speaks at a rally for gun control at the Broward County Federal Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Feb. 17, 2018.

This isn’t to say that women aren’t part of gun culture. The National Rifle Association has been sure to make that point clear; it named a woman chief spokesperson, and its television network, which “celebrates” female gun owners, serves up bald and breathless publicity for sponsors Smith & Wesson. These aren’t mere lobbyist optics: Twenty-two percent of American women own guns. But most women who own guns buy them for protection. Most men who own guns buy them because the use of weaponry is how they get their kicks.

Again, this is the gender binary of gun ownership, and frankly, of so many toxic aspects of our world: men’s entitlement versus women’s safeguarding. And to respond according to a binary is to debilitate urgent, vital progress for us all.

There’s a bigger issue at play here, even bigger than gun violence: If we decide collectively that gun violence is a women’s issue, we will all but guarantee that efforts to solve the problem will fail.

It’s a bleak truth: If you want to fetter an issue, make it a women’s issue. You’ll get marchers in the street, calls to legislators, grassroots discourse — all necessary hallmarks of functioning democracy. But because this is hardly a functioning democracy, legislative change will fail to track the howl arising from a very vocal majority.

This is a nation where, even at our best, the so-called men’s issues of defense, crime, business and foreign policy garner the lion’s share of our tax dollars and legislative attention. Meanwhile, so-called women’s issues like education, social services, civil rights and general health care are left begging to divide up the ever-shrinking leftover scraps. And those aren’t even the issues left to sit in the gynecologist’s waiting room. You want to fully disempower an issue, not in the culture, but on Capitol Hill? Paint it pink.

Jonathan Drake/Reuters David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, speaks at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, three days after the shooting at his school.

School shootings are ground zero for this binary collision. They involve kids. And teachers. In schools. We rely on social workers’ assessments, not gun bans, for prevention. This is all the provenance of female concern, populated by a largely female workforce.

And the solution from our education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a men’s issues advocate in lipstick and pumps, is classic binary ― a man’s solution to a women’s problem: Let teachers be armed. Others, like one North Carolina lawmaker, believe that we should arm those teachers ourselves, in an impoverished public education system where teachers pay for classroom supplies from their own meager salaries. But that’s a woman’s issue.

Gun violence is a men’s problem. No organization has been as effective in framing the crisis as a public health epidemic as Women Against Gun Violence, which began 25 years ago as the result of a conversation between founder Ann Reiss Lane and Betty Friedan herself. Then, after the Sandy Hook massacre, now 300 school shootings ago, Moms Demand Action rose up as a force far fiercer than its bake-sale identifier might suggest. This fight has defaulted to women because men have not stepped up to join us. Male silence, and nothing else, has made our gun crisis a women’s issue.

We can’t re-norm our society overnight, any more than women can re-norm men en masse by saying they should be different. We have no choice but to be smarter about how we reform the situation, now. If we want men with guns to stop killing our kids, our friends, our partners and our parents, we need to make damn sure men are out in front.

Boys who survived the Parkland shooting know this, as do girls who have made it their own fight without making it a gendered one: Cameron Kasky and David Hogg are showing you the way, gentlemen. Because in this country, we’ve got nowhere else to run."

The “Never Again” demonstrations began after a young man with an assault-style rifle killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week and wounded more than a dozen more.

Hundreds of students across Miami-Dade and Broward counties in South Florida walked out of school mid-morning on Wednesday, their action broadcast live as a news helicopter followed from above.

“We want to show support for those who lost their lives and make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” one student from Cypress Bay High School told Local 10 News.

Several hundred students, including some from Stoneman Douglas High, took a bus to the Florida Capitol in Tallahassee to press the issue with state lawmakers there. Further protests across the region are expected later Wednesday; the state also saw walkouts on Tuesday.

In Maryland, hundreds of students from at least three high schools in Montgomery County walked out Wednesday, many of them heading toward the U.S. Capitol for a gun control rally:

Daniel Gelillo‎, a senior at Richard Montgomery High in Rockville, Maryland, helped organize part of the local protest. He said students are taking to the streets because they’ve had enough of politicians’ inaction.

“All people in this country, particularly children, should feel safe and should not live in fear of a gunman killing them in their school, place of worship, or a nightclub,” Gelillo wrote in a press release. “We expect our leaders to do whatever is required to keep us safe. That has not happened.”

He continued, “We are young and can fight until we can vote and then we can vote out every politician that obstructs real change and is owned by the NRA.”

Students also staged walkouts in Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky and Minnesota, among other states.

Not all schools condoned such teenage activism.

The Houston-area Needville Independent School District threatened Tuesday to suspend students for three days if they walked out or otherwise disrupted school in protest.

“Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness!!” Superintendent Curtis Rhodes wrote in a note sent to parents. “Should students choose to do so, they will be suspended from school for 3 days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension.”"

For some black activists who have long been mobilizing around gun violence, the current wave of public attention and outrage over the issue is welcome. But it also invites the question of why there’s been comparatively little attention and outrage focused on the even more common reality of routine gun homicides in the country, which disproportionately affect communities of color, and specifically black Americans.

Prominent black organizers and public figures have also noted the largely positive public response to the student activists from Parkland ― most of whom are not black and who attended school in a largely white, relatively affluent Florida suburb ― compared to the frequent vilification of young black activists protesting gun violence, particularly police shootings.

“It’s complicated, but I would encourage us to lean into the complicated,” Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said on a panel with HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen on Wednesday. “Why don’t black people get to be victims? That’s the question we have to ask ourselves ... It’s a question not just for elected officials but it’s a question for us ... Who gets to be a victim?”

“I’m so grateful these children are getting the support they need,” she added. “And where is our support?”

It is interesting to note the difference in support for the kids in FL versus the kids in Black Lives Matter. I say that with full admiration for the kids in FL, to survive such a trauma and fight for everyone to be safer.

Gosh. This is amazing. And a I'm not being sarcastic. I have to be honest and say that I'm a bit taken aback (and a bit hurt) that those of us who were in the streets in the past five years for Black lives didn't receive this type of reception or public support. https://t.co/HLYXTcVdfL — Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018

In the wake of the Florida shooting, students from Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have led a bold wave of mobilizations ― organizing school walkouts, speaking at rallies and planning the nationwide March for Our Lives protest next month. The teens have been justifiably celebrated on social media, featured in the news (including at HuffPost), and some were even invited to the White House.

HuffPost reached out to March for Our Lives, but did not immediately receive a response.

Importantly, those bringing up this disparity are not criticizing the Parkland students’ activism ― quite the opposite. The only people seeking to discredit the teens so far seem to be right-wing conspiracy theorists claiming the teens are “crisis actors.”

Still, the different public responses are telling: There’s justified, universal outrage at a shooting in a largely white, affluent area, but not so much at the frequent shooting deaths of black Americans; the public is praising Parkland’s student activists, but not so much Black Lives Matter organizers.

“I’m excited these young people are getting attention, which they deserve, and they’re driving amazing social change,” Dante Barry, co-founder of anti-racist, anti-violence organization Million Hoodies, told HuffPost on Thursday. “But I’m also disheartened and a little shocked to see folks like Oprah give $500,000 to [March for Our Lives], while she’s seen black folks in the streets for years.”

Other communities that have been devastated by gun violence are still fighting for crumbs. Dante Barry, Million Hoodies

“The way people are responding to predominantly white communities is notable: Whose movement is more valuable to support?” he added. “Other communities that have been devastated by gun violence are still fighting for crumbs.”

Young black activists who have been mobilizing around gun violence, including police shootings, for several years are generally perceived negatively by white Americans, are often arrested for protesting, and have been labeled as “extremists” by the FBI.

When black activists have taken to the streets to protest police shootings, members of law enforcement have met them in full riot gear, and at times attacked them with tear gas. By contrast, the largely non-black student activists from Parkland have been invited to a CNN town hall event with lawmakers.

“What happens is white people get to be everything ― they get to be victims, they get to be heroes,” Cullors said on the Wednesday panel. “Black people unfortunately continue to be criminalized for our moments of courage, mourning or grieving. When we go out to the streets to protest for our lives that matter, we’re given heavy police repression. This is a race question.”

Mass shootings like the one in Florida often spur an important national conversation on gun control, particularly when shooters target schools, like at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, or when there are high death counts, like in Las Vegas last year.

Yet while mass shootings have been on the rise in recent years, they represent just a portion of overall gun deaths in the U.S. annually.

In total, there were around 12,500 to 15,500 gun deaths per year in the U.S. from 2014 to 2017, not including suicides, according to the Gun Violence Archive. According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of just over 100 people died each year in mass shootings from 2009 to 2016 ― with mass shootings defined as incidents in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter.

“I’m very impressed and inspired by what I’m seeing these students do. Fighting for gun control ― I take my hat off to them,” Cobe Williams, deputy director at Chicago-based gun violence prevention organization Cure Violence told HuffPost on Wednesday."

The administration billed the event as a listening session in the wake of the Florida mass shooting, but it quickly turned into a powerful and heartbreaking moment in the decades-long debate over gun control as survivors and family members stood up and called on lawmakers to come up with solutions to gun violence.

“We’re here because my daughter has no voice. She was murdered last week and she was taken from us. Shot nine times on the third floor. We as a country failed our children. This shouldn’t happen,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“I’m very angry that this happened, because it keeps happening,” Pollack added, while speaking directly to the camera. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here with this administration and me. I’m not going to sleep until it gets fixed.”

Vice President Mike Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky joined Trump at the event, as well as dozens of parents and survivors of the Florida shooting and the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting.

Trump listened while survivors spoke during the event, but he later used the school shooting in Florida to make a case for looser laws on concealed carry permits. He proposed that arming 20 percent of teaching staff at schools may be effective at quickly ending attacks.

“If he had a firearm ... he would have shot and that would have ended,” Trump said about Stoneman Douglas coach Aaron Feis, who was slain.

Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters Wednesday that last week’s shooter bypassed the school’s armed officer.

In addition to suggesting ending gun-free school zones, Trump proposed opening more hospitals for the mentally ill and toughening background checks. “We’re going to go very strong into age — age of purchase, and we’re also going to go very strong into the mental health aspect of what’s going on,” he said.

Some of the participants at the session made the case for stricter gun control laws.

“How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon?” Stoneman Douglas student Sam Zeif asked of the ability to purchase an AR-15, the assault-style weapon used by the Parkland gunman. “How did we not stop this after Columbine? After Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening,” he said, tearfully gesturing to Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.

“After Sandy Hook, they said we wouldn’t let this happen again, yet it has continued to happen for five years. How many more deaths can we take as a country?” Hockley said.

Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, which represents 3 million educators, rejected the idea of arming more people on campuses. “Bringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms. ... We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that.”

“We owe it to the students and school personnel, who’ve lost their lives at schools and on campuses across the country, to work together so that we can thoughtfully and carefully develop common sense solutions that really will save lives.”

The National Education Association represents 3 million educators.

This is one of many recent media appearances by groups of Parkland students affected by last week’s shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 students and faculty members. It marked the 17th school shooting incident so far in 2018.

Many have made strong calls for Congress to act on gun control legislation, and students and adults plan to participate in the March for Our Lives next month, a protest they’re organizing in Washington, D.C., and several sister cities.

Several of the students seated around Trump thanked him for his leadership on mass shooting issues but made few remarks about gun access, marking a sharp tone shift from the Parkland students behind next month’s march.

One of the students, Cameron Kasky, tweeted after the listening session that he, student organizer Emma Gonzalez and the other Parkland students calling for gun control were “not invited” to the White House on Wednesday."

(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott announced a proposal on Friday to increase restrictions on buying guns and to strengthen school safety measures after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in the state last week.

Scott said he would work with state lawmakers during the next two weeks to raise the minimum age for buying any kind of gun in Florida to 21 years old, with some exceptions for younger military members and law enforcement officers. Long guns, including the semiautomatic AR-15-style assault rifle used in the Feb. 14 attack, can be bought by people as young as 18 under current law.

The Republican governor also said he would change laws to make it “virtually impossible for anyone who has mental issues to use a gun.” He wants to ban the sale and purchase of bump stocks, an accessory that transforms a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon able to fire hundreds of rounds a minute.

He called for a mandatory law enforcement officer in every public school and for mandatory “active shooter training” for student and faculty.

Staff members returned for the first time on Friday to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, now the site of one of the deadliest school attacks in U.S. history in which 14 students and three faculty were killed.

The attack at the school last week has inflamed the national debate about gun rights. Many of the student survivors of the massacre have since advocated for tougher gun-control laws. They have been widely interviewed on national television and have traveled to meet politicians in Tallahassee, the state capital, and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House.

Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old former student at the school, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Authorities have said that Cruz, who was expelled from Stoneman Douglas High last year for unspecified disciplinary problems."

The bill, from Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), allows anyone with a permit from one state to carry hidden, loaded firearms into all other states. It would allow people with permits from states with weak permitting rules to carry into states with strict rules, like New York and California. And if a state will issue a concealed carry permit to a nonresident, an applicant could get one and carry the weapon into any other state.

Opponents of the legislation, known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, warn that it would allow the states with the loosest permitting standards to define the laws of the nation and would undermine states’ rights to protect their own residents.

The National Rifle Association has called this legislation, which is expected to pass in the House, its “highest legislative priority.” It is likely to be the first gun bill to receive a vote since the back-to-back mass shootings in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas.

Gun violence experts and victims’ advocates say the legislation is particularly alarming for domestic violence survivors, who are in more danger when their abusers are able to carry hidden firearms.

Under federal law, a person convicted of domestic violence or subject to certain protective orders is not allowed to own firearms. But the law is limited ― it only covers spouses, not dating partners or stalkers ― and dozens of states have passed their own laws that expand on federal legislation in the interest of keeping guns away from abusers.

Currently, each state sets its own rules about who is eligible to carry concealed weapons. In some states, law enforcement can prohibit a person from carrying a concealed gun at their discretion, such as if they believe the applicant lacks good character or doesn’t have a good reason to carry a loaded gun in public. In other states, officials are essentially required to issue a permit to anyone who meets basic requirements, such as passing a background check or completing safety training.

Some states offer significantly more protections to victims of domestic abuse, dating violence and stalking than others. In 28 states, for example, individuals convicted of stalking are not allowed to carry in public. But, as Everytown for Gun Safety counsel Courtney Zale explained to HuffPost, under concealed carry reciprocity, a stalker in one of those states could obtain a permit from Florida, which does not prohibit stalkers from concealed carry and issues permits to nonresidents through the mail. He could then use that permit to carry throughout the country.

In another example, an abuser who is convicted of sexually assaulting his girlfriend cannot currently legally carry a concealed firearm in Massachusetts. But under this bill, he could obtain a permit from nearby New Hampshire ― which issues permits to nonresidents and does not consider that offense prohibitory ― and carry his firearm back into his home state.

In 25 states and Washington, D.C., law enforcement can deny individuals a concealed carry permit if they have a history of red flags, such as repeated domestic disturbances. Under concealed carry reciprocity, a person could bypass state rules by applying for a permit from a state with less stringent standards.

Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said the House measure would effectively “zero out” countless state laws designed to protect victims of abuse. A person who is banned from carrying guns in his home state because of domestic violence could just apply for a permit from another state where he is still eligible because of more permissive laws, she said.

“The efforts that some states have made will be for naught,” Glenn said. “Domestic abusers are very crafty. If we think they don’t know about these laws and ways around them, we are sadly mistaken.”

If a woman in the U.S. is a victim of gun violence, it’s usually because of domestic abuse. More than half of women killed with guns in the U.S. between 2010 and 2014 were killed by intimate partners or family members. The research on this topic is unambiguous: Firearms make abusive relationships more dangerous. If abusers have access to guns, victims are five times more likely to be killed.

Even when they are not being used to kill and maim women, guns are often deployed as a tactic to control and terrorize victims. In addition, most mass shootings in the U.S. involve a male perpetrator targeting a family member or intimate partner.

Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said that when survivors relocate to escape their abusers, they often take into consideration a state’s firearms protections.

“Imagine fleeing to another state where you believe your abuser won’t be able to carry a gun, and then finding out that Congress says that he can bring his gun with him ― and he can hide it,” she said.

Susan B. Sorenson, a gun violence researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, said the House bill could endanger lives. There’s some evidence to back that up: A recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that states with weaker concealed carry laws were associated with 10.6 percent higher handgun homicide rates.

“If this law gets passed, it will be the state with the easiest permit requirements that will define the permitting requirements for every state,” said Adam Winkler, a gun policy expert and law professor at UCLA. “A state that is willing to give permits to people with a history of domestic violence will undermine the laws of many other states that are trying to restrict abusers.”

Buried on Page 719 of his fiscal year 2019 budget, released Monday, the president calls for cuts to the National Criminal Records History Improvement Program and the NICS Act Record Improvement Program. Both provide federal grants to states to help them improve their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database for background checks, including domestic violence records.

The two programs are currently budgeted at $73 million. Trump’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would slash their funding to $61 million, which amounts to a 16 percent cut.

Trumps FY19 budget

(Why do the numbers in the infographic jump around so much from 2017 to 2019? A House Appropriations Committee staffer said it’s unclear, but notes the 2017 figure reflects what the Justice Department actually spent while the 2018 and 2019 figures reflect what Trump requested.)

Gun control advocates say these federal grants have been “critical funding sources” for states trying to routinely submit comprehensive records to the national background check database.

“President Trump claims that he wants to build ‘a safe, strong, and proud America’ but his actions do not live up to his words,” said Robin Lloyd of Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived a gunshot to the head in 2011.

“Instead of strengthening the nation’s background check system to make sure it effectively keeps guns out of dangerous hands, he slashed funding to this critically important system, which will significantly undermine its effectiveness,” Lloyd said.

There are about 30 million reasons why Trump would want to weaken gun safety measures. That’s roughly how many dollars the National Rifle Association spent helping to elect him president. His proposed cuts are also wildly out of step with polls showing near-universal support for strengthening background checks to apply to all gun sales, not just those done by licensed firearms dealers.

The president’s budget, however, is more an overview of White House priorities than it is a document that translates into law. Republicans in Congress will use Trump’s proposal as a baseline but come up with their own government spending levels when they put forward annual appropriation bills.

Trump’s call for cutting funds for gun background checks comes just three months after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, involving a gunman who was prohibited from buying or owning firearms because of a domestic violence conviction but who had a gun nonetheless because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the national criminal background check database. The error has prompted the Air Force to begin a review.

Mass shootings are now a regular occurrence in the country ― and so is Congress’ inaction on it. There have already been 30 mass shootings and 18 school shootings in 2018. Republican leaders in Congress routinely offer “thoughts and prayers” in response to each shooting but don’t follow up with any policy changes aimed at stemming gun violence.

Another mass shooting took place as this article was being written Wednesday. This one was at a high school in Parkland, Florida. At least 17 people died and many others were injured."
huffpo182,huffpo,"[""Lydia O'Connor"", 'Reporter']",2018-02-20 20:07:39-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-gun-background-checks_us_5a8cb36ae4b03414379b433d,"A new poll from Quinnipiac University has found the highest support it’s ever surveyed for universal background checks for firearms purchases, with nearly 100 percent of those polled supporting the gun control measure.

According to the findings released Tuesday, 97 percent of respondents support the checks, with 2 percent opposing and 1 percent declining to respond. Even among gun owners polled, support is at 97 percent.

Overall support for the policy is 2 percentage points higher than what the university measured in December, and has been steadily on the rise since Quinnipiac University first started polling on this topic in 2013, when just 89 percent of respondents supported such background checks.

The school conducted the survey days after a gunman used an AR-15 assault-style rifle to kill 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week.

“If you think Americans are largely unmoved by the mass shootings, you should think again,” Tim Malloy, the Quinnipiac University Poll assistant director, said in a statement about the overall polling results.

The poll also found majority support for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons and a mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases and other gun control proposals.

“In the last two months, some of the biggest surges in support for tightening gun laws comes from demographic groups you may not expect, independent voters, men, and whites with no college degree,” Malloy said.

The poll surveyed 1,249 voters nationwide from Feb. 16-19.

While support for background checks is nearly universal, there are some apparent cracks in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the federal program that handles these checks to ensure certain criminals are not able to purchase firearms.

In November, it was revealed that the gunman who killed 26 people in a Texas church should have been prohibited from buying the firearm he used because of a domestic violence conviction he’d received while serving in the Air Force. However, the Air Force admitted that it had failed to submit that information to the background check database."
huffpo183,huffpo,"['Nick Wing', 'Senior Reporter']",2018-02-22 20:11:26-05:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atf-gun-industry_us_5a8dc6ece4b0273053a737dd,"The U.S. gun industry has grown explosively over the past decade, leaving the federal agency responsible for regulating it, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, struggling to keep up with the rising flow of guns into the civilian market. And if the ATF stumbles, it could mean serious consequences for public safety.

Production at U.S. gun companies more than doubled under the Obama administration, with manufacturing totals going from 5.5 million firearms in 2009 to 11.5 million in 2016, the latest year for which federal data are available. Gun sales appeared to go up by similar margins over that period. At the same time, the number of federally licensed gun dealers increased by about 9,000, topping out at 56,754 in 2016, while the number of federally licensed firearms manufacturers more than tripled, according to the ATF.

The ATF’s budget, which includes funds for monitoring the network of gun manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers, has increased only slightly amid the recent boom, and it has remained unchanged at $1.25 billion over the last few years. The agency hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed director since 2015, and, as The New York Times reported on Thursday, the National Rifle Association has been part of a campaign to ensure that the ATF remains a small agency grappling with a wide-reaching set of duties, including prosecuting gun crimes, combating gun violence and trafficking, and regulating firearm commerce in the U.S.

“As an organization, personnel wise, ATF is smaller than the Broward County Sheriff’s department, which would be law enforcement in the Miami area,” said David Chipman, a former ATF agent who now serves as senior policy adviser for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “The last aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, so that’d be like 10 years of ATF budgets.”

In 2016, the ATF employed 821 industry operations investigators, who were in charge of regulating more than 100,000 federal firearms licensees, or FFLs. These agents periodically inspect gun dealers and manufacturers to make sure their businesses comply with federal law. ATF investigators review paperwork at gun stores to confirm sales have been legally conducted and properly recorded, so firearms can be traced if they’re used in a crime. For gun manufacturers, the ATF examines inventory and transaction records to make sure the company has distributed its products according to the law.

“The inspector comes in, they take a sample of the forms ― the key is it’s got to be a random sample because they’re not looking at them all ― he looks for troubling answers that shouldn’t be there. If he finds them, he tries to get them resolved or he refers them to law enforcement to get resolved,” said Howard Wolfe, a former ATF supervisor.

By catching illegal sales, straw purchases and other improper dealings, these inspections keep guns out of the hands of those who are not allowed to own them. The inspections also allow the ATF to proactively identify and crack down on the relatively small number of bad actors who are responsible for a disproportionate number of crime guns.

“Although most gun dealers are law abiding and their compliance is pretty good, when you have a dirty dealer, they can push out so many guns into the criminal market quickly, so you’d want to be on top of that immediately,” Chipman said.

But with meager resources and no law specifying how frequently the ATF must inspect firearms licensees, or even mandating that it conduct the inspections at all, the agency is fighting to keep up. From 2007 to 2012, the ATF failed to inspect 58 percent of all FFLs, according to a 2013 Office of the Inspector General report. In 2016, the agency estimated that it conducted 9,790 inspections, only about 7 percent of the 137,464 active licensees.

“You’ve got many dealers that haven’t been inspected in five or 10 years, and that can have dramatic impacts,” Chipman said. “I don’t know about you, but I’d probably shy away from eating at a restaurant that was only health-inspected once a year.”

You’ve got many dealers that haven’t been inspected in five or 10 years ... . I don’t know about you, but I’d probably shy away from eating at a restaurant that was only health-inspected once a year. David Chipman, senior policy adviser for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

Of those 137,000 federal licensees, more than 57,000 are firearms collectors. The ATF’s failure to inspect those collectors is less of a concern to Wolfe, because they’re rarely the source of guns used in crimes. But Wolfe admitted that keeping tabs on gun dealers alone remains difficult.

“The FFL license is good for three years, so ATF’s goal is to get each dealer inspected once every three years, but I doubt if they’re making it because there are just way more firearms licensees than there are inspectors,” he said. “The more records an inspector has to look at, the harder his job is. He’s got to do more statistical sampling, he’s got to cut back to a number of records he can actually look at, which increases the chances that he could miss something.”

Although there has been some discussion of mandating routine ATF inspections for each licensee over a certain period, Wolfe said that it would be impossible for inspectors to abide by such a standard with the agency in its current financial shape.

“The powers that be need to realize that if they demand a higher number of inspections with the same number of people, they’re going to get lower quality inspections, and that means things are going to get missed,” he said.

The ATF has pleaded for more funding over the past few years in order to patch up some of these holes.

“The growth in firearms commerce is an external challenge that has strained ATF’s ability to meet the needs of the firearms industry and the citizens of the United States,” the agency wrote in a recent budget request for fiscal year 2019.

“As the volume of firearms commerce continues to increase, the number of individual firearms records and transactions that FFLs maintain has significantly increased, leading to lengthier inspection times,” the document explained.

In its request, the ATF calls specific attention to the lack of timely inspections of FFLs, saying it “presents a significant risk to public safety.”

For the time being, however, the agency doesn’t appear to be getting much help on the regulatory front.

President Donald Trump’s recently released 2019 budget proposal requests an additional $66.6 million for the ATF. The largest increase would go to bolstering the agency’s ability to process applications for equipment regulated under the 1934 National Firearms Act. These items include gun silencers, machine guns and short-barreled rifles, which have surged in popularity in the last decade.

If the federal government is truly committed to addressing gun violence and responsibly regulating a rapidly growing gun industry, it could start by investing in the ATF, Chipman said."

Waste and inefficiency add costs to U.S. health care system. And health care costs rank highest on a new list of consumers’ worries found by the Monmouth Poll this week, well above jobs, housing, terrorism or immigration.

In the current American health reform debate, inefficiency and waste don’t get raised as top concerns. Consider that the U.S. spent $3.2 trillion on health care in 2015. As much as $300 billion of that money is wasted, and a big piece of that inefficiency is due to paper processes with which last century’s TV doctors Kildare, Welby, and perhaps even Hawkeye Pierce would have been familiar.

But this is the 21st century, and today is Feb. 9, 2017. Here is my personal story of health care paper and wasted costs to illustrate that this issue belongs to every U.S. health citizen.

On October 19, 2016, I went to the pharmacy in a suburban Philadelphia grocery store to get a flu shot. Before heading to the store, I checked with my health plan’s list of approved providers for immunizations, and that particular location was included.

I checked in with the pharmacy tech, who asked for my insurance card. When he clicked into the system for authorization, my coverage wasn’t available. The tech asked for assistance from the pharmacist, who double-checked the tech’s workflow and, sure enough, my health plan information wasn’t current in the computer system even though our premium for coverage had been paid.

After 15 minutes of the staff’s various computer clicks, I phoned my health plan’s third party administrator to inquire. In 10 minutes on the phone, I was counseled to “simply” pay for the flu shot and submit for reimbursement, which would be paid in full given that this was a covered preventive service in our health plan.

I got the shot, and handed a credit card to the tech who charged me $28.99 for the service.

Since that day, I have received six emails from the third party administrator concerning my reimbursement. She informed me that I would receive three (paper) checks to cover the $28.99.

I subsequently received two Explanations of Benefit forms from my health plan on October 31, 2016 and January 9, 2017. The first detailed the billed amount of $28.99, an allowed amount of $13.88, a coinsurance of $6.94, a “not covered” amount of $15.11, “what my plan paid” of $6.94, and “what I owed” amounting to $22.05. The second EOB indicated that of the $28.99 total flu shot cost, the plan paid $8.06.

So far, I have received a check for $6.94 (the “what my plan paid” amount) dated October 31, 2016, and a check for $8.06, dated January 9, 2017. I have been told, in one of the third party admin’s emails, that I should be receiving a third check in the amount of $13.99 from the grocery store pharmacy, but that check hasn’t yet arrived.

It’s now 121 days since I got my flu shot. I’ve calculated the real cost of that shot, and specifically the paper and workflows associated with the transaction and its aftermath: it’s at least $100. That accounts for the pharmacy workers’ time, the third part admin’s emails and follow-ups, and the insurance company’s EOBs and paper check cutting.

This direct cost calculation doesn’t include the patient’s (my) time-cost and aggravation that can lead to lower satisfaction and, potentially, plan and provider “flight.”

I am the shoemaker’s child with no shoes in this story. For nine years, I have been a member of the Advisory Council to the CAQH Index, which has been measuring the adoption of electronic, real-time transactions, away from paper-based processes, by health plans and health care providers.

The 2016 Index found continued migration to electronic transactions among health plans and providers, especially for submitting claims, verifying eligibility for the patient-member, inquiring into claim status, and paying for claims. Nevertheless, the use of manual transactions is not declining as rapidly as we would like, with phone calls still consuming significant time and money. This is happening, even though health plans are offering web portals and interactive voice response systems to replace manual processes.

“Our research for the Index shows that while progress has been steady, there are opportunities to encourage greater industry use of electronic transactions by reducing adoption barriers and sharing best practices,” observed Robin Thomashauer, Executive Director, CAQH. “Realizing the full potential of these transactions will require an ongoing commitment by all health care stakeholders, including health plans, providers, vendors and government.”

Each manual transaction costs health plans and health care providers about $3 more than the electronic transaction that could replace them. Since there were over 3 billion manual transactions between health plans and providers in 2015, moving to digital transactions represents a potential $9 billion savings for the U.S. health care system and its payors – which include consumers as we take on greater up-front financial risk in high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts.

My $100 flu shot was but one single transaction in the U.S. health care ecosystem that represents a much larger scenario of waste in American health care. That waste costs, in terms of money, time, and ultimately, the nation’s public and financial health."
