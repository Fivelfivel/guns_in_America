We are again confronting the challenge of remaining faithful to the unalienable right to life articulated in the Declaration of Independence – a challenge that the Constitution demands we protect from two angles.

By seeking to “insure domestic tranquility,” the government has an obligation to protect us from violence. But by acknowledging “the right of the people to keep and bear arms” it also recognizes the need for individuals to protect themselves by means of self-defense.

We must have a conversation about how to navigate the tension between these two realities. It should involve everyone in our society and within our government. President Trump is talking about it. Congress is talking about it. The media, educators and citizens are talking about it.

But one potential participant remains conspicuously silent: the United States Supreme Court. On Feb. 20, the Supreme Court refused to hear the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals case Silvester v. Becerra. That case concerned a California law requiring a 10-day waiting period before purchasing a firearm.

The challenge to the law said it should not apply to people who previously had gone through the background check process and now sought to buy an additional gun. The 9th Circuit Court upheld the 10-day waiting period.

Regardless of this case’s particular merits, the high court’s denial represents a larger pattern. For nearly a decade, the court has refused to rule on the constitutionality of gun regulations in a systematic fashion.

The justices’ reticence is both strange and problematic. It is strange in light of prior decisions. A decade ago, in the 2008 case of D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court interpreted the Second Amendment to the Constitution for the first time as protecting the right of an individual to own a gun. But far from making this right absolute, the court declared that limits existed to gun ownership.

What exactly were those limits? The court didn’t really say.

Beyond affirming that “longstanding prohibitions” could continue, Justice Antonin Scalia refused to give details when the Heller decision was announced. No need to do so, he said, “since this case represents this Court’s first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field … there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.”

It seemed that the court, having established the baseline of an individual right, expected a series of future cases to draw the lines for how to balance gun safety and gun rights. The court ruled in 2010 that the Second Amendment applied to the states in McDonald v. City of Chicago.

However, the decision in the McDonald case didn’t break much new ground on the content of the right itself. Instead, it merely kicked the can of further definition down the road. After that case, when given numerous options to further delineate the Second Amendment, the court has refused – again and again.

The Supreme Court’s failure to define the scope of gun rights is problematic because it leaves too much unsettled. The Heller and McDonald decisions opened up myriad questions about gun rights and their regulation without settling on a standard by which to judge gun laws.

This means that, absent further precedent, lower courts possess little guidance in how to rule on competing claims, which in turn has given rise to confusion.

As Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out when objecting to the latest court refusal to hear the Silvester case, there is a great disparity in the standards exercised by lower courts in gun cases. While some judges seek to impose a more stringent standard on gun laws, others – like many on the 9th Circuit Court – adopt a “deferential analysis” that accepts as valid nearly any regulation.

The Supreme Court once argued that “liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.” That remains true for gun owners, who are subject to the accident of whatever lower court judge’s jurisdiction they happen to live in.

It is also true for legislators, who are left without guidelines to follow when crafting legislation. But it is especially true for the victims of gun violence.

Liberty does not find a refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt, and neither does life. The Supreme Court cannot and should not try to settle every detail of gun policy. But it should begin to fulfill the promise made in the Heller case.

The nation’s highest court should seek to further describe what it believes the Second Amendment protects regarding gun ownership and what the amendment allows for gun regulations. The high court should also police lower courts to hold them accountable to those standards.

In so doing, the Supreme Court can make its own needed contribution to the present conversation. It can bring the Constitution to bear in its own way in the gun debate.

Above all, the Supreme Court can play a part in furthering the right that proponents of gun regulation and of gun protection both seek – a right that has been so desecrated by our seemingly endless school shootings: the unalienable right to life."

Pat Roberts']",2018-03-01 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/01/gun-control-measures-proposed-by-trump-lawmakers-after-florida-school-shooting.html,"In the weeks after a gunman walked into a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members, survivors aren't giving up their fight for stronger gun control efforts.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School teenagers have moved front and center in the gun control debate, organizing a coming national school walkout, meeting with President Donald Trump, lobbying state lawmakers and participating in protests.

Since the Feb. 14 shooting, several ideas have been floated by the White House, Republicans, Democrats and state officials to combat gun violence. Trump also hosted a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House to discuss reform.

Here are seven measures lawmakers are now debating.

Arming teachers

Trump and Republicans suggested the possibility of arming teachers after the school shooting – and Florida lawmakers moved closer to do that this week.

A school safety bill that, among other things, would allow some teachers to be armed, narrowly passed the Florida state House in March, and Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed it into law.

On Twitter, Trump promoted the idea of having “highly trained, gun adept” teachers and coaches in schools who could confront a shooter before first responders arrived or serve as a “deterrent to the cowards that do this.”

“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!” Trump tweeted.

Two school districts near Dayton, Ohio, already train a group of select teachers and faculty members to confront an active shooter. These staff members, whose identities are not revealed, have access to safes throughout the schools which have guns hidden inside.

Ohio offers funding for schools to train staff to respond in emergency situations. There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff members who are trained to fire back, or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds.

Strengthening federal background checks

Trump has seemed open to strengthening the federal background check process for gun purchases, saying it should be a bipartisan effort to do so.

Gun control advocates point to what they see as “loopholes” in the current system that could allow for people to purchase guns even when they legally should not be able to do so.

Specifically, Jonas Oransky, deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, noted the ability for consumers to purchase guns from a private seller without completing a background check.

“It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller.” - Jonas Oransky, Everytown for Gun Safety

“It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller,” Oransky told Fox News.

He also pointed to the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed – when National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) marks a document “delayed” but does not approve or deny it within three business days. He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers, citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency.

However, Second Amendment advocates argue the background check system already does too much.

“We don’t think it’s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit, told Fox News.

Eliminating bump stocks

In the wake of the Parkland shooting, Trump said he signed an order instructing the Justice Department to ban bump stocks, an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to resemble a fully automatic weapon.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said top officials in the Justice Department believe they can ban bump stocks through the regulatory process. However, gun manufacturers and owners are likely to sue if they are banned without any legislation from Congress.

Bump stocks were approved in 2010 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after concluding the devices did not turn guns into machine guns, which are prohibited under the National Firearms Act.

The devices weren’t used in the Parkland shooting, but the massacre did reignite the debate over whether they should be banned.

Limiting high-capacity magazines

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said he's open to changing his stance on one gun control measure after meeting with survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting: high-capacity magazines.

""I have traditionally not supported looking at magazine clip size and after this and some of the details I have learned about it, I am reconsidering that position,"" Rubio said during a recent town hall. ""While it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack ... So we'll have to get into that debate, but that is something I believe that we can reach a compromise [on] in this country, and that I'm willing to reconsider.""

The suspected gunman had to stop to reload his firearm during the massacre, which Rubio added was “evidence in this case that it saved the lives of some people.”

Several measures introduced in states across the country – including in Colorado, Illinois and Rhode Island – would ban high-capacity magazines.

Raising the age limit to buy certain guns

After hosting survivors of gun violence and their parents at the White House, Trump publicly backed raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21.

“There’s nothing more important than protecting our children,” Trump said.

“Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15.” - Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan.

And when Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., acknowledged that a bill he’s sponsored with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to broaden background checks does not include raising the age limit, Trump accused him of being “afraid of the NRA.”

National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch has already said the powerful gun lobby does not support raising the age limit to purchase certain firearms. After Trump’s White House meeting, she told Fox News it was “good TV,” but some of the proposals were “really bad policy.”

However, some Republican senators, including Rubio and Pat Roberts of Kansas, have voiced support for raising the minimum age to purchase certain types of firearms.

“Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,"" Roberts said.

Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, announced this week that it would stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone under the age of 21.

Banning ‘assault-style’ rifles

House Democrats introduced a ban on semi-automatic firearms in February called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. More than 150 Democrats signed the legislation, the Washington Examiner reported.

According to a Harvard CAPS-Harris survey, 61 percent of respondents support banning the AR-15 firearm, used in many of the recent mass shootings in the U.S., including Parkland. Just 39 percent of respondents said adults who pass a background check should be allowed to purchase the firearm.

Dick’s Sporting Goods announced in February that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm.

“We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Edward W. Stack, chairman and CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods, said in a statement. “But we have to help solve the problem that’s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America – our kids.”

Stack also said the company would stop selling high-capacity magazines and will continue its policy of not selling bump stocks.

“Some will say these steps can’t guarantee tragedies like Parkland will never happen again. They may be correct – but if common sense reform is enacted and even one life is saved, it will have been worth it,” Stack said.

Cutting ties with the NRA

Trump encouraged lawmakers not to be afraid to disagree with the NRA, the powerful nonprofit that advocates for gun rights, during a televised meeting with lawmakers.

“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump said. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”

Several companies have cut ties with the NRA since the Parkland school shooting. Among them are: Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, MetLife, United and Delta.

Georgia lawmakers voted to yank a tax break for Atlanta-based Delta on March 1 after the airline severed ties with the NRA.

The bill cleared the state House with an overwhelming 135-24 vote, after being approved in the state Senate on a 44-10 vote. It was then sent to the governor's desk.

The final version dropped an earlier amendment that would have renewed a jet fuel tax exemption worth $50 million that was taken off the books in 2015.

“Businesses have every legal right to make their own decisions, but the Republican majority in our state legislature also has every right to govern guided by our principles,” said Lieutenant Gov. Casey Cagle, who threatened to kill the airline tax break days prior to the vote.

The threat prompted liberal governors nationwide to court the airline, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who tweeted his support and encouraged Delta to move its headquarters north.

“Now more than ever the NRA is showing just how out of step they are with the American people,” Cuomo said in a statement, calling the NRA's agenda “dangerous.”

The NRA has fired back at companies like Delta – and at the lawmakers encouraging them – for allegedly not supporting the Second Amendment.

“Ultimately, our members are passionate #2A supporters. Having those on the left pushing for a boycott to pressure companies to drop discounts just shows how out of touch some are,” the NRA said on Twitter.

James Eric Davis Jr., 19, was apprehended just after midnight Saturday after being wanted in connection with the shooting deaths of his father James Eric Davis Sr., 48, and his mother Diva, 48. The manhunt for Davis went on for nearly a day and involved more than 100 police officers.

Central Michigan University Police Chief Bill Yeagley told reporters Saturday that the gun used in the shooting belonged to Davis Sr., a part-time police officer in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood. He would not say whether the father had brought the gun to campus when picking up his son, but noted that Davis Jr. was seen on video in the dorm's parking lot with the gun before going into the building where his parents were shot.

Yeagley did not say if the gun was Davis Sr.’s service weapon.

MICHIGAN STUDENT SUSPECTED OF SLAYING PARENTS HAS BEEN ARRESTED, AUTHORITIES SAY

Providing a timeline of the incident, Yeagley said Davis Jr. ran into the office of the CMU police officers Thursday in fear saying he believed someone was trying to hurt him. Davis was ""very vague"" and claimed someone had a gun. The officers investigated and were able to identify someone who ""may have been threatening Davis.""

The individual was found and interviewed to see if there was a threat. During that time, officers were talking to Davis who was ""not making much sense."" The officers determined there was no risk to Davis.

A few hours later, officers found Davis in the dorm's hallway with his suitcases and bags acting ""unreasonable."" The officers asked him to call his parents. The officers spoke to Davis' mother to tell her about her son's recent behavior. The officer said they were suspicious of drugs. Following the conversation, Davis was taken to the hospital.

CMU STUDENT’S FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS REACT TO NEWS OF PARENTS’ DEATHS

Davis stayed at the hospital until his parents picked him up the next day. The family went to the school's campus to pick up his bags and take him home, Yeagley said.

Surveillance video appeared to show Davis Jr. in the dorm's parking lot with the gun before going into the building where his parents were shot. Following the incident, the 19-year-old fled on foot and ran on railroad tracks. Authorities were able to recover the weapon at the scene.

Yeagley said the investigation was ongoing. A motive was not immediately clear.

The shooting at Campbell Hall occurred on a day when parents were arriving to pick up students for the beginning of a weeklong spring break.

Yeagley also said authorities were able to track Davis due to a tip from a railroad employee. The student is being treated at McLaren Hospital. He was reportedly ""hypothermic and confused"" when he was taken into police custody, the Lansing State Journal reported.

The New York Times failed to do this with an error-filled piece that incorrectly claims President Trump “peppered his remarks with inaccurate facts about mass shootings and gun policy” Wednesday in a meeting with members of Congress.

I have a bit of a personal stake in this, as President Trump was using arguments that I have been making for many years in my earlier academic research at universities on gun control laws and public safety and in my role as founder and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center.

By any objective standard, truth in labeling would show that the Times article by Linda Qui is not a fact check at all, but simply a political attack on President Trump, with no attempt to understand the arguments he is making.

At his televised meeting with lawmakers, the president stated: “You take Pulse nightclub, if you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did.”

Qui rates this statement by the president as “false.” “There was, in fact, an off-duty police officer working in the nightclub at the time of the shooting,” she writes.

But in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando – when a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 58 others – the police officer on guard was the first person who was shot at. An officer’s uniform is like a neon sign saying “shoot me first.”

The same targeting of uniformed officers happened at the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris in 2015, when two brothers shot and killed 12 people and injured 11 others. And it happened again last year when a gunman shot and killed 39 people and wounded at least 70 others in Istanbul in Turkey.

Attackers are not stupid. They want to eliminate anyone who poses an immediate threat at the outset of their attack. If a police officer or security guard in uniform is the only person with a gun, shooting him will give shooters free reign to kill others. Florida is one of only 10 states that ban civilians from carrying guns at nightclubs.

What President Trump had in mind was concealed carrying of a handgun. If one or more people who aren’t obvious guards are armed, attackers won’t be able to identify them, and so won’t know who they need to attack first. This is a critical distinction that Qui ignores.

Concealed handgun permit holders make a guard's job much safer, because an attacker won't be able to attack the guard without worrying that someone behind him or to his side might be able to stop him with a bullet. It is the concealed handgun permit holder who can’t be identified as having a weapon who takes away the attacker’s strategic advantage.

President Trump also stated in his meeting Wednesday: “98 percent of all mass shootings in the United States since 1950 have taken place in gun-free zones.”

Qui claims that this is “disputed” because gun-free zone prohibitions don’t “account for weapons being carried by law enforcement officers, military troops or licensed professional security personnel.”

Criticizing my research, Qui writes that “Lott’s data set included military bases like Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard.” But my point is valid. Whether the person guarding the place is a uniformed police officer or a security guard, they are the first target for these attackers.

Regular military members are banned from carrying guns at military bases in the United States, making the bases surprisingly soft targets. The only people who can carry guns on domestic bases are military police, so the situation is much the same as at the Pulse nightclub.

Fort Hood in Texas – where a U.S. Army major shot and killed 13 people and wounded 30 others in 2009 – is like a medium-sized city, with military police driving around just as police do in any city.

Terrorists can kill the police first, wait for them to leave, or pick another target. Concealed handgun permit holders take away the strategic advantage that terrorists have in being able to choose the time and place of their attacks.

Qui points to a study by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety that finds “70 percent of mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015 took place in private residences.” Qui cites another study that also counts gang shootings.

But President Trump properly follows the official FBI definition of mass public shootings, which excludes “shootings that resulted from gang or drug violence” or that occurred in the commission of another crime such as robbery.

The FBI also includes only shootings in “public places” such as: commercial areas (malls, stores and other businesses); schools and colleges; open spaces; government properties (including military bases and civilian offices); houses of worship; and health- care facilities.

Qui and the two studies she cites completely ignore the reasons behind the FBI's definition of “mass public shootings.” Shootings in private residences are distinctly different, since they often involve killers who know the homeowners and whether they own guns. If there is a gun in the home, the killer may know who has access to it. And in some cases, one spouse or romantic partner shoots the other.

Mass public shootings are uniquely motivated. Whereas gang fights are typically part of larger turf wars over control of the sale of drugs, the perpetrators of mass public shootings seek to gain publicity by killing or injuring as many people as possible. The remedies for these two types of violence are also vastly different.

The issue of gun-free zones is particularly pertinent to mass public shootings. The number of casualties in an attack depends on the amount of time that elapses before someone with a gun intervenes.

The above responses to Qui’s arguments have been made dozens of times. But Qui apparently didn’t feel it necessary to address them in her piece. Perhaps she didn't think it was necessary because readers of the New York Times would never hear the arguments on the other side.

If we're going to effectively address the problem of mass public shootings, we're going to have to set political biases aside."

Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, tweeted late Thursday that ""POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control.""

About an hour later, Trump appeared to endorse Cox's version of events with a tweet of his own: ""Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!""

On Wednesday, Trump shocked observers during a televised discussion with bipartisan lawmakers by appearing to endorse extreme gun control measures.

“Take the guns first. Go through due process second,” Trump said. “I like taking the guns early.”

JUDGE NAP: TRUMP'S COMMENTS ON DUE PROCESS ARE WHAT GUN OWNERS, NRA FEAR THE MOST

Trump, who has publicly changed his mind on other key issues, also urged Republican lawmakers not to be ""afraid"" of the powerful gun lobby and openly entertained more gun restrictions.

The NRA had reacted quickly to Trump's comments, even before Thursday's meeting.

NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Wednesdsay that Trump’s meeting with lawmakers “made for good TV” but “bad policy.”

She said the organization is “in lock step” with the president on protecting children, but wants to “respect due process.”

During the televised discussion with bipartisan lawmakers on Wednesday, Trump said they and the NRA don’t “have to agree on everything.”

He proceeded to pitch a mix of gun control measures as well as proposals the NRA likes -- such as arming teachers. But his language, at times, was stunning coming from a Republican president.

'Take the guns first. Go through due process second.' - President Trump

“Take the guns first. Go through due process second,” Trump said at the White House. “I like taking the guns early.”

Trump has long been comfortable defying conventional Republican policy tenets, working ever since his entry into the 2016 race to pull the party toward him -- on trade, on entitlements, on infrastructure and more.

If any GOP president could have the ability to test gun control positions without a devastating backlash from his base, it could be the president who once -- ironically -- bragged he could ""shoot somebody"" on Fifth Avenue and not lose votes.

Yet the NRA was one of Trump's biggest 2016 supporters, and has seemed taken aback. The group already has pushed back on his call to raise the purchase age for certain guns to 21.

NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Wednesdsay that Trump’s meeting with lawmakers “made for good TV” but “bad policy.” She said the organization is “in lock step” with the president on protecting children, but wants to “respect due process.”

“We’re talking about punishing innocent Americans and stripping from them constitutional rights without due process and making them pay for what the political class has done,” Loesch said on “The Story” with Martha MacCallum on Wednesday.

“The NRA is also going to protect due process for innocent Americans. That is an approach that we are going to hold to,” Loesch said. “We stressed this to the president. … It is a foundational principle of this country and due process must be protected and respected in terms of going around any solutions.”

The White House, meanwhile, plans to roll out specific policy proposals Thursday aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.

Trump stresses that he and the NRA have a solid bond.

“I’m a fan of the NRA. There’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA,” Trump told lawmakers Wednesday. “These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.”

Trump is expected Thursday to reiterate his support for a bill that bolsters the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, as well as the STOP School Violence Act, which gives grants for preventing school violence.

The president also doubled down Wednesday on his intent to get rid of “bump stocks,” saying they will “be gone shortly.” The firearm modifiers, which can make a semi-automatic weapon fire nearly as rapidly as a fully automatic machine gun, were used in the October 2017 Las Vegas Massacre, where 58 people were killed and hundreds more were injured.

“Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!”

Trump is also expected to call for changes Thursday to the FBI’s tipster program, amid revelations that the bureau received multiple tips about Nikolas Cruz, the teenager accused of killing 17 people at the Parkland, Fla. high school, but failed to stop him.

The president also said he wanted lawmakers “to come up with some ideas” and put them into a “very bipartisan bill.”

Jesse Randall Davidson, 53, allegedly fired at least one shot inside a Dalton High School classroom, then barricaded himself inside until he surrendered to police. Davidson, a social studies teacher, is known as the “radio voice” during the school’s football and basketball games because of his play-by-lay announcements, Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Police revealed details about the high school teacher’s past, including when Davidson went to detectives on March 21, 2016, and said he arranged to have someone killed, AJC reported, citing a police report. He reportedly ordered to have the individual killed because he had an online affair.

Police said they couldn’t verify what Davidson told them or if the individual existed. Davidson was taken to the hospital ""based on him thinking about hurting himself,"" the police report stated.

The school was aware of the incident at the time.

GEORGIA TEACHER IN CUSTODY AFTER ALLEGEDLY OPENING FIRE IN CLASSROOM, POLICE SAY

In another incident that occurred January 2017, Davidson was found sitting on the curb about a mile away from Dalton High School and refused to respond to police, the report stated. Davidson had left school early that day after he said he wasn’t feeling well.

Davidson was taken to the hospital and police did not take further action.

Davidson, who has been with the high school since 2004, was arrested Wednesday and charged with aggravated assault, carrying a weapon on school grounds, terroristic threats, reckless conduct, possession of a gun during commission of a crime and disrupting public school, according to police.

The gunshot heard just before noon ignited panic and chaos among students and faculty members. Some students were sent running down the hallways and out of the school. Others barricaded themselves in classrooms.

“It wasn't a drill. And we had to get down and barricade the doors so nobody could come in. Nobody knew what was going on at the time,” Jayden Boston, a Dalton High School student, told WSB-TV.

Davidson was found with a handgun, which he carried into the building by placing it in his computer case, Dalton Police spokesman Bruce Fraizer said. Police took the 53-year-old into custody after a 30- to 45-minute standoff.

TRUMP CALLS FOR ARMING TEACHERS, RAISING GUN PURCHASE AGE TO STOP ‘SAVAGE SICKO’ SHOOTERS

Wednesday’s incident occurred two weeks after a gunman opened fire inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. President Trump called on arming teachers in classrooms shortly after to increase school safety after the deadly shooting.

“I never said ‘give teachers guns’ like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving ‘concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience- only the best,” Trump tweeted last Thursday when defending his proposal.

Andrew Cuomo's comments at the time, coming in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, might have well been spoken today after yet another mass shooting.

""Mentally ill people should not have access to guns. Criminals should not have access to guns. You should limit these high capacity magazines. Why? Because if, God forbid, the gun winds up in the wrong hands of someone you want to limit the danger,"" he said.

A growing number of gun manufacturers are leaving states like New York and California, which have unleashed a wave of strict gun control laws the past few years. Companies like Fargnoli are now becoming a rare breed in the Empire State as many flee to more gun-friendly states.

Fargnoli believes many of the SAFE Act restrictions were arbitrary and random. No more pistol grip. No more threaded barrel. It meant redesigning components, and finding new out-of-state-suppliers. Asked if he lost a lot of business, he replied, ""If 10 percent is a lot. It hurt us.""

Yet, the SAFE Act mandated no changes to the working parts of what critics call ""assault"" weapons – the very types of carbines Fargnoli and his staff of seven employees assemble.

""They are literally identical, they are interchangeable,"" said Scott Braum, counsel to Just Right Carbines. ""They're all the same function, they're all the same operation. They're all the same caliber. They just look different.""

One of the sponsors of the SAFE Act disagrees.

""These cosmetic changes are not cosmetic at all,"" says Jeff Klein, who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. He described them as ""features that enhance one-handed shooting comfort and rapid reloading capabilities that no sportsman needs.""

Just Right Carbines has found that even changing the color of its rifles, from black to a wood-grained metal, or to an American flag design, appeases some anti-gun legislators.

The ever increasing costs of compliance has driven many gunsmiths out of New York and other states southward to more gun friendly states. Remington, in business here since the 19th century, recently relocated to Alabama. Beretta pulled out of Maryland for Tennessee. KAHR Arms moved to Pennsylvania. So far, Fargnoli is resisting.

""I have 11 grandchildren and one on the way. And I can tell you my wife’s not leaving them. So moving the business isn't going to happen for me,"" he said.

And he ponders whether more laws will work when existing ones didn't. He notes that concerned citizens raised countless red flags about Nicolas Cruz. Most were ignored or casually dismissed by authorities, in what amounts to an utter failure by government institutions. A reality, he believes, that reinforces a citizen’s right – and need – to keep and bear arms.

""What they take away will never give back,"" he said."

During an event at the White House, the president announced he signed a memo ordering the regulations on “bump stocks” and told Sessions he wants new federal guidelines finalized “very soon.

He also signaled support for additional changes to gun legislation, tweeting Tuesday evening, “Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!”

The memo, released by the White House on Tuesday, directs the DOJ to propose a rule “banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.”

Trump wrote in the memo, “Although the Obama administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns.”

GUN LAW CHANGES ATTRACT RENEWED GOP INTEREST

A spokesman for the DOJ said it is acting ""quickly"" on the president's order.

“The department understands this is a priority for the president and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process,"" spokesman Sarah Isgur Flores said. ""We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed.”

During Tuesday’s press briefing, the White House said the president opposes the “bump stock” rifle modifier, which make semi-automatic firearms fire faster.

“I can tell you the president supports not having the use of bump stocks and that we expect further action on that in the coming days,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday.

Sanders added that the president had ordered the Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to review the regulation of bump stocks after a gunman opened fire on concert-goers on the Las Vegas strip in October, killing more than 50 people.

“My understanding is that review has been completed and movement will take place on that shortly,” Sanders said.

In the wake of last week’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people, Sanders said Trump plans to host parents, teachers and students on Wednesday to discuss “efforts to ensure safety at our schools.” Among those attending will be members of the Parkland community and those affected by the Sandy Hook and Columbine school shootings, the White House added.

Liberals have renewed calls for new gun control measures after last week’s shooting. Trump, who was backed by the NRA during the 2016 election, has expressed support for the Second Amendment and has said he’s against reflexive gun control measures that wouldn’t make a difference.

Sanders said the White House hasn’t “closed the door on any front.”

She also said, “The president has expressed his support for efforts to improve the federal background system and in the coming days we will continue to explore ways to ensure the safety and security of our schools.”

Meanwhile, the state House in Florida, days after the Parkland shooting, on Tuesday voted down a motion to take up a bill that would ban so-called assault rifles, effectively killing the measure for this session. The motion failed by a 36-71 vote.

Just weeks earlier, YouTube announced it would hire thousands of additonal human moderators to ensure that inappropriate videos are removed from the website, while continuing to develop automated moderating solutions.

But amid this week's national conversation on gun rights, some users said YouTube's moderators were nixing their legitimate uploads, Bloomberg reported.

For example, the owner of the popular Military Arms Channel on YouTube, which has more than 650,000 subscribers, said in a Facebook post that moderators removed three of his videos: ""Sure Shot Exploding Targets,"" ""MAC Opens a Gun Shop - Copper Custom,"" and ""New Kel-Tec RDB Bullpup.""

The videos are not conspiratorial or overtly political in nature. The Kel-Tec video, for example, is a mostly techincal rundown of the features of an upcoming rifle from the company, and features footage of a man firing the weapon.

Those videos are currently back online, but Tim Harmsen, founder of the Military Arms Channel, said Monday that YouTube had temporarily prevented the channel from posting new videos.

PROFESSOR ACCUSES GOOGLE OF CENSORSHIP

""As of this moment I cannot post new videos to YouTube for two weeks,"" the channel's owner, Tim Harmsen, wrote. ""Apparently if YouTube agrees with your political motivation, they side with the political trolls and disregard their own rules against reporting community standard compliant videos.""

""Apparently if YouTube agrees with your political motivation, they side with the political trolls and disregard their own rules ..."" - Military Arms Channel founder Tim Harmsen

Bloomberg, citing the website Outline, also reported that several other accounts with fringe political messages -- including one run by Titus Frost, who tweeted that Parkland survivor David Hogg is a crisis actor -- were also banned.

New York Times bestselling author and Infowars D.C. bureau chief Jerome Corsi also tweeted Tuesday that YouTube had removed some of his content and temporarily banned him.

An outright ban of fringe commentators would signal an escalation in YouTube's content-policing tactics, Bloomberg reported.

The video-sharing website's policies prohibit ""harmful"" or ""dangerous"" content, as well as hateful and harassing uploads.

YouTube did not comment on specific deletions, but said that its moderators may have made mistakes.

""As we work to hire rapidly and ramp up our policy enforcement teams throughout 2018, newer members may misapply some of our policies resulting in mistaken removals,"" a YouTube spokeswoman told Bloomberg. ""We’re continuing to enforce our existing policies regarding harmful and dangerous content, they have not changed. We’ll reinstate any videos that were removed in error."""
fox10,[],2017-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/06/how-was-texas-gunman-able-to-buy-firearm.html,"The gunman who slaughtered 26 people at a Texas church was able to buy weapons because the Air Force failed to report his domestic violence conviction to the federal database that is used to conduct background checks on would-be gun purchasers, authorities said Monday.

Federal officials said the Air Force didn't submit Devin Patrick Kelley's criminal history even though it was required to do so by Pentagon rules.

Kelley, 26, was found guilty of assault in an Air Force court-martial in 2012 for abusing his wife and her child and was given 12 months' confinement followed by a bad-conduct discharge in 2014. That same year, authorities said, he bought the first of four weapons.

Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel for crimes like assault should be submitted to the FBI's Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division.

It's the kind of lapse that gun-control advocates say points to loopholes and failures with the background check system.

At issue is the Lautenberg Amendment, enacted by Congress in 1996. The federal law was designed to prohibit people convicted of domestic violence from buying or possessing a firearm regardless of whether the crime was a felony or a misdemeanor.

""This is exactly the guy the Lautenberg Amendment is supposed to prevent from possessing a firearm,"" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and former judge advocate. ""Of course, the law only works if folks are abiding by the law.""

Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in an email that the service is launching a review of its handling of Kelley's case and taking a comprehensive look at Air Force databases to make sure other cases have been reported correctly.

An initial review indicates that Kelley's conviction was not entered into the federal database by officials at Holloman Air Force Base's Office of Special Investigations, the Air Force said.

Kelley served at Holloman in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge. He was in logistics, responsible for moving passengers and cargo.

Law enforcement authorities said Kelley owned four guns, including the three he had with him during the attack: a Ruger AR-15 that was used in the church and two handguns that were in his car. The weapons were purchased — one each year — from 2014 to this year.

A 2015 report by the Pentagon's inspector general found lapses in the military's reporting to civilian authorities of domestic violence convictions.

From Nov. 30, 1998, until last week, firearms purchases in the U.S. were denied 136,502 times because of a domestic violence conviction, according to Justice Department statistics.

""The fact this guy was even court-martialed at all indicates it reached a certain level of severity that should act as a red flag that this is a dangerous person and shouldn't have a gun,"" said Lindsay Nichols, the federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, named after former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was gravely wounded by a gunman in 2011.

Lawyers for Jose Ines Garcia Zarate on Thursday claimed that the judge presiding over the murder trial failed to properly instruct jurors before they acquitted him.

Zarate’s lawyers argued in court papers that the jury should’ve considered the claim that he didn’t know he was holding a gun when it fired on San Francisco’s Pier 14 in July 2015.

Lawyers also argued their client didn’t hold the gun long enough to warrant a firearm possession conviction.

The judge declined to include those instructions and jurors convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Zarate was acquitted of both first and second degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the trial. He was also found not guilty of assault with a semi-automatic weapon.

They smash through front doors, with stolen vehicles if necessary, to steal dozens of firearms in seconds.

And it’s happening all across the country.

Just this week, brazen thieves broke into the Warhorse Firearms shop in Littleton, Colo. and stole 27 semi-automatic rifles just before 3 a.m. No arrests have been made in the case.

ATF officials say it’s a troubling new trend. Instead of stealing a gun from a home or street corner, thieves are now targeting gun stores where they could steal a handful or dozens of firearms at a time.

""This is our top priority at ATF,"" according Lisa Meiman, spokesperson for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which tracks gun thefts nationwide.

CALIFORNIA STUN-GUN ROBBERY SPREE: 3 WOMEN ON THE LOOSE IN LA AREA

In 2012, there was a total of 5,762 guns stolen in America, according to the ATF. Last year, that number jumped to 9,281. That includes guns taken in robberies, burglaries and simple larcenies. In the same period, the number of gun shop robberies, defined as thefts committed during business hours with staff present, increased by 175 percent, ATF said.

Many happen at night, with thieves using vehicles to smash through doors, grab as many guns as possible and leave before police get there.

SHERIFF: FUGITIVE CAPTURE TURNS INTO SEARCH FOR MISSING MAN

That's exactly what happened at the Sunshine State Armory in Zephyrhills, Florida last April. Police have not said how many guns were stolen in that case.

In March, thieves broke through the front doors of the 50 West Armory in Chantilly, Virginia. They were seen on security camera videos grabbing 35 firearms. Manager Scott Wahl said police responded within minutes, but the crooks were gone in just 48 seconds.

Most of these so-called smash and grabs are anything but random. They are committed by professional thieves who target store after store in coordinated break-ins, authorities said.

""Guns serve almost as a form of currency in many gangs,"" Meiman explains. ""You can barter for drugs or for favors. They give them to their criminal friends and associates, they use them in other crimes.""

Worst of all, Meiman said, everyone knows where these guns end up.

""They are not used as trophies, they are not going to be used for hunting,” she said. “They are going to be used in future crimes and potentially hurt people and maybe even cause death.""

Federal officials say they really have no idea why the numbers of gun thefts have increased so dramatically in recent years, but they acknowledge the problem is growing worse year by year.

The ATF says there are no federal security regulations gun stores have to follow, only recommendations.

Joshua Barton, who owns DCF Guns in Castle Rock, Colorado said most guns shop owners use the best security they can.

""We have state-of-the-art alarm systems and camera systems,” Barton said. “There's a certain amount of loss that's acceptable in a lot of retail businesses. In ours, it's not.""

Barton installed concrete and metals barriers in front of his store. They stopped a jeep that tried to ram the entrance in June. But, a week later, the thieves came back, tied tow cables to the front door and simply ripped them off the hinges.

""The community needs to know that this stuff is taken very seriously,"" he said. ""And there's a lot of money that goes into making sure that things like this are prevented. Unfortunately, like any other burglary, things are going to happen."""

Earl Ray Tomblin’s veto on Saturday in a bipartisan effort to enact permitless gun carry in the state.

Beginning June 5, anyone over age 21 who can legally possess a firearm will be allowed to carry it concealed on their person without having to obtain a permit. West Virginia has long allowed permitless open carry but, like most states, required a permit to carry a concealed firearm. With the new law the state will become the eighth in the nation to implement what gun rights activists call “constitutional carry.”

The law also creates a provisional permitting process for those between the ages of 18 and 20 who wish to carry a concealed firearm within the state. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 had previously been excluded from the permitting process altogether.

West Virginia’s move to permitless carry marks the continuation of a national trend that began in 2003. Before then, only Vermont allowed law-abiding adults to carry concealed firearms without a permit. The pace accelerated over the last five years, with seven states adopting the policy.

Concealed carry laws vary from state to state, but most adhere to one of three basic structures. The most popular, which is in effect in 34 states, is commonly referred to as a “shall-issue” structure, where applicants must be issued a permit if they pass a background check along with whatever training and identification requirements are set by the state.

The most restrictive type of concealed carry law, adopted by only eight states, is the “may-issue” structure in which applicants can still be denied a permit even if they meet all of the requirements set out by the state. May-issue concealed carry laws often issue very few concealed carry permits to residents.

The regulation, issued in the final months of President Barack Obama's term, is one of a handful congressional Republicans are rolling back, knowing they habe a new ally in the White House. The Senate is poised to scuttle an Obama rule preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams.

""In my home state of Kentucky and others across the nation, the Stream Buffer Rule will cause major damage to communities and threaten coal jobs,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

The House passed the gun resolution on Wednesday and Senate approval on Thursday will send the measure to Trump for his signature.

Obama's background check rule required the Social Security Administration to forward to the Justice Department the names of certain disabled beneficiaries for a database of individuals ineligible to purchase a firearm. The rule affects an estimated 75,000 beneficiaries who require a representative to manage their benefits because of a disabling mental disorder.

Republican lawmakers criticized the regulation for reinforcing a negative stereotype that people with a mental disorder are dangerous.

""There are people who need help and seek help, but that is not a criteria for taking away one's constitutional right"" to own a gun, said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.

After the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama directed the Justice Department to provide guidance to agencies regarding information they are obligated to report to the background check system. The Social Security Administration issued a final rule on Dec. 19 that spells out when the names of beneficiaries must be forwarded to the database that federally licensed gun dealers consult before selling a firearm.

In Newtown, 20 children and six educators were shot to death when a gunman entered the Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012. The gunman had earlier killed his mother inside their home, and he used a gun and ammunition that she had purchased.

Democrats said Republicans were doing the bidding of the National Rifle Association, which opposed the Social Security Administration's rule. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said his constituents have a right not to be victims of gun violence.

""They have a right to protect their loved ones who may use a weapon against themselves or their family members,"" McGovern said.

While gun rights groups have weighed in with opposition to the regulation, some advocates for the disabled have also said the regulation is discriminatory. The agency that advises the president and Congress on government policy, the National Council on Disability, said there is no connection between the inability to manage money and the ability to safely possess and use a firearm.

Republicans are employing a rarely-used tool to roll back some of the rules issued in the final months of Obama's tenure. The Congressional Review Act allows provides a temporary window for a simple majority of both chambers to invalidate the rule. Trump would also have to sign the resolution of disapproval for the regulation to be deemed invalid. What's more, the law prevents the executive branch from imposing substantially similar regulations in the future.

Among the top priorities for the GOP is to scuttle the rule to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. The Interior Department said in announcing the rule in December that it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests, preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby waters. The rule maintains a long-established 100-foot buffer zone that blocks coal mining near streams, but imposes stricter guidelines for exceptions to the 100-foot rule.

Interior officials said the rule would cause only modest job losses in coal country and could even create jobs as companies hire construction crews to haul and store debris.

Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., said repealing the stream protection rule would ""sicken and kill the very people Donald Trump falsely promised to help,"" coal miners in West Virginia and other states."

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, had commissioned the Government Accountability Office report to look into how online private dealers might be selling guns to people not allowed to have them.

Their efforts were based on a 2016 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which claimed that “anonymity of the internet makes it an ideal means for prohibited individuals to obtain illegal firearms.”

“Congressional requesters asked that GAO access the extent to which ATF is enforcing existing laws and investigate whether online private sellers sell firearms to people who are not allowed or eligible to possess a firearm,” the GAO report said.

Over the course of the two-and-a-half year investigation, agents tried to buy firearms illegally on the “Surface Web” and the “Dark Web,” generally by sharing their status as “prohibited individuals” or trying to buy across state lines.

But the GAO revealed that their 72 attempts outside of the dark web were all “unsuccessful.”

“Private sellers on Surface Web gun forums and in classified ads were unwilling to sell a firearm to our agents that self-identified as being prohibited from possessing a firearm,” the GAO reported, noting that in their “72 attempts ... 56 sellers refused to complete a transaction once we revealed that either the shipping address was across state lines or that we were prohibited by law from owning firearms.” In the other cases, the investigators' website was frozen or they encountered suspected scammers.

On the dark web, GAO agents successfully purchased two guns illegally, as the serial numbers on the weapons were “obliterated” and “shipped across state lines.” But in the attempt to purchase, the GAO agents “did not disclose any information indicating they were prohibited from possessing a firearm.”

Based on the findings of the study, the GAO said it is “not making recommendations in this report.”

Cummings, Warren and Schatz did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on the GAO’s findings.

The National Rifle Association seized on the report to claim that online sales are in fact regulated, calling the study an ""embarrassment"" for the gun control lobby.

“GAO’s findings showed nothing so much as that private sellers advertising online are knowledgeable about the law, conscientious, and self-policing,” The National Rifle Association said, adding that online gun sales are “subject to the same federal laws that apply to any other commercial or private gun sales.”

The NRA described the study as an attempt to model the findings of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s 2015 report, titled “Point, Click, Fire: An investigation of illegal online gun sales,” which found that 62 percent of private sellers were willing to proceed with a sale, even if the prospective purchaser could not pass a background check."
fox18,['Stacy Washington'],2017-06-29 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/06/29/most-americans-know-that-owning-gun-is-essential-part-our-freedom.html,"An overwhelming majority of Americans view gun ownership as essential to their freedom. This is what a recent Pew Research poll discovered in a deep dive into the complex relationship Americans have with guns.

According to the poll, “The nationally representative survey of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, was conducted March 13 to 27 and April 4 to 18, 2017, using the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel.” In other words, the survey is pretty comprehensive. And its findings reflect the understanding of many clear-thinking Americans on the 2nd Amendment: for those who do own and use firearms, it is integral to who they are.

Guns are ubiquitous in our culture. Both the bad guys and the heroes utilize them in movies and books, which accurately reflects reality – the bad guys will always have guns and good guys know that firearms are an effective tool for securing property and protecting loved ones. In other words, gun ownership is completely normal, and – contrary to what the gun grabbers and “security liberals” would have you believe – safe.

There is a direct correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and less crime. Urban areas have fewer lawfully obtained guns and higher levels of criminal activity. Socioeconomics are a driver, but the impact of burdensome laws on who can own and carry firearms in urban areas plays a distinct role in lowering safety levels for residents.

Only a third of Americans expressed that they do not nor would they ever consider owning a firearm. A healthy 66 percent of gun owners, a significant portion of whom own more than one, would never consider not owning one. These people exist in a culture where gun ownership is the norm. It would be interesting to see the minority of Americans who eschew guns react to the findings here.

The survey results show a clear relationship between the conscious choice to own a gun and the exercise of personal freedom. Other studies on crime and gun owners have found that gun owners commit fewer crimes as a population than the police. The civilizing factor of owning a firearm increases the level of responsibility that must be exercised. This positively impacts everyone in proximity to gun owners.

Of note: only 19 percent of those dwelling in urban environments, where crime is the highest, own guns. In rural areas where crime is exceedingly low, 46 percent of those surveyed reported owning a gun. Of suburban respondents, 28 percent own guns. To place a finer point on the data, in just one out of five homes in an urban environment will an intruder face the possibility of a homeowner defending his home and loved ones with a gun. In a rural area an invader faces a nearly 50/50 chance, hence the miniscule incidences of criminal activity.

Another point worth noting is that while most gun owners could never see themselves not owning a gun, they have no desire to force others to possess them. Conversely, many Americans who do not own firearms have an almost compulsive desire to disarm law-abiding gun owners even as proof mounts against the efficacy of confiscation and disarmament. When guns are regulated away from those who seek them lawfully, only the criminals are armed.

Americans’ broad exposure to guns includes an overwhelming number who have fired a gun or have lived in a home with a gun owner. Approximately seven out of ten Americans have fired a weapon at least once.

Again, guns are tools and Americans have experienced their use as normal. The research done by Pew exposes the lesser-known facts surrounding firearm ownership and America’s relationship with guns. One thing is patently clear: guns aren’t going anywhere because Americans who own guns associate them with liberty and self-reliance. And that’s a good thing.

The Second Amendment spat began in 2013, when Gov. Bill Haslam signed into law the controversial “Guns in Parking Lots"" bill.

“No employer shall discharge or take any adverse employment action against an employee solely for transporting or storing a firearm or firearms ammunition in an employer parking area,” reads an amended version of the bill, signed into law earlier this month by Haslam, a Republican.

“The employer cannot [fire you] simply because you have a permit or a gun in your car.” - Tennessee Rep. Mike Carter

An estimated 500,000 residents of Tennessee have permits to carry guns, and in a state where hunting is popular, having guns secured inside a car is not uncommon. While employers usually would not know if cars in their parking lots contained firearms, there are ways it could be brought to their attention, according to University of Tennessee Law Professor Dwight Aarons.

“Maybe there’s a broken window in the car, or a drug sweep or somebody being careless where someone is talking too much, saying they have a gun in their car -- there are a thousand other different ways,” Aarons told FoxNews.com.

The amended bill had overwhelming support in Nashville’s GOP-dominated Statehouse, but was opposed by a coalition of groups that included Democrats, gun control advocates and the state Chamber of Commerce.

“It’s outrageous,” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart, who told FoxNews.com businesses are now forced to allow people with weapons on their private property. “What’s next? Are we going to have a law that forces a family to let an armed person into their living room? Where does it stop?”

The law’s sponsors initially thought employees were protected, but then-Attorney General Robert Cooper, a Democrat, issued an opinion months after its passage that the law did not prevent employers from firing workers who brought guns to the job site.

Vice President of the State’s Chamber of Commerce Bradley Jackson said his group opposes the law because it sends a bad message to employers.

“It violates our personal property rights and tramples all over it,” said Jackson. “It’s going to be costly to defend in court,” adding the law also compromises business’ ability to maintain a safe workplace.

State Rep. Curry Todd, the Republican who sponsored the bill in the legislature’s lower chamber, said the new version clears up legal confusion. But fellow lawmakers were quick to say it can’t be used as a defense for employers fired with other justification.

“The employer cannot [fire you] simply because you have a permit or a gun in your car,” Republican State Rep. Mike Carter told The Tennessean. “But if you sue alleging that, you have to prove that was the sole reason you were terminated. If you were late to work and terminated, no dice,” said Carter.

Nearly 20 states have adopted laws that ban employers, including school districts in many cases, from restricting guns in their parking lots, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

New York lawmakers passed the SAFE Act last year, and announced with fanfare that it effectively banned the sale of “assault weapons.” But AR-15s, the most popular type of guns often referred to as assault weapons, are sold in Empire State gun shops, freely and legally. The gun is being marketed by Stag Arms as a ""New York-compliant AR-15,"" and features a slightly modified stock and no bells and whistles. The gun does not have a pistol grip, for instance - one of the features banned by the act.

""This just shows that the gun prohibition lobby uses symbolic gestures over substance to push their anti-gun rights agenda. Banning guns based on cosmetic features proves that point,"" Alan Gottlieb, president of the Second Amendment Foundation, told FoxNews.com.

[pullquote]

Gun-rights supporters say it illustrates that so-called “assault weapons” – an often-used term with no single definition – are usually no more dangerous than hunting rifles. The ""AR"" in AR-15 does not stand for ""assault rifle,"" as commonly believed, but for ""Armalite Rifle.""

In New York, an assault weapon is defined as any semi-automatic rifle that accepts a magazine and has any of a list of ten features, ranging from a pistol-like grip to a flash suppressor to a bayonet mount.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center – all groups that support more gun control – declined to comment or did not answer questions from FoxNews.com about the effectiveness of assault-weapons bans.

The New York Attorney General’s office referred questions to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office, which did not respond.

Cuomo’s website boasts that the state has “the toughest assault weapons ban in the country” and that “under the legislation, the Bushmaster used in the Newtown, Conn., shooting will be illegal.”

Gottlieb said that may be well-intentioned but is ineffective at best.

“Some of the guns they’re banning are the safest guns,"" he said. ""There aren’t many accidents committed with Bushmaster rifles, and there are a number of times that so-called assault rifles have been used in self defense.”

Some gun dealers in New York State say they are glad to be selling AR-15s again.

“Believe it or not, if I had a hundred of things to sell, they’d already be gone. I’m hoping to have them in my shop in the next two weeks,” Justin Reickart, who runs H&H Guns in southwestern New York, told FoxNews.com.

“We’ve already showed it to about a dozen people, just a picture of what it's going to be, and the younger generation – they already love it. They’re like, it’s same gun, just with a sci-fi looking stock. The suggested retail price is going to be $1,050. Prior to the ban, you would have been able to buy the gun for $949 – so it adds $100, to make it New York compliant.”

Asked why people want AR-15s, Reickart said they are simply good guns.

“It’s a universal gun that you can put in anybody’s hands… I’ve used it for coyote hunting, deer hunting... it’s a fun and enjoyable gun to shoot,” he said.

Reickart got attention last year when he developed his own AR-15 which he believed complied with New York law – but he decided not to actually sell the gun because the State Attorney General would not give written confirmation that it followed state law.

For New York gun owners with existing non-compliant AR-15s, they either have to register their gun with the state by April 15 or modify it to comply with the law.

Some gun owners are hesitant to register their guns, some for fear that the list would later be used for gun confiscation as just recently happened in New York City.

To avoid that, some owners of old AR-15s are modifying them so that they no longer classify as “assault weapons.” One company, S&B Products, offers a “spur” to replace the pistol grip.

“The New York State Police have told us that by removing all of the prohibited design characteristics the rifle is no longer considered an ""assault weapon"" and is therefore not subject to the registration requirement,” Steve Byron, President of S&B Products, told FoxNews.com.

Byron said he thought the triviality of the modifications shows that the law is not productive.

“I believe politicians should not write and pass laws about something they know nothing about,” he said.

The candidate, Austin Petersen, published an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on his campaign website on Thursday and argued his situation was part of a larger trend of unfairness towards conservatives.

“It’s difficult to ignore that this action comes during a period of heightened tension regarding Facebook’s role in our elections, and its perceived bias against conservative voices,” Petersen wrote.

In his letter, Petersen said he has made Facebook a centerpiece of his campaign’s outreach efforts.

“That’s why, on September 22, I was so shocked to receive a notification from Facebook informing me that I had been ‘blocked’ from using Facebook for thirty days because I ‘recently posted something that violates Facebook’s policies,’” he wrote.

Petersen said a Facebook Live video he posted to his campaign’s page promoting the AR-15 giveaway for supporters was removed. He also said a status update posted to his profile referencing the giveaway was also removed.

“I’m confident that such giveaways are consistent with Facebook’s policies...so it’s unclear to me why such content would warrant an immediate takedown and thirty-day ban,” he said.

A spokesman for Facebook did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News.

But Facebook’s “community standards” website says the trade of firearms is prohibited on the site.

“The purchase, sale or trade of firearms, ammunition and explosives between private individuals isn't allowed on Facebook,” it says.

Petersen said in the letter that he reached out to Facebook for more information, but he has not yet received an explanation and the block remains in effect.

He also wrote in the letter that Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has contributed money to Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill – something he says “does not inspire confidence in Facebook’s neutrality.”

Donor records indicate Sandberg donated $5,400 to McCaskill in January.

It’s common for campaigns to create petitions as a way to collect names and contact information of potential supporters. Petersen’s giveaway requires people to sign a petition on his website to be entered to into a raffle for the rifle.

“Austin Petersen will always be a strong ally of the Second Amendment, and we know you will be too,” the site says. “That's why, when you add your name to this petition and stand up to defend the Second Amendment, we'll add your name into a raffle to win an AR-15! Yes, it really is that simple; no strings attached.”

Petersen’s fight with Facebook comes as President Trump has argued the site is biased against him.

BIG TECH TITANS SUMMONED TO CAPITOL HILL

“Facebook was always anti-Trump,” the president tweeted Wednesday, amid recent questions about how the site was used by the Russians to try to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Facebook’s announced earlier this month that it had uncovered $100,000 worth of fraudulent ad spending across its network tied to the presidential race.

Along with Twitter and Google, Facebook has been invited by lawmakers to testify on Capitol Hill as Congress ramps up scrutiny of Russia’s meddling.

fox23,['Diane Macedo'],2010-05-06 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/06/exclusive-toy-gun-sold-easily-turned-real-thing.html,"Felons, illegal immigrants and all others banned from buying a gun in the United States have a new alternative if they’re looking to get their hands on a firearm: Just buy a toy.

A FoxNews.com investigation reveals that a popular recreational pellet gun can be converted easily to a real semi-automatic weapon. And while the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is already aware of the issue, these “toys” -- new, top-of-the-line airsoft rifles -- continue to be sold throughout the country.

Like paintball without the paint, the propane-powered airsoft guns are designed to shoot quarter-inch plastic pellets and are generally used for recreation or in military and law enforcement training.

When the ATF seized a shipment of 30 of these guns in October from a port in Tacoma, Wash., it said they could be “readily convertible” to machine guns. But gun experts called that claim absurd and said the ATF was overstepping its bounds.

Now one of those critics is reversing his position, saying at least one airsoft manufacturer has taken the quest to be authentic a little too far.

“The airsoft can be converted to an AR-15,” firearms manufacturer Leo Gonnuscio told FoxNews.com after testing the make and model of airsoft guns seized by the ATF.

Having concluded that several other airsoft guns could not be converted to fire real ammunition, Gonnuscio said he was surprised to find that he was able to to transform this particular gun to the real thing -- and with “minimal work,” because its bottom half, or “receiver,” is so similar to an AR-15's.

To make the airsoft receiver function just like an AR-15’s, Gonnuscio said, “All you have to do is drill one hole.”

And once that's out of the way, the rest is even easier. The AR-15 receiver is the only part of the semi-automatic rifle that is given a serial number, and is the only part that is regulated. All the remaining parts of the real thing can be purchased by anyone – any kid, criminal or terrorist.

The cost of buying the Taiwan-made airsoft gun and all the parts needed to convert it to an AR-15 comes to roughly $1,100 -- more than the cost of some real AR-15s. But someone who can’t clear a background check or has been refused a gun for any other reason could use this method to make his own lethal weapon, Gonnuscio said.

Making it into a machine gun, he said, would require yet another conversion, and the makeshift gun would likely be able to fire only 15-20 rounds before it stopped working due to the pressure it would have to withstand while firing in an automatic fashion.

But as semi-automatic weapon, Gonnuscio said, “It may not last forever, but they’ve got a gun to get the job done that they were assigned to do, and nobody knows the wiser.”

The ATF has made no reported moves to regulate or seize any more of the airsoft guns, which continue to be sold in stores around the country, and it appears to be bowing to critics and reconsidering its stance on the guns' convertibility.

“We’re having to take a serious look at this, so it’s just something that we’re reviewing, and I’m hoping we’ll have some information that we can make available to the public certainly very soon,” ATF spokesman Drew Wade told FoxNews.com.

But firearms expert Len Savage said the ATF is taking a “serious look” at the wrong issue -- or, more specifically, the wrong part of the gun.

The reason it’s possible to make these airsoft receivers function as real receivers is that all an AR-15 receiver does is hold the gun together, Savage said. So with enough gun knowledge, almost anything can be made into a receiver.

“There’s a line of AR-15 firearms out there where the lower (the receiver) is made entirely of injection molded plastic … It could be made of cardboard and scotch tape,” he said.

The most important part of an AR-15, and the most difficult part to replicate, he said, is the upper half of the gun -- which is unmarked, unregulated and readily available for purchase.

""The ATF is regulating the wrong part as a firearm receiver, not the part that goes bang,"" Savage said.

“The upper is what contains the barrel, the breech or bolt, that’s what contains all the pressure,” he added.

The reason the lower half of the AR-15 is the part with the serial number, and thus classified as the receiver, is that when the gun was created it was up to the manufacturer to choose the location of the gun’s serial number, he said. Because the bottom of the gun has a flat surface, it was the easiest to mark.

And though federal law has since defined a gun’s receiver as the part “which provides housing for the hammer, bolt, breechblock and firing mechanism,” Savage says the bureau has continued to mark and regulate the lower part of the AR-15 to avoid confusion.

“In the stream of commerce, you’d have uppers that were marked and regulated and then lowers that were marked and regulated, you could see the confusion on a dealer basis” in determining which parts require licensing and which don’t, Savage said.

But even though the upper half of the gun can be bought by anyone, Gonnuscio still says that banning the airsoft receivers and implementing a few new rules for airsoft manufacturers could be a good start to keeping unregulated AR-15s off the street.

“I would hope that the ATF applies pressure to the manufacturers of these airsoft guns to redesign them so they cannot be converted,"" he said. ""Make them move the pin holes ... so that an upper can’t be attached to it without major machining.

""Fill in some of that gap so that they would literally have to chuck this thing up in a mill and totally reconfigure it to work. Tighten up the magazine well so a regular magazine won’t fit in it.”

And because the U.S. is such a big market for these airsoft guns, Gonnuscio said, a foreign manufacture would change the product if its current design were banned here.

“There are tons of good uses for these guns: We use them for training, kids do reenacting with them, kids get out there and play just like the old days. We played BB gun wars when we were kids and we survived. These are little plastic balls that are shot by electricity or propane.

""So let them have their toys. Just make sure they're still toys.”"

""We live in a violent society, even here in Maricopa County, and across our nation, and the least we can do is to arm our deputies…,” Arpaio said, according to Fox 10 News.

Before the shootings happened, Republican state Rep. Andy Holt had offered the AR-15 as a door prize at a fundraiser scheduled for later this month. When he was heavily criticized following Sunday's shootings, he said he would give away a second one as well.

""In response to people saying I shouldn't do this: No, actually we should — and we should celebrate it,"" Holt said in a telephone interview. ""Not in response to what happened in Orlando by all means, but in response to the bans that have been called for.""

Holt, a hog farmer from northwestern Tennessee, was the sponsor of a new law this year to allow faculty and staff at public colleges and universities to be armed on campus. He said that more armed people inside the Orlando club could have intervened before so many people were killed by the gunman.

State Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini in a release on Monday called Holt a reckless gun owner.

""Responsible gun owners don't put guns in the hands of strangers,"" she said. ""Andy Holt doesn't know if he's putting the winning raffle ticket in the hands of the next mass shooter.""

Holt dismissed Mancini's comments as misguided, saying that he plans to do all background checks required by law. He also argued that specific weapons shouldn't be targeted for bans.

""It doesn't matter what the physical characteristics of the gun are,"" he said. ""What matters is that in the hands of an unlawful, crazed individual, a person who is motivated by hate, any instrument can be used as a weapon of destruction.""

Holt said his office was contacted repeatedly by an anonymous caller who said he was armed and threatened to pay him a visit. He said he had forwarded the recorded calls to the Tennessee Highway Patrol's Capitol security unit because the threats were made to a staffer.

Holt said it has become a ""fairly regular occurrence"" for him to receive threatening emails, text messages and phone calls to his home. None has resulted in a personal confrontation.

Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency officer Andrew Ward went to Outback Steakhouse to have dinner with his wife Friday evening, he wrote in a public Facebook post.

Ward said in the post that a manager approached him and requested that he put his gun in his truck. Ward told the manager that he could not because he was in uniform and had to have his weapon on his person.

The manager left to make a call, Ward writes, and then returned to ask Ward and his wife to leave because Outback is a “gun free zone.”

Ward noted that he does not “blame the manager,” but was angered by the treatment an armed “uniformed Law Enforcement Officer who is sworn to protect and serve the public” received.

Since Ward posted the incident on Facebook, he said a representative for Outback contacted him and apologized for what they called a mistake.

In a statement to NewsChannel9, the Director of Media and Community Relations for Outback’s parents company, Bloomin Brands, said:

“We’ve always allowed uniformed law enforcement officers to carry their side arms inside our restaurants. A manager made a mistake and we have discussed this with her. We have contacted the guest personally and apologized.""

Ward said the chain told him “there was another customer that was ‘scared for her life’ who was seated across” from the couple, and said “she was afraid because ‘police are shooting people.’”

According to Ward’s post, “This customer went on to demand to be escorted to her vehicle out of fear of being shot.”

On Facebook alone, Ward’s story has been shared over 200,000 times and has over 150,000 reactions on Facebook with many calling the actions of the restaurant ""unbelievable.""

Ward continues not to blame the manager for her actions.

On Saturday, Ward told NewsChannel9 that he considers the incident to be over.

“I have spoken with the manger involved, the regional manager and the Vice President of operations for Outback today. They have apologized profusely and I have accepted their apology and the issue in my opinion has been concluded.”

Outback Steakhouse also sent the couple a $100 gift certificate for the ordeal."

Kim Jong Un’s military has been collecting large stockpiles of nerve agents, such as sarin and VX, that could target U.S. military bases in the region and large cities like Seoul and Tokyo, according to a new report.

“Nuclear weapons are not the only threat,” Kelsey Davenport, director of non-proliferation policy for the Arms Control Association told the McClatchy Washington Bureau. “North Korea could respond to a U.S. attack using chemical weapons. That would be devastating.”

While Pyongyang officials deny the rogue regime possesses chemical weapons, the country began developing chemical weapons in 1961 amid rising tensions at that time.

The Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology reports the country has four military bases equipped with chemical weapons and at least 11 facilities where they are produced and stored.

Davenport said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to neutralize North Korea’s chemical weapon stockpile with a preventive strike.

“Compared to the nuclear threat, which involves, a finite number of warheads and delivery systems vulnerable to air defenses and antimissile systems, the chemical threat is not as easily negated,” military analyst Reid Kirby wrote in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.

The report on Pyongyang’s chemical arsenal comes amid rising tensions with the U.S., a conflict which saw an apparent de-escalation this week after North Korean media reported Kim Jong Un had delayed a decision about whether to follow through with his threat to fire missiles toward Guam, a U.S. territory.

President Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday the dictator made a “wise decision” to back down from his threats.

“The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!” Trump wrote.

U.S. military officials have not commented on North Korea’s chemical weapons arsenal.

VX and sarin are two potent nerve agents, which attack the nervous system. Both are banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, but several countries maintain stockpiles.

Trump accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons on its citizens earlier this year, an attack that killed at least 74 people.

“There is legitimate concerns that sustained use of chemical weapons in Syria has lowered the threshold for their use elsewhere,” Davenport said."

After announcing Russia had developed new nuclear weapons, President Vladimir Putin on Thursday invited the nation to offer names for some of them — apparently not worried by Britain's red-faced experience doing the same thing.

In 2016, the most popular choice in an online competition to name a British polar survey vessel was Boaty McBoatface. That ship was eventually christened the Sir David Attenborough in honor of the naturalist, but the goofy moniker became the name of one of the country's remotely operated submarines.

The weapons for which Putin is soliciting names aren't anything to laugh about.

One is a nuclear-powered underwater drone capable of sneaking close to the shore unnoticed and blasting coastal areas away with a powerful nuclear explosion. Another is an atomic-powered cruise missile carrying a nuclear warhead that can fly around the globe and perform sharp maneuvers to dodge enemy defenses.

Just a couple of hours after Putin's speech, the Defense Ministry opened the online name contest.

Since Soviet times, Russia has had a tradition of giving innocuous names to some of the deadliest weapons in the nation's arsenal.

The sea-launched, nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles were named with the Russian words for Liner and Azure. The Tu-160 nuclear-capable strategic bomber was called White Swan.

And the list of names of Russian artillery cannons sounds like a blossoming garden, including the heavy Peony, Hyacinth and Carnation howitzers.

Some of the names in the Russian arsenal also appeared to have a streak of cynical humor, like the Sun Heat rocket launcher that reduces broad areas to scorched desert."
fox35,['Harry J. Kazianis'],2017-08-27 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/08/27/north-korea-likely-tested-weapon-that-could-start-second-korean-war.html,"Question: Why didn’t President Bill Clinton in 1994—when the North Korean nuclear menace was still in its infancy—destroy Pyongyang’s atomic program before it would transform into the existential threat it is today?

Simple. He risked the possibility that the Kim family would, at the very least, rain down a barrage of massive artillery and rocket fire on the capitol of South Korea, Seoul, just some 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone.

As one senior Clinton official told me some months ago: “We just couldn’t take that risk.”

And this weekend’s test of three successful weapons remind us yet again that Pyongyang doesn’t need to fire nuclear missiles at targets in Asia or strike the U.S. homeland to kill scores of people—its conventional weapons can do enough damage all on their own.

In the event of a Second Korean War, North Korea could very well open its assault with such conventional weapons targeting downtown Seoul, home to 25 million people.

So much for the restraint the Trump Administration was commending Pyongyang for just a few days ago.

Indeed, in the event of a Second Korean War—or a continuation of the first, as we must remember, the First Korean War never ended with a treaty but a mere armistice—North Korea could very well open its assault with such weapons targeting downtown Seoul, home to 25 million people in that metro area alone.

Stop and think about it for a second. Kim Jong Un, seems to be reminding us again and again of his capabilities—one at a time.

Over the course of this year alone, Kim has been testing—and showing off—his ability to not only attack with short-, medium- and long-range missiles, but also killing off his half-brother with chemical weapons.

But Friday night Kim seemed to want to make a statement that he can strike with weapons we almost always forget about, with reports claiming that North Korea tested what is referred to as MLRS, or a multiple rocket launcher system, with a range that could put a large portion of South Korea under threat of attack.

Such systems are nothing new and not exactly a novel concept. What is concerning, however, is that the system that was potentially tested, according to reports in South Korean media, was one of North Korea’s more advanced missile systems, a 300-mm artillery rocket launching platform, commonly referred to as the KN-09.

The system, per the Center for Strategic and International Studies, has a range of 190km, carrying a total of eight rockets in two pods of four launchers. These deadly weapons sit on a mobile truck, making them mobile and harder to destroy in a conflict.

The danger of such weapons is obvious: such a platform might just be the ultimate terror weapon.

Consider this: With little or no warning, and if used in combination with more classic artillery platforms, these weapons could do tremendous damage to not only South Korean cities but also incite a mass panic the likes of which has not been seen in decades.

Imagine in Seoul large skyscrapers collapsing thanks to MLRS fired in a surprise attack with millions of people heading for safety. Roads, bridges, and highways would be clogged for miles. Social media worldwide would be filled with images of what looks like 9/11—but far worse than you can possibly imagine.

Now to be fair, such weapons would not last long in a conflict with South Korea and America, and indeed, Kim’s army is no match for Allied forces on the peninsula as it is old and clearly obsolete.

However, as the saying goes, quantity is a quality all its own. And the North Korean military is large—it has over 1 million men under arms, 4,300 tanks, potentially as much as 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and as many as 60 nuclear weapons. In wargame after wargame I have been a part of over the years, millions of people could be killed in a conflict with North Korea—as many as 8 million or more in one simulation I was part of.

Clearly the Trump Administration must redouble its efforts to contain North Korea as much as possible, as Kim Jong Un will no doubt to continue to show off his growing military might. He is also likely trying to sprint towards even more deadly nuclear and missile technologies—pictures coming out of the hermit kingdom last week seem to make that point crystal clear.

In fact, in the coming weeks, we will likely see Kim test another nuclear weapon or ICBM, potentially as early as September 9th, on North Korea’s founding day—the last time Pyongyang tested a nuclear device.

But no matter what Kim does next, he will continue to reinforce his ultimate point—to show that he can reach out and kill someone—lots of someones.

And we need to take that very seriously."
fox36,['Joseph Weber'],2018-02-24 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/24/could-veterans-be-democrats-secret-midterm-weapon.html,"Washington Democrats and their supporters have recruited and backed dozens of military veterans to run in this year’s elections -- even sending some into deep-red districts to challenge the Republican Party for the so-called “guns-and-God” vote and to achieve the party’s ultimate mission of taking control of the House.

“Veterans are especially appealing candidates in key swing districts,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, who served four tours in Iraq and has been leading such efforts, told Fox News. “Veterans have credibility, not just with Democrats, but with independents and Republicans, as well. They’re the kind of people respected for their leadership, not just their politics.”

Moulton has endorsed 19 military veterans in this year’s House races and plans to back a total of 24 -- the exact number of seats Democrats must win to retake control of the House, with primary races starting in just a few months.

Republican have, at least in elections in the past several decades, largely won the military vote, including the 2016 White House race in which Republican Donald Trump took 60 percent of the vote, according to exit polls.

However, Democrats see opportunity this year in what they consider the president’s lack of respect for the military -- including his offhanded remark about Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain being captured in Vietnam and the Trump's public spat with a Gold Star military family.

Moulton, a two-term congressman and Harvard graduate, has at times been critical of Trump, even calling him “draft dodger.” (Trump received a series of student deferments while in college and a medical deferment after graduation, according to Selective Service records.)

But he’s also been outspoken about Washington Democrats and their continued anti-Trump platform, instead touting a pro-jobs message and cultivating what he calls “the next generation of Democrats,” including military veterans.

VoteVets.org, a liberal-leaning political action committee, is backing 36 Democratic military veterans in this year’s congressional races -- three sitting senators and 33 House incumbents or challengers.

The group was founded in 2006 to help veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and who were opposed to the Iraq War, get elected to Congress.

Four of the group’s roughly 46 veteran candidates that year won their congressional race, enough to help Democrats retake the House.

But the group has higher expectations this year, largely because of the “tremendous amount of anti-Trump sentiment” and Democrats being “shut out of everything” from the White House to Congress to statehouses across the country, says Jon Soltz, VoteVets chairman and co-founder.

He also maintains that 2018 candidates are in a better position to win than those in previous years -- considering what they’ve done since leaving the military, and because they have a more solid “infrastructure” of successful Democratic veterans in Congress.

Among the names he mentioned were Moulton, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who in fact lost in 2006, when she first ran for a House seat.

“There’s big difference now,” said Soltz, who points to candidates like Christina Houlahan, a former Air Force officer and nonprofit CEO with degrees from Stanford, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania.

“There’s a broader definition of service,” Soltz continued. “Candidates are much more professional.”

Houlahan is running in the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 6th Congressional District, a suburban Philadelphia seat occupied by GOP incumbent Rep. Ryan Costello. He won re-election in 2016 by 14 percentage points. But Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton essentially tied in the district.

Still, Democrats' efforts to run top-tier veteran candidates to help win back white middle-class voters who went for Trump will be stiff challenge.

The two-year budget deal recently passed by Congress had bipartisan support but was led by Republicans in the GOP-controlled Congress who successfully argued the increased spending in the $400 billion agreement was needed to keep the U.S. military from deteriorating under austere spending caps.

“Our government has no higher responsibility than to support our men and women who are in harm’s way,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said about the measure, which raised the cap on military spending by roughly $160 billion.

In addition, the tax cuts signed last year by Trump, after being passed in Congress without a single Democratic vote, is also presenting a challenge to Democrats, who once appeared poised to have a wave election.

Two recent polls show Democrats losing double-digits leads in so-called “generic” polls that ask potential voters which party they prefer in congressional races, even though history shows the party that doesn’t control the White House historically picks up about 30 seats in a midterm.

The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, whose mission is to help Republicans get elected and reelected to the House, did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the NRCC’s counterpart, told Fox News on Friday that is has more than 40 military veteran candidates in midterm races.

“We’re excited by the incredible candidates with records of service to their nation that have stepped up to run for office this cycle,” said DCCC spokesman Tyler Law. “There’s no doubt that veterans have unique qualifications and experiences that give them important credibility with Democrats, Independents, and Republican voters alike.”

The first real test could come in just a few weeks -- in western Pennsylvania where Democratic nominee Conor Lamb, a federal prosecutor and ex-Marine with an Ivy League law degree, is competing for an open seat against Republican nominee Rick Saccone, a state lawmaker and Air Force veteran.

Trump won the district by nearly 20 points. Lamb is keeping the race close, trailing by about 3 percentage points with voting for the special election on March 13.

Lamb continues to argue that the tax cuts are more of a gift to corporations than to the middle class and that they could have been enacted without increasing the federal debt.

The 33-year-old candidate has also tried to distance himself from the Washington establishment, particularly House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has said the employee bonuses related to the tax cuts amount to “crumbs.”

Meanwhile, Washington Republicans and their political action groups are reportedly spending millions on TV and digital ads to protect the seat.

“Everyone (except Lamb) must be seeing the latest round of polling that shows public support way up for the Republican tax cuts,” the RNC said last week.

In addition, Vice President Pence has stumped in the district for Saccone, and Trump plans to visit before Election Day.

The DCCC seems noncommittal about whether it will continue to put money into the race.

“We’ll continue to monitor that election day by day,” group chairman Rep. Ben Ray Lujan recently said. “But make no mistake, Conor will have the resources he needs to compete.”

Still, his statement is not being viewed as a sign of defeat.

Moulton and others last summer blasted establishment Democrats for investing so much in their failed effort to win a special election congressional race in the Atlanta suburbs, which likely has them trying to avoid the same mistake, as outside groups continue to help Lamb.

Among the other highly touted Democratic military veteran candidates this year are Navy veteran Gil Cisneros, running for the House seat in Southern California now left open by retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce, and Mikie Sherrill, a Naval Academy graduate and former helicopter pilot competing for the House seat left open by retiring GOP Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee

“She just scared him out the race because she’s just an incredible leader,” Moulton recent said on NBC’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”

At the beginning of the 115th Congress, 102 members were either serving or had served in the military. That number was one more than at the beginning of the 114th Congress but six fewer than at the beginning of the 113th Congress. The House has 79 veterans and the Senate has 19, according to information from the Congressional Research Service to Fox News."

On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the U.S. is considering the closure of its embassy in the Cuban capital following a spate of unexplained incidents that have left American diplomats injured.

Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, the Associated Press has reported.

SONIC WEAPONS REPORTED IN CUBA: COULD SOUND BE HARNESSED IN AN ATTACK?

Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential ""sonic attack."" Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms.

The U.S. hasn't identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn't ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba's security services might be involved.

The strange incidents continue to puzzle scientists. There has been speculation that infrasound (a low frequency sound below the human hearing range) or ultrasound (above 20 KHz and can not be heard by humans), may have been harnessed in the attacks.

SOUND WEAPONS THAT DELIVER INVISIBLE AMMO IN SPOTLIGHT AFTER AMERICAN DIPLOMATS INJURED

“Ultimately, devices working in either spectrum could cause hearing damage but it is unlikely to be infrasonic given the size of the speaker required to produce the requisite frequency and decibel level,” explained Dr. Toby Heys, leader of Manchester Metropolitan University’s Future Technologies research centre, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “Infrasound is also very difficult/next to impossible to direct, within current technological dictates.”

""There's no efficient way to focus infrasound to make it into a usable weapon,"" said Mario Svirsky, an expert on ear disorders and neuroscience at New York University School of Medicine.

Heys added that ultrasound could be directed at a target’s head, but would require extremely precise targeting within a building’s infrastructure.

SONIC WEAPON KNOCKS DRONES RIGHT OUT OF THE SKY

Experts say that it is also difficult to explain the concussions experienced by some of the victims of the attacks. Usually, those follow a blow to the head or proximity to something like a bomb blast.

“The frequency-based trauma in question would have to be very severe to cause this,” explained Heys. “There is a history of brain injury and hearing loss that stretches back to WW1 when soldiers had to endure not only the intense and massive sounds of conflict for extended periods of time but also the shock waves produced by large artillery.”

The academic cited a French study in 1918 that concluded, that, when exposed to intense noise over a prolonged period of time, the skull does not particularly protect the brain. “The difference of course here is that this is audible sound, whereas the frequencies in question in Cuba are supposedly ‘non-audible’, which makes it more difficult to explain as a phenomenon,” he added.

KIM JONG NAM'S SON APPARENTLY SHOWS HIS FACE FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DAD'S MURDER

The attempted sale, documented in a U.N. report this month, has sparked new concern in the Trump administration, Congress and the U.N. about the proliferation threat posed by Pyongyang's growing nuclear- and ballistic-missile programs, congressional officials and nuclear-weapons experts said.

""The U.N. Panel of Expert's report on North Korea provides further evidence that North Korea will stop at nothing to advance its illicit nuclear and missile programs,"" said Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.) who wrote a new sanctions bill against North Korea last year.

NORTH KOREA COULD HALT NUKE PROGRAM IF SOUTH KOREA, PENTAGON STOP MILITARY DRILLS, CHINA CLAIMS

North Korea's production of the enriched lithium, known as lithium-6, is also seen by nuclear experts as evidence of the country's accelerated efforts to miniaturize a nuclear warhead, potentially for use on ballistic missiles.

Lithium-6 can be used to produce tritium, which is used to flood neutrons into a nuclear device and magnify the explosive power of nuclear detonations, allowing countries to build bombs with smaller amounts of plutonium or uranium, nuclear experts said.

These smaller devices can be affixed to intercontinental ballistic missiles.

""Lithium-6 is ideal, not only for making tritium for boosting fission devices, but also for directly fueling advanced weapons—including thermonuclear bombs,"" said Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon official who heads the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, a Washington think tank.

Lithium also has nonmilitary applications, particularly in producing batteries, lubricants and medicines, nuclear experts said. North Korea is believed to have significant natural deposits of the metal in its soil.

The number of reported attacks using corrosive liquids rose from 261 in 2015 to 454 in 2016, London police said. Some appeared to be related to gang activity or the theft of cars and motorbikes.

Most notably, in April, two people were left partially blinded after acid was sprayed at a crowded east London nightclub. A man has been charged and is awaiting trial.

Other similar high-profile attacks include a 25-year-old man accused of throwing acid at an aspiring model and her cousin as they sat in their car.

In August, an 18-year-old girl was recently given jail time for pouring drain cleaner into a fellow student's viola case in a revenge attack that has left the victim scarred for life.

The use of acid in attacks has even spread to children as young as 12 who have been arming themselves with substances ""for self-defense.""

Heat Street reported in April that students are using acid because it’s much easier to conceal than a knife, with some even placing the liquid in a water bottle. Gang culture has been blamed for the spike in schools.

“A lot of people ain’t got the heart to stab people,” a student told The Sun. “It’s just easier to squirt someone.”

In February, a student was arrested for an attack that left two teenagers and a man scalded after they were splashed with acid during a soccer match in east London.

London police chief Cressida Dick said officers were concerned by the increase in the ""completely barbaric"" attacks.

""We will arrest people, we will enforce the law as we can, and we are working very closely with the (government) to try to see if there is any changes in the law required,"" she told LBC radio.

The spike in attacks has prompted some lawmakers to call for restrictions on the sale and carrying of corrosive liquids such as sulfuric acid.

James Eric Davis, 19, was apprehended just after midnight Saturday, an officer with Mount Pleasant Public Safety told Detroit's Fox 2.

No details were immediately available about where or how Davis was arrested, but the city of Mount Pleasant, Mich., tweeted about the arrest.

Authorities said the student was wanted for fatally shooting his father James Eric Davis Sr., 48, and mother Diva, 47 earlier Friday.

For hours the campus went into lockdown mode while a manhunt involving local and state police also included help from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Mount Pleasant officials said Davis Jr. opened fire inside Campbell Hall at Central Michigan University around 8:30 a.m.

Police described the shooting as a “family-type domestic issue.” The university confirmed that the shooting victims were Davis' parents.

The elder Davis was a part-time police officer in Bellwood, Ill., Bellwood police Chief Jiminez Allen told Detroit's Fox 2.

Vice President Mike Pence commented on the slayings during a stop in Detroit, the Detroit Free Press reported.

""Our hearts go out to the fallen and especially local, state and federal agencies who are working on the apprehension and the investigation,"" Pence said. ""We have to act and we will. We’ve got a lot of work to do. This president and this administration will not rest until we make our schools safe.""

Lt. Larry Klaus said surveillance video suggests that Davis fled on foot after the shooting.

The suspect is from Plainfield, Ill., and graduated high school in 2016, according to spokesman Tom Hernandez of the Plainfield School District.

Illinois state Rep. Emanuel Chris Welch confirmed the deaths on Twitter, calling it ""a sad day in Bellwood."" He said the shooting ""strikes close to home.""

""My sincerest condolences go out to the family of Bellwood Police Officer James Davis Sr. and his wife who were shot and killed this morning,"" he continued. ""May they RIP.""

According to Davis' Twitter page, he was a sophomore at Central Michigan University, slated to graduate in 2020.

Officials described Davis as being approximately 5 feet, 9 inches tall. He was last seen wearing yellow-colored jeans and a blue hoodie with a weapon tucked in his belt. Officials said he may have shed certain clothes while on the run.

Klaus said Davis was taken to a local hospital Thursday night with a drug-related injury, possibly an overdose, but would not elaborate.

Central Michigan University went on lockdown after students and faculty were sent emergency alerts around 9 a.m. Friday.

Halie Byron, 20, said she locked herself in her off-campus house, about a 10-minute walk from Campbell Hall. She had planned to run errands before traveling home to the Detroit area.

""It's scary thinking about how easy a shooter can come into a college campus anywhere — a classroom, a library. There's so much easy access,"" Byron said.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said he has been in contact with local police to ""determine what has occurred at Central Michigan University.""

""The priority right now is the safety of those still on campus and I thank all first responders involved for their swift action,"" he continued in a tweet.

U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said he was “deeply saddened” by another “tragic incident of gun violence.”

“I am heartbroken for the victims and praying for the safety of Mount Pleasant and @CMUniversity community as first responders work to apprehend the shooter,” he tweeted.

A men’s basketball game scheduled for Friday night between Central Michigan and Western Michigan University was postponed. No makeup date has been announced.

DPS spokesman Trooper Deon Cockrell says a department helicopter spotted the suspect, and the trooper was able to track him back down and pursue him. At one point, the suspect drove onto a highway and started traveling in the wrong direction.

The suspect eventually stopped his vehicle and got out. Cockrell says the man and the trooper exchanged gunfire and were both hit.

When Doss, along with other officers, arrived at the scene, they encountered a 43-year-old suspect who was standing outside the home with a weapon, according to the Detroit Free Press.

The suspect, identified as Decharlos Brooks, allegedly opened fire on them before they even got out of their squad car, shooting Doss. The officer’s partner, Samuel Anderson, took him to Detroit Receiving Hospital.

Brooks reportedly barricaded himself inside the home until officers threw teargas into the home, and eventually captured him.

The suspect’s wife, Natalie Scott, told Fox 2 that the suspect suffers from mental illness.

“He’s not that type of person. He’s not himself,” Scott told the news station. “He’s no evil person. I feel sorry and prayers to the family, but this just not him.”

Brooks was charged Saturday — before Doss died — with eight counts of assault with intent to murder, seven counts of resisting and obstructing, one count of carrying a dangerous weapon and 17 counts of felony firearms, The Detroit News reported.

Police Chief James Craig on Sunday called Doss, who had been with the department for two years, an “American hero.”

Officer Glenn Doss Sr., Doss Jr.’s father who’s a 19-year veteran of the department, said he his son initially had studied therapy and psychology.

“I never told to join the police department,” Doss Sr. said. “I never advised him to join the police department. He called me up a couple of years ago, and said, ‘Dad, what do I have to do to be in the police.’”

“I told him to go to [Detroit Public Safety Headquarters] and put in an application. Three months later, he started the academy, and fell in love with the job,” Doss Sr. added.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said Doss Jr. “was everything that’s good about the city of Detroit.”

A GoFundMe page set up for Doss’s family stated that “Glenn chose a career serving the community because his willingness to help others was evident in everything he did.” It had raised more than $18,800 of its $5,000 goal by Sunday afternoon.

Doss leaves behind his 9-month-old son, Eli, and Emily Crouse, his girlfriend of nine years."

The suspect in the officer's shooting was later shot and killed by police after a chase.

Prince George's County police Chief Hank Stawinski said Officer Mujahid Ramzziddin was confronted by a man with a shotgun when he left his home in suburban Maryland to help a woman who lived a few doors away and knew Ramzziddin was a police officer.

""He stood his ground,"" Stawinski said at a press conference. ""He saved her life by giving his own.""

The man who shot Ramzziddin, identified by police as Glenn Tyndell, 37 of Brandywine, then fled the scene in a vehicle. Stawinski said the chase carried briefly into neighboring Charles County, and ended when the suspect was shot and killed by two Prince George's County officers.

State Route 210, a major highway in southern Maryland connecting Prince George's and Charles counties, was closed for several hours Wednesday near the scene of where the suspect was shot and killed, several miles (kilometers) from where Ramzziddin was shot.

Stawinski said the initial shooting occurred about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday in the Brandywine area, about 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of the nation's capital.

Ramzziddin, a married father of four, had been with the department for 13 years, and in 2006 received a Valor Award from the department, Stawinski said.

""Today was not the first time he demonstrated his heroism,"" Stawinski said.

The man who shot Ramzziddin had a history of domestic incidents, Stawinski said. Police later said he had three open warrants for assault, and court records list multiple civil and criminal complaints against him dating back to 2010. Many of them were ultimately dismissed.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is conducting its own investigation, but Stawinski said he has reason to believe that those domestic incidents should have barred the suspect from legally owning a firearm.

Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker said his sadness over Ramzziddin's death is mixed with pride for his willingness to help a member of the community.

""He didn't have to answer the door,"" Baker said. ""He didn't have to walk out that door."""

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a technology that could allow childhood vaccines—for everything from polio to measles, mumps, and rubella—to be combined into a single injection, reports the BBC.

The idea is that one shot would inject microscopic capsules of vaccine into a person, and those capsules would be designed to break down and release their contents at different times, per the Science study.

WHY DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY IS STILL OUT

A simpler application would be to deliver one vaccine and its necessary booster shots at one time. In tests on mice, researchers were able to time the release of the booster doses to exactly nine, 20, and 41 days after the initial shot.

The concept has not been tested in humans yet.

""For the first time, we can create a library of tiny, encased vaccine particles, each programmed to release at a precise, predictable time, so that people could potentially receive a single injection that, in effect, would have multiple boosters already built into it,"" MIT's Robert Langer says in a release.

In the developing world especially, this ""might be the difference between not getting vaccinated and receiving all of your vaccines in one shot,"" adds study author Kevin McHugh, whose research was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Much work remains: For one thing, scientists would need to figure out how to keep the doses, normally refrigerated, stable in a warm body, per the Guardian.

IDENTICAL TWINS GIVE BIRTH HOURS APART AT SAME HOSPITAL

They also are trying to further shrink the capsules so they can be injected directly into muscle, per New Scientist. (A vaccine for the common cold is in the works.)

Officer Ken Copeland, a veteran of the San Marcos Police Department since March 1998, was serving a warrant in the El Camino Real subdivison of the city when he was fatally shot, Police Chief Chase Stapp confirmed during a press conference Monday night.

Copeland — who was wearing a protective vest — and other officers were shot at by the suspect, ""much like in an ambush type of situation.""

He was taken to the Central Texas Medical Center immediately and was later pronouced dead at 3:50 p.m. local time, according to a press release from the city of San Marcos.

The shooting happened near Bowie Elementary School, Fox 7 reported.

A suspect is in custody after he surrendered to law enforcement following a shootout. The suspect was shot during the incident and was transported to a hospital in Austin, police said. It's unclear if the suspect was injured from a self-inflicted wound or if he was injured from police gunfire.

""Ken's a hero. Everybody here loved him,"" Stapp said, noting that Copeland's photo is hung throughout the police department.

Copeland was shot while working on his day off, the police chief added. ""He worked just about every day off to provide for his kids.""

Stapp said that Copeland is the first officer from the San Marcos force to be killed in the line of duty.

Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott tweeted the news, and said: ""We pray for the family of the San Marcos police officer killed in the line of duty. We remember the sacrifices our men and women in law enforcement make every day. #BackTheBlue.""

In a separate statement, the governor said, ""Today we grieve for the family of the fallen San Marcos police officer, and we vow swift justice for the killer. The men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line every day to protect and to serve our communities, and we will never forget their sacrifices.""

He added: ""Cecilia and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the officer’s family and to the entire San Marcos Police Department.""

Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that he's ""deeply troubled and saddened"" at the officer's death, and added: ""Officers around our state courageously serve and deserve our utmost honor and respect, especially during this time. Please join Angela and me as we pray for the officer's family, the people of San Marcos, and for our law enforcement officers around the state."""
fox46,[],2017-12-31 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/31/deputies-down-after-being-called-to-suburban-denver-scene.html,"A man fired more than 100 rounds at sheriff's deputies in Colorado early Sunday, killing one and injuring four others, before being fatally shot himself in what authorities called an ambush. Two civilians were also injured.

Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said deputies came under fire almost immediately and were shot ""very, very quickly"" after entering a suburban Denver apartment and trying to talk with the suspect, who was holed up inside a bedroom.

""They all went down almost within seconds of each other, so it was more of an ambush-type of attack on our officers,"" Spurlock said. ""He knew we were coming and we obviously let him know that we were there.""

The Douglas County coroner identified the suspect as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl.

A YouTube user named Matthew Riehl posted a YouTube video Dec. 13, saying he wanted to replace Spurlock and railing against the sheriff and other officers in profane, highly personal terms.

The wounded deputies tried to pull the fallen officer, Zackari Parrish, out of the line of further gunfire but were unable to because of their own injuries and only managed to ""crawl to safety,"" Spurlock said.

The incident began around 5:15 a.m. at Copper Canyon Apartments, a landscaped apartment complex in Highland Ranch, 16 miles (28 kilometers) south of Denver.

Authorities had left the home barely an hour earlier in response to a complaint of a ""verbal disturbance"" involving two men, the sheriff's office said. One of the men told them the suspect ""was acting bizarre and might be having a mental breakdown"" but the deputies found no evidence of a crime.

When deputies were called back, a man who had left came by to give them a key and granted permission to enter the home, leaving again before shots were fired.

""The suspect was just making a ton of noise and annoying everyone around him,"" Spurlock said.

Four officers, including Parrish, were shot from a bedroom around 6 a.m., forcing the retreat. A SWAT team entered the apartment at about 7:30 a.m. in an exchange of gunfire that left the gunman dead and another officer injured.

Vira Cover, who lives in a building about 50 yards away from the shooting, was woken up by a phone call from her fiance, Steve Silknitter, who warned her about what was happening and urged her to stay inside. Soon afterward she said she heard about 15 to 20 very loud shots fired over about 30 seconds or a minute. She sat on the couch with her cats and called Silknitter back before turning on the television to try to find out more about what was happening.

""I couldn't believe this was happening in our backyard,"" she said.

Silknitter heard the shots fired too but from about a half mile away, stopped at a police roadblock as he tried to get back home from work. Then he said he saw police in tactical gear speed past him in a pickup truck.

Silknitter said he lived 2 miles away from the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado where 12 people were killed in a shooting in 2012. He said he never would have expected anything like this in his apartment complex, where the only noise you might normally hear is children running around upstairs.

""Where do I move to where I don't have to worry about someone shooting us?"" asked Silknitter, who is now considering getting a concealed weapons permit.

The suspect was well-known to authorities in the Denver area but had no criminal record, said Spurlock, who declined to name him until his identity was confirmed.

Riehl said in his Dec. 13 YouTube video, called ""Fire Sheriff Spurlock,"" that he would run as a libertarian, ending with holiday greetings and a vow to ""fire all these bums come early next year.""

Riehl is vague about his political beliefs and personal grievances, though his animosity clearly ran deep. He flashes the business card of an officer who, he says, shows up at homes after sunset with an attractive woman and ""will then ambush you from behind the door.""

A video posted on Nov. 28 shows a traffic stop by a police officer in the city of Lone Tree — apparently taken inside the officer's car — that Riehl said was done illegally. He alleges the officer clocked the wrong driver, identifying the officer by name in the video and calling him ""dirty.""

""Scumbag, dirtbag, liar,"" he says as the officer questions the driver. ""He's the boss, huh? He's the Nazi in charge with the stripes on his shoulder and the fake badge.""

The sheriff did not release any details about the weapons and ammunition used except to say the suspect had a rifle. He also did not know if law enforcement had any prior knowledge of firearms being in the home but the possibility always weighs on deputies' minds.

""We respond to every call anticipating that everyone has a gun. This is Colorado. Everybody has a gun,"" Spurlock said.

Parrish, the slain officer, was 29 and a married father of two young children. He came to the department seven months ago after working as an officer for the nearby Castle Rock Police Department. Spurlock called him a ""good kid"" who was eager to work.

""His wife told me today that he loved this job more than he had loved any job he ever had,"" the sheriff said.

Gov. John Hickenlooper ordered flags on all public buildings immediately lowered to half-staff until Tuesday evening in Parrish's honor.

The three deputies and one police officer injured were listed in stable condition. Authorities identified them as deputies Michael Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32; and Castle Rock police officer Tom O'Donnell, 41.

The two civilian injuries were not life-threatening.

Pelle is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. The sheriff shared a picture of him and two other family members by his son's hospital bed on his office Twitter account. All four, including Jeffrey Pelle, who underwent surgery, are smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture.

President Donald Trump expressed sorrow, writing on Twitter, ""My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @dcsheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all!""

The shooting occurred on the final day of a year that saw the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas.

Christian Thomas McCall, 47, was taken into custody, suffering from wounds after allegedly firing at deputies at about 3:30 a.m., police said. Four South Carolina officers — three York County Sheriff’s deputies and a K9 officer — were wounded and rushed to a hospital.

The York County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the names of the four officers in a tweet Tuesday afternoon.

Det. Michael Doty remains in critical condition, Sgt. Randy Clinton is awaiting surgery with non-life threatening injuries, Sgt. Buddy Brown is recovering from surgery and Sgt. Kyle Cummings of the York County SWAT team is also in recovery, Fox 46 reported.

""His situation is very critical at this time. That's all I can tell you at this time. We really could use your thoughts and prayers,"" York County Sheriff’s spokesman Trent Faris said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon about Doty.

McCall, a father of three children, was previously arrested in 1994 and was charged with assault, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry told WSOC.

Around 10 p.m. Monday, he allegedly assaulted his wife in their York home, about 25 miles southwest of Charlotte, when the incident escalated, McCall’s father-in-law told WSOC.

Authorities responded to a domestic call, but the suspect had already fled the scene on foot when they arrived, Faris said. K-9 units were sent to the scene when McCall fired his gun just after 1 a.m., striking one of the K-9 officers. McCall also allegedly shot at a police helicopter. The bullet struck the aircraft, but did not injure anyone, WSOC reported.

Three York County Sheriff’s deputies were shot about 3:30 a.m. while searching the woods. McCall had several ""long guns"" with him at the time, but police did not specify what type of weapons they were.

McCall’s father-in-law told WSOC-TV said it was “uncharacteristic” for McCall to act violently toward police. A neighbor, Roger Gilfillan, said he was stunned to find out who might be involved.

""This is baffling,"" Gilfillan said, noting McCall lived in the home with his wife and three children.

""They were real nice people. He just kept to himself,"" said Gilfillan.

McCall frequently walked around the neighborhood, but would only speak when someone spoke to him. McCall never appeared to cause any trouble, Gilfillan said.

Officer Ryan Nash, 28, shot suspect Sayfullo Saipov in the stomach moments after he allegedly rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd in Lower Manhattan, the New York Daily News reported.

The attack left at least eight people dead and several others injured in what Mayor Bill de Blasio called a “cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians.”

Nash, a five-year veteran of the police force, was outside the nearby Stuyvesant High School reporting to an unfounded call of a nonviolent, emotionally disturbed person before the deadly rampage began, The News reported.

When chaos broke out, Nash rushed to the bloody scene where he successfully subdued the suspect.

NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill commended Nash in a news conference Tuesday evening, saying the young officer “stopped the carnage moments after it began.”

A source told Fox News that 29-year-old Saipov was from Uzbekistan and had a green card. He remains hospitalized following the attack."

This time, the gun barrel exploded, knocking the farmer from Hampton, Iowa, backward, severely damaging his right hand and ear and burning his face.

Unknown to Hansen, the manufacturer of the rifle that injured him in 2014 had received other complaints of explosions and injuries over the prior decade. Customers repeatedly reported that the barrel of the stainless steel 10 ML-II muzzleloader exploded, burst, split or cracked, according to thousands of court documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

Lawyers for the company, Westfield, Massachusetts-based Savage Arms, were expected to appear Wednesday in federal court in Iowa to defend against a lawsuit filed by Hansen. He is seeking damages for his injuries, alleging the company failed to warn customers about the defect.

It's one of several lawsuits that have claimed the company recklessly kept the muzzleloaders on the market even as they kept occasionally mangling hands, damaging hearing and burning faces. At least three have been settled on a confidential basis since last year.

Martin Crimp, a Michigan State University metals expert who examined a 10ML-II that exploded and caused a hunter to lose multiple fingers in 2009, told the AP the barrel of that gun was ""metallurgically defective.""

An expert hired by Hansen's lawyers came to a similar conclusion, saying the steel used to make the rifle was prone to catastrophic failure after repeat firings.

Anthony Pisciotti, an outside lawyer for Savage Arms, said he wasn't authorized to comment. A spokesman for its parent company, Vista Outdoor, didn't return messages.

Savage Arms, which discontinued the gun in 2010 after thousands were on the market, has insisted it's safe when used properly, has no defects and was designed in accordance with industry standards.

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE

Savage Arms has argued that operator error is to blame for the explosions, saying users must have created too much pressure inside the barrel either by loading two bullets or using the wrong amount or type of gunpowder. It has issued a safety notice on its website warning owners to ""carefully follow the safe loading procedures"" in the product manual to avoid injuries.

Hansen's case highlights how gun makers, unlike manufacturers of other consumer products, have the sole discretion to decide themselves whether to recall potentially dangerous weapons. In 1976, Congress blocked the newly-created Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has broad authority to regulate everything from toasters to toys and BB guns, from restricting the manufacture or sale of firearms.

""It's an example of an industry that can essentially do whatever they want and there's no consequences other than being held accountable in a civil liability context,"" said Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center in Washington D.C.

Other companies have faced allegations that they allowed unsafe guns to stay on the market. Remington agreed to replace triggers in its popular Model 700 rifles — only after several lawsuits claiming that they were prone to accidentally discharging. Ruger was accused of marketing revolvers for decades that could fire when dropped.

Savage Arms recently agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Trent Procter, who was on a hunting trip with friends in October 2009 when the 10 ML-II he'd owned for years ""just blew apart"" when he shot at a target.

Procter, 48, missed nine months of work from his job as a power company lineman as he endured surgeries on his left hand and rehabilitation. He had to move to a different job and still experiences numbness due to nerve damage in his hand, where he's missing parts of his thumb and middle finger.

Photos of Procter's hand were shared on hunting websites after the explosion, and he said it was insulting that some suggested he and not a defective product was to blame.

""I'm surprised it was never recalled or a warning was put out that this was actually happening,"" he said. ""It's quite scary when you think about it.""

Last year, the company also settled a case brought by Michigan hunter Rodney Palatka and his wife, who was pregnant with twins and suffered a miscarriage after witnessing her husband's injuries.

James Putman of North Carolina alleges in a pending lawsuit that his Savage 10ML-II burst as he hunted last year in the George Washington National Forest, blasting his thumb off and forcing his early retirement as a firefighter.

Savage Arms started making the 10ML-II in 2001. It was designed to withstand the use of smokeless powder, which appealed to some shooters because it didn't require the same messy cleanup as black powder.

The company's knowledge of the barrel problems is becoming clear after years of lawsuits.

In Palatka's case, a federal magistrate in 2015 sanctioned the company for a ""purposeful record of obfuscation"" that included falsely claiming that it was aware of only two prior explosions while withholding information that showed otherwise.

The company acknowledged in Hansen's case that it received 45 legal claims related to burst or split barrels dating to 2004. Hansen's lawyers say documents show Savage Arms created a special ""muzzleloader return team"" and faced hundreds of warranty and service claims.

Some hunters were offered free replacement rifles after they were told their errors caused the damage.

Hansen, 50 and a lifelong hunter, testified in an August deposition that he followed the recommended procedures when he loaded his 10ML-II, which he bought in 2010 and had shot 200 times. He said he weighed and loaded 43 grains of the recommended powder and one bullet. He set a target at 50 yards, laid on a dirt pile, aimed and fired.

Hansen, who was rushed to the emergency room after the explosion, testified he still struggles to hear even with a hearing aid and cannot perform some farm chores due to his hand injury.

Savage Arms has suggested that Hansen used an improper mix of powders that caused too much pressure. Trial is set for next year."
fox51,['Hollie Mckay'],2017-08-23 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/23/how-california-gun-owners-are-legally-keeping-their-ar-15-rifles.html,"It seems California lawmakers’ efforts to force rifle owners to register their personal details, or resort to cumbersome reloading or giving up their arms altogether, may have missed the mark.

Although months behind schedule, the State of California’s Department of Justice (DOJ) this week opened up its online registration for gun owners to enroll their bullet-button toting AR-15 rifles – now deemed to be “assault weapons” – in line with a controversial set of sweeping gun control laws signed into state law last year.

But gunmakers and owners say they already have come up with creative workarounds to be legally compliant but avoid giving the government even more personal information.

“The registration is seen by many as a trap to purge the owner since they ask for very specific information about acquisition of the original rifle that most owners don’t have or remember,” Steven Lieberman, a California-based attorney and founder of firearms training company Artemis Defense, told Fox News. “As a result, the ‘guesstimate’ as most would, they are potentially committing perjury.”

The registration process is considered by many to be “more intrusive” compared to prior registration processes. In the past, one simply needed to submit a list of serial numbers to the state’s DOJ.

This time, the level of information required includes everything from locating their receipts to confirm when they originally purchased their firearms, as well as multiple photos of each gun to be uploaded, and all on a website technology rather than mobile device optimized.

This leaves the California gun owner who chooses not to register with the option of opting for a “featureless” model – deemed an AR-15 that does not contain a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a vertical grip, or a flash suppressor. And, perhaps ironically, it has actually breathed new life into the otherwise declining gun sales.

California gun owners thus can bypass registration by either revising their current platform to the featureless style or buying a new one altogether.

“If there had been no change in the law, the California market demand for guns would have fallen just like it did in the rest of the country as demand for these types of firearms fell with the coming of the Trump presidency,” said California firearms instructor and risk analyst Dennis Santiago. He was referring to the drop in demand nationwide for guns, given that sales soared during the Obama era as gun proponents feared stringent gun control measures would be put in place.

“Instead, lawmakers just propped up demand again, and opened up the market for gun owners to convert their guns and manufacturers to make new guns that easily circumvent the law with a few cosmetic changes,” he added.

At the heart of the legislation is the outlawing of the AR-15’s “bullet button” – already a feature not used in other states and designed to slow down the reloading process given that it requires a tool to be pushed on the ‘button’ to eject a spent magazine before being able to reload. By focusing on detachable magazines, California lawmakers were endeavoring to make it an even more laborious reloading process.

Marc Levine, a Democratic State Assembly member who was a huge backer of the new gun laws, told Fox News: “By closing the bullet button loophole, it is slowing down the reloading mechanism. Lawmakers will continue to do whatever it takes to keep communities safe.”

But savvy designers, Santiago contends, have other ideas.

“Lawmakers were probably thinking that guns would require being taken apart to reload them as a result of their new law. They were mistaken,” Santiago explained. “Ironically, the next generation of unregistered semi-automatic rifles will be better; almost all new designs will have detachable magazines again.”

Chris Eger, a staff writer for Guns.com, pointed out that within days of the new legislation, there already were workaround devices and tweaks being concocted by “some clever person ... invented to defeat it.”

“We have covered several new inventions that have popped up just in the past few months, and you can imagine right now that there are rooms of people burning lean muscle tissue into the night trying to come up with more,” he said.

Manufacturers have redesigned their products to take advantage of the new law's ""featureless"" build definition.

“As long as states continue to pass feature-based bans and/or until the Supreme Court finally decides that all of these laws are unconstitutional,” Alan Thordsen, President of Thordsen Customs in California, said, “There will be companies like us and others designing ways to keep law-abiding citizens in compliance.”

Eger noted that the new way without the bullet button may end up making reloading more efficient.

“The new way can be faster, especially with some aftermarket attachments made to break open the receivers more quickly,” he said.

SALE OF FIREARMS THAT USE BULLET BUTTONS SURGE AHEAD OF NEW CALIFORNIA GUN LAW

CONCEALED-HANDGUN CARRY BILL TRIGGERS PUSHBACK FROM COASTAL MAYORS, POLICE CHIEFS

But despite the apparent outmaneuvering, California’s gun control proponents stand firm that the new legislation is still a step in the right direction.

“It’s no surprise that gun manufacturers are coming up with ways to try to get around reasonable restrictions,” said Levine, adding that they will continue to address the “workarounds” with legislation as necessary.

And Ari Freilich, an attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, concurred that although “workarounds have already been introduced,” they are confident that this legislation will “save lives and reduce the lethality of mass shooting events.”"
fox52,['Allison Barrie'],2017-01-12 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/01/12/marines-get-groundbreaking-unstoppable-new-rifle-magazine.html,"A reliable weapon can be the difference between life and death for those serving in the military.

The Magpul Industries PMAG GEN 3 is a magazine for rifles that ensures the user stays lethal in a fight. More than 20,000 rounds fired? No problem. Still no magazine stoppages.

Why is that so important? Because every time a stoppage happens with a weapon, it means a lost opportunity to neutralize an enemy combatant. But the even bigger issue is that a stoppage can put the warfighter at risk and even lead to loss of life.

With AR, M4, and M27 weapons for example, magazine problems are a primary culprit in stoppages. But if a warfighter uses the PMAG, then the risk of stoppage is massively reduced.

The US Marine Corps has made the decision to ensure that all Marines have the best magazine available. Going forward, Magpul’s PMAG GEN 3 has become the official magazine, giving Marines that extra advantage to stay alive and lethal in a firefight.

This is the first commercial magazine adopted as the official standard for the Marine Corps primary service rifle, Magpul explained.

THE 5 COOLEST MILITARY INNOVATIONS OF 2016

Magpul has also introduced the PMAG GEN 3 in the “medium coyote tan” color. The black and medium coyote tan are now the only magazines authorized by the USMC for combat and training. The government-designed EPM USGI (aluminum) magazine will be used only for training purposes.

PMAG GEN 3 Basics

The PMAG GEN 3 would be ideal for the M4, M16, M27IAR (Infantry Automatic Rifle) and M249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon). And the magazine works with all types of bullets.

And in spite of tens of thousands of rounds, it won’t melt because of its special advanced material.

The military put the PMAG GEN 3 through years of testing, and thousands and thousands and thousands of rounds. And what did they find? No stoppages.

For example, testing found that even in 20,400 rounds of M855A1— a tricky ammo type— still there were zero stoppages.

How tough is tough?

Both the US and NATO have what’s called “rough handling” testing and Magpul’s PMAG GEN 3 passed all of it with flying colors.

What does mean? It is one rugged magazine. You can use it in extreme cold— as in -60 degrees Fahrenheit cold— all the way through to 180 degrees of extreme heat, and this magazine still cannot be stopped. It is reliable.

HOW SKYDIVING MILITARY SNIPERS HARNESSED TOP OXYGEN TECH ON MOUNT EVEREST

The magazine also easily passed military testing against things like dust, UV exposure and even salt fog. You can also throw whatever dirt and grime is around and it will still outperform other magazine options.

So how does it work?

The PMAG GEN 3 loads from stripper clips. It inserts rapidly on a closed vault with a full 30 rounds. There is a smart over-insertion stop to protect against hard-core magazine changes and drops.

When you’re shooting, there is a handy window that Magpul describes as working like a gas gage. As you fire, it will provide exact data on just how many rounds you have left by a quick glance at the orange coil.

THESE HACKERS COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE IN A DISASTER

This magazine drops free, making reload very quick and efficient. There’s a dust and impact cover, but you don’t need it to store the magazine loaded. It is really there to protect against major impact like dropping the mags out of aircraft, for example.

Unlike the USGI aluminum magazine, it is very easy to disassemble to clean.

Dominating the field and winning the Marine Corps contract

In battery after battery of military testing over the course of several years, the PMAG GEN M3 relentlessly dominated the competition. In tens of thousands of rounds, there were zero magazine-related stoppages and it performed better than any other magazine. The GEN M3 was pitted against both government developed USGI and commercial mags— but none could come close to rivaling the PMAG GEN 3’s relentlessly reliable performance.

Magpul is highly motivated to find top-notch solutions for warfighters. Founder Richard Fitzpatrick was Marine Reconnaissance, many at the company served in the Corps, and have children currently serving. This is a company that understands the needs of those serving in the US military and takes delivering excellence extremely seriously.

“Firearm performance is a passion for us at Magpul, whether for military weapon systems or for civilian arms for defense and recreation,” Duane Liptak, Magpul Industries’ product management and marketing director, said. “Very early in the company history, Magpul’s founders identified shortcomings in the USGI magazine, and we’ve been dedicated to making the most reliable magazines in the world because although it may seem like a simple box with a spring, people’s lives depend heavily on this item performing.”

What’s next for Magpul? For civilians, there will be some very big reveals at SHOT Show next week. To find out first, download the latest Tactical Talk and meet a former Marine Corps fighter pilot who will give you an exclusive peek at some of the exciting news.

Justin Timperio sued Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, seeking unspecified damages.

Authorities say a doctor who had been forced to resign from Bronx Lebanon Hospital two years earlier amid a sexual harassment claim opened fire inside the hospital on June 30, killing a doctor and hurting six others. Police say the doctor, Henry Bello, killed himself at the scene.

The lawsuit said the hospital had insufficient security to stop Bello from entering the grounds even though a nurse and a security guard were injured in a 2011 shooting there.

It also blamed the shooting on a Schenectady, New York, gun shop.

fox54,['Perry Chiaramonte'],2017-10-05 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/05/bump-stock-rifle-modifiers-green-lighted-by-obama-administration.html,"So-called 'bump stock' recoil devices like the ones used by the Las Vegas gunman, were first approved under the Obama administration's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

In June, 2010, about 18 months into Obama’s first term, the ATF issued an opinion letter to stock manufacturer Slide Fire on the company's after-market device. The bureau gave the company approval, according to the Media Research Center.

“The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed,” reads the letter dated June 7, 2010. “In order to use the installed device, the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand. Accordingly, we find that the “bump-stock” is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.”

The National Firearms Act prohibits the sale, manufacture, and transfer of automatic weapons to the general public. Unless a person is a member of the military or a police agency, obtaining an automatic firearm is difficult and expensive. Potential buyers must first locate a gun dealer who is authorized to sell automatic weapons. Then they must submit applications to both federal and local agencies. If those applications are approved, the buyer must pay $200 for a tax stamp.

With the device, semi-automatic rifles can easily be modified to fire like fully automatic weapons. The devices allow the shooter to use the recoil of the gun to push the trigger against the stationary finger, allowing for a rapid succession of shots, similar to a fully automatic firearm. Other devices, like a trigger crank, can also modify these weapons so they fire in an automatic fashion at a very low cost and with no regulatory red tape.

The approval of these types of devices falls under what some lawmakers in Washington are calling an “automatic weapon loophole.” And even the gun lobby is in agreement.

""Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,"" the National Rifle Association said in a Thursday statement. ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.""

On Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., along with numerous Democratic senators, announced the introduction of a bill to close the loophole and ban devices that enable a semi-automatic weapon to fire fully automatic.

“Automatic weapons have been illegal for more than 30 years, but there’s a loophole in the law that can be exploited to allow killers to fire at rates of between 400 and 800 rounds-per-minute,"" she said. ""The only reason to fire so many rounds so fast is to kill large numbers of people. No one should be able to easily and cheaply modify legal weapons into what are essentially machine guns.”

Republicans on the Hill are also considering taking action against the sale of these weapons attachments.

Fox News has learned that Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., is writing a bipartisan bill to ban bump stocks and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, also opened the door to looking at the issue.

Even the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, opened the door to new restrictions.

""If somebody can essentially convert a semi-automatic weapon by buying one of these and utilizing it and cause the kind of mayhem and mass casualties that we saw in Las Vegas, that's something of obvious concern that we ought to explore,"" Cornyn told reporters.

fox57,['Joshua Rhett Miller'],2010-11-24 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2010/11/24/armys-revolutionary-rifle-use-afghanistan.html,"Since the dawn of modern warfare, the best way to stay alive in the face of incoming fire has been to take cover behind a wall. But thanks to a game-changing ""revolutionary"" rifle, the U.S. Army has made that tactic dead on arrival. Now the enemy can run, but he can't hide.

After years of development, the U.S. Army has unleashed a new weapon in Afghanistan -- the XM25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement System, a high-tech rifle that can be programmed so that its 25-mm. ammunition detonates either in front of or behind a target, meaning it can be fired just above a wall before it explodes and kills the enemy.

It also has a range of roughly 2,300 feet -- nearly the length of eight football fields -- making it possible to fire at targets well past the range of the rifles and carbines that most soldiers carry today.

Lt. Col. Christopher Lehner, project manager for the semi-automatic, shoulder-fired weapon system for the U.S. Army's Program Executive Office Soldier, said that the XM25's capability alone is such a ""game-changer"" that it'll lead to new ways of fighting on the battlefield, beginning this month in Afghanistan.

""With this weapon system, we take away cover from [enemy targets] forever,"" Lehner told FoxNews.com on Wednesday. ""Tactics are going to have to be rewritten. The only thing we can see [enemies] being able to do is run away.""

And that would make it much easier for U.S. troops to put them in their sights, either with that same XM25 or another direct-fire weapon.

With this new weapon in the Army's arsenal, Lehner said, ""We're much more effective, by many magnitudes, than current weapons at the squad level. We're able to shoot farther and more accurately, and our soldiers can stay behind sandbags, walls or rocks, which provides them protection from fire.""

Lehner said the first XM25s were distributed to combat units in Afghanistan this month. The 12-pound, 29-inch system, which was designed by Minnesota's Alliant Techsystems, costs up to $35,000 per unit and, while highly sophisticated, is so easy to use that soldiers become proficient within minutes.

""That's how intuitively easy it is, even though it's high-tech,"" Lehner said. ""All a soldier needs to know how to do is laze the target. It decimates anything within its lethal radius.""

Once the trigger is pulled and the round leaves the barrel, a computer chip inside the projectile communicates exactly how far it has traveled, allowing for precise detonation behind or ahead of any target.

""We have found that this has really made our soldiers so much more accurate and being able to deliver this high-explosive round in about five seconds,"" said Lehner, taking into account the time it takes a soldier to laze, aim and fire the weapon. Once fired, Lehner said, the round will reach its target in a ""second or two,"" meaning the entire process from aiming to direct hit lasts less than 10 seconds, compared to 10 minutes or longer for traditional mortar fire.

A potential battlefield scenario, according to Army officials, might go something like this:

-- A patrol encounters an enemy combatant in a walled Afghan village who fires an AK-47 intermittently from behind cover, exposing himself only for a brief second to fire.

-- The patrol's leader calls for the XM25 gunman, who uses the weapon's laser range finder to calculate the distance to the target.

-- He then uses an incremental button located near the trigger to add 1 meter to the round's distance, since the enemy is hiding behind a wall.

-- The round is fired, and it explodes with a blast comparable to a hand grenade past the wall and above the enemy.

""This is revolutionary for many reasons,"" Lehner said, citing increased efficiency, safety and lethality. ""This is the first time we're putting smart technology in an individual weapon system for our soldiers. We feel it's very important to field this because it keeps us ahead of the technological curve of our potential enemies. We have a feeling other people will try to copy us -- this is the future.""

Lehner said the Army plans to purchase at least 12,500 XM25 systems beginning next year -- enough for one system in each infantry squad and Special Forces team.

The military isn't overly concerned that the weapon might be captured by the enemy, because they would be unable to obtain its highly specialized ammunition, batteries and other components. Lehner said he expects other nations will try to copy its technology, but it will be very cost-prohibitive.

""This is a game-changer,"" Lehner said. ""The enemy has learned to get cover, for hundreds if not thousands of years.

""Well, they can't do that anymore. We're taking that cover from them and there's only two outcomes: We're going to get you behind that cover or force you to flee. So no matter what, we gotcha."""

Shannon Jason Cables was killed by deputies responding to a domestic violence call at his Lake Wales home on Saturday, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.

Sheriff Grady Judd told the Lakeland Ledger newspaper that Cables first attacked his wife with Mace and a pool cue.

Then, Cable's daughter came to her mother's defense.

""That's when the 19-year-old actually jumped on the suspect and wrestled and choked him,"" Judd said. He said the pair managed to get away, and Cables fled into some woods behind the house.

The women took refuge at a neighbor's home and called police.

Deputies searched the woods with police dogs and a helicopter for two hours while the women received medical care. When the women returned home with law enforcement, deputies spotted Cables carrying an assault rifle and a shotgun coming up behind the house, Judd said.

The sheriff's office says they ordered Cables, a 46-year-old white man, to drop the weapon, but he pointed it at deputies instead, so they shot him. The deputies' races were not released.

Judd told the newspaper that investigators found shells from Cables' assault rifle outside, indicating he fired the weapon. No deputies were injured.

An activist group called INDECLINE claimed responsibility for the change in an emailed statement. The ad originally said, “Shoot a .50 caliber only $29.”

""This protest piece is in response to America’s longstanding obsession with gun culture and our government’s inability to honor the victims of mass shootings by distancing themselves from the homicidal policies of the NRA,"" a news release from INDECLINE stated, according to Fox 5 in Las Vegas.

Police began investigating after the vandalism was reported, and the message was taken down within hours.

The sign stands off Interstate 15, less than five miles from the Mandalay Bay resort and casino, where a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers from the 32nd floor, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more. The Oct. 1 attack was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

A Feb. 14 mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead was also used as inspiration for the billboard, a spokesman told AP.

fox61,['Joseph Curl'],2018-03-02 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/02/new-death-wish-movie-is-sure-to-create-huge-conversation-on-gun-violence-and-it-wont-be-pretty.html,"A new iteration of the vigilante movie ""Death Wish"" opens on Friday, and hoo boy, is it going to explode like no other movie in recent memory.

The movie, starring Bruce Willis as Paul Kersey (a role that revived the long career of Charles Bronson back in the '70s), was set for release in November 2017, but was delayed until this Friday.

There was no way to know a mass shooting – one in which police and mental health authorities utterly failed to protect young students gunned down in a Florida school – would suddenly change the tone and tenor of the movie.

In the original, Paul Kersey is a mild-mannered architect, in love with his wonderful wife Joanna and their daughter Carol, living in Manhattan. One day, two hoodlums (one of whom is a very young Jeff Goldblum, starring in his very first movie) follow the women home from a grocery store. They beat Joanna to death and brutally rape Carol – leaving her in a catatonic state – in a scene considered very graphic for the day.

Kersey has abhorred guns his whole life: His father was killed in a hunting accident. Soon, he becomes frustrated with the slow pace of the police investigation. He takes long walks, and one night he takes along an antique .32-caliber gun given to him by a friend. When a mugger attacks him, Kersey shoots him dead.

The soft-spoken architect likes the feeling. He's doling out justice on the spot in the mean streets of New York City. Soon, he's taking nightly walks, killing several criminals – some of whom he provokes into attacking him. Before long he ends up – guess where? – Chicago! Yes, the city where 650 people were slain in 2017. The city, run by Obama crony Rahm Emanuel, has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation.

That's where the new ""Death Wish"" picks up. Willis plays Kersey, but this time he's a doctor. The rest of the plot is essentially the same – but different, given that now, people film him on their cell phones during his vigilante acts. ""Everybody's watching this viral video, this guy in a hoodie, they're calling him the grim reaper,"" says a radio DJ in the film's trailer.

""He stopped a carjacking. He's become a folk hero. Is he right for taking the law into his own hands?"" the DJ asks. At another point, a deep voice says simply: ""If a man really wants to protect what's his, he has to do it himself."" But when a friend tells Kersey: ""You're not a cop!"" he says ""Somebody has to do it!""

At another point in the trailer, a cop says: ""They called him a guardian angel.""

And that's where things get very interesting. A few years after the original film came out, the Guardian Angels were born.

Curtis Sliwa formed the organization to combat widespread violence and crime on the New York City subway system. Soon, more than 130 cities had Guardian Angels protecting citizens. They were trained to make citizen’s arrests for violent crimes.

Then ""Death Wish II"" came out, in 1982. Just before the release of ""Death Wish 3,"" Bernhard Goetz shot four muggers on a New York City subway train in Manhattan, seriously wounding all of them.

The New York City media dubbed him ""The Subway Vigilante,"" and his vigilantism struck a chord with city dwellers living in fear (crime was insane in New York back then, with 2,000 murders a year). Goetz was hailed by many as a hero, and at his 1987 trial, he was acquitted of attempted murder and assault and convicted on just one count – illegal weapons possession.

In his interrogation, Goetz told police of the muggers: “They were intending to play with me like a cat plays with a mouse. What happened here is, I snapped.""

And that's what happens to Kersey. In the original, he's not some gun nut – just the opposite, he was a conscientious objector during the Korean War who still served as a combat medic. But he arms himself and, forced to act, takes the law into his own hands.

There are some great – and suddenly very timely – exchanges in the Bronson movie. Ames Jainchill, the pal who gives Kersey the antique gun, says: ""There's so much g------ hoopla from the gun-control people, half the nation's scared to even hold a gun.""

Learning Kersey was a conscientious objector, Jainchill says: ""You're probably one of those knee-jerk liberals thinks us gun boys'll shoot our guns 'cuz it’s an extension of our penises.""

But then Jainchill explains: ""Well, maybe it is. But this is gun country. Can't even own a handgun in New York City. Out here I hardly know a man who doesn't own one. And I'll tell you something: unlike your city, we can walk our streets and through our parks at night and feel safe. Muggers operating out here they just plain get their asses blown up.""

At one point, Kersey watches a TV news program, which is covering one of his vigilante acts. The TV anchor says: ""The actions of the vigilante, as lawless as they may be, seem to be giving others new attitudes toward crime in the streets. Instead of helplessly allowing themselves to be mugged and robbed, a few are fighting back.""

Americans today are fearful about their safety. Thousands of people flocked to the Florida State Fairgrounds last week for a gun show event, shortly after the high school shooting that left 17 dead.

“Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights,” the manager of the show said.

The new Willis vehicle is already being slammed – and tied to President Trump.

""Like a Donald Trump speech on immigration, the unspoken threat against normal (white) American (white) families is articulated as practically inevitable. It’s less of a question and more of a statement: Bad people are here and bad things are coming. Will you just sit back and let this happen to you? Where is your weapon?"" writes The Daily Beast. ""The trailer stops just short of effectively selling a Trumpian fantasy, and instead exists in a confusing space that’s just plain not the world we live in.""

And more: ""Apparently you can make the movie today, but if you’re thinking that this still isn’t the right time for vigilante porn, you’re right. The horrible, chilling truth is that, as insensitive as it may seem to release this film at this moment, there never will be a 'good time' for Death Wish – not just because the politics of the movie are problematic at best but because, if we keep going the way we’re going, there will just be another tragedy around the time of the next release date.”

Whichever way you slice it, the new ""Death Wish"" is going to create a huge conversation. And it won't be pretty."
fox62,['Caleb Parke'],2018-02-20 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/20/florida-school-shooting-survivor-media-is-using-tragedy-to-push-gun-control.html,"A survivor of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who was previously interviewed by CNN and MSNBC following the mass shooting, told Fox News he believes certain media outlets are politicizing the tragedy to push gun control.

Brandon Minoff, an 18-year-old senior, said the media chose to target gun control advocates instead of focusing on the 17 lives lost in Wednesday's slaughter.

“I wholeheartedly believe that the media is politicizing this tragedy,” Minoff said. “It seems that gun control laws is the major topic of conversation rather than focusing on the bigger issue of 17 innocent lives being taken at the hands of another human.”

FLORIDA SHOOTING SURVIVOR: CNN GAVE ME ‘SCRIPTED’ QUESTION FOR TOWN HALL, QUASHED QUESTION ON ARMED GUARDS

Minoff said students at the school are well-meaning and passionate on both sides of the contentious gun issue. At least 100 students from the school were expected to march in front of the State Capital in Tallahassee on Wednesday to demand stricter gun laws. Dozens of his classmates have willingly approached reporters and anchors to advocate for what they see as solutions to stop the school shooting epidemic. But Minoff said not all of the students at the school share the same stance -- yet most of the coverage has ignored those who favor gun rights.

“I know many people who are pro-gun and others who support gun control but it seems that the media is specifically targeting those in support of gun control to make it seem as if they are the majority, and the liberal news outlets are the ones that seem to make the bigger effort to speak to these people, and I'm talking from experience,” said Minoff, who was interviewed on cable news in primetime.

Minoff, who had a class with shooter Nikolas Cruz during his sophomore year, was outside when Cruz started firing. Minoff's brother, Aiden, was inside and heard the shots.

But Minoff said as soon as the gunfire stopped, the gun control push began.

“After getting home Wednesday night, three hours after the shooting took place, sitting on the couch and putting on the news, it pained me to hear conversations of gun control laws as I had just luckily escaped one of the deadliest school shootings in US history,"" Minoff said.

MSNBC’s Brian Williams asked Minoff what he would do as a lawmaker to stop school shootings. Minoff immediately replied that banning guns just creates a higher demand for them, and contended the real issue is mental health reform.

The next day, Minoff said he watched as CNN again focused on gun control even as the shooter's troubling mental health history -- and missed warning signs -- began to emerge.

“And all day Thursday, CNN was interviewing gun experts and specialists to brainwash the audience that gun control is a necessity,” he said. “They even have an army of my classmates trying to persuade other students that guns are unnecessary and should be illegal.”

Minoff said he supports the First Amendment rights of his classmates, but he believes many of them are uninformed about guns and are just going along with the perceived popular opinion.

He pointed out that on the “March For Our Lives” website the mission statement says “We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the life of students.” But, he noted, an assault rifle is an automatic weapon, and there wasn’t an assault rifle used in the Florida shooting -- rather Cruz was armed with an AR-15.

Like many of his classmates, Minoff wants to make changes so this doesn’t happen again, and he hopes to meet with President Trump to discuss solutions.

Minoff supports some regulations when it comes to purchasing firearms, such as age restrictions and more extensive background checks that include police reports -- especially given the police were called to the Cruz residence nearly 40 times before the shooting occurred.

“I would also talk about the importance of arming security guards and other trained individuals in schools,"" he said. ""The only armed person in the school, the SRO, was reportedly nowhere to be found during the time of the attack and it shows in the fact that Cruz managed to vacate the school unscathed.""

FLORIDA TEACHER OF THE YEAR’S GUN VIOLENCE POST GOES VIRAL AFTER SCHOOL SHOOTING

He added: ""At the same time, [security guard and] Coach Aaron Feis had a face-to-face altercation with Cruz and was unable to do anything but use his body to shield others. The definition of security is ‘state of being free from danger or threat,’ but there is no freedom from danger or threat when security guards are unarmed.”"

In a flurry of tweets, the president hit back at media coverage of his comments about arming teachers the day before. He suggested his remarks were mischaracterized, but made clear he supports allowing some trained teachers to carry concealed weapons.

“I never said ‘give teachers guns’ like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving ‘concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience- only the best,” Trump tweeted.

“20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards,” Trump added. “A ‘gun free’ school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!”

The president’s tweets followed a listening session at the White House Wednesday afternoon with students, parents and teachers affected by the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting last week which left 17 dead. He also invited parents affected by the Sandy Hook and Columbine massacres.

During the almost two-hour session, Trump left the floor open for suggestions to prevent school shootings. One parent floated the idea of concealed-carry for teachers—an idea the president discussed at length with support, noting the administration would look “very strongly” at the option. His Thursday morning tweets seemed to double down on his earlier comments, even as he criticized media coverage.

At the same time, Trump made clear Thursday that he will urge several new gun law restrictions -- including raising the age for purchasing firearms, something sources said he was considering.

“I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health,” Trump tweeted Thursday. “Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue—I hope!”

TRUMP ON PREVENTING MASS SHOOTINGS: 'WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE'

But Trump especially sought to clarify and defend his comments about guns in schools.

Trump said Wednesday that “a gun-free zone to a maniac, they’re all cowards, is 'let’s go in and attack because bullets aren’t coming at us.'”

On Thursday, he tweeted: “History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/ coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!”

Minutes later, Trump added: “If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there…problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work.”

While top NRA officials on Thursday – at the Conservative Political Action Conference – pushed back on gun control calls, Trump said at another listening session late Thursday morning that the NRA “is ready to do things.”

Among those things, he said the NRA would back his call to raise the purchasing age to 21.

Thursday’s listening session was for state and local officials on how to improve school safety. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky and others attended, along with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

“We want to ensure that when we see warning signs, we act quickly. This guy was a sicko,” the president said at the beginning of the meeting. “There’s a tremendous feeling that we want to get something done … including at the NRA.”

The president noted that he has called “many lawmakers” in recent days.

“They’re into doing background checks that maybe they wouldn’t be thinking about [a few weeks ago],” Trump said.

Earlier this week, the president directed Sessions to create new regulations to ban firearm modifiers, including the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas massacre in October 2017.

Under current federal law, licensed firearm dealers cannot sell handguns to people under 21 and cannot sell long guns to people under 18, according to the Giffords Law Center, which tracks gun laws and advocates for more restrictions. Some states already impose laws with tighter minimum age requirements.

The National Rifle Association, which endorsed Trump in the 2016 presidential election, quickly rejected any talk of raising the age for buying long guns to 21.

“Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection,” the NRA said in a statement.

It is unclear at this point, however, whether Trump will push for a change in federal law or encourage a change at the state level."

If only reducing crime and suicides was so easy. In reality, gun control efforts in Australia have not been as successful as we’ve been led to believe.

In fact, the only proven policy to stop gun attacks is deterrence – by allowing law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and others, as President Trump correctly pointed out Thursday on Twitter and in remarks at the White House.

The president tweeted: “If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school.”

The president added: “Cowards won’t go there ... problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!”

European countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands have even stricter gun control laws than Australia does, but their mass public shooting rates are at least as high as those in the United States.

This effective action proposed by the president has been greeted with disdain by most of the media.

Instead, news organizations such as USA Today , the New York Times and the Washington Post have all run stories in recent days crediting Australia’s 1996-1997 gun buyback program with cutting the firearm homicide and suicide rates in half, and eliminating mass public shootings.

Our friends in Australia have been only too eager to offer advice telling us to follow their example.

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently offered to explain to Americans the best gun control regulations. Over this past weekend a church in Australia got international attention for putting up a sign saying: “When will they love their kids more than their guns.”

Responding, anti-gun politicians from Hillary Clinton to President Obama have pointed to Australia’s gun laws as a model that we should closely examine.

But looking at simple before-and-after averages of gun deaths in Australia regarding the gun buyback is extremely misleading. Firearm homicides and suicides were falling from the mid-1980s onwards, so you could pick out any subsequent year and the average firearm homicide and suicide rates after that year would be down compared to the average before it.

The question is whether the rate of decline changed after the gun buyback law went into effect. But the decline in firearm homicides and suicides actually slowed down after the buyback.

Australia’s buyback resulted in almost 1 million guns being handed in and destroyed, but after that private gun ownership once again steadily increased and now exceeds what it was before the buyback.

In fact, since 1997 gun ownership in Australia grew over three times faster than the population (from 2.5 million to 5.8 million guns).

Gun control advocates should have predicted a sudden drop in firearm homicides and suicides after the buyback, and then an increase as the gun ownership rate increased again. But that clearly didn’t happen.

For other crimes, such as armed robbery, what happened is the exact opposite of what was predicted. The armed robbery rate soared right after the gun buyback, then gradually declined.

Gun control advocates like to note that there has been no mass public shooting in Australia since the buyback. But they are simply picking out a country that happens to “prove” what they want it to prove.

European countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands have even stricter gun control laws than Australia does, but their mass public shooting rates are at least as high as those in the United States.

During the Obama administration, the per capita casualty rate from shootings in the European Union was actually 27 percent higher than the U.S. rate.

Even excluding fights over sovereignty and including the recent attacks in Las Vegas, the Texas church shooting in November, and the Florida school massacre, the number of mass shootings in the rest of the world has been much worse than in the U.S. since at least as far back as 1970.

Many point to the widely covered work by the University of Alabama’s Adam Lankford, who claims that 31 percent of mass public shootings from 1966 to 2012 have occurred in the U.S. But Lankford’s totals don’t line up with others, and he has refused repeated requests to release a list of his cases.

New Zealand also provides a useful comparison to Australia. They are both isolated, island nations, and have similar socioeconomics and demographics. Their mass murder rates were nearly identical prior to Australia’s gun buyback.

From 1980 to 1996, Australia’s mass murder rate was 0.0042 incidents per 100,000 people. New Zealand’s was 0.0050 incidents per 100,000 people. After 1997, both countries experienced similar drops in mass murders, even though New Zealand had not altered its gun control laws.

It would be just as misleading for gun control critics to cite only New Zealand as it is for gun control advocates to cite Australia.

The right approach is to look at a lot of similar places and see what gun control measures actually made a difference. To do just that, Bill Landes of the University of Chicago and I collected data on all multiple-victim public shootings in all the United States from 1977 to 1999.

We examined 13 different gun control policies, including: waiting periods, registration, background checks, bans on assault weapons, the death penalty, and harsher penalties for committing a crime with a firearm.

But only one policy reduced the number and severity of mass public shootings: allowing victims to defend themselves with permitted, concealed handguns.

Since 1950, all but six U.S. mass public shootings have happened in areas where general citizens were banned from having guns. And in Europe, every single mass public shooting has occurred where guns are banned.

Killers have good reason to avoid places where people have guns. In dozens of cases concealed-carry gun permit holders have stopped mass public shootings. In the Texas church shooting last year, the killer was killing the wounded when a man living near the church shot him.

Yet gun control advocates keep focusing on laws that won’t make any difference. None of the mass public shootings since at least 2000 would have been stopped by universal background checks.

Relying on Australia requires a misreading of the evidence, and requires that we ignore what has happened in all the other countries with strict regulations. The truth is that gun control hasn't worked for anyone."

“You don’t shoot up a high school without thinking about it for a very, very, very, long and dark time,” said Dr. Jordan Peterson, a psychologist at the University of Toronto. “You go places when you’re doing that that no reasonable person would ever want to go.”

After the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., many have blamed lax gun control laws and an inadequate mental health support system for why there is an uptick in mass shootings.

But experts say there are other factors to consider.

The phenomenon of mass school shootings, and the apparent uptick in them in recent years, occurs as violent crime rates have been declining.

A confluence of factors may be contributing to it.

For one, gender is a big factor.

“An epidemic of nihilistic hopelessness,” Peterson said. “Not just young men, young people in general, but young men are more likely to act it out in a violent manner.”

There is also a contagion effect of mass shootings. Killers know they’ll get the nonstop attention from media outlets — attention they so crave, and often miss out on, in life.

“It’s so spectacular. It gives particularly resentful people who are lost and aiming down, $100 million of free publicity. The stakes are very high. It’s not like they’re ill-informed about their predecessors. There’s an element of competition to this,” Peterson said.

He suggests media ban the names of such killers and limit the coverage of them to help stem the contagion.

Some believe the roots of the mass-shooting phenomenon may lie in the 1960s Cultural Revolution. That epochal time brought welcome change to discrimination against women and minorities. But many contend it led to the tossing out of deeply imbedded traditions of Western Culture from art, architecture, literature, family structure, and traditional roles.

“It’s almost impossible to express how much more important it is to be a mother or a parent who guides rearing and development of a child than it is to be a mere research scientist,” Yale University computer sciences professor David Gelernter said.

Gelernter is blunt about his belief that the ‘60s revolution replaced rigorous scholarship in the American academy with dumbed-down curricula — hurting even Ivy League students.

“They don’t know anything. We’ve given ourselves a pass in educating and rearing them as result of the Cultural Revolution,” he said.

Gelernter argues in his book, “America Lite,” that, as in totalitarian states like Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and Communist China, American academia underwent a purge of tradition which filtered down through secondary schools — through art, media, and even the family structure.

“We’ve done enormous destruction. We’ve wreaked havoc with our children and our children’s children,” he said.

Now, into a second generation of the students taught this way, secondary schools have more to contend with than they can handle.

“They’re called on to act as parents to those children whose parents aren’t acting like parents. They’re called upon to be psychologists and judicial agents and all of these things, and they simply can’t do it,” Peterson said.

Many feminist critics say the revolution hasn’t evolved enough — that young men and boys are governed by a “toxic” kind of masculinity.

“The man’s fear that he’s losing his power, and because minorities and women are taking higher positions and have more power (than) white men and men in general, they are afraid that they’re going to lose their strength and their virility,” Kathy Areu, publisher of Catalina Magazine, told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson recently.

Peterson and Gelernter believe gun control and mental-health debates that arise with inevitable predictability in the aftermath of a mass shooting can wait.

A higher priority, they say, is to fix the culture and broken boys with time-tested ideals of masculine role modeling, responsibility and sacrifice — as well as the Judeo-Christian ethic upon which Western Culture was built.

“The human need for religion is more desperate than it has ever been. Science, cosmology is every bit as relevant as it’s ever been, and yet we allowed cynics in philosophy and science to drive us away from our roots,” Gelernter said.

Peterson sends this plea to adults who would help disoriented youth: “They need to have one person in their life, one straight arrow that flies true to orient themselves properly. If they don’t have that, they can be easily lost.”

Peterson’s new book addresses this phenomenon, in part: “12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos” rocketed to No. 1 on Amazon on Jan. 16, its first day of release, and has remained in the top-two spots ever since."
fox66,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",2018-03-02 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/02/school-shootings-prompt-more-teachers-to-consider-carrying-guns.html,"Kasey Hansen didn’t like guns.

The special education teacher from the Salt Lake City region didn’t grow up in a family with guns, and had never gone hunting. She certainly didn’t think guns had a place schools.

“I was honestly scared of guns. I thought that they would just randomly go off, and that they were dangerous,” Hansen told Fox News.

But the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, which left 20 students and six staff members dead, changed her mind.

“I did not go into teaching thinking about a shooting in my school,” Hansen said. “But holing up inside a classroom and hoping the shooter doesn’t see you didn’t seem like a good idea. So I decided to take a class to get a concealed carry permit.”

Sandy Hook affected other teachers and school officials across the country, and sparked a national debate around the idea of arming educators. That debate has reignited in the weeks since 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people with an AR-15 assault rifle in his former Florida high school.

“When you have these shootings it’s about the high number of casualties, and these shooters think they’re successful when more people die,” said a language arts teacher from rural Ohio, who asked not to be named. “But we can stop them and if I can save the life of just one student than I think it’s worth carrying a gun.”

Gun rights advocates say that since the Sandy Hook massacre, the number of individual teachers and school districts interested in arming themselves on campus has risen exponentially, with some programs having to put interested applicants on a waiting list to meet the demand. But if a teacher who gets a concealed carry permit can actually carry a weapon in school varies widely, depending on the state they work in.

There are about 10 states that allow concealed carry weapons on school campuses. In Utah, for example, state law allows Hansen to possess a concealed firearm, even though her school doesn’t officially condone it.

And while the majority of states have laws prohibiting anyone from carrying a gun on school property, there are a select few, like Ohio and Missouri, where school districts can supersede state law and permit their staff to carry guns.

“We looked at other options such as having a resource officer here fulltime but they were all cost prohibitive,” Aaron Sydow, the superintendent at the Fairview R-XI School District in Missouri, told Fox News. “We decided to go ahead with the program and now we love it and stand by it.”

Gun rights advocates argue a teacher with a gun is not only a deterrent to a school shooter, but also the first line of defense in protecting students.

“The general public thinks that we’re just standing outside the doors of schools handing out guns,” Dean Rieck, the executive director of the Buckeye Firearms Association, told Fox News. “But we’re not trying to turn teachers into cops. We’re looking to give them the tools to save lives before the professionals arrive.”

Rieck and other pro-gun advocates noted the training teachers receive goes far beyond that of most local law enforcement agencies. The training includes not just basic gun skills and target practice, but everything from how to make a tourniquet and stanch a bullet wound to unorthodox shooting stances and SWAT team maneuvers.

Depending on the school district, teachers undergo between 40 and 150 hours of training before they can carry a concealed weapon on campus. They must also be able to hit a target with 90 percent accuracy. Most local police forces require only a 70 percent rate.

“If people could see the training we do and the depth of what we learn, I think that they would think differently about arming teachers,” said the Ohio language arts teacher.

And to even qualify for the programs, a teacher must undergo a mental health evaluation with a psychiatrist, already have a concealed carry permit, and be able to pass random drug screenings.

“Teachers have to know how to be able to take care of a problem and how to use force,” Sydow said. “Even if the ultimate goal is that nobody has to use it in school.”

The idea of concealed firearms in schools has faced opposition from a diverse array of groups – including many teachers unions and law enforcement groups – who argue more guns in school will do nothing to prevent these shootings.

“There is just not enough evidence to support the idea that a teacher would be able to neutralize a threat,” Amy Klinger, the director of programs at the Educator’s School Safety Network, told Fox News. “What makes us think that a social studies teacher can do something that law enforcement has troubled doing?”

New York City Police Department Commissioner James O’Neill is one of the most high profile cops to speak out against arming teachers, calling the proposal “not a good idea” during a press conference last week.

“Let teachers teach,” he said, according to the New York Post. “Having a gun, it’s a big responsibility. You have issues of safeguarding the weapons, you have issues of training. This is what law enforcement does, and you should leave it to law enforcement to protect the children of New York City.”

Klinger seconded O’Neill’s comment and added there are other safety concerns that should be addressed before school decided to put guns in the hands of teachers.

Among the changes Klinger suggested were better mental health programs in schools, and implementing systems to identify students who potentially pose a threat, better building and perimeter security on campus and changing the arrival and dismissal procedures.

Teachers and school officials in districts that allow concealed carry firearms don’t disagree with Klinger that there are other issues at play. But they say arming educators is something that can immediately make a difference – particularly when other tactics fail.

“Guns are just one aspect of the 20 different solutions to this,” Hansen said. “We want to nip the problem in the bud before a shooting happens.

""But look at what happened in Florida. Everyone knew what he was capable of, and he still was able to get into the school and take innocent lives.”"

I don’t like to speak out at these times, because as Ecclesiastes correctly tells us there is “a time to every purpose under the heaven,” including “a time to mourn.”

But then someone kicks me in the shin.

This time it was CNN media reporter Brian Stelter, saying on CNN’s “New Day” program Wednesday that the National Rifle Association and gun owners don’t want to tell the truth about guns.

No, the truth that is many in the media refuse to cover the truth about guns and the gun cultures in America. They don’t want to admit there are two wildly different gun cultures in our country. One is the freedom-loving, gun-rights culture that upholds the responsible use of guns for hunting, sport and self-defense. The other is the criminal culture that thrives in the places where government restricts gun rights.

Not acknowledging that the two cultures exist separately, and instead pretending legal gun owners are responsible for crimes committed by the illegal gun culture in America, isn’t just a lie. It is getting good people killed.

In the most recent mass murder last week at a Florida high school, where 14 students and three adults were killed, the FBI failed in its responsibility – not guns or gun owners. That was hardly an anomaly. In many other cases a murderer should have been denied legal access to guns, but the bureaucracy failed us.

In other cases, from Columbine High School in Colorado to the Pulse nightclub in Florida, law enforcement opted not to charge in to stop the carnage. They had their own safety in mind, but nevertheless this tells a person who carries concealed that they can’t depend on law enforcement during such a scenario.

And no matter how good a job law enforcement agencies do, police cannot be everywhere at all times when criminals may decide to begin murdering innocents. Because of this, disarming responsible and law-abiding gun owners to take away their ability to defend themselves and others is dangerous, and can result in greater loss of lives.

Meanwhile, the big lie being pushed in the media is that guns and the freedom enjoyed by America’s more than 100 million law-abiding gun owners are somehow to blame for murders. That narrative alienates gun owners and misdirects resources away from solving real problems.

America’s gun owners aren’t the problem. They are allies in the fight to stop criminals who use guns.

Blaming guns also isn’t rational. First of all because guns don’t commit crimes all by themselves, but also because rifles of all types are used in less than 3 percent of murders each year in the U.S., according to FBI uniform crime reports.

Semiautomatic firearms aren’t even new – they are a late 19th century invention. The AR-15 (called an “assault weapon” in the media, though that is a meaningless political moniker) was first sold to U.S. citizens in 1963, the same year the U.S. Army began buying M16s from Colt.

Semiautomatic firearms – pistols, rifles and shotguns – are the most popular sold today for hunting, self-defense and target shooting. As the 1994 law banning assault weapons showed, there is no real way to even define what constitutes an “assault weapon,” other than by deciding to ban whatever looks scariest to some lawmakers.

So how do we stop more murderers?

First, by working with America’s many gun owners. Blaming freedom for the actions of criminals is just nonsensical. It also misdirects resources and, if that ideology gets its way, simply reduces the freedom of the law-abiding citizenry – not the criminals who by definition will break the law.

When we stop blaming legal gun owners and guns for murders we’ll be left, by the process of elimination, with those who are really to blame: criminals, some of whom are mentally ill.

We’ll also have to acknowledge that good citizens are being harmed because they aren’t allowed to carry arms for their own defense in some areas of this otherwise free country.

Such a change, which actually has been taking place, causes the big, responsible gun culture in America – the one that bought the millions of legal guns over the last decade as violent crime rates fell – to invade the areas where the illegal gun culture dominates, because laws prevent good citizens from utilizing their rights.

This would also allow us to stop wasting energy in this endless loop of blame. We do need to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The National Shooting Sports Foundation and the NRA are for this; in fact, there is bill right now working its way through Congress designed to do this.

Other things also need to be done, such as firing whoever didn’t pass the tip about the accused Florida killer being dangerous to the FBI’s Miami field office. Changes must be made to be sure agencies tasked with protecting us act more competently.

Of course we’ll never stop all murderers, whether they are committed by terrorists, bank robbers or the mentally ill. But it would help if we could channel our attention and resources toward criminals and the mentally ill who are a danger to themselves or others – not the good citizens who live across this great nation."

On Wednesday, Lawrence attended the New York preimere of her film, and she told the Associated Press that a division between the entertainment industry and politics is needed.

“I think that, you know, we’re the entertainment industry. At some point, there has to be a separation between politics and the entertainment industry or we’re going to suffer,” she said. “This is, it’s an art. And it’s an art to entertain and, as an industry, we will suffer and people need to take that responsibility on themselves.”

The ""Hunger Games"" actress went on to say, “The same kind of violence is in different parts of the country that don’t have as many problems as we do.""

Lawrence, who is no stranger to using firearms in films such as ""Winter's Bone"" and ""X-Men"" then clarified, “I think the problems is guns not the entertainment industry.”

Though the star decided to vocalize her opinion on gun violence, in the March issue of Vanity Fair, Lawrence admitted that she tries her best to stay away from politics.

“I’ve always thought that it was a good idea to stay out of politics,” the actress said in the spread. ""My family obviously hates every time I talk about politics because it’s hard to see your kid get criticized and they live in Kentucky, where nobody is really liking what I’m saying.""

But the actress recently announced that she plans to take a break from acting for the next year in order to focus on local political work.

""I'm going to be working with this organization as a part of Represent.Us ... trying to get young people engaged politically on a local level,"" the 27-year-old Academy Award winner told Entertainment Tonight in February. Lawrence went on to clarify that her involvement in the organization does not deal directly with party politics.

""It doesn't have anything to do with partisan [politics],"" she said. ""It's just anti-corruption and stuff trying to pass state-by-state laws that can help prevent corruption, fix our democracy."""

Kevin Torres, 18, was believed to have killed Tania Arbaiza, 37, before killing himself, Denver Police said.

The Denver Post reported Torres and Arbaiza appeared to have split days before the incident according to some cryptic social media posts.

Torres posted on Facebook Monday, “Sometimes you gotta give up on people. Not because you don’t care but because they don’t.”

Arbaiza shared a message on Facebook from another social media user on Feb. 20 that read, “When you have a good heart, help too much, trust too much, give too much, love too much, this is what happens.” The post also had an illustration of a boy with sharp objects drawn to his back.

The teen’s last Facebook post on Monday contained four drawings of grim reapers and read, “Sacred death will never abandon him and will be with him forever.”

Torres was slated to be sentenced Monday for a “felony trespassing conviction,” the Denver Post reported. He was arrested on May 26 on robbery charges and later pled guilty to “a reduced charge of trespassing.”

""While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday.

Sanders said the president has spoken to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, about a bill to “improve federal compliance with criminal background check legislation.”

Trump has said on social media he wants to “be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on Mental Health.” He's also said tackling background checks is an issue that needs both Republican and Democratic support.

During an emotional listening session at the White House this week with parents and students impacted by school violence, Trump promised to be “very strong on background checks.”

Here’s a look at how the federal background check system currently works, and what experts and activists have to say about it.

What happens when you want to purchase a gun?

In order to purchase a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer (FFL), a consumer must provide identification and pass a federal background check using the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ 4473 form.

The first page of the document requires basic information, including the buyer’s full name, address, sex, birthday and ethnicity. A Social Security number is encouraged, but not required.

The form also asks the buyer about criminal background, immigration status and mental health — information that could result in a consumer being denied. Those questions include:

Have you ever been convicted in any court of a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could have imprisoned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation?

Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug or any other controlled substance?

Have you been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions?

Have you ever been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence?

Lying on the federal form is a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, an ATF spokesperson confirmed to Fox News. That penalty is also listed at the top of the form.

Once the form is completed, the dealer will submit it to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) online or by phone. Then, almost immediately, the licensed seller will know how to continue with the sale:

Proceed: If NICS indicates the seller can proceed, then the sale can continue.

Canceled or Denied: Should NICS mark the form as “canceled” or “denied,” the seller cannot legally sell the firearm to the buyer. Michael Smith, the vice president of marketing and media for Upstate Armory Group, a firearm dealer in Simpsonville, S.C., told Fox News he generally provides the customer with contact information for a local lawyer who handles restoration of firearm rights in case the failed background check is erroneous. There have been times police have arrived at the gun shop to arrest the customer who legally cannot purchase a gun, Smith said.

Delayed: If the background check elicits a “delayed” response from NICS, the seller cannot complete the transaction for at least three business days. Unless a specific “denied” designation is issued, the seller will be able to complete the transaction with the customer after that period elapses, under federal law.

Even before a 4473 form is filled out, Robbie Wheaton, vice president of the Wheaton Arms Inc. gun shop in Piedmont, S.C., said he takes note of the customer. If a customer seems to be intoxicated or “shady” – talking, for instance, about a cheating spouse – dealers don’t have to sell that person a gun.

“A shop has a final right to say ‘no’ based on a person’s behavior whether they will sell a firearm to them or not.” - Robbie Wheaton, vice president of Wheaton Arms Inc. in South Carolina

“As a federal firearms licensee, we have the right to be able to refuse the transfer of firearms to someone,” Wheaton told Fox News. “A shop has a final right to say ‘no’ based on a person’s behavior whether they will sell a firearm to them or not.”

Smith praised the background check system, as it can flag other discrepancies for sellers, such as an age issue.

South Carolina law, for example, prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from purchasing a long gun (such as an AR-15) and anyone under 21 from buying a pistol, handgun or other firearm, he said. The background check can prevent sellers, particularly at hectic gun shows, from accidentally selling a firearm to someone who isn’t of age, Smith said.

Why do I have to complete the background check?

Thanks to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, the FBI created the NICS in 1998. The system is supposed to instantaneously let a firearms dealer know whether a buyer is legally allowed to purchase the gun.

According to the FBI, more than 230 million checks have been made by cashiers prior to a purchase and more than 1.3 million denials have been issued since the system was put in place.

Is this process the same in every state?

No.

In South Carolina, for example, consumers who already have a concealed weapons permit do not need to go through a background check in order to purchase a firearm in the state, multiple dealers in the Palmetto State told Fox News.

Also, state laws may be superseded by federal law. The 4473 form asks consumers about marijuana use. Those who use the drug, in states where recreational or medicinal use is legal, will be denied a firearm, Wheaton said.

In Hawaii, after the first legal medicinal marijuana dispensary opened in the state in 2017, local law enforcement agencies asked users who are also gun owners to turn in their firearms within 30 days, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.

Is this system strong enough?

It depends on who you ask.

Jonas Oransky, the deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, praised the background check system but said it has “significant gaps.”

Specifically, Oransky’s organization points to a “private sale loophole.” Federal law requires licensed dealers to complete background checks, but people can also purchase guns from a private seller – such as a friend or through online classifieds websites like ArmsList.com. (ArmsList.com prompts users to “accept” a terms of use document, which acknowledges the website doesn’t certify or investigate transactions and instructs users not to use the site for “illegal purposes.”)

“It doesn’t matter necessarily if people are selling at scale,” Oransky told Fox News. “It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller.”

Wheaton, who has been in the firearms business full time since 2007, said he and other licensed sellers try to persuade customers to transfer guns through a licensed dealer so a background check can be conducted.

Oransky also pointed to the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed – when NICS marks a document “delayed” but does not approve or deny it within three business days. He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers, citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency.

“The FBI should have the time they need to complete a background check. It’s more important than expediting sales to people who shouldn’t have a gun,” he said.

On the other hand, Second Amendment advocates argue that the background check system already does too much.

“We don’t think it’s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit, told Fox News.

“Our rights are listed in the Bill of Rights for a reason,” he continued. “People’s rights are being infringed upon and it’s resulting – in some cases – in death and in other cases extreme inconvenience in being able to purchase firearms.”

Pratt also said the background check system doesn’t do its job, as several of the more recent mass shooters in the U.S., including the suspect in the fatal shooting of 17 people in Parkland, Fla., were able to pass background checks.

fox71,[],2012-12-28 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/28/teachers-in-utah-ohio-get-free-gun-training.html,"Gun-rights advocates in Utah offered six hours of training Thursday in handling concealed weapons for hundreds of Utah teachers in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.

The latest effort to arm teachers to confront school assailants was organized by the Utah Shooting Sports Council, which hosted the training session to help educators become eligible for concealed firearm permits, FOX 13 News reported.

More than 200 teachers flocked to the training class in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City. Raye Ann Blauer, a kindergarten teacher, told FOX 13 she is considering using her permit to carry a firearm at school.

“[A]fter everything that happened in Connecticut, I want to be aware of how I can help in the classroom and protect my kids and whatnot. Be aware,” Blauer said. “I think it’s really smart. Especially with everything that’s happened lately.”

English teacher Kevin Leatherbarrow holds a license to carry a concealed weapon and doesn't see anything wrong with arming teachers in the aftermath of the deadly Connecticut school shooting.

""We're sitting ducks,"" said Leatherbarrow, who works at a Utah charter school. ""You don't have a chance in hell. You're dead -- no ifs, ands or buts.""

In Ohio, a firearms group said it was launching a test program in tactical firearms training for 24 teachers. The Arizona attorney general is proposing a change to state law to allow an educator in each school to carry a gun.

The moves come after the National Rifle Association proposed placing an armed officer at each of the nation's schools after a gunman on Dec. 14 killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

There are already police officers in some of the nation's schools. Parents and educators, however, have questioned how safe the NRA proposal would keep kids, whether it would be economically feasible and how it would alter student life.

Some educators say it is dangerous to allow guns. Among the dangers are teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and accidentally or purposely shooting classmates.

""It's a terrible idea,"" said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education. ""It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.""

Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could, but legislators left them with no choice. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from imposing their own gun restrictions.

Educators say they have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate 1 percent of Utah teachers, or 240, are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many do so at school.

Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of deadly shooting that took place in Connecticut.

""We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls"" for an armed intruder, said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's leading gun lobby. ""They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter"" breaks into a classroom, he said.

The council said it would waive its $50 fee for the training. Instruction will feature plastic guns and a major emphasis will be for people who are facing deadly threats to announce they have a gun and retreat or take cover before trying to shoot, he said.

""Mass shootings may still be rare, but that doesn't help you when the monster comes in.""

At the class, teachers offered their fingerprints for a permit as an instructor in the ""psychology of mass violence"" kicked off the gun class.

""I just bought a bra holster,"" said Jessica Fiveash, a 32-year-old Utah teacher and wife of a retired Army sergeant who grew up shooting and said she had no hesitation packing a gun at school. ""Women can't really carry a gun on their hip.""

Utah is among few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws.

Leatherbarrow said he often felt threatened while working at an inner-city school in Buffalo, N.Y., where he got a license to carry a pistol. He moved less than a year ago to Utah, where he feels safer.

But he said gun violence can break out anywhere. He said he was highly trained in handling guns -- and was taking criticism from parents who don't appreciate his views on school safety.

""I'm in agreement not everybody should be carrying firearms in school. They're not trained. But for some parents to think we're cowboys, that frustrates me,"" he said. ""I wish parents would understand.""

Cavalier Knight applied for a gun permit from the New York City Police Department in 2014. He went to court when the application was denied. He claimed the NYPD violated his Second Amendment rights.

But in a decision posted Friday, a judge rejected that claim while upholding New York’s tough gun control law, the New York Daily News reported Saturday.

Manhattan State Court Judge Michael Stallings said the NYPD was not infringing on Knight’s constitutional rights by refusing to let him bear arms on sales calls.

The independent arms merchant argued that without a gun it would be easier for criminals and terrorists to steal his goods.

“That claim is based upon pure speculation, which is unsupported by any evidence,” the judge said.

Knight is a New York City resident and sells weaponry through Armored Mobility, a California firm.

The NYPD denied Knight’s application, saying that he had been selling firearms without incident for years and that he failed to show he’s in more danger than others in his profession."

1,992,219 checks were conducted through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, last month. The number represents an increase of nearly 200,000 checks, or more than ten percent, over September 2015. September is the 17th month in a row to set a new record within its month, a streak dating back to May 2015.

The FBI’s accounting of how many NICS checks were processed in a month is considered one of the most accurate metrics for judging gun sales. Virtually all sales made through licensed gun dealers must include a NICS check. Some states require sales between private parties to include an NICS check as well.

The number is not a one-to-one measure, however.

“These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS,” a note on the FBI report cautioned. “They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.”

3-D industrial printers that can create plastic models and prototypes can make workable guns that can't be picked up by metal detectors, and officials say they could pose a threat to countless government institutions, schools and other buildings.

A longtime ban on undetectable firearms is scheduled to expire Dec. 9 and two Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer of New York and Bill Nelson of Florida, have called for a ban on plastic guns. Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., also has introduced legislation on the issue.

""The expiration of this law, combined with advances in 3-D printing, make what was once a hypothetical threat into a terrifying reality,"" said Schumer. ""We are actively exploring all options to pass legislation that will eliminate the problem.""

In a meeting with reporters Wednesday, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said plastic guns present a special challenge for law enforcement agencies.

The agents said that in order to comply with current law, a person manufacturing a gun must use a certain amount of metal in the finished product so that the firearm is detectable by scanners at airports, federal buildings, sporting events -- any place where security screening is in place. If the law expires, someone could legally make and sell firearms that are undetectable.

A loophole in the existing law allows someone to make an illegal gun legal by simply attaching a removable metal piece to the weapon. That piece could be removed if someone wanted to sneak the weapon into a protected location.

Israel's legislation would require certain major components of a gun be made of metal.

The Wall Street Journal reports ATF agents said there are not any known instances of a person being shot with a plastic gun in the U.S., nor are there criminal investigations open involving one.

Additionally, officials do not believe there is a risk that street criminals will be able to mass produce guns using 3-D printing technology, as the printer required to produce a gun can cost more than $100,000 and quality varies.

""This is more for someone who wants to get into an area and perhaps be an assassin,"" Richard Marianos, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the Wall Street Journal. ""Or they want to go to a courthouse and shoot a witness.""

ATF spokesman Christopher Amon said that the agency does not comment on specific legislation, but provides technical advice and assistance to members of Congress and their staff on a variety of firearms-related issues.

The Justice Department has not weighed in on the issue.

As a firearm owner myself, I wear this description proudly.

Gun ownership is not a special privilege reserved for a select few. It is a constitutionally protected freedom to which the government should be completely colorblind.

I am not the only one. There are approximately 300 million privately owned firearms in the United States; a number that rises by 10 million annually. And those of us who clung to our Second Amendment rights before are keeping an even tighter grip today as the Obama administration continues its efforts to chip away at these fundamental freedoms.

Gun ownership is not a special privilege reserved for a select few. It is a constitutionally protected freedom to which the government should be completely colorblind.

In the years since President Obama made those telling remarks, he has proposed bans on so-called “assault weapons” and high capacity magazine clips; publicly opposed bipartisan, House-passed legislation to free up public lands for recreational hunting; and his handpicked Attorney General oversaw the illegal transfer of some 2,000 firearms across our border into Mexico as part of the failed “Operation Fast and Furious.”

Our conservative majority in the House of Representatives has stood firm in its opposition to proposals that would erode our Second Amendment freedoms. But we all know that, in the absence of help from Congress, the Obama administration has never been shy about using its infamous pen and phone to rewrite the rules on its own terms.

Such was the case with a quietly issued 2012 rule by the president’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to revise its Form 4473 – a document that must be completed by both the seller and buyer as a part of most gun sales. The modified form now requires customers to separately list their race and ethnicity.

Besides being highly intrusive, many find the similar back-to-back questions to be just plain confusing and, as a result, check one box or the other instead of both. This is considered an ATF violation and, when a gun dealer is audited, could result in the loss of their license.

Forcing gun retailers to collect racial data on every last customer – and issuing steep penalties to those that do not – is shameless backdoor gun control and a stunning privacy violation to boot. To make the situation even more insulting to gun owners, the ATF cannot rightly say what the information is used for in the first place.

When Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) wrote the ATF last year asking for what purpose the data was collected, its response was to note that it has required some form of race information since 1968 – in other words, “this is how we have done it all along,” and to pin responsibility for the latest change on a Clinton administration-era directive from the Office of Management and Budget that was supposed to be implemented nearly ten years earlier.

This year, the ATF fine-tuned its talking points, telling The Hill that the race and ethnicity data “can be helpful when tracing firearms used in crimes.” There’s just one problem with that logic – it directly contradicts the agency’s claims last year when it assured Americans that it has “never compiled or maintained [race information] in any database.”

Confused yet? You’re not the only one. This lack of explanation from ATF has even drawn the ire of traditionally left-leaning groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, and I believe it deserves a response from Congress as well.

Gun ownership is not a special privilege reserved for a select few. It is a constitutionally protected freedom to which the government should be completely colorblind. That is why, with the help of Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas), I reintroduced the Freedom from Intrusive Regulatory Enforcement of Arbitrary Registration Mandates (FIREARM) Act. This simple, one-page bill would prohibit the federal government from requiring Americans to disclose their race or ethnicity in order to purchase a gun.

Washington may not be able to agree on much these days, but protecting our Second Amendment should be an area of broad consensus. Law abiding citizens should never have to play a game of 20 questions with Uncle Sam just to access this basic right.

I hope my colleagues will give the FIREARM Act the consideration it deserves so that we can reverse this latest regulatory overreach and ensure that fairness and privacy are upheld in our nation’s gun laws.

Earlier this year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge's decision against the 2009 Montana Firearms Freedom Act. The law attempts to declare that federal firearms regulations don't apply to guns kept in the state where they were manufactured.

Other pro-gun states have passed similar measures.

The Justice Department has argued successfully that the courts already have decided Congress can use its power to regulate interstate commerce. Some gun-control advocates sided with the federal argument, saying ""firearm freedom acts"" would allow felons to obtain guns without background checks and make it harder to trace guns used in crimes.

Gun advocates have long said only the Supreme Court can decide the case because it will have to limit the reach of Congress to regulate guns. The Supreme Court is expected to decide next year whether to accept the request.

The advocates, led by the Montana Shooting Sports Association, have had legal support from the attorneys general from the pro-gun states of Montana, Utah, Alaska, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. States that have formally passed a version of Firearms Freedom Act include Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Tennessee, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.

MSSA president Gary Marbut has said he wants to manufacture a small, bolt-action youth-model rifle called the ""Montana Buckaroo"" for sale in Montana. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told Marbut such a gun would be illegal under Montana law, prompting a lawsuit by the group against the U.S. attorney general.

Marbut said high court decisions dating back to 1942 dealing with certain interstate commerce need to be reversed. The request to the Supreme Court argues the rulings have allowed more concentration of power with the federal government, creating problems like more national debt and the potential for abuses of power.

""Without the centralization of so much regulatory power in the federal government, tyranny would be a lot less likely to occur,"" the argument reads."

Cheese appears to have taken the kid-friendly chain’s “no guns” policy too far, refusing to serve a police officer who entered the restaurant with a firearm.

The gun-toting officer encountered the problem at the Chuck E. Cheese in the Greenwood Mall in the city of Bowling Green, prompting outrage from some people, including a sheriff from a neighboring jurisdiction, WBKO-TV reported Friday.

""I was upset,” Edmonson County Sheriff Shane Doyle told the station. “I was shocked for that officer and also for all the patrons there because you know if you have an obvious police officer and they're wearing police clothing, then I don't understand what the problem would be having someone like that with the training and experience of a police officer [coming] into an establishment.""

Chuck E. Cheese’s national headquarters called the situation an unfortunate misunderstanding.

""Our firearms policy does not apply to officers in uniform. We do have a no firearms policy for civilians and off-duty non-uniformed officers, but officers in uniform are always welcome to bring in their firearms,"" Chuck E. Cheese spokeswoman Alexis Lynn told the station.

But what constitutes a uniform? The officer refused entry was wearing a marked police polo shirt.

Doyle said that shouldn't have been an issue.

""I've seen Bowling Green officers in polos many times in my history working in law enforcement, and obviously I recognize that person as a sworn employee,"" he said.

Besides, the sheriff said, Kentucky state law permits police officers to carry their weapon in most locations regardless of whether they were on duty or not.

""The state law allows us to carry concealed anywhere in the state of Kentucky except for federal buildings, that's basically the only place,"" he said.

Doyle told the station he still plans to take his family to the Bowling Green Chuck E. Cheese, but he added that everybody “needs to understand that somebody who is trained and qualified to carry a weapon, they’re there to help people.”"

Compton’s debate centers on a new presence on city school properties this academic year – AR-15 semiautomatic rifles.

School board officials this summer approved a policy that allows school police who pass a screening to carry AR-15 rifles in their patrol cars during the time they are working, according to KPCC, a Southern California public radio station.

""This is our objective—save lives, bottom line,"" Compton Unified Police Chief William Wu told the board, according to KPCC.

Critics of the policy call it excessive. They say there is no justification for police providing security around schools to carry high-powered weapons.

""The school police has been very notorious in the community and in reality has never had to shoot anyone before,"" said Francisco Orozco, described by KPCC as a recent Dominguez High School graduate and founder of the Compton Democratic Club. ""So this escalation of weapons we feel is very unnecessary.""

The city of Compton is predominately Latino. Hispanics make up some 65 percent of the community, followed by African-Americans, who are about 33 percent.

Wu maintains that police can be helpless when faced with a mass attack, such as a terrorist one or a school shooting.

Perpetrators in such cases, Wu said, often wear body armor that is impervious to routine weapons. The AR-15, he added, is also more accurate.

""Handguns you'd be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards,"" Wu said. ""With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can be go 50, 100 yards accurately.""

A CNBC story from last year about the growing popularity of the AR-15 described it as the weapon that “is at the heart of the gun control debate.”

""The AR-15 is, essentially, a gun that was designed to inflict maximum casualties, death, and injury, in close to medium range. That's what it does,"" CNBC quoted gun control advocate Tom Diaz as saying. ""The real problem is that we allow that kind of firepower to come into a theater or into a first-grade class.""

But a defender of the AR-15, Steve Sanetti, president of the National Sports Shooting Foundation, told CNBC: ""It's a question of cosmetics. It's not a question of functioning. The rifles are sane, safe, reliable types of firearms used by millions of citizens for lawful purposes. They are not just killing machines.""

Orozco told KPCC that the district should devote more attention to more common security problems on school grounds.

He also expressed concern about a lawsuit by parents of district students that said that Compton school police profile minority students.

""The school police has not even earned the right to carry handguns,"" Orozco said.

In a Facebook exchange with the Compton Democratic Club, the Compton School Police Officers said they “are not planning to attack the Galaxy of Teachers and Students” with the AR-15 rifle. They also noted that some five other school districts in California allow such weapons.

“If we encounter an active mass murderer on campus with a rifle or body armor, our officers may not adequately be prepared to stop that suspect,” the message said. “School Police Officers will undergo a training course, followed by a shooting proficiency test on a firing range and a written exam… The safety of our Students, Staff, and Parents are very important to us.”

Stafford, 42, of upstate Schenectady, N.Y., won the assault rifle during a pre-announced raffle at the March 23 service at Grace Baptist Church in Troy, where pastor John Koletas preaches that the constitutional right to bear arms shall not be abridged.

On Monday, Stafford was on his way to pick up the gun -- valued up to $1,200 -- after a federal background check.

""I’ll plead the Fifth on that,” Stafford joked when asked if the AR-15 was his first gun. “I’m on my way to pick it up right now, and to meet the pastor.”

Stafford, who works in sales, said he went to the service “on a whim” and didn’t expect to be selected. Three other people were initially picked, but Stafford walked away with the gun because they had already left the service, which drew roughly 150 congregants.

“Actually, I went on a whim; I wanted to see what this was all about,” he told FoxNews.com. “I found out about it about a month ago and I wanted to exercise my God-given right.”

[pullquote]

Koletas, who could not be reached for comment, reportedly received death threats due to the giveaway, but won’t be deterred – he’ll actually be giving away another free AR-15 during a service late Monday.

“My peace I give unto you,” reads a flier promoting the event, quoting the Gospel of St. John. “Qualified attendees will receive a legally-modified AR-15 … All giveaways are absolutely free to enter (attendance required).”

All winning applicants will be subject to a federal background check, must be age 18 or older and provide a valid driver’s license. The church also reserves the right to deny anyone of “questionable character,” according to the flier.

“We have the Constitution to protect us,” Koletas told parishioners during the service, according to the Albany Times-Union. “But we have our liberty to protect ourselves.”

Koletas declined to elaborate on details of the alleged death threats he received and indicated he had not contacted authorities.

“I don’t need the police to protect myself,” he told the newspaper.

A large portion of the church’s budget was used to purchase the gun and to promote the event, said Koletas, who declined to give specifics.

Bob Gray, a retired pastor from Texas, spoke during Sunday’s service and is scheduled to appear again on Monday. Republican Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin also attended Sunday’s event, WNYT.com reports.

“Yes, it is unusual,” McLaughin told congregants. “Is it illegal? Absolutely not. And it’s not unethical either. And the people have every right to support the Second Amendment. I hope everybody does.”

Gray raised some eyebrows during the service when he told the crowd — some 75 of whom registered for the drawing — that he had a concealed weapon amid the pews.

“And listen up, reporters,” Gray said, according to the Times-Union. “It’s not registered.”

Some churches in Kentucky have also been using guns to attract new members. Earlier this month, churches in Paducah — where three students were killed during a school shooting in 1997 — hosted “Second Amendment Celebrations.” At Lone Oak First Baptist Church, roughly 1,300 people crammed into the church hall for a steak dinner and pep talk by gun expert Chuck McAlister, who was hired by Kentucky’s Southern Baptists to grow membership. Twenty-five guns were raffled off during the dinner and winners were required to pass a background check.

""I brought a gun with me tonight,"" McAlister told the group, according to NPR.org. ""I know that's very controversial.""

Mayor-elect Martin Walsh came out against the plan over the weekend. The Boston Police Department had been pushing for a limited number of officers to carry the high-powered rifles, in light of recent mass shootings as well as the Boston Marathon bombing earlier this year.

But after the incoming mayor initially stayed mum on the idea, a spokeswoman for Walsh said he's not on board -- not yet, anyway.

""Mayor-elect Walsh is opposed to the AR-15 rifles,"" spokeswoman Kathryn Norton told FoxNews.com in an email. ""Unless otherwise convinced by the Boston Police Department, he does not think they are necessary.""

Police officials had pushed for the rifle purchases in response to mass shootings like the one in Newtown, Conn. The Boston Marathon bombing happened after the plan was already in the works but nevertheless fueled the proposal.

One unnamed officer told the Boston Herald, which first reported Walsh's stance on the issue, that ""it gives you at least a fighting chance if you go into something where suspects have more firepower than you.""

Under the plan, according to MyFoxBoston.com, the city would buy 33 AR-15 rifles, at $2,500 apiece. They would go to two trained officers in all 11 districts of Boston.

But the plan needs the mayor's sign-off, and a number of critics had spoken out against the idea, questioning whether giving officers such rifles would increase the chances of innocent people getting shot.

""I don't believe arming them with assault weapons is going to make them any safer,"" City Councilor Charles Yancey said, according to MyFoxBoston.com."
fox83,[],2016-06-23 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/23/facebook-scraps-gop-congressional-candidates-ar-15-giveaway-posts.html,"A Florida congressional candidate said Wednesday his contest to give away a semi-automatic rifle is still on despite the original post being taken down by Facebook.

Greg Evers, who is running in the Republican primary for the open seat in Florida’s 1st District, announced Monday he’s giving away a “Homeland Defender” AR-15 rifle on July 4.

But Monday night, Facebook pulled a post about the contest showing the rifle after receiving numerous complaints for ""promoting graphic violence"" and ""describing the purchase or sales of drugs, guns or regulated progress.""

Facebook flagged another post sowing the rules for entering the contest.

Last January, Facebook imposed a policy barring private individuals from advertising or selling firearms on the social media network.

Evers’ campaign said someone in California reported the post. Brian Burgess, a campaign spokesman, said they had anticipated someone would object but that likes and shares are still being tracked.

The original post received more than 1,100 likes and nearly 900 shares.

Evers said on his Facebook page Wednesday that he’s become a target for gun advocates.

The custom-built rifle will be given away at random person who shared and like Evers’ page or signed up on his campaign website. It’s open to only adults in the district who must pass all required background and security checks.

As of Wednesday, Evers' page had received over 4,800 likes and nearly 2,100 shares.

Evers' promotion came barely a week after a shooting at a gay nightclub killed 49 people in Orlando, a roughly five-hour drive from the Florida Panhandle district Evers seeks to represent. Gunman Omar Mateen used a semi-automatic rifle that was mechanically different from an AR-15 but had similar design features.

""The giveaway is tasteless, disrespectful and disgusting political pandering at its worst. He should be ashamed,"" said Stratton Pollitzer, deputy director of the gay and transgender rights group Equality Florida. ""Giving a complete stranger the same style assault rifle just used to murder 49 people, most of whom have not yet even had funerals, is grotesque.""

This is not the only contest involving an AR-15 in a congressional race. Tennessee state representative Andy Holt is giving away two rifles during an event Saturday with candidates for that state's 8th Congressional District.

In 2014, AR-15 rifles were part of giveaways in at least three U.S. House or Senate races.

Evers is one of five candidates running in the Aug. 30 Republican primary for the seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Miller. Evers has served in the Florida Legislature since 2001, including the Senate the past six years. The National Rifle Association has given him an A-plus grade for the past 15 years.

In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, ATF Director B. Todd Jones said all types of the 5.56 military-style ammo used by shooters pose a threat to police as more people buy the AR-15-style pistols.

""Any 5.56 round"" is ""a challenge for officer safety,"" he said. Jones asked lawmakers to help in a review of a 1986 bill written to protect police from so-called ""cop killer"" rounds that largely exempted rifle ammo like the 5.56 because it has been used by target shooters, not criminals.

His agency's move to ban the 5.56 M855 version was condemned by the National Rifle Association and majorities in the House and Senate and as a result was pulled back though not abandoned. At the hearing Jones said that nearly 90,000 comments on the proposal were received, many negative."

Fugate says the decision of whether or not to charge the Rev. Jeremy Lucas, of Christ Church Episcopal Parish in Lake Oswego, would fall to the local district attorney's office.

San Diego-based U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez ruled that the ban approved by the Legislature and voters last year takes away gun owners' Second Amendment rights and amounts to the government taking people's private property without compensation.

""Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of otherwise law-abiding citizens will have an untenable choice: become an outlaw or dispossess one's self of lawfully acquired property,"" Benitez wrote.

California law has prohibited buying or selling the magazines since 2000, but until now allowed those who had them to keep them.

He issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law from taking effect while he considers the underlying lawsuit filed by the National Rifle Association-affiliated California Rifle & Pistol Association.

“The State of California’s desire to criminalize simple possession of a firearm magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds is precisely the type of policy choice that the Constitution takes off the table,” the injunction read.

Meanwhile, a Sacramento-based judge on Thursday rejected a similar challenge by several other gun owners' rights organizations, creating what Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, called ""dueling opinions"" that may be sorted out on appeal.

""Unfortunately this law will be delayed but we are confident it will go into effect, and soon,"" he said.

He called the San Diego lawsuit and ruling part of an effort by the NRA ""to delay and dismantle California's law brick by brick.""

Had the ban taken effect, owners would have been required to get rid of their magazines by sending them out of state, altering them to hold no more than 10 bullets, destroying them or turning them into law enforcement agencies. Possession could have been punished by $100 fines or up to a year in jail.

Owners can now keep the magazines until a final ruling by Benitez or if an appeals court overturns his injunction, said Chuck Michel, attorney for the NRA and the California Rifle & Pistol Association.

""This court recognized that the Second Amendment is not a second-class right and that law-abiding gun owners have the right to own these magazines to defend themselves and their families,"" Michel said.

State lawmakers approved the ban last year as part of a package of bills adding to what already were some of the nation's strictest gun laws. Voters agreed in November when they approved Proposition 63, a measure that toughened the penalties by allowing violators to be fined or jailed.

Benitez said he was mindful of voters' approval and government's legitimate interest in protecting the public but added that the ""Constitution is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.""

Gun owner's constitutional rights ""are not eliminated simply because they possess `unpopular' magazines holding more than 10 rounds,"" he wrote in a 66-page decision.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra criticized the decision but did not say what he will do next.

""Proposition 63 was overwhelmingly approved by voters to increase public safety and enhance security in a sensible and constitutional way,"" Becerra said in a statement. ""I will defend the will of California voters because we cannot continue to lose innocent lives due to gun violence.""

Supporters say that magazines often holding 30 or 100 bullets are typically used in mass shootings and aren't needed by hunters or civilian owners.

""Clearly it escalates the lethality in any mass shooting when high-capacity magazines are involved,"" said Amanda Wilcox, a spokeswoman for the California chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence whose daughter was fatally shot.

Forcing assailants to change magazines more frequently gives victims time to flee or subdue the shooter, Becerra argued in court filings.

Moreover, the government wouldn't own the magazines in the way it would property seized for a new highway or public building, he argued, since the magazines would be destroyed by law enforcement agencies.

Becerra said opponents' Second Amendment challenge has repeatedly been rejected by other courts, allowing at least seven other states and 11 local governments to already restrict the possession or sale of large-capacity ammunition magazines.

The company, Black Rain Ordnance, said the rifle would eliminate features that were made illegal under the SAFE Act. The gun will not have a pistol grip and will include a non-threaded muzzle and a 10-round low-capacity approved magazine.

""With the continual trampling of the 2nd Amendment in New York, Black Rain Ordnance is proud to announce their 'New York Compliant' rifles,"" the company said on its website. ""These rifles feature all of the quality and craftsmanship of the standard BRO-lines, but with the added features that allow for legal possession.""

The Journal News reported that Just Right Carbines, a New York-based gun manufacture, has been producing a carbine rifle since August that complies with the SAFE Act. The grip was modified to comply with the law.

""Everybody is doing basically the same thing, which is basically adopting a stock that was originally produced for the California market and basically adopting that stock for the New York market,"" Testa told Gannett's Albany Bureau.

Testa added that the company has sold about 100 of the weapons since August. State police have not said that the modified weapon is non-complaint, according to the report.

Supporters and opponents of the law held dueling rallies in Albany on Tuesday, with Donald Trump and Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino declaring that the law prohibiting the sale of some popular guns like the AR-15 goes too far and should be scrapped.

The law bans the sale of some semi-automatic firearms and requires those who already own one to register them by April 15. It also bans high-capacity magazines, requires federal background checks on private gun sales and imposes felony penalties for illegal gun possession.

The new gun control proposals announced Tuesday include requiring gun owners to use gun safes or trigger locks when storing a gun, a 10-day waiting period before a buyer can take possession of a gun, and a rule that would prohibit anyone from buying more than one handgun a month.

The terror network managed to make its own tunnel-boring machine (see photo above), a hideous but effective part of the group's arsenal.

The discovery of the ISIS machine is credited to the Iraqi Army’s 9th Division, after which Devin Morrow, a technical adviser with Conflict Armament Research, analyzed the machine.

Most days Morrow dons a bulletproof vest and ventures to the front line of Iraq's battle against ISIS to inspect the latest spoils of a grinding and bloody war.

The 30-year-old Canadian woman is tasked with analyzing seized weaponry from ISIS -- piece by piece -- and uncovering its source and pathway to the terrorist network.

Much of the illegally traded weapons are small arms but some -- like the ISIS-made tunnel machine -- demonstrate a level of sophistication never seen before by such a group, according to Morrow.

""It's quite unprecedented, the level at which ISIS is able to create its own ammunition and weaponry,"" Morrow told Fox News.

""We don't see this quality of production in other conflict zones,"" said Morrow, whose U.K.-based company traces and documents illegally diverted weapons in conflict zones like Iraq, Syria, Somalia, South Sudan, Libya and Yemen.

Once a weapon is captured from ISIS, Morrow and her team begin their investigation -- snapping photographs of the items and examining each weapon's markings and serial number.

""We don’t rely on secondary information. We spend a lot of time out in the field,"" she said. ""It does get scary. Anything can happen at any time and it's important to remember that.""

Hundreds of seized weapons are variants of the AK-47, which Morrow described as highly versatile and easily trafficked.

""They last a long time. They’re very durable,"" she said of the high-powered assault rifles. ""Variants of the AK-47 are very widely used in the Middle East. The main producers are former Soviet countries and Russia. They have been around for decades and they're everywhere.""

Expand / Contract Mauser ammunition from 1935 Nazi Germany that was captured from ISIS near Kirkuk in 2014. (Conflict Armament Research )

Some of the ISIS items discovered by Morrow are old -- including ammunition found in northern Iraq in 2014 that was made in Nazi Germany.

""It just shows you how far that ammunition can go,"" she said.

Expand / Contract ISIS-produced bombs (Conflict Armament Research )

Other weapons and equipment are more recently produced, including those made by the terror network itself. Among such findings are ISIS-made mortars and IEDs.

Morrow and her team have also uncovered a ""suicide vehicle"" she referred to as the ""SVBIED."" ISIS fighters, she explained, are taking civilian cars and SUVs, loading them with explosives and then covering the vehicles with heavy metal plates that help them get close to the front lines.

""They’re taking these regular cars and trucks from civilian people in Mosul and doing extensive modifications on them to make them into suicide vehicles,"" she said.

The terror group also is using tunnel-boring machines to dig extensive tunnel systems between houses and underneath roads to confuse coalition forces, according to Morrow.

""They built that machine themselves,"" she said of the tunnel machine found in Hamdaniyah late last year.

The Battle of Mosul is a joint offensive by Iraqi government forces with allied militias, the Kurdistan Regional Government and international forces to retake the northern Iraqi city from the Islamic State. The offensive began in October 2016.

For Morrow, the tracking of illegal weapons is only one part – albeit a critical one – in defeating the enemy on the ground.

""Our group actively tries to document individual items. That’s the first step in decreasing the proliferation of illegal weapons,"" she said.

""By creating this database and by understanding corridors and trafficking among regions – where the weak parts are around the world – then we can create more robust and responsible international arms policies.""

Morrow – a Western woman in Iraq in a male-dominated field – said there is no other work she would rather be doing.

""It can be trying if you’re working with a bunch of guys – it can be a little bit stressful – but I feel very well respected and no one has ever questioned my role and my experience being there,"" she said. ""My team is incredibly supportive.""

The “Assault Weapons Ban of 2018” bill was formally introduced Monday by Democratic Reps. David Cicilline, of Rhode Island, and Ted Deutch, whose Florida district is where a gunman killed 17 people with the kind of semi-automatic rifle the bill aims to ban.

“Now is the time for action,” Deutch tweeted. “Let's start by ridding our streets of assault weapons. These are weapons of war made for the sole purpose of killing people. Most Americans support the assault weapons ban. It's time for Congress to listen to them and pass sensible legislation.”

The bill, as of Tuesday afternoon, was sponsored by 164 of the chamber’s 192 Democratic members, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other members of her leadership team.

Deutch has publicly urged House Speaker Paul Ryan to allow members to vote on gun-control measures. And he’s vowed to work with anyone in Congress -- “Democrats and Republicans, to take meaningful action on gun safety.”

The bill itself would seek to “regulate the importation, manufacture, possession, sale or transfer of assault weapons,” according to the text. The measure is just one of several introduced this week to curb gun violence.

However, Ryan on Tuesday appeared to rule out consideration of anything resembling a gun ban.

“We shouldn't be banning guns for law-abiding citizens. We should be focused on making sure those who shouldn't get guns don't get guns,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We want to listen to kids but want to protect people’s due process rights while making sure people who shouldn't get guns don't get them.”

The Wisconsin Republican vowed to still “have the conversations we need” with members to ensure “this doesn't happen again.”

House leaders on Tuesday also nixed an attempt by California Rep. Mike Thompson, who leads House Democratic efforts on firearms, to consider a special resolution to force the GOP-controlled chamber to “immediately consider gun-violence legislation.”

Ryan and his leadership team are also arguing the House has already passed legislation to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which flags dangerous gun buyers before they can make such purchases.

They point out that the chamber also has passed legislation dealing with mental-health problems, often a factor in mass shootings. Both of those measures are now being considered in the GOP-controlled Senate.

Still, Ryan and his team, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, on Tuesday directed much of their focus toward the breakdowns in law enforcement during the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla.

“There was a colossal breakdown,” Ryan said. “We need to get to the bottom of how breakdowns occurred -- from the armed officer in the school at the time to the FBI failing to follow up on a profound tip.”

Scalise, who is still recovering from gunshot wounds he suffered in a June 2017 mass shooting while practicing with colleagues for a charity softball game, said he has talked with some of the surviving Florida students.

“There was talk about breakdowns at various levels of government, but ultimately we talked about our shared experience,” said Scalise, whose life was saved by officers who killed the shooter in last year’s attack.

“What angers me most is when I see breakdowns with law enforcement. The FBI had [the shooter’s] name on a silver platter. He himself said he wanted to be a professional school shooter. It was posted under his name and turned over to the FBI,"" continued Scalise, R-La.

Ryan said that as a parent he supports the suggestion by President Trump to have trained teachers with a concealed weapon in classrooms, to prevent similar incidents -- but that the issue should be addressed by states, local governments, school boards and other parents."

The recording, first released by the Associated Press on Thursday, is reportedly one of several from Havana that first led investigators to believe a sonic weapon was involved.

Of Americans affected in Cuba, not all of them reportedly heard the sounds. But some who did said, while not identical, that the recording was relatively consistent with what they heard.

“That’s the sound,” one witness said.

US EXPELS CUBAN DIPLOMATS FROM EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON

The recording, which has not yet provided much insight about what is harming diplomats, has been sent to the U.S. Navy for further examination. The Navy has advanced capabilities for analyzing acoustic signals.

It is unclear whether the sounds are directly responsible for the attacks, which have been shown to cause hearing, cognitive, visual, balance, sleep, and other problems.

At least 22 U.S. Embassy workers were injured in the attacks that began last year in Havana.

As a result, the U.S. has pulled 60 percent of its government employees out of the country. It also expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the embassy in Washington D.C.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the move was made because Cuba had failed to protect American diplomats on its soil.

""Until the government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,"" Tillerson said.

US TOURISTS BACK FROM CUBA CLAIM SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO MYSTERIOUS ATTACKS

The Cuban government has denied all knowledge or involvement in the attacks, calling the U.S. move “hasty” and “irresponsible.”

The State Department also issued a warning to American tourists, urging them to stay away from Cuba, saying that the U.S. cannot guarantee that individuals staying at Havana hotels would not also be harmed.

Some U.S. tourists have since complained of symptoms similar to those experienced by government workers.

The recording was shared with workers at the U.S. Embassy in order to teach them what to listen for.

Because of the limited information available, the U.S. government has only been able to advise workers that if they think they’re being attacked, they should move to another area because the attack is unlikely to be able to follow them.

It appears serene and picturesque, but those workers are rushing to salvage Iraq’s deteriorating Mosul Dam – which was once under ISIS control and straddles the Tigris River just 40 miles upstream from the city of Mosul.

Failure to reinforce and maintain the dam could mean unleashing what is, in effect, a potential weapon of mass destruction.

“When we started, the risk assessment regarding the potential fate of the dam was very high. And ISIS had stolen everything that was here,” Carlos Morales, deputy project manager for Trevi, the Italian company awarded the repair and maintenance contract to prevent catastrophe, told Fox News on a recent exclusive visit to Mosul Dam.

The dam, the largest in the country with the capacity to hold 3 trillion gallons of water, controls the flow of the Tigris River north of Mosul and supplies electricity to more than a million residents. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that if the dam ruptures, it will send floodwaters crashing more than 200 miles downstream – swallowing villages and much of Mosul City with waves as high as 80 feet. In addition, floodwaters could reach as far as Baghdad and potentially result in the loss and displacement of millions of lives and up to $20 billion in damages.

Furthermore, a 2015 study from the European Commission’s Science Center concluded that even a partial fissure that released just one quarter of its full capacity would be disastrous. The concern even prompted an urgent memo from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in March 2016, cautioning Americans to “avoid areas within three miles of the river and have a plan in case of emergency.”

Progress is being made. Since the emergency work began just over a year ago, some 15,000 metric tons of cement have been poured into the 370-foot structure and more than 150 miles of electrical grids have been installed. Also, some of the “critical grouting,” the pumping of a mixture of clay, water and cement into the dangerously soft bed of gypsum on which the dam wall rests has been completed. Another year of critical grouting is planned.

The dam, which has been a cause of concern since it was built in 1984 and known at the time as the “Saddam Dam,” was captured by ISIS in August 2014 in the early onslaught of the terror group. Although it only controlled the area for 10 days before being run out by Kurdish and Iraqi forces, the massive structure has deteriorated badly as it has not received mandatory maintenance from either ISIS or, subsequently, coalition forces.

AFTER ISIS CAMPAIGN, IRAN-BACKED FIGHTERS IN IRAQ VOW TO DRIVE OUT US TROOPS

The Trevi Group is calling its work a “success” -- so far -- yet the intense pace of its work must be maintained for the sake of scores of lives downstream of the dam. The Iraqi government has not yet officially renewed the group’s contract, which the Iraqi government says was worth about $300 million and funded in large part with a loan from the World Bank. That contract expires this spring.

Discussions are underway about continuing the Trevi partnership into 2019, as the Iraqi government has acknowledged ongoing risks to the dam, an officials with the Corps told Fox News.

“Some grouting results look promising, but uncertainty will remain until grouting efforts have progressed across the full length of the dam,” the representative of the Corps said. “The Ministry of Water Resources has concluded that a second year of grouting and training is necessary.”

The Trevi contract also came with the Italian government’s promise to deploy 450 troops to guard the vulnerable area while repairs are underway. Along with protecting workers, the soldiers – led by the Praesidium Task Force of the 3rd Alpine Regiment of the Italian Army – have been training Iraq’s counterterrorism forces and have implemented initiatives to support the local hospitals, schools and families inside the small villages that make up the Mosul Dam community.

“We’ve been cooperating with the Italian taskforce with the objective of protecting the dam and the people around it,” explained Iraqi counterterrorism leader, Maj. Ahmed. “But the idea long-term is for us not only to help in a military way, but in a humanitarian way, too.”"

Not just in the sheer number, but in the wide range of types of weaponry.

On the smaller scale, there were pistols and rifles. In two crucial historic shifts, the Army made a radical change in sidearms and introduced a new pistol and the Marines took the Armed Forces lead in adopting a new magazine that eliminates jamming and will save many Marine lives in the future.

There was also a boom in excellent concealed carry options for personal and tactical professional use. With several of the legendary American gunmakers celebrating anniversaries and iconic history, special editions of rifles with meaningful significance were also big alongside innovation for rifle use in law enforcement and military scenarios.

New Army pistol

In future battles, U.S. soldiers will have a new sidearm for personal protection. The Army’s new pistol may see more action than the last thanks to a design that has great potential for offensive purposes like close quarter combat.

The Sig Sauer 9mm XM17, and the more compact version XM18, are replacing the M9 as the Army’s service pistol. At the end of 2017, the Army began fielding the first Sig Sauer XM17 Modular Handgun System (MHS) sidearms.

This is the first change in about three decades since Beretta’s M9 was first introduced as the Army’s sidearm in the Cold War era back in 1986. For all the details: Meet the US Army's new pistol

The U.S. Army has revealed a new holster that soldiers will rely on when drawing their new pistols.

North Korea continues to threaten the United States with a nuclear attack. In the Cold War era, the deterrence approach could be described as the bigger the nuclear bomb, the better.

Are new mini nukes the right solution instead for today’s threats? Building a new type of nuclear weapon, mini nukes, is under consideration by the White House.

America’s nuclear arsenal

In 2017, America’s vast nuclear arsenal was regularly in the spotlight.

But what exactly does President Trump have at his disposal in terms of nuclear weapons?"

The man, who was being interviewed by the Minneapolis Police Department, started hurting himself with an “edged weapon,” Fox 9 reported. Officers tried “to subdue the adult male subject” but ultimately had to discharge their weapons, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said.

The interview room where the incident unfolded is reported to be the location of the department’s “investigation units.”

Minneapolis Police said the incident has been “contained” and noted “there’s no threat to the public.” Several officers involved in the incident have been put on paid administrative leave.

Paramedics reportedly took the man to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. His condition is unclear.

The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating the incident. Arrandondo said police obtained video of what transpired.

McMaster said Saturday the threat of North Korea launching a nuclear weapon at the U.S. or another rival nation is “impossible to overstate” and repeated that a preemptive military strike remains an option.

“It’s impossible to overstate the danger associated with a rogue, brutal regime,” McMaster told Hugh Hewitt on the conservative commentator’s MSNBC TV show.

“Are we preparing a plan for a preventive war? … The president has been very clear that he’s not going to tolerate North Korea being able to threaten the U.S. … So of course we have to provide all options to do that, and that includes a military option.”

Still, he said the United States would like to resolve the situation “short of what would be a very costly war.""

The retired Army general said President Trump has been ""deeply briefed"" on the strategy on North Korea.

Tensions have mounted with Pyongyang's two recent successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles. And Trump has sought help from China and South Korea toward de-escalating the situation.

In the interview, McMaster spoke about several problem spots around the world, including Iran and Venezuela, where residents fighting against an oppressive regime have also raised concerns about U.S. military intervention.

The U.N. Security Council was expected to vote on a new sanctions resolution that would increase economic pressure on North Korea to return to negotiations on its missile program.

McMaster said “democracy is now over in Venezuela” but significantly downplayed the potential of a military operation from neighboring countries or the United States.

“I don’t see an outside military intervention,” he said

McMaster also reiterated that Trump doesn’t like the so-called Iran nuclear deal, brokered by the former Obama administration and that eases billions in economic sanctions on the rogue nation.

The deal eases the sanctions in exchange for Iran scaling back its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

McMaster said Trump thinks Iran has already violated the spirit of the agreement, pointing to the country’s support of the Assad regime in Syria. However, he declined to say whether the U.S. will exit the agreement after an upcoming 90-day review.

Footage recently emerged of North Korea paratroopers jumping out of what seems to be two 70-year-old Antonov An-2 transport aircrafts.

While the concept of Pyongyang using these Stalin-era planes seems far-fetched considering the nuclear weapons at its disposal, the aircrafts could be North Korea’s most deadly weapon.

The dated aircraft raisesthe concern that they could be used to transport a nuclear bomb to be dropped quite easily without triggering any radar at any specific target.

According to several reports, the North Korean army has a fleet of 200 Antonov An-2 aircrafts. They were first “introduced” in 2015, but disregarded as obsolete by many.

However, what makes them so dangerous is that they have an incredibly low radar profile, meaning they are difficult to track using conventional aircraft.

The Drive reported the aircraft fly at such a slow speed and low altitude that modern surface-to-air missile systems would have a very hard time detecting and engaging them.

The aircraft, initially designed as a crop duster and utility transport, can land on short sections of a road that would make disembarking soldiers quite easy and sneaky.

According to the BBC, the Antonov An-2 first flew in 1947 as the Soviet Union was rebuilding after the end of World War II. Aside from its remarkable short take-off and landing, it can basically fly backwards.

“The reason the An-2 still flies is that there is really no other aircraft like it,” aviation writer Bernie Leighton, who has flown in an An-2 in Belarus, told the BCC. “If you need an aircraft that can carry 10 soldiers, people or goats, that can take off from anywhere and land anywhere ‒ it is either that or a helicopter.”

The Soviet Union built more than 10,000 airplanes before it fell in 1991."
fox98,[],2017-04-04 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/04/timeline-syrian-chemical-weapon-use.html,"Chemical weapons have killed hundreds of people since the start of Syria's civil war, with the U.N. blaming three attacks on the Syrian government and a fourth on the Islamic State group.

Syrian rebels and opposition activists say pro-government forces have used chemical weapons and bombs containing chlorine on numerous occasions. They say a chemical weapons attack on a town in northern Syria on Tuesday killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied ever using such weapons.

Here is a timeline of events related to chemical weapons use in Syria.

Aug. 20, 2012: U.S. President Barack Obama says the use of chemical weapons would be a ""red line"" that would change his calculus on intervening in the civil war and have ""enormous consequences.""

March 19, 2013: The Syrian government and opposition trade accusations over a gas attack that killed some 26 people, including more than a dozen government soldiers, in the town of Khan al-Assal in northern Syria. A U.N. investigation later finds that sarin nerve gas was used, but does not identify a culprit.

WHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS 'HEINOUS' ATTACK IN SYRIA



Aug. 21, 2013: Hundreds of people suffocate to death in rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital, with many suffering from convulsions, pinpoint pupils, and foaming at the mouth. U.N. investigators visit the sites and determine that ground-to-ground missiles loaded with sarin were fired on civilian areas while residents slept. The U.S. and others blame the Syrian government, the only party to the conflict known to have sarin gas.

Aug. 31, 2013: Obama says he will go to Congress for authorization to carry out punitive strikes against the Syrian government, but appears to lack the necessary support in the legislature.

Sept. 27, 2013: The U.N. Security Council orders Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, following a surprise agreement between Washington and Moscow, averting U.S. strikes. The Security Council threatens to authorize the use of force in the event of non-compliance.

Oct. 14, 2013: Syria becomes a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting it from producing, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons.

HEARTBREAKING IMAGES FROM SUSPECTED SYRIA GAS ATTACK

June 23, 2014: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it has removed the last of the Syrian government's chemical weapons. Syrian opposition officials maintain that the government's stocks were not fully accounted for, and that it retained supplies.

Aug. 7, 2015: The U.N. Security Council authorizes the OPCW and U.N. investigators to probe reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, as reports circulate of repeated chlorine gas attacks by government forces against civilians in opposition-held areas. Chlorine gas, though not as toxic as nerve agents, can be classified as a chemical weapon depending on its use.

Aug. 24, 2016: The joint OPCW-U.N. panel determines the Syrian government twice used helicopters to deploy chlorine gas against its opponents, in civilian areas in the northern Idlib province. A later report holds the government responsible for a third attack. The attacks occurred in 2014 and 2015. The panel also finds that the Islamic State group used mustard gas.

Feb. 28, 2017: Russia, a stalwart ally of the Syrian government, and China veto a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing sanctions against the Syrian government for chemical weapons use.

April 4, 2017: At least 58 people are killed in what doctors say could be a nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held Idlib province. Victims show signs of suffocation, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and pupil constriction. Witnesses say the attack was carried out by either Russian or Syrian Sukhoi jets. Moscow and Damascus deny responsibility."

Andy Grimm ""had his camera in his hand"" when he was shot in his side by a Clark County sheriff's deputy in New Carlisle, which north of Dayton, The New Carlisle News said in a Facebook post.

He was rushed to Miami Valley Hospital for surgery and is expected to recover.

Grimm had left the newsroom around 10 p.m. on Monday to take pictures of a lightning storm, the paper said. While he was taking pictures, a traffic stop occurred on the same road, according to the article.

""I was going out to take pictures and I saw the traffic stop and I thought, 'Hey, cool. I'll get some pictures here.'"" he told the newspaper. He said he pulled into a parking lot in full view of the deputy, got out of his Jeep and started setting up his tripod and camera. ""I turned around toward the cars and then 'pop, pop.""

The newspaper speculated that the deputy may have mistaken the camera for a weapon. Grimm said the deputy, identified in reports as Jake Shaw, gave him no warning.

""I was just doing my job,"" he said. ""I know Jake. I like Jake. I don't want him to lose his job over this.""

Sources told the newspaper that there was “some confusion” surrounding the shooting.

“I just talked to Andy and he said that he is very sore, but in good spirits,” Dale Grimm, the photographer's father and publisher of the New Carlisle News, told Fox News. “He said the hospital expects to be releasing him Tuesday. He also stressed that he does not want the deputy to lose his job over this.”

The Dayton Daily News reports the case has been turned over to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

“This is a small town. Everybody knows everybody. It was just a terrible misunderstanding,” his father said.

Detective Sgt. Aaron Steensma was shot in the chest, and Trooper Daniel Thayer was shot in the chest and hand, state police confirmed in a news release. The officers were outside a home in Union Township around 11:15 a.m.

""When troopers announced their presence prior to making entry into the residence, the suspect leveled a long gun at the officers. They were attempting to take cover when the detective sergeant was shot in the chest and a trooper received a grazing wound to the hand,"" an earlier release said.

Detective Sgt. Steensma remains in serious but stable condition at Borgress Medical Center in Kalamazoo, where Michigan State Police Director Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue said he's ""doing remarkably well for the seriousness of his injury.""

Trooper Thayer, who was shot in the chest and hand, was saved by his ballistic vest. Michigan State Police said all officials who responded to the incident were wearing body armor when they came under fire.

Officials confirmed the suspect, who was not idenified, is deceased. It's unclear how the suspect died.

Gov. Rick Snyder earlier Wednesday tweeted to ""Please keep [Steensma], his family and his colleagues in your thoughts and prayers. Thank you to all the men and women in law enforcement who are working hard to protect all of us every day.""

The search warrant police were serving was related to an investigation surrounding 62-year-old Duane Finney's 2009 shooting death, Fox 17 reported.

An investigation is ongoing.

Police Chief William McManus said shortly after the Sunday night shooting that the boy was shot in the leg and was expected to survive, but that two of the adults' injuries were life-threatening. He said investigators don't believe the shooting was random.

The child, two men and two women were sitting on a bench outside a Texas Roadhouse when they were struck by gunfire around 8:40 p.m., according to a preliminary police report released Monday

The suspect walked up to a nearby parking lot and fired multiple rounds from a handgun before fleeing, according to the report. Police said the suspect was about 15 feet (4.6 meters) from the front of the restaurant when he opened fire.

Police said the suspect hasn't been identified and remains at large.

The child and four adults were taken by emergency responders to University Hospital in San Antonio, while the fifth victim, a 27-year-old man, was later discovered at the hospital after transporting himself, according to the report. Police said the adults ranged in age from 22 to 50.

Police said Monday that they had no immediate updates on the victims' conditions. Citing hospital policy, a spokeswoman for University Hospital said Monday that she couldn't confirm whether the victims were being treated at the facility."

Despite the loud rhetoric from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, there are a core group of us who have served in multiple administrations, who hail from industries outside of Washington, who hold different points of view, who find ways to collaborate.

I am a registered Republican and have served four presidents, including one Democrat. And I also partnered with Michelle Obama’s office on Let’s Move anti-obesity campaign. Over the last 15 years as I built complex public private partnerships to help solve big problems, I succeeded by modifying Ronald Reagan’s 80/20 rule. I created my own 60/40 rule: if I agree with someone on 60 percent of the issues, we can agree to disagree on the 40 percent and focus our collective energy on areas of commonality.

I am by no means unusual among a strata of people who line up on one side of the aisle but find ways to work with the other side.

“Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it,” Mark Twain wryly noted. His observation is shared by many across the political spectrum with whom I have worked.

In 2009, 16 CEOs from consumer goods companies joined me as members of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation. Working collaboratively with public health agencies and the Obama administration, the conservatives and liberals among us joined forces to implement the largest voluntary food and beverage industry marketplace initiative, ultimately removing 6.4 trillion calories from the American diet by reducing the sugar and fat content of hundreds of products. In 2005, as U.S. Commissioner General I worked alongside governors – from both parties -- and the private sector. We overcame our ideological differences and many challenges and together launched the US Pavilion at the Aichi World EXPO, formerly known as the World’s Fair.

A similar approach is on display in any of a number of bipartisan commissions and blue ribbon panels that have toiled away on important issues as diverse as Social Security, biodefenses, tax reform and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Many are ongoing, at the state and federal level, even amid the rancor that permeates current politics. These efforts succeed because the end goal is what matters. Party ideology does not. Away from the fishbowl of D.C., the participants, whatever their affiliation, conclude that serving the nation eclipses serving as a party emissary.

“Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it,” Mark Twain wryly noted. His observation is shared by many across the political spectrum with whom I have worked.

The efforts I have worked on employ the principles of bipartisanship common in so many areas beyond politics -- in the office, at the doctor’s office, at the playground, at church and at home. We focus on personal consideration, listening and respect. We know that if we want succeed, we can’t expect others to approach the problem in the identical way, so it becomes imperative to do things differently. Turn the idea on its head. Think of new paths and be bold.

We politely keep commentary to ourselves unless it’s relevant to the discussion at hand. We focus on fixing the problem--no rat holes are allowed. Tension may reign at the beginning of each relationship as battle lines are quickly drawn and cynicism prevails, but soon data-driven progress brings a continuity of results, a collegial environment and a celebration of success. Over dinner or on the Acela, good humor prevails as we find ourselves sharing stories and learning about each other’s children, grandchildren, lives and challenges. We agree to disagree but commit to the facilitation of success. We become friends.

Ronald Reagan won the nation over with his sunny optimism. But we are in danger of losing the graciousness that Reagan epitomized in political discourse if we don’t pause and remember that the shouting on cable TV and the blogosphere is not the whole picture by a long shot.

Bipartisanship is not dead. It is alive, certainly not as well as it could be, and in need of further nurturing."

“I’m so grateful to be here. It wouldn’t be possible without the first responders and the amazing doctors and the love everyone has sent,” she said.

The high school junior sat just feet away from the doctors at Broward Health North Hospital in Deerfield Beach, who performed three surgeries on her within 48 hours, and the Coral Springs Fire Department lieutenant who was part of a team of five who triaged and rushed her to the hospital 11 miles away — an act that may have saved her life.

“I was sitting on my couch thinking of all the letters, love that was passed around. I wouldn’t be here without — I just want to send my love and appreciation,” Maddy said.

Her father agreed.

“I am grateful to be sitting here next to my daughter alive and well today, and there are a lot of people to thank for Maddy’s life, and four are right at the back of this room, these guys from the Coral Springs Police Department and Broward County Sheriff’s for pulling her out of the school and saving her life,” David Wilford said.

Maddy is one of more than a dozen students who were shot and survived the attack by former classmate, Nikolas Cruz. Seventeen other students, teachers and coaches died after police say Cruz opened fire with an AR-15 assault-style weapon, shooting more than a hundred rounds of ammunition in building 12. That building now is closed and is scheduled to be demolished.

Minutes after Maddy was shot, she was treated by Lt. Laz Ojeda, who after finding out her age, made a last-minute split decision to transport the teenager to Broward Health North, which is 20 miles closer than the hospital she originally was supposed to be transported to. It’s a decision that doctors say saved her life.

“When you see somebody in such a decompensated shock state, and you make the determination to take them to the closest trauma center and the doctor says that this saved her life, it validates the thought process of myself and the crew that was on that call,” Ojeda said.

“Maddy came in, she was pale, nonresponsive and in shock,” said Dr. Igor Nichiporenko, Broward Health North Medical director of Trauma Services. “Immediately she had to get a chest tube placement, because her wounds to her chest were very severe with massive bleeding.”

Despite three bullet wounds and three surgeries, Maddy is now out of the hospital and back home with her family. Doctors say besides occupational therapy on her right hand, Maddy physically could be ready to return to school next week. Doctors call it a miracle, but Maddy’s mom says her daughter’s resilience also may have saved her life.

“I can spend an hour talking about my daughter, I’m a little biased. She’s a fighter. She wants to heal, she wants to get better,” said Missy Wilford.

Maddy knows that’s her priority right now, and says she’s doing just that, thanks to support from her family, friends and community.

“Like my mom said, it’s times like these when I know we need to stick together. I’ve seen a lot of positive posts about what’s been going on at the school, and I’m so glad we are sticking together, that I am making a full recovery and everything’s been going so smoothly, and that’s all I have to say,” said Maddy, as her grateful father gently kissed her on the head."

The gunman's motive wasn't known but investigators believe it was an isolated incident.

""I want you to know right now that this has nothing to do with terrorism,"" Capt. Robert Plummer told reporters outside the scene of the shooting.

The shooting happened before 7 a.m. at Arizona Charlie's Decatur, which is located west of the Las Vegas Strip. According to police, the suspect, Christopher Olague, ran from the hotel-casino after the shooting and into a nearby neighborhood where he tried to enter two homes but the residents were able to keep him out.

Police found him in a laundry room accessible through a garage of the second home after he appeared to have shot himself in the head, Lt. Dan McGrath said.

According to McGrath, Olague tried to enter the first home with the intention of stealing a car and also tried to take a vehicle on the street.

Police described Olague's condition as a ""non-survivable wound.""

The victims' identities were not released. Police said the uniformed security guards were a man and a woman in their 40s and that one was armed. Their identities and their causes of death will be released by Clark County Coroner's Office.

McGrath said the circumstances of what happened in the hotel room still unclear.

The hotel-casino's office did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

The shooting comes a day before law enforcement officers expect tens of thousands of New Year's Eve revelers on the Strip and three months after the city dealt with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Officials have been trying to reassure residents and visitors that the city is safe, especially in the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting. A high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below. He then killed himself."

FBI spokeswoman Christina Garza told KPRC that multiple people, including two children, were inside the home in northeast Houston at the time the shots were fired. She declined to provide details of the shooting, citing an ongoing investigation.

An FBI agent involved in the shooting was placed on leave pending an internal investigation.

The Houston Chronicle reported that the unidentified victim was kidnapped from a home in Conroe Wednesday by two men with guns who forced their way inside. According to the paper, the victim's brother and 12-year-old son were bound with duct tape.

""[The kidnappers] were demanding money they were owed that nobody knew anything about,"" Conroe Police Sgt. Jeff Smith told the paper.

Smith added that the kidnappers claimed to have connections with a Mexican drug cartel, but noted there was no evidence that was the case.

""There are oftentimes claims of a cartel connection just to place a fear factor,"" Smith told the Chronicle.

After the victim's brother received a phone call demanding a ransom, police and the FBI were able to track the suspects to a Clear Lake hotel. Three people were detained and questioned, enabling police to locate the victim in the home.

Police told the Chronicle that a woman in the home was arrested and charged with aggravated kidnapping. Two men detained at the hotel were charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery. It was not immediately clear if more charges would be filed.

The dog, Gunner, had belonged to Bryan Vallandingham, a 14-year U.S. Army veteran in Richwood, Ky., who relied on the service animal for safety, Cincinnati's Fox 19 reported.

Gunner would alert Vallandingham’s family members whenever the disabled veteran was having a seizure.

“He would tell us by sitting in front of him by laying across him or just barking randomly at Bryan so he would notify us and give us time to get him in a safe situation so he wouldn’t hurt himself,” Vallandingham’s wife, Kimberly, told Fox 19.

The family said Bryan wasn’t doing well after learning of Gunner’s death, and has been having repeated seizures.

The family suspected Gunner had been stolen from their yard more than two weeks ago. One family member said they received text messages from a person who claimed to know where the dog was and demanded money, but the family refused.

Authorities are investigating if extortion is involved with Gunner’s disappearance and death."

Just minutes before the 10 a.m. shooting, Prentis Robinson had been to the Wingate police department and spoke with the chief about a cellphone that had been stolen from him, Wingate Police Chief Donnie Gay told WCCB-TV .

On a portion of the video, Robinson wore a hat and used a selfie stick to record himself talking and walking along a street in Wingate, which is about 30 miles southeast of Charlotte. At one point, he was heard saying ""You on live,"" apparently telling another person the conversation was being recorded.

The video showed Robinson was approached by someone who fired four shots with a long gun. The camera hit the ground after the shots rang out and showed sky and trees, and the gunman running away. A car pulled up and found Robinson.

Wingate University and Wingate Elementary School were placed on lockdown for a couple of hours after the shooting, although the shooting didn't occur on either campus.

Robinson's Facebook account described him as a musician who lived in Atlanta. According to public records cited by The Charlotte Observer , Robinson lived in Charlotte during the previous decade but spent much of his adult life in Wingate and graduated from a local high school."

Veteran officers Anthony Morelli, 54, and Eric Joering, 39, were killed in a gun battle with violent criminal Quentin Smith in the Columbus suburb of Westerville Saturday. The officers had responded to Smith’s home after a 911 hang-up call related to a domestic incident.

In subsequent 911 calls a female voice is heard crying as she identifies Smith as the man who shot the officers, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.

The caller says “please help, please help” and “my husband shot the police officers,” the paper reported.

She also says, “my daughter is in there.”

When she is asked where she is, the woman says she is hiding in the bushes.

Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said Sunday at a press briefing that Morelli and Joering exchanged gunfire with Smith after making contact with him.

Authorities said Smith was wounded and was being treated at a hospital. Late Sunday, they announced that he was charged with two counts of aggravated murder in the deaths of Morelli and Joering.

“The groups that we have been thinking about over the past 24 hours, of course have been the families of both officers,” Morbitzer said at police headquarters in front of makeshift-memorial for the officers.

Police released incident reports late Saturday showing police had been to the Smith home or had dealings with him several times since 2017, some for alleged domestic violence involving a woman identified in the reports as his 33-year-old wife, Candace Smith.

In a Nov. 29 incident, Candace Smith went to a police station and asked about protection orders because she said she and her husband weren't getting along and she discovered she had a sexually transmitted disease. She also told police that when she ""threatens to leave Quentin, he tells her that he would kill her, their daughter, and himself,"" the report said.

Candace Smith told police her husband ""has a gun that he carries all of the time, and if it isn't on him, it is close by."" Police were called to the home later that night to investigate a report of domestic violence.

TWO SLAIN OHIO OFFICERS WERE 'TRUE AMERICAN HEROES,' POLICE CHIEF SAYS

Police had been called to the home as recently as three weeks ago for a reported disturbance, the Enquirer reported. The home’s residents, however, told police at the time there was nothing wrong.

Smith had a rap sheet that included indictments for violent crimes like burglary, domestic violence and felony assault when he lived near Cleveland about a decade ago, Fox 28 Columbus reported. He had pleaded guilty to the burglary and domestic violence charges, and spent some time in jail, pending trial.

Joering had been a Westerville officer for 17 years. Morelli had been a member of the force for 30 years.

At Sunday’s news conference Morbitzer lashed out at people who were trying to benefit from the tragedy by establishing phony GoFundMe pages to solicit funds.

Chief Morbitzer also said people have been calling the police department screaming threats, obscenities and vulgarities. ""Quite frankly, there's a special place in hell for those people,"" he said. ""And my wish is that it comes very soon.""

Long Gun Beginnings

Even before there was actually a ""United States"" there was what could arguably be considered the first true ""American rifle."" Known as the Pennsylvania rifle, the Kentucky rifle or simply the long rifle, it was designed for hunting and was characterized by an unusually long barrel, a unique development that was uncommon in the European rifles of the era.

Military history consultant and former United States Marine Corps Captain Dale Dye told FoxNews.com that, in the flintlock era, the long gun was the first to have grooves in the barrel. ""These grooves, or rifling, along with the longer barrel, made the guns much more accurate than the British Brown Bess musket,"" he said.

HISTORY OF REMOTE WEAPONS IN PICTURES

The long rifle wasn't ever produced in large enough numbers to truly make a difference during the American Revolution, but its use by sharpshooters – such as members of Morgan's Riflemen at the 1777 Battle of Saratoga established the reputation of the American marksman.

The first truly big leap forward in long gun design came with the Caliber .54, Model 1841 Rifle, which was the first to utilize a percussion ignition system. The Model 1841 is sometimes called the Mississippi Rifle due to its use by a Mississippi rifle regiment during the Mexican War between 1846 and 1848. The regiment was commanded by future Confederate States President Jefferson Davis.

Davis, who served as Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce, also authorized the production of the .58 Caliber Musket, or Springfield Model 1861, the first rifled weapon to be produced for general issue by the U.S. Army. The Springfield Model 1861 would go on to be the most widely used U.S Army weapon during the Civil War.

HISTORY OF THE 'JEEP' IN PICTURES

The rest of the 19th century saw other innovations in rifle design including the Springfield Model 1873 ""Trapdoor"", a single shot weapon that was not without its problems, and later the Model 1896 Krag-Jorgensen, a reliable but underwhelming bolt action rifle.

Truly American Rifles of the 20th Century

The real change came with the Springfield Model 1903 – an American take on a European classic.

""The Springfield was patterned after the (German-made) Mauser action,"" said Dye. ""It didn't have an overly deep magazine, but it was accurate to 800 yards and could be fitted with a scope and used as a sniper version.""

HISTORIC TANKS IN PICTURES

The Springfield M1903 was the standard infantry rifle for all branches of the military during World War I, and was used widely during the early phases of World War II. It was replaced by what has been called one of the finest weapons of the 20th century, the M1 Garand, named after its inventor John Garand.

""This was the first successful semi-automatic used by any military,"" Dye told FoxNews.com. ""It is extremely rugged, extremely accurate.""

The M1 Garand, which will celebrate its 80th anniversary next year, was a significant improvement over the bolt action rifles of the day, which required that the weapon was manually cocked between each shot.

HISTORIC AIRCRAFT CARRIERS IN PICTURES

""This was really a game changer as it was semi-automatic and held eight rounds,"" R. Lee Ermey, better known as the ""Gunny"", former United States Marine Corps staff sergeant and host of the Outdoor Channel's “Gunny Time”, told FoxNews.com. ""It could be argued it helped win World War II.""

After the war the military planners sought to find a one-size fits all rifle, and the result was the M14, which was actually developed to replace four different weapons systems that included the M1 rifle, the M1 Carbine, the M3 ""Grease Gun"" submachine gun, and the M1918 Browning Automatic Bar (BAR). The upsized M1 had its fans, including the Marine Corps, which still issued one to each platoon in the Vietnam War.

""The M14 could hold its own against the bad guy gun, the AK-47,"" added Ermey. ""The problem is that it went with a smaller round than the M1, so it lost some of its punch.""

HISTORIC BOMBERS IN PICTURES

The M14 utilized the 7.62x51mm NATO round, or .308 caliber, which was too powerful for use in fully automatic mode as a replacement for a submachine gun, but yet too light to serve as a replacement for the BAR. In the end, however, the problem wasn't so much the gun, but rather the situation.

""It was a little too late for the changing tactics of the conflict,"" said Dye. ""The select fire didn't work out as well as planned. It had too heavy a cartridge for close-quarter fighting, and it made for a heavy weapon. While you are willing to trade weight for firepower, the rifle was not ideal for the situation in Vietnam.""

The irony is that the weapon that replaced the M14 proved not to be ideal at first either. The M16 had a rough baptism of fire, largely due to the fact that it was erroneously billed as self-cleaning and issued without cleaning kits.

SHOT SHOW 2016 IN PICTURES

""It had a turbulent introductory period,"" said Dye. ""The problem for the M16 is that it was introduced while fighting was going on, and this didn't allow for the familiarization period that small arms really need. As a result it cost lives, and that is what you don't ever want to do.""

The other problem with the M16 was the fact that military planners switched the ammunition to one that produced more fouling, and this resulted in jams. The rifle, however, was refined with the M16A1 version.

""The Americans don't have a good track record of backing up,"" Dye told FoxNews.com. ""With the M16 this meant improving it and it proved to be a reliable weapon.""

AUSA 2016: TANKS, TRUCKS AND MORE TECH

As the battlefield changed, the military adapted as well with the introduction of the M4 Carbine, a shorter and lighter variant of the M16A2. This has replaced the M16 in most U.S. Army and Marine Corps combat units as the primary infantry weapon today.

""Lightening the load has been the constant quest and the result is the slimmed down M16,"" said Dye. ""Engagement tactics said we didn't need the long-range weapon for combat.""

The other refinement of the M4 has been its modular design, which allows it to be fitted with numerous accessories including bipods, laser pointers, telescopic sights and even grenade launchers. However, even in the M4A1 version the military may not have found the definitive rifle for the next battlefield. While the M4A1 may be more lethal at close range, there is still a need for taking out targets at distance.

""The next challenge is going to be that long range rifle,"" said Dye. ""This isn't about arming everyone with it, or even making it a sniper rifle, but there is a need for long range shooting and that is going to be the challenge to find the next great long range weapon for the U.S. Army."""

“Let it be absolutely clear,” the organization said in a statement. “The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.”

The statement came two days after Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s executive vice president, delivered a fiery speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland.

The NRA, which represents about 5 million members, has faced public outcry following a mass shooting Feb. 14 in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people. That outcry has mostly taken the form of calls for gun control legislation and for boycotts of companies that partner with the NRA on discount offers and other consumer inducements.

On Saturday, United and Delta Airlines joined the list of companies separating themselves from the gun group. Previous companies to do so include MetLife, Symantec and rental car companies Hertz, Budget, Avis and Enterprise.

Those moves prompted Saturday's response from the NRA, which asserted that those corporations had “decided to punish NRA membership in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.”

NRA BACKLASH: THESE ARE THE COMPANIES CUTTING TIES

The NRA's statement argued that other factors besides gun ownership were to blame for events like the Parkland massacre.

“The law-abiding members of the NRA had nothing at all to do with the failure of that school’s security preparedness, the failure of America’s mental health system, the failure of the National Instant Check System or the cruel failures of both federal and local law enforcement,” its statement said.

However, the Washington Post reported that the NRA fought the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers, suing the federal government once the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was up and running. The NRA had argued that the entire law, including the NICS provision, be struck down as unconstitutional, the report said."

Deputies found Scott Edmisten, 43, of Johnson City, carrying a .357-caliber Magnum, a loaded .45-caliber semi-automatic, a .223-caliber fully automatic assault rifle, a .308-caliber fully automatic assault rifle, more than 900 rounds of ammunition, and survival equipment, Washington County Sheriff Ed Graybeal said.

Graybeal asked the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to help investigate, since the automatic weapons aren't registered and lack serial numbers. He told The Johnson City Press that Edmisten had apparently modified the AR rifles to make them automatics.

""Anytime you have several firearms and several hundred rounds of ammunition in a vehicle, that always causes a concern,"" said Michael Knight, an ATF spokesman.

Authorities still haven't determined why Edmisten was carrying all that firepower, but they ""don't see a connection"" to recent mass shootings, Knight said.

The arrest came a day after Stephen Paddock killed 59 people and wounded more than 500 in Las Vegas, firing down on a music festival crowd from a high-rise hotel suite. Some of the 23 guns in the suite were equipped with devices that enable a rifle to fire continuously, like an automatic.

""It's not connected to any of the other national incidents, but timing obviously was a concern,"" Knight said.

Knight said investigators are tracing where Edmisten's weapons came from.

""Our priority is reducing violent crime on the front end, so that's the other thing we're looking at, along with motive: Were these items going to be used for a criminal act or were they just being transported from one area to another area?""

Graybeal said Edmisten threatened his arresting officer and lunged toward investigators trying to question him. He's jailed without bond on charges of possessing prohibited weapons, speeding, and felony evading arrest. It's unclear if he has a lawyer.

The Winchester 1873 rifle was discovered in the Great Basin National Park leaning against a juniper tree in November. But the strange discovery has triggered more questions than answers.

“You have this gun that no one really knows what happened to it and it gets so much attention because of that,” said Ashley Hlebinsky, curator at the Cody Firearms Museum, in Wyoming.

“You have this gun that no one really knows what happened to it and it gets so much attention because of that.” - Ashley Hlebinsky

The gun was carefully collected and shipped to the museum, where its weathered wood was stabilized with an alcohol solution. A team of researchers carried the firearm to a local hospital to be X-rayed under the patient name “Rifle.”

Museum workers determined the rifle, which was massed produced and is billed as the “gun that won the west” was made in 1882 -- but there are no records to show who owned it.

Adding to the mystery, the gun’s lifter was removed so it was only capable of firing a single shot at once.

Researchers told FoxNews.com the area in Nevada where the gun was found doesn’t help the case either. There was never a recorded fire in the region, which would help them date the gun's presence at the tree, had it survived the flames. Archaeologists scoured the nearby soil for related clues but found nothing—especially not a body.

The Winchester rifle is currently being preserved and is on display at the Cody Firearms Museum, where it sits among 7,000 other guns. Hlebinsky said the Winchester is the star of the show.

“I think a lot of it has to do with the allure and the mystique,” Hlebinsky said. “Why was it leaning up against that tree, how long has it been there, who left it and why.”

And, folks are coming up with all types of scenarios about how it got there.

“A personal favorite of mine is ‘my ex-wife hid it and took it from me,’” she said.

The museum won’t estimate how much the rifle is worth, but gun experts at Las Vegas’ famous Gold and Silver pawn shop say the added backstory of the rifle would likely increase its value.

“It definitely can fetch a higher price, probably a few thousand dollars I would say,” said Travis Benton, store manager.

Eventually the Winchester rifle will be shipped back to the Great Basin Park for permanent displa, it’s tattered body and the secret of how it ended up in the desert forever protected by a wall of glass.

The gun, its stock split, gray and faded like driftwood, and its steel barrel rusted brown, blended in perfectly against the tree in a remote part of the Great Basin National Park until a National Parks Service employee spotted it.

""Perhaps it belonged to a lone cowboy riding the high range."" - Winchester publicist Scott Engen

“The rifle, exposed for all those years to sun, wind, snow and rain, was found leaning against a tree in the park,” said Nichole Andler, chief of interpretation at Great Basin National Park.

An engraving on the gun marks it as a ""Model 1873,"" and Andler said further research showed the serial number on the lower tang, or portion of the grip, matched up with records held at the Center for the West at the Cody Firearms Museum in Cody, Wyo. with a manufacture and shipping date of 1882, Andler said. According to Morgan, Utah-based Winchester Repeating Arms, 720,610 of the rifles were manufactured between 1873 and 1916. In 1882 alone, more than 25,000 of the 1873 models were made.

The gun sold for $50 when they first came out -- nearly $1,000 in today's dollars. By 1882, they were selling for half that price and touted as an accessible “everyman’s” rifle.

The discovery was enough to fire imaginations about the fate of the gun's owner. An article on Winchester's website offered a few theories.

""Perhaps it belonged to a lone cowboy riding the high range,"" wrote Winchester publicist Scott Engen. ""Perhaps it was set aside by a sourdough prospector in his search for a vein of rich ore. Whatever the actual story, it has the makings of a great campfire tale.

On Great Basin Park's Facebook page, the same questions are being bandied about.

“Who left the rifle? When and why it was leaned against the tree? And, why was it never retrieved?” reads a post on the page.

The park's cultural resource staff is combing through old newspapers and family histories hoping to solve the mystery. But posters to the site had their own suspicions.

""No big mystery,"" wrote Kenneth Larson. ""A hunter left it. Set it against the tree, took care of the deer, drug it or packed it out on a horse. Got to the bottom and realized he'd left the rifle and said screw it. Or went back and couldn't find it.”

Park officials will exhibit the rifle before it is sent to conservators to stabilize the wood and apply museum conservation techniques to prevent further deterioration.

San Bernardino is recognized as the same city where 14 people were killed and 24 were injured in a December 2, 2015 terror attack. The performance took place just hours after at least 26 people were murdered inside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when a gunman opened fired.

“In an era where mass shootings have become a nearly daily occurrence, this was an act of theater in an attempt to make a statement about how easily accessible semi-automatic weapons are and how seeing them has become normalized,” the 48-year-old shock rocker said in a statement sent to Variety Monday.

A post shared by Marilyn Manson (@marilynmanson) on Sep 11, 2017 at 10:02am PDT

“My art has always been a reaction to popular culture and my way to make people think about the horrible things that happen in this world,” he added. “My performance was not meant to be disrespectful or show any insensitivity.”

TMZ reported Monday the “Beautiful People” singer was in a wheelchair, due to a leg injury, while he carried the fake firearm. He pointed it at the crowd while singing “We Know Where You F-----g Live.” Manson moved the fake gun around and pointed it throughout his controversial concert.

“The prop microphone I used on stage was handed to me with the approval of a police officer,” said Manson. “My empathy goes out to anyone who has been affected by the irresponsible and reprehensible misuse of REAL guns.”

Earlier this year, Manson claimed the Columbine shootings were to blame for ruining his career.

The FBI agent didn't know it was the victim who grabbed his rifle during last week's rescue attempt as the room was dark, said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo.

""A well intentioned effort to rescue a man who had been kidnapped ended in a tragic outcome,"" he said.

However, Douglas York, an attorney for the family of 47-year-old Ulises Valladares, is attributing his death to a series of bungling errors that show ""a roadmap of mistakes,"" by authorities.

""We're not saying the guy went there with malice in heart so that he could kill a duct-taped hostage,"" York said. ""But once they got there, they failed to protect the very person they were designed to do. And when you're holding a deadly weapon, I think you owe a duty to the hostage not to kill him.""

Police said Valladares was kidnapped from his home in Conroe, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Houston, on Jan. 24. His 12-year-old son called police, who called the FBI for assistance.

The FBI tracked down two male suspects to a motel near Houston. The suspects directed FBI agents to a house in Houston where another suspect — a woman — was located along with Valladares.

At around 3:30 a.m. on Jan. 25, a SWAT team from the FBI began entering the house. While one team of agents entered through the front of the home, two other agents began entering by breaking through a back window. When the tool one agent was using to break the window fell into the home, he started using his M4 rifle to break the glass, Acevedo said.

Someone then started to pull the agent's rifle and the agent, fearing the weapon could be used against other agents entering the home, fired twice, Acevedo said. One bullet hit Valladares, who died later at a hospital.

The agent didn't know that Valladares, situated right by the window, was the person pulling at his rifle, Acevedo said. The room was dark and the agents breaching the window didn't use any lights because they didn't want to blind the entry team coming in through the front of the home, Acevedo said.

""Everyone involved, their heart breaks,"" he said. ""Those agents that morning went there with the best of intentions.""

While Valladares' hands had been bound with tape to the front of his body, he was apparently still able to grab the weapon, Acevedo said.

Agents at the scene were yelling ""FBI"" and Acevedo suggested the victim, who is from Honduras, might not have understood what the agents were saying.

However, Valladares' brother, Ernesto, said his brother spoke perfect English and he doesn't believe investigators' claims that his brother pulled the agent's rifle.

""How is he going to grab the rifle when his hands were bound?"" Ernesto Valladares said.

York was critical of the agent's decision to fire his weapon in the dark.

""I'm positive he was not trained just to start firing his weapon into an area he can't see because why? You're going to shoot somebody who is an innocent victim,"" York said.

The police investigation into the shooting is ongoing and once it's concluded, its findings will be presented to prosecutors, Acevedo said.

In a statement, Perrye Turner, special agent in charge of the FBI Houston office, said he couldn't provide additional details because of the ongoing investigation but his agency ""takes very seriously any shooting incident.""

Two men and one woman have been charged by authorities in Montgomery County, where Conroe is located, with aggravated kidnapping. The men also are charged with aggravated robbery.

Ulises Valladares' 12-year-old son was placed in foster care after his father's death. York said Ernesto Valladares has filed a lawsuit to get custody of his nephew as the boy's mother died a couple of years ago from cancer and he has no other relatives in the Houston area.

The suspect has access to weapons inside the vehicle and has fired one shot, according to the Garden Grove Police Department. The keys are in the car's ignition, and authorities have evacuated the surrounding area, The Orange County Register reported.

“At the moment he is armed inside (the vehicle) … We don’t want him to be mobile,” Lt. Carl Whitney, a police spokesman, said.

Police had been responding to a call from an addiction-recovery home to assist with a man showing signs of psychosis, Whitney told the paper.

The man gained access to the patrol car after police placed him inside the vehicle while waiting for an ambulance, according to the paper.

“He was able to get access from the rear passenger side to the front side …and a high-powered rifle,” Whitney told the paper.

No injuries have been reported, authorities said.

Kivona, as she requested to be called, was working at the fast food chain in Dearborn, MI, early Monday morning when she said a drive-thru customer ordered a frappe, Fox 8 reports.

Kivona informed the customer, described as a black male in his 30s, that the machine was broken. She told Fox 8 the customer then became furious with her.

“It wasn't like I was being nasty or anything. I just took his order, and I guess he wasn't satisfied with the answer he had gotten,” Kivona said.

Kivona says when she opened the drive-thru window to take the man’s money, Fox 8 reports, he shot her in the face with a paintball gun and drove away.

“I was in shock, and I was holding my face. I thought I got shot by a real gun,” she said to Fox 8, stating that the paintball gun looked like a real handgun.

The paintball struck her cheek and left her with a deep, round wound. She is expected to make a full recovery.

A White House source told Fox News that Trump is open to a number of measures to address mass shootings, including supporting a rise in the minimum age for owning certain firearms – a proposal that could face resistance from gun rights groups, like the National Rifle Association.

According to the Giffords Law Center, which tracks gun laws and advocates for more restrictions, licensed firearm dealers under federal law cannot sell handguns to people under 21 and cannot sell long guns to people under 18. Some state laws already impose stricter minimum age requirements.

It’s not clear if Trump would seek changes to federal laws, the source said, or if he would advocate for a change at the state level.

The Washington Post reported that Trump is considering arguments that the minimum age for buying any semiautomatic weapon should be raised from 18 to 21. Axios also reported that Trump has been telling associates that he “doesn’t think high school kids should be able to buy guns.”

During Tuesday’s White House briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about raising the age for buying AR-15s and said, “I think that's certainly something that's on the table for us to discuss, and that we expect to come up over the next couple of weeks.”

She said the administration is working to determine what can be done at the federal level.

“I know there are currently laws in place in certain states that restrict that,” she said. “In terms of whether or not we make that federal policy, that hasn't yet been determined.""

TRUMP URGES BAN ON ‘BUMP STOCKS’

The NRA has not yet publicly commented on the trial balloon. But the discussion could be a test for Trump’s loyal base, as many of his supporters generally oppose new restrictions that would affect law-abiding gun owners. Yet Trump has flouted traditional conservative positions in the past, and could be testing whether he could sway certain wings of the party.

At the same time, he may be wary of going too far.

The talks come as the NRA’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, is expected to address conservative activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington this week.

Trump, who was backed by the NRA during the 2016 election, has expressed support for the Second Amendment and said he’s against reflexive gun control measures that wouldn’t stop tragedies.

But since last week’s shooting, the president has begun to embrace new gun restrictions.

Trump on Tuesday directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft new regulations to ban firearm modifiers including the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas massacre.

A memo, released by the White House on Tuesday, directs the DOJ to propose a rule “banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.”

Sanders said the White House hasn’t “closed the door on any front” when it comes to trying to stop mass shootings and said Trump supports efforts to improve the federal background system.

Trump on Tuesday tweeted, “Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!”

The president on Wednesday is hosting parents, teachers and students at the White House to discuss efforts to ensure safety at schools.

Among those attending will be members of the Parkland community and those affected by the Sandy Hook and Columbine school shootings, the White House said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And I'm a fan of the NRA. There's no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. They want to do it.

These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we agree on everything. It doesn't make sense that I have to wait until I'm 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18. I don't know. So, I was just curious as what you did in your bill.

You don't address it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We didn't address it, Mr. President.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: You know why? Because you're afraid of the NRA. Right?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

NEIL CAVUTO, ""YOUR WORLD"" HOST: All right. That did not sit well with Pennsylvania Republic Pat Toomey. And it did not sit well with a number of Republicans, who didn't like the president saying that, as a party, maybe and other congressmen as well, are afraid of the NRA, afraid to take on the NRA.

Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole is one of them.

You didn't like that, did you?

REP. TOM COLE, R-OKLAHOMA: Well, look, I just think it created some uncertainty whether they didn't need to be any.

We are going to clearly be able to pass a background check improvement. And that's a good thing. We're clearly all lined up against bump stocks, NRA included on both those issues, by the way. And that's a good thing.

And I think most of us, at least on the Republican side, think we need to take measures literally as the president suggested to harden the targets, that is, to make schools and school personnel better able to resist a random act of insane violence like this.

So, we have got a lot more in common than we do that divides us. We ought to work on those things and see what we can do to address the problem.

CAVUTO: The due process thing with the president, where he would just take your gun first, that didn't sit well with many in that room, including some Democrats, who thought it was a bit extreme, in other words, take guns, deal with due process later.



COLE: Well, I wouldn't have put it that way.

Now, there are -- there is legislation to allow immediate intervention if police think there's a dangerous situation. It's been passed at the state level in several places. Things like that are worth considering.

And certainly if you know you have made a mistake -- look, in this case, there were massive failures. It's not a matter what the law was, when 39 times local police officers are coming to intervene with the a particular individual, when you have got credible tips to the federal law enforcement people that the this guy needs to be checked because we think something's about to happen.

That was a huge failure. And legislation had nothing to do with it. So you got to look at implementation as well.

CAVUTO: Do you sense that the opportunity is still there, Congressman, to get meaningful reform done?

The president threw this out there I think as much, and some of these other ideas that would normally be anathema to many in your party, to get more debate going and to sort of crack down on sacred cows.

What do you make of that?

COLE: Well, I think when there is a great opportunity.

Look, the House has already passed the Cornyn bill, the so called Fix NICS bill. And we also put some things with it Democrats might not like, concealed carry reciprocity. But the point is, we can do this one way or another. They can pass just a background check. We will go to conference, work out the differences. That can be done.

The president -- we have bump stocks were made legal by administrative action in the Obama administration.

CAVUTO: So, can he make them with the swipe of a pen -- I just want to be clear on this process. He say he's going to issue an order -- I think that was the gist of it out -- and end that.

COLE: I personally believe he can. There are others that are very well- informed that think it will take a law.

Either way, there's overwhelming consensus to do it. So if we need to do both to make sure, that would be fine by me. So, again, I think actually Leader McConnell had it pretty good last week. Let's focus on -- earlier this week -- let's focus on the things we agree on, and start getting those things done.

And let's also remember we have partners here. Look, state governments are free to do an awful lot themselves. We're seeing that happening in Florida right now and probably it will happen in other states as well.

So it's going to take a concerted effort. But let's just start doing the things we agree on. We will get a long way down the road.

CAVUTO: The president has espoused positions that typically are not those of a Republican president on the gun issue that you have got into, Congressman, also on these trade tariffs that many in your party and others are concerned about.

Are you worried?

COLE: No.

Look, I think this is a president that delivered to the largest tax cut in a generation, who is involved in the largest defense buildup since the 1980s, who has done more to deregulate the economy than any president in decades.

So he's an unconventional president. He doesn't always agree. He's not a party-line Republican. I actually respect that. And I think that's one of the reasons he got elected.

But on the broad issues, actually, he's governed very much like a traditional Republican. And he's delivered I think big time for the American people.

CAVUTO: Congressman, thank you very, very much. We appreciate it.

COLE: Thank you.

“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump told lawmakers at the White House. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”

During the meeting, which also included prominent Democrats, Trump told House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who was gravely injured in a mass shooting this summer, that a comprehensive gun bill would not pass if it included a concealed carry reciprocity proposal desired by Republicans.

“You know, I’m your biggest fan in the whole world,” Trump told Scalise. “I think that bill maybe one day will pass, but it should pass as a separate. If you’re going to put concealed carry between states into this bill, we’re talking about a whole new ball game.”

Trump added: “I’m with you, but let it be a separate bill.”

His comments come as Fox News has learned the White House plans to roll out specific policy proposals on Thursday aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Among the proposals are some that may put him at odds with the NRA, the powerful pro-gun organization that was a frequent topic during the meeting.

At one point during Wednesday’s session, Trump told Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who has previously sponsored background check legislation, “You are afraid of the NRA.”

A spokesman for Toomey, Steve Kelly, responded in a statement to Fox News, saying: “Senator Toomey has not received a dime from the NRA since joining the Senate. Senator Toomey has demonstrated that he is not afraid of the NRA or any other special interest group.”

At the beginning of the meeting, Trump said he wanted the lawmakers around the table with him “to come up with some ideas” and put them into “a very bipartisan bill.”

“It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody could support as opposed to, you know, 15 bills,” he said.

Trump has been pushing some new gun restrictions in the wake of this month’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in which 17 people were killed. He emphasized his commitment to strengthening background checks for gun buyers and dealing with the mentally ill.

“What surprises me more than anything else is that nothing’s been done for all of these years,” Trump told the lawmakers. “Because I really see a lot of common ground where there's Democrat, Republican.”

According to sources, the White House proposal will include raising the minimum age for buying long guns to 21 from 18 -- a proposal that Trump acknowledged is opposed by the NRA. Trump will also call for training and arming certain members of school faculty and staff, either through federal grants to states or a federal training program.

During Wednesday's meeting, Trump said “we must harden out schools” against attacks, calling for arming some staff at schools.

Speaking of the Pulse nightclub shooting in September 2016 that killed 49 people, Trump said: “If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn't have happened. Or certainly not to the extent it did, where he was just shooting and shooting and shooting and they were defenseless.”

On Thursday, Trump is also expected to reiterate his support for a bill that bolsters the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. He also will back the STOP School Violence Act, which gives the Justice Department grants for preventing school violence.

The president said Wednesday he will get rid “bump stocks,” saying they will “be gone shortly.” The firearm modifiers, which can make a semi-automatic weapon fire nearly as rapidly as a fully automatic machine gun, were used in the Oct. 1, 2017, Las Vegas massacre, in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured.

Trump will also call for fixing the FBI’s tipster program, amid revelations that the bureau received multiple tips about the youth accused of shooting up the Parkland school ahead of that massacre but failed to stop him.

In addition, the president is also expected to encourage states to create laws for extreme-risk protective orders, which would allow parents and law enforcement to petition courts to take weapons away from anyone threatening to harm themselves or others.

Republicans lawmakers at the meeting included: John Cornyn of Texas; Steve Danies of Montana; Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Marco Rubio of Florida; Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania; Orrin Hatch of Utah; Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee; Brian Mast of Florida, John Rutherford of Florida and Steve Scalise of Louisiana.

Democrats included Dianne Feinstein of California; Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Chris Murphy of Connecticut; Ted Deutch of Florida; Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut and Stephanie Murphy of Florida.

Lawmakers pitching their ideas on gun control told Trump their proposals could pass if he expressed his support. The president contrasted himself to past presidents, accusing former President Obama of not being “proactive” in getting a bill passed.

“It's time that a president stepped up… I'm talking Democrat and Republican presidents,” Trump said. “They have not stepped up.”

Trump expressed a willingness to be open to proposals from Democrats that Republicans usually reject outright, telling Feinstein he would review her assault weapons ban legislation. But he remained non-committal when pressed by Feinstein, telling her to discuss her plans with her congressional colleagues."
fox122,['Caleb Parke'],2018-02-27 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/27/florida-gun-show-sees-record-number-after-parkland-school-shooting.html,"Florida Gun Show organizers said they’ve never had so many people attend one of their events, amid legislators in the Sunshine state calling for stricter gun legislation.

The gun show over the weekend attracted almost 7,000 attendees to the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa, just two weeks after the deadly Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that killed 17 people.

“Some of the people attending are afraid that future legislation will impact their gun ownership rights,” gun show manager, George Fernandez, told WTSP.

Florida Sen. Bill Nelson called for stricter gun laws on the so-called “gun show loophole,” allowing people to purchase a gun at one of these events without getting a background check – in addition to an assault weapons ban.

Nelson told the local news station that the number of deaths has increased since the NRA killed the law in 2004.

Fernandez took issue with Nelson’s push because he said it wouldn’t have stopped the massacre in the Parkland school shooting. He said the shooter had mental health issues and should’ve been identified by law enforcement from the beginning.

He added that 95 percent of the vendors at the show were required to run background checks because they are licensed dealers, but the other five percent are private citizens.

The company canceled their gun show next month in Fort Lauderdale after Mayor Jack Seiler asked that it be shut down out of respect to the Parkland victims, but they plan to sponsor another Tampa show in late April or early June."
fox123,['Jeremy Hunt'],2018-02-27 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/02/27/would-universities-stand-up-for-pro-gun-students-free-speech-rights.html,"In a rare act of solidarity, several universities are voicing their support for applicants who participate in protests for stricter gun control.

Schools like Yale, MIT, Boston University, and others have issued statements explicitly stating that those who stage demonstrations against pro-gun laws will not have their admissions jeopardized, should their high schools penalize them for peaceful protests. In a now-viral tweet, The Brown University Office of College Admission stated:

@BrownUAdmission Applicants to Brown: Expect a socially conscious, intellectually independent campus where freedom of expression is fundamentally important. You can be assured that peaceful, responsible protests against gun violence will not negatively impact decisions on admission to Brown.

Quite plainly, several admissions departments seem to have picked a side in the gun control debate:

@UMassAmherstUA Students: If you participate in peaceful protests against gun violence and receive school discipline for walking out, staging your protest, etc., please rest assured that you can report it to UMass Amherst, and we won't hold it against you. #ParklandStudentsSpeak

@ApplytoBU Admission to BU will not be jeopardized should your school levy a penalty for participating in peaceful protests, such as the National School Walkout Day. See Dean of Admissions Kelly A. Walter's full statement here: http://spr.ly/6012DRTEk BU_Tweets #StudentsStandUp

This comes as survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and other high school students are organizing rallies, media interviews, and school walkouts to protest gun violence.

In response, several high school administrations issued warnings to students that any participation in such demonstrations, such as the National School Walkout Day, during school hours will result in disciplinary action. In fact, the Needville Independent School District in Texas promised three days of suspension for those who decided to protest.

But students need not fear; they now have universities on their side.

While it’s encouraging to see “universities” and “free speech” in the same headline, only half the work is done if college administrations don’t go to the same lengths to protect speech with which they might disagree.

It’s refreshing that colleges are finally standing up for free speech. It’s disconcerting that they only tend to do so for students who share their political views. Many of these same universities have stood idly by as conservative groups have found their First Amendment rights put on the backburner.

In several cases around the country, several schools have discovered creative means to muffle free speech when it comes to conservative students. The University of Minnesota could potentially face a lawsuit for banning conservative icon Ben Shapiro from speaking at any of their large campus venues—banishing the event to their “cow campus” in St. Paul.

Just last month, the Department of Justice filed in support of conservative groups suing the University of California, Berkeley for discriminating against their activities on campus. In one case, the Berkeley administration instituted a bizarre 3pm curfew for one of their events causing a conflict with classes.

Several other universities have come under fire for barely punishing students who violently disrupt events involving right-leaning speakers. Administrations have mastered the art of issuing empty statements voicing their disapproval of violent activities, while doing very little to stop them from happening.

That’s why you shouldn’t buy all these virtue-signaling announcements from universities claiming to support the First Amendment rights of high school applicants. In fact, if you read them a little closer, several statements are pretty specific about not penalizing pro-gun control activists in particular. I have a hard time believing that a staunch NRA-supporting, Second Amendment activist would be guaranteed such protections.

But true adherence to constitutional rights doesn’t stop with only your political allies. Colleges and universities should be bastions of free speech—even when it’s inconvenient.

A recent study conducted by Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) and YouGov found that “very liberal students are 14 percentage points more likely to feel comfortable expressing their opinions in the classroom than their very conservative peers.” For all of the talk about embracing diversity on campus, it’s clear that too often that doesn’t include diversity of thought.

While it’s encouraging to see “universities” and “free speech” in the same headline (without being followed by “lawsuit”), only half the work is done if college administrations don’t go to the same lengths to protect speech with which they might disagree. After all, isn’t that what they taught us is the point of the Constitution?"
fox124,[],2018-03-03 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/03/police-officer-bypassed-laws-to-resell-dozens-guns-prosecutors-say.html,"A California police officer and spokesman used his job to bypass the state’s strict gun laws in order to resell dozens of weapons without a license, federal prosecutors said Friday.

Pasadena police Lt. Vasken Gourdikian was arrested Friday morning and charged with illegally selling more than 100 firearms between 2014 and 2017.

The weapons included some that are outlawed in California, the Pasadena Star-News reported.

Gourdikian, 48, was released on a $100,000 bond after pleading not guilty Friday in federal court in Los Angeles. His attorney, Mark Geragos, said the charges were ""misguided and truly an abuse of the supposed discretion of the government.""

He has been placed on unpaid leave, the Star-News reported.

As a police officer, Gourdikian was able to purchase so-called ""off-roster"" handguns, which aren't available to the public and aren't listed in a catalog of certified handguns maintained by the state, authorities said.

Pasadena's Police Department issued seven waivers to the officer, allowing him to bypass 10-day waiting periods on purchases of six pistols and an assault rifle at gun shops in Los Angeles and Orange counties, the Star-News reported.

Gourdikian posted on online gun message boards that he had weapons that were brand new and still in the box, court documents said. The indictment alleges Gourdikian sometimes sold weapons in bulk across Southern California and advertised on the website Calguns.net, the Star-News reported.

The investigation against Gourdikian began during a routine analysis of sales and trace reports by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to Bill McMullan, special agent in charge of the ATF field office in Los Angeles.

ATF agents raided Gourdikian's home last year and seized 62 firearms, including an unregistered short-barreled rifle, officials said.

He was also charged with possessing an unregistered gun and falsely claiming on federal firearms forms that he was buying a gun for himself, even though he had already agreed to sell the weapon to someone else, prosecutors said.

Gourdikian, who had been on paid leave for about a year, will no longer be paid by the police department, officials said. An internal review is now ""on hold pending the outcome of the criminal investigation,"" police said in a statement.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."
fox125,['Caleb Parke'],2018-02-16 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/16/florida-teacher-years-gun-violence-post-goes-viral-after-school-shooting.html,"A Teacher of the Year at a Florida middle school posted a Facebook message that has since gone viral saying parents need to “step up” when it comes to their kids’ behavior.

“Okay, I’ll be the bad guy and say what no one else is brave enough to say, but wants to say,” Kelly Guthrie Raley, who was named Eustis Middle School Teacher of the Year 2017-2018 last month, said in a now-viral Facebook post following the mass shooting that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Raley said she’ll “take all the criticism and attacks” for her opinion because, as a teacher with two decades of experience, she has to worry about an active-shooter situation on a daily basis.

The middle school teacher said over her almost two decades as an educator that she’s seen an increase in violence and a lack of compassion among students.

“Until we, as a country, are willing to get serious and talk about mental health issues, lack of available care for the mental health issues, lack of discipline in the home, horrendous lack of parental support when the schools are trying to control horrible behavior at school (oh no! Not MY KID. What did YOU do to cause my kid to react that way?), lack of moral values, and yes, I’ll say it – violent video games that take away all sensitivity to ANY compassion for others’ lives – as well as reality TV that makes it commonplace for people to constantly scream up in each others’ faces and not value any other person but themselves, we will have a gun problem in school,” the sixth-grade language arts teacher wrote.

Raley, who loves hunting and four-wheeling in her spare time, added that she grew up with guns in her home.

“But you know what? My parents NEVER supported any bad behavior from me,” Raley said.

She said when she began teaching 20 years ago, she never had to worry about calling a student’s parents and getting cussed out, told to go to hell, or threatened with a public shaming all because she was calling out their child’s behavior. Something, she said, has got to change.

“Parents, it’s time to step up!” Raley urges. “Be the parent that actually gives a crap! Be the annoying mom that pries and knows what your kid is doing. STOP being their friend. They have enough ‘friends’ at school. Be their parent. Being the ‘cool mom’ means not a damn thing when either your kid is dead or your kid kills other people because they were allowed to have their space and privacy in YOUR HOME.”

She doubles down that she had guns in her home.

“But you know what? I never dreamed of shooting anyone with his guns. I never dreamed of taking one! I was taught respect for human life, compassion, rules, common decency, and most of all, I was taught that until I moved out, my life and bedroom wasn’t mine...it was theirs. And they were going to know what was happening because they loved me and wanted the best for me.”

Raley concludes her post by adding that she never brought up gun control.

“This post wasn’t about gun control,” she said. “This was me, loving the crap out of people and wanting the best for them. This was about my school babies and knowing that God created each one for greatness, and just wanting them to reach their futures.”

Raley said the only thing she holds dearer than teaching students is her faith and family, and that her father, a military hero, and her mother, a retired school teacher, inspired her to be who she is today."
fox126,['Perry Chiaramonte'],2017-01-18 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/18/california-snafu-releases-personal-info-nearly-4000-gun-safety-instructors.html,"The private information of thousands of California firearms instructors was accidentally released by the state late last year in response to a journalist’s Freedom of Information request.

The data request was made in August, when a reporter for Southern California Public Radio (KPCC), an NPR affiliate, sought all information on Firearms Safety Certifications available from the California Department of Justice.

The information was released in October, and a clerical error gave the reporter wide access to the personal information of 3,424 firearms instructors -- whose dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and California identification numbers were handed over, according to NRA-ILA, the legislative arm of the National Rifle Association.

The error was caught two months later, and the California DOJ sent out a letter to all of the Golden State’s instructors letting them know their personal information had been compromised.

“The Department discovered the data breach on October 17, 2016, and notified the requestor of the error and asked that the information be destroyed and that no further dissemination of it occur,” said the letter, sent by the Office of the Attorney General Kamala Harris. Harris is now a U.S. senator.

The letter also recommended the firearm instructors place a fraud alert on their credit. Since driver's license numbers are appealing to identity thieves, a fraud alert could prevent criminals from misusing someone's personal data.

NRA officials blasted the California DOJ for its data breach and questioned why it took the department so long to alert the thousands who were affected.

“This privacy breach is just another example of the California Department of Justice’s disregard for the rights of gun owners,” Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs for the NRA, said to FoxNews.com. “There’s no reason why the private information of firearms instructors should have been released – the DOJ redacts information all the time.""

Baker also questioned the length of time it took the state to inform victims of the breach.

Expand / Contract Nearly 4,000 gun safety instructors in California received this letter by the DOJ two months after the breach was discovered.

“It’s time the California government start awarding gun owners the same respect as it does non-gun owners.”

Some security experts said that while it wasn't a significant data breach, there is still cause for concern.

“The main concern, if any, would be identity theft, simply because it is so prevalent,” police consultant and retired Los Angeles Police Lt. Raymond Foster said to FoxNews.com. “I don’t think anyone would threaten these instructors, but one concern is that many of them are retired police officers and that could put them at an additional risk. Most of them when they are off-duty like to lie low and blend in.

“But I’d imagine that NPR would never publish this info and would likely just rip it up.”

The reporter, who the NRA-ILA identifies as Aaron Mendelson, acknowledged in his FOIA request that part of his request would be redacted.

“…Please inform me of the redaction and the legal justification for it,” said the request, which was obtained by FoxNews.com.

Since receiving the data, it appears that none of the information has been published in any recent stories. In its letter to firearm instructors, the California DOJ said that it had asked the reporter to destroy the information he received and if he did not do so he would face legal action.

Neither Mendelson nor officials for Southern California Public Radio immediately returned calls for comment.

Gun instructors in California took the news of their information being released in stride. Dennis Santiago, an independent gun safety instructor in the Los Angeles area, who received the DOJ letter, told FoxNews.com he at first thought it was a hacking incident.

“I was speaking with other instructors at a gun shop about it and they didn’t seem too concerned,” Santiago said. ""They took it as being the cost of being in America.”

fox127,"['John Lott', 'John R. Lott']",2016-09-08 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/08/gun-ownership-is-up-in-america-so-why-isnt-media-telling-about-it.html,"Two weeks ago, the PEW Research Center released a survey showing that gun ownership by households is up to 44% — a 7-percentage point increase in the past two years. Another 5% of households won’t reveal whether they own a gun. Yet, not a single mainstream American media headline has announced the increase.

In fact, the media goes out of its way to find polls claiming that Americans are turning away from guns. In their War on Guns they want to give the impression that gun owners are a small, fringe group. Maybe they are hoping that this will have an impact on policy. As General Social Survey director Tom Smith told me, a large drop in gun ownership would “make it easier for politicians to do the right thing on guns.”

In June, the Washington Post and Time magazine trumpeted a CBS News poll with this headline: “American gun ownership drops to lowest in nearly 40 years” and “The Weird Reason Why Gun Ownership in America Is at Its Lowest Point Since the 1970s.” Last year, an Associated Press headline announced: “Gun ownership in U.S. drops to record low.” Recent headlines in the New York Times and CNN declared: “Share of Homes With Guns Shows 4-Decade Decline” and “Fewer US gun owners own more guns.”

The Washington Post falsely assured readers, “The downward trend in gun ownership remains consistent across the national polls.” Bizarrely, if the Washington Post and CNN had relied on their own polls, their headlines would claim that gun ownership has remained constant over the years. But neither organization has run such headlines.

Only two surveys actually show a drop in gun ownership. They are by CBS News and the General Social Survey (GSS). According to the GSS, the percentage of homes with a gun has fallen from approximately 50% in the late 1970s to 32% in 2014. The CBS poll claimed that ownership had fallen from 51% in 1978 to 36% this year.

But many other surveys have obtained very different results.

According to Gallup, household gun ownership has ranged from 51 percent in 1994 to just 34 percent in 1999. In 2014, household gun ownership was at 42 percent – comparable to the 43-45 percent figures during the 1970s.

There was absolutely no news coverage of a 2011 Gallup poll headlined, “Self-Reported Gun Ownership in U.S. Is Highest Since 1993.”

The ABC News/Washington Post poll shows an even more stable pattern, with household gun ownership rates of 44-46 percent in 1999. In 2013, the ownership rate was 43 percent.



A CNN poll from January showed 40% of Americans living in a household that owns a gun. Nine percent of respondents were unwilling to state an opinion, implying that the true ownership rate is greater than 40%.

Furthermore, polling is not the only indicator of gun ownership. The number of concealed handgun permits has soared from about 2.7 million in 1999 to over 14.5 million in 2016. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) shows that the number of gun purchases has exploded, almost doubling from 2008 to 2015.

In Illinois, a Firearm Owner Identification (FOID) card is required. The number of people with those cards dramatically increased from slightly over 1 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2015.

There are some other strong reasons for believing that polls underestimate the number of gun owners. A recent Zogby Analytics survey posed the question, ""If a national pollster asked you if you owned a firearm, would you determine to tell him or her the truth or would you feel it was none of their business?” Thirty-five percent of current gun owners said that it was none of the pollsters’ business. This answer is especially common among those who claim not to be gun owners.

We also know that current events influence people’s willingness to acknowledge gun ownership. After mass shootings, a sudden drop can be seen in the polling numbers. But there is no evidence of people getting rid of their guns. Indeed, gun sales actually soar.

But this isn’t the only limitation of gun ownership polls. Take the fact that, compared to married women, married men are much more likely to admit to having a gun in the home. Either the men are hiding guns from their wives or women are more reluctant to tell pollsters that they own a gun. If the latter, the GSS survey results should be about 4 percentage points higher.

The media's selective use of polls may provide gun control advocates with talking points and let them try isolating gun owners. But hard numbers clearly show a huge increase in gun sales and in the percentage of Americans who carry guns.

Already parents of three, the couple is in the process of formally adopting a daughter through the state foster care system and is fighting Department of Children and Family Services rules they say severely restrict their gun rights. The couple charges that the firearm restrictions aimed at safeguarding foster children violate their constitutional rights and threaten their ability to keep their family safe.

“Our family has always owned and used firearms,” said Kenneth Shults, 37, who is a firearms safety instructor and a machine shop manager. “No foster parent should have to forfeit their constitutional rights in order to be a foster parent.”

Prospective Illinois foster parents must either certify that there are no firearms in their home or complete a form called the Foster Family Firearms Arrangement. That document requires a list of all guns and ammunition in the home and locations where they are stored. Would-be foster parents also must certify the guns have trigger locks and are stored unloaded, separate from ammunition and in locked containers accessible only with a key kept off the premises or on the owner’s person.

The rules can be enforced by involuntary home inspections, according to the lawsuit.

The state’s rules defeat the purpose of keeping a firearm for protection, said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Washington-based Second Amendment Foundation, which has joined the suit as a plaintiff along with the Illinois State Rifle Association.

""When seconds count, having your gun unloaded, locked up and ammunition stored somewhere else makes you a likely victim of a violent crime,"" Gottlieb said.

The Shultses claim to have a legitimate need for the protection afforded by an accessible, loaded gun. Colleen, a nurse at the Illinois Department of Corrections’ Danville Correctional Center, was warned in March by her employer that prisoners were seeking home addresses of prison staff, including correctional officers and nurses. The letter warned that she and other prison employees should take unspecified precautions.

The Shultses have complied with the state policy so far, but now believe they need guns at the ready “for self-defense and defense of family.”

“This lawsuit is important not just for foster families in Illinois, but all across the nation,” said Gottlieb. “What we are challenging is the denial of the fundamental right to defend yourself and your family.”

The suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, accuses the director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services of deprivation of civil rights under color of law. The complaint maintains the constitutional Second Amendment rights of foster parents were violated because Illinois Department of Children and Family Services policy effectively prohibits current and prospective foster parents from possessing firearms for the purpose of self-defense.

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services told FoxNews.com that the agency had no comment because it had not yet received and reviewed the lawsuit.

The suit is one of a series filed by the Second Amendment Foundation challenging gun laws in the state of Illinois over the last several years. One of the most publicized was McDonald v. City of Chicago, in which Otis McDonald, a maintenance worker and grandfather living in Chicago, claimed he was unable to protect himself and his family in a dangerous neighborhood because of an ordinance banning the possession of handguns.

The landmark case went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010, when, in a 5-4 decision, the justices held that the right of an individual to ""keep and bear arms"" in every state is protected by the Second Amendment.

In another Illinois lawsuit, the foundation forced the State Legislature to adopt a conceal-carry statute.

“One would think the state would have wised up by now,” Gottlieb said. “But here we are again, to make sure that the state cannot discriminate against foster parents who merely wish to exercise the rights we’ve restored in Illinois.”

fox129,[],2012-01-21 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2012/01/21/tips-for-firearm-storage-at-home.html,"A few days after Christmas we had some neighbors over to catch up a bit. In the beginning of the evening we talked about all kinds of things; one of these was my new Springfield Champion .45 ACP. When I mentioned my newest acquisition, my neighbor Gary said, ""Oh, I would like to see that.""

After I retrieved it, I gave it a quick safety check then dropped the empty magazine and racked the slide open. At this point my neighbor quickly commented to his wife, ""Tammy, see how he did that."" This was in response to my safe handling of the firearm. As a 1911 style semi-auto, this empty and locked open slide quickly transferred the message that the firearm was safe to handle, and as an experienced gun owner himself he verified my work before handling the gun himself.

I learned to shoot and to handle firearms safely as a teenager. My father was a police officer and also competed on the police force's pistol team. I can remember always having guns around the house. My brothers and I were all taught the safety fundamentals at an early age. I still feel that education is the best tool for keeping weapons safe.

Households that have very young children, however, need to take additional firearm storage measures, as curiosity often trumps learning and common sense. The fact that we got to handle and shoot them, removed a lot of the mystery that guns hold for those whom are less familiar or curious. Like my father before me, I have begun to introduce my two daughters to safe handling and shooting as well. It is a process and occurs with highly supervised and measured steps.

Cabinets, Safes and Locks

One way to ensure that firearms are safe is to lock them away in safes, or lockable cabinets, or install locking devices on the guns themselves. These are the preferred methods for those who have small children in the home, or the potential to have children visit.

Another equally effective way to prevent accidental discharge is to lock away the all the ammunition. (It is very clear that both the gun and ammo are needed to be able to fire.)

One common concern with people who keep guns for home security is the availability and speedy access if needed. I recently saw an advertisement about firearms and home protection that caught my eye. The ad's copy read. ""When seconds count, help is only minutes away."" This reality is all too true in many urban areas where police or rescue personnel cover dense populations, or in more remote locations were considerable distances are involved. Your 911 call may not be as fast as you hope, and your safety may rely on your own skills and preparations. In cases where a home intruder may be present, or a marauding wild beast, ready access and usability may outweigh more secure firearm storage. There are a number of firearm storage configurations that can provide both. Some are even designed with ""bio-metric"" systems that can read fingerprints. With these types of firearm storage units, the need to remember a locking code in a high stress environment is eliminated.

Burglar-Proof Firearm Storage

Defending a home is only possible if you are there, though it may be a frightening experience. Preventing the theft of firearms in an empty home is another reason to own a gun safe. Guns can be expensive things and some folks' collections can be quite extensive. I'm just getting started and my collection pales in comparison to one of my neighbors'. They have two gun safes that are each bigger than my decent sized refrigerator. Keeping your firearms protected in a burglar-proof location, like a large gun safe, which can be to big to carry or is firmly bolted in place, can offer peace of mind. Many of these firearm storage safes also provide some degree of fire protection.

Unlike a basic cabinet which may have a lock to keep children out, a true gun safe offers far more security. When I was growing up, my father (a skilled but amateur remodeler in Detroit) constructed a secret room in our basement to house his collection. Any potential burglar would have had a hard time finding it. A 500 pound gun safe may yell, ""This home has guns,"" but the chance of a burglar actually moving it, or getting in, is pretty impossible.

My new Springfield uses the ""ILS"" Integrated Locking System, and a basic cable lock secures my wheel guns. Now that my collection is starting to grow, I need to find a permanent firearm storage unit for them....though they will still come out to play as needed.

But despite her extensive self-defense training, she found herself in a life-threatening scenario where her martial arts background wasn’t enough.

""Owning a firearm...was life changing for me because women for sure, but even men too can be in a very, very vulnerable position with no options if you have intruders or any scenario where you're being dominated physically,"" Carlson told FOX411. ""[A firearm] is the only equalizer you have.""

The 39-year-old revealed a person in her past began stalking her in 2012 and even hired people to break into her home and tap her phones. After several break-ins and being followed on the streets, she contacted law enforcement who were not sympathetic to her situation.

“Law enforcement, they didn’t take me seriously. probably because I’m an actor but also because my situation was a little crazy,” she admitted.

One good thing came out of the scary ordeal: Carlson met her husband Dan after hiring him to teach her counter-surveillance.

""I had learned self defense for many years but I just knew around that time I needed some help,"" she admitted. ""My attorney and I were interviewing some people that provide security but no one that we interviewed understood counter-surveillance."" Carlson ended up calling a friend on the East Coast who recommended someone who could help her.

""He recommended Dan, who is my husband now,"" she said. ""I mean, it's a happy ending because I lived through it but more so I did meet my husband. He couldn't have been a better trainer and he's such a good teacher and he didn't ever question my scenario.""

Carlson understands why a person may ""fear firearms,"" but she explains ""it's crucial for people to look at it from a logical standpoint and take the emotions out of it because one needs to have that option to save them.""

The actress believes she has the perfect platform to advocate for firearm use and safety not only because of her celebrity, but also because she has a family member who was murdered by firearm.

“I wanted to tell my story because it's unique where I’ve had a family member be murdered from a firearm and not for a second did anyone think in my family to champion stricter gun laws.”

The Minnesota-born model said that if her view on firearms has hurt her Hollywood career, she doesn’t care.

“It probably has and I don’t know it...I don’t care.” According to Carlson, “people think Hollywood is very anti-guns but California is huge and we have way more support than people think and I’d like people to know that...that was surprising to me and I was happy to know there’s such a huge [firearm] community and that you have a lot resources for safety training.”

Carlson tells her story on an episode of Outdoor Channel’s “NRA: All Access” airing on July 15. She decided to share her past experiences because she’s “a woman who has a little bit of a public platform.”

“If this happened to me, it's happened to millions of women. I have the responsibility to educate people about firearms and also share my story,” the 39-year-old said. “I'm not telling people to just go get [a firearm], they’re not for everybody. While my message is supportive, I also very much emphasize on training and safety because it is a dangerous weapon. It’s a lifestyle and it can save your life.”

A bill working its way to President Trump’s desk could change that, by allowing gun owners who are allowed to carry concealed guns in their home states to exercise the rights in any other state that does not prohibit concealed carry.

“Our Second Amendment right doesn’t disappear when we cross state lines,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said last month when he introduced a Senate bill that closely tracks one introduced in the House.

“Our Second Amendment right doesn’t disappear when we cross state lines.” - Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas

Cornyn’s Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 is aimed at allowing legal gun owners to carry concealed firearms “freely between states without worrying about conflicting state codes or onerous civil suits,” he said.

The National Rifle Association said confusing and conflicting state laws can ensnare law-abiding gun owners.

“The current patchwork of state and local gun laws is confusing and can cause the most conscientious and law-abiding gun owner to run afoul of the law when they are traveling or temporarily living away from home,” said Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA-ILA.

The proposed law would not supersede state laws or establish national standards for concealed carry, advocates assure. A companion bill in the House of Representatives was introduced by Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C.

Some 40 states already offer some form of reciprocity with other states.

Critics claim reciprocity laws will undercut states that believe public safety is linked to strict gun control.

“Reciprocity would have a profound impact on state public safety, making the state with the weakest standards into the law of the land, and letting criminals and other dangerous people carry concealed guns in every state in the country,” the gun control group Every Town for Gun Safety said in a statement."

Jason McLemore, 44, who owned McLemore Gun Shop, and his 17-year old son Jacob, were killed after a disagreement with two customers, Pearl River County Sheriff David Allison told the station. Both were pronounced dead at the scene.

Authorities say that Audy McCool, 52, and his son, Michael McCool, 29, went to the gun shop to pick up a weapon Saturday afternoon. The men were told the gun had not yet been repaired, and one of the men reportedly became angry that he had paid a $25 service charge but did not yet receive his firearm.

Jason McLemore’s wife reportedly witnessed the encounter, and called her husband and son in an effort to keep the incident from escalating.

""During this argument, we believe there might have been some pushing and shoving,"" Chief Deputy Shane Tucker said, the Sun Herald reported. ""One of the customers and one of the owners produced firearms. We don't know who shot first.""

Jason McLemore reportedly had an unholstered 9-mm. handgun by his side when he was shot.

Michael McCool is the alleged shooter, according to WLOX, which cited authorities, and is suspected of shooting both victims using a 40-caliber pistol. No charges have yet been filed.

According to WLOX, the elder McCool was found bleeding from a wound to his back when law enforcement authorities arrived, and the younger McCool was in the intensive care unit at a New Orleans hospital.

The shooting is still under investigation."
fox133,[],2014-11-19 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/11/19/utah-issuing-thousands-concealed-carry-firearm-permits-to-people-from-other.html,"Tens of thousands of gun owners from around the country are taking advantage of Utah's concealed firearm permits each year — often taking a required class given by instructors licensed by Utah but who live in other states.

About two-thirds of the nearly 577,000 permits Utah has issued in the last two decades have gone to residents from other states. More than 81,000 out-of-staters obtained permits from Utah in fiscal year 2014, accounting for 80 percent of the cards issued, shows a new state report issued this week.

Utah's permit is attractive to out-of-state residents because it's recognized in 35 states and allows them to travel more widely with it, said Rep. Curt Oda, a Republican lawmaker from Clearfield and a concealed-carry permit instructor.

Utah ranks alongside Arizona and Florida as being the most popular for out-of-state permit seekers not because it's easy to get one, but because of the widespread acceptance around the country, said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun lobby.

The requirements are fairly simple: Anyone 21 or older who passes a criminal background check and takes a firearms course taught by an instructor certified by Utah can get the permit. Most of the 2,300 current instructors — 72 percent — don't live in Utah. Not all states allow classes to be taken from out-of-state instructors, adding another layer of simplicity for permit-seekers, Aposhian said.

Utah runs background checks on a nearly daily basis, and permits can be suspended or revoked if holders are convicted of crime that take away their eligibility, Aposhian said.

Illinois, Oregon, New York and California account for states with the most Utah-issued permits, state records show. That's likely because permits from those states aren't widely recognized, so gun owners get a second card from Utah for travel, Aposhian said. Because Utah's permit isn't recognized in those states, it's easier to get a Utah card because residents there don't have to first get a permit from their own state.

Utah is one of more than a dozen states that issue concealed-carry permits to residents of other states. Each state has its own rules for issuing the cards, and Utah's application process is not the weakest, said Allison Anderman, attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

For instance, Utah requires that people from states that recognize the permit get a concealed carry from their home state first and submit it with the Utah application. ""It's not like you can get denied in your home state and get a permit in Utah,"" Anderman said.

Utah issues cards to people around the country even if their home state doesn't recognize the permit, putting the burden on the card holder to know what each state law allows. Washington and Wisconsin are tops for permit holders among the states where the card is recognized.

""It makes no sense to us,"" said Gary Sackett, board member for the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah. ""It's not clear to us why we want to make it easy for people from other parts of the country when we have such a weak form of approval.""

Oda said Utah has the right idea in making the process less strenuous than other states. Other states often require live-firing as part of a permit course, while Utah only requires classroom time and familiarity with the basics of a gun, he said.

""Why should proficiency be a prerequisite to that right of defending yourself?"" Oda said. ""Just because they happen to live across the border, doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to defend themselves as well.""

Self-defense is ""passive"" and should not require training, Oda said.

Representatives from the Bureau of Criminal Identification presented the report to a Utah legislative committee on Wednesday. There were hardly any questions asked by lawmakers and minimal discussion. In Utah, the program is old news and hardly generates any backlash.

The total of 101,640 permits issued in the recently completed fiscal year is more than any year from 2004-2012. But it is fewer than in 2013, when nearly 134,000 permits were given out.

Applications cost $41 for Utah residents and $51 for non-residents. The permits last five years and cost $15 to renew.

During the record year of 2013, the permits brought in $2.3 million for the state. This year, however, the state lost $58,000 in administering the program. Part of that loss was caused by the cost of buying a new card-printing system, said Alice Moffat, chief of the Bureau of Criminal Identification.

Sackett doesn't understand why Utah keeps up the program, especially when it loses money.

""This advances no Utah state interest at all. There's no interest in somebody from Florida having a concealed weapons permit,"" Sackett said. ""It simply does not make any sense for us to be in this marketplace."""

Flanagan, who reported on-air under the name Bryce Williams, purchased the Glock 9 mm pistol in July from a federally licensed gun dealer in Virginia.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokesman Tom Faison told The Roanoke Times on Thursday that Flanagan said a background check was conducted on Flanagan before the purchase was finalized. The check didn’t reveal any of the criteria that would have prevented him from owning a gun, such as felony conviction or a history of court-ordered psychiatric treatment, the newspaper reported.

Faison said Flanagan purchased multiple guns but didn’t say how many guns he purchased. It’s unclear whether the gun Flanagan used to shoot himself was the same one used to kill WDBJ reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward and wound Smith Mountain Lake Chamber of Commerce leader Vicki Gardner. The Roanoke Times reports at least one of the guns was the same make and model as the one Virginia Tech school shooter Seung-Hui Cho used to murder 32 students in 2007 before killing himself, Faison said.

“He could be as mentally ill as the day is long,” Faison said, “but unless someone has been legally adjudicated as such, they can purchase a firearm.”

Flanagan, 41, was ordered by his bosses at the WDBJ station to seek help for his frequent problems with co-workers, according to a July 30, 2012 memo obtained by The Guardian.

""You are required to contact Health Advocate, the employee assistance program,"" the memo, from then-station director Dan Dennison, said. Flanagan was given four days to make the call. ""This is a mandatory referral requiring your compliance. Failure to comply will result in termination of employment.""

Flanagan apparently followed up with Health Advocate, since he wasn’t terminated from WDBJ until February 2013.

There are 19 different factors that could disqualify someone from buying a gun in Virginia. Convicted felons, people who have been committed to mental health programs, illegal drug users and illegal immigrants are among the criteria that would prevent someone from getting a gun, according to The Roanoke Times.

The Virginia State Police says about 405,000 checks were made last year and 2,661 attempted purchases were denied.

Lori Haas, state director for the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence told the newspaper she’s not aware of any background check system that could have prevented someone like Flanagan from purchasing a gun.

“Even the best background system in the world would not have prevented this shooting,” Andrew Goddard, legislative director of the Virginia Center for Public Safety, told The Roanoke Times.

Flanagan initially planned on getting away with the murders of Parker, 24, and Ward, 27. After shooting and killing himself in his getaway car, police who searched his vehicle found the Glock pistol with multiple magazines and ammunition, a white iPhone, letters, notes, a to-do list and a brief case that contained multiple license plates, a wig, shawl, umbrella, sunglasses and black hat, according to The Associated Press. Flanagan never used any of the disguises as he was tracked down by police on Interstate 66 around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.

A representative for Flanagan's family issued a statement on Thursday expressing ""condolences"" for the loved ones of the dead.

“It is with heavy hearts and deep sadness that we express our deepest condolences to the families of Alison Parker and Adam Ward,” the statement said. “We are also praying for the recovery of Vicky Gardner. Our thoughts and prayers at this time are with the victims’ families and the WDBJ7 NEWS family. Words cannot express the hurt that we feel for the victims. Our family is asking that the media respect our privacy.”

Biden made the recommendation during a Facebook chat on Tuesday, saying he has advised wife Jill to stand on the deck of their rustic home and fire the family's double-barreled shotgun in the air, should she sense an intruder.

“It was poor advice, and it comes off a little sexist,” Kate Ernest, the woman who got the advice, told Fox News Channel on Friday.

Said Biden: “You don’t need an AR-15 — it’s harder to aim, it’s harder to use. You don’t need 30 rounds to protect yourself. Buy a shotgun.”

Biden used the social media event to garner public support for President Obama’s attempt to tighten federal guns laws, following a series of mass shootings.

Among the recommendations are to ban assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

Ernest purportedly has a small cache of firearms that includes an AR-15. She said a double-barrel shotgun holds only two shells, which would make a shooter a “sitting duck” and that he or she might easily fumble while reloading should somebody be attacking them.

Ernest said Biden’s advice also sounded like: “Let me tell you what you need versus arm yourself and protect yourself with what is necessary.”"

Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City was examined at a hospital for unknown injuries.

""I think there's those people who would say, 'You know what, I wish you'd killed him,'"" Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner said at a news conference Friday evening. ""Now, that's not who we are. We are not him. We did our job.""

Marquez, 34, and a woman also taken into custody were questioned by investigators about their motives late Friday night, said Sacramento County sheriff's Sgt. Lisa Bowman said.

It wasn't immediately clear when they would be formally booked.

More On This... Sacramento deputy dead

The deadly chain of events began around 10:30 a.m. when Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range as he checked out a suspicious car in a Motel 6 parking lot, authorities said.

Oliver, 47, was the first county deputy killed since 2008. The 15-year veteran left a wife and two daughters.

""He was not able to return fire or do anything"" but his partner was able to shoot back, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones said.

The car, which had a man and woman inside, then drove about a mile and the couple tried to carjack a driver and shot him in the head when he refused to give up his keys, authorities said.

Anthony Holmes, 38, of Sacramento, was listed in serious condition at a hospital Friday night, the Sacramento Bee reported

The attackers then stole another car and finally took a red Ford pickup from Jose Cruz, who was gardening outside a client's house in Sacramento.

Cruz told the Bee that a man in a white Ford Mustang convertible told him: ""I need a favor.""

""What's the favor?"" Cruz asked.

""Your keys,"" the man said. ""Hurry up, because they're chasing me...I don't want to hurt you.""

Cruz said the man pointed a gun at him and had a bloody shirt wrapped around his other arm.

The couple then fled to neighboring Placer County, about 30 miles north of Sacramento, authorities said.

In Auburn, the truck briefly pulled over to the side of a road and two Placer County deputies spotted it and approached.

The gunman shot them with an AR-15-type assault weapon, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said.

Homicide Detective Michael David Davis Jr., 42, died at a hospital - 26 years to the day after his father, for whom he was named, died in the line of duty as a Riverside County deputy sheriff in Southern California.

Davis was a 15-year veteran of the department and a father of four.

The wounded deputy, Jeff Davis, is a 17-year veteran who was shot in the arm. He was released after treatment at a hospital.

""This guy was on a one-man crime spree today. He has no idea of the damage he did,"" Erwin said.

Dozens of deputies flooded the area but the gunman fled into a neighborhood near a high school and ran into a home.

Police finally used tear gas to flush Marquez from the basement of the home, witnesses said.

The long manhunt involved hundreds of officers from multiple agencies backed by search dogs, helicopters and armored vehicles. Residents nearby were told to stay indoors, and schools were locked down during the search.

Flags at the state Capitol were ordered flown at half-staff and Gov. Jerry Brown issued a statement extending his sympathy to the families of the slain officers.

Their ""brutal murders,"" Brown said, ""...are a tragic reminder of the sacrifices we demand of our peace officers and the incredible courage they display as they protect our communities.""

The slaying of the deputies was the single deadliest day for California law enforcement since February 2013. In separate incidents that month, former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner killed two law enforcement officers, and two Santa Cruz police detectives were shot and killed."

The Chicago Tribune reports (http://trib.in/29jQ9lo ) Second Amendment Sports in McHenry, Illinois, called off the raffle following questions about whether it would be legal. Under Illinois law, only nonprofit groups may hold raffles.

Bert Irslinger Jr. and his father own the shooting range and gun store. They were selling $5 tickets to win an AR-15 rifle similar to the weapon a gunman used to open fire in a gay nightclub June 12, leaving 49 people dead and 53 injured.

Irslinger says employees have received death threats since the Tribune first reported the raffle.

He says they may partner with a nonprofit organization to conduct the raffle in the future.

A number of armed American citizens have also used their firearms to stop or limit mass killings.

The former National Rifle Association instructor who lives next door to the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring, Texas, grabbed his AR-15-style rifle after hearing the gunfire and went over to investigate. Confronting the shooter, Devin Kelley, Willeford shot him in the leg and torso before Kelley dropped his weapon and fled the scene in his SUV.

As horrific as Kelley’s rampage was, it could have been much worse if it wasn’t for Stephen Willeford.

“I thank my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done,” Willeford told local media on Monday. “I just wish I could have gotten there faster.”

Willeford has quickly become an example for pro-gun advocates to point to when defending their argument that the best defense against mass shooting is a better-armed and better-trained civilian populace that is ready to defend itself, anytime and anywhere.

But – while not as common compared to the overall number of mass shootings in the U.S. – Willeford is certainly not the first “good guy with a gun” to stop a mass shooter’s killing spree in recent years.

Experts may disagree on how the number of mass shootings stopped by civilians is counted. Do off-duty police officers count as civilians? What about military members? And how many people need to be killed or injured for it to be considered a mass shooting? But there are a number of incidents over the last 20 years where an armed bystander helped prevent further tragedy.

Here are a few examples of such incidents:

-- In 1997, the assistant principal of Mississippi’s Pearl High School, Joel Myrick, used the .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol he kept in his truck to detain 16-year-old Luke Woodham after the teenager stabbed and bludgeoned to death his mother at home and killed two students and injured seven at the high school.

-- A decade later, in 2007, Matthew Murray killed four people at Colorado Spring church before being shot by church member and volunteer security guard Jeanne Assam.

-- Last April, an Uber driver with a concealed-carry permit shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people in Chicago’s Logan Square.

-- This September, an usher at a Tennessee church used his personal firearm to subdue a masked gunman who had already killed one woman in the church’s parking lot and injured six others inside.

Gun-rights advocates say that not only do these gun-carrying civilians prove that an armed populace can help mitigate the death toll of a mass shooter, but could also prevent mass shootings as a whole from happening.

“These killers all say they target places where people normally don’t carry guns,” John Lott, the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, said. “So concealed-carry acts as a deterrent to these killers and would also stop these shootings from being much worse.”

Those in favor of limiting access to firearms, however, argue that many of these mass shooters should not have had access to a gun in the first place – given some of their criminal and mental health records – and that the “good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun” argument is unsupported by facts or research.

“If having more guns in society worked to deter shootings, then America would have the lowest rate of gun violence of any developed country,” Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign, said in a statement provided to Fox News. “Put simply, the myth that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun is unsupported by facts or research. The killer in this mass shooting should never have had access to a gun in the first place, given his criminal record.”

James Jacobs, a professor at New York University’s School of Law who has written extensively about gun laws in the U.S., said that there are flaws in the arguments of both supporters and opponents of gun control – noting that there are already thousands of guns in the country that are unaccounted for and those could easily end up in the hands of someone who wanted to commit mass murder.

“I’m skeptical on the ability to clamp down on guns. That horse has already left the stable,” Jacobs said. “Most people who are highly dangerous don’t go to a legal gun dealer. They go on the internet or the black market or just get someone else to buy a gun for them.”

Jacobs added that instead of having one law governing firearms on a national – or even state – level, whether or not civilians should be able to carry a gun in public should come down to individual counties or even communities.

“There is not a one-size fits all solution to this issue,” he said. “What works in Alaska or rural Wyoming will not work in cities like Chicago or Detroit.”

EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story indicated Willeford used an AK-47. He has said it was an AR-15-style rifle."

As promised, President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation, targeting the top-selling rifle in the country, the AR-15 style semi-automatic, with a ban on one of the most-used AR bullets by sportsmen and target shooters.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this month revealed that it is proposing to put the ban on 5.56mm ammo on a fast track, immediately driving up the price of the bullets and prompting retailers, including the huge outdoors company Cabela’s, to urge sportsmen to urge Congress to stop the president.

Wednesday night, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, stepped in with a critical letter to the bureau demanding it explain the surprise and abrupt bullet ban.

Wolfinger was arrested in July 2015 and charged with ""going armed to the terror of the public"" when he carried the gun into a photo shop in the Cross Creek Mall.

District Attorney Billy West said investigators determined Wolfinger had the store's permission to carry the gun in for a photo shoot. The infantryman with the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division said he wanted pictures for a casting call for a ""Captain America"" movie.

Authorities say Zachary Peters was home alone when he shot Maxwell Cook, Jacob Redfern and Jakob Woodruff with an AR-15 rifle on March 27 at his home just outside the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow.

""It is the opinion of this office that Zachary Peters acted justifiably ... when he used deadly force to defend his home,"" said Wagoner County Assistant District Attorney Jack Thorp. ""It was clear he operated completely within the law when he used deadly force,"" Thorp later told The Associated Press.

The spellings of the names and the ages of the teens differ in some public records, but Wagoner County Deputy Nick Mahoney said the latest information is that Cook and Redfern were 18 and Woodruff was 15.

Wagoner County Sheriff Chris Elliott said he supports the decision not to charge Peters.

""We support the right of our citizens, the right to bear arms and to defend their homes,"" Elliott said. ""In this such case, we feel strongly that's what took place here.""

Oklahoma is one of 24 states which have laws allowing citizens to shoot someone if they believe the person threatens their safety, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

However, an Oklahoma City pharmacist was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2009 fatal shooting of a 16-year-old robber inside the pharmacy. Prosecutors said the teenager was left unconscious by one shot from the pharmacist, who then chased another robber outside the store before returning inside, picking up a second gun and shooting the still unconscious teen several more times.

Thorp also said Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, 21, of Oologah, was charged Monday with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of burglary in the case and is jailed without bond. Oklahoma law allows a person to be charged with murder if they take part in a crime in which people are killed, even if the person does not take part in the slaying.

Court records do not list an attorney for Rodriguez, but she has acknowledged driving the three to the home and waiting in a vehicle outside, and said while she understands Peters was protecting his home, she believes he could have shot the three in the legs.

""I won't take responsibility for the murders, I won't. I feel guilty, but I don't feel responsible,"" Rodriguez said in an interview last week with ABC's ""World News Tonight with David Muir.""

Elliott said the three were wearing masks, hoodies and gloves and that brass knuckles and a knife were found among their possessions.

Elliott said the group had gone to the property earlier the same day and stole liquor and electronic equipment from a garage apartment, then returned to steal more items.

""We do know at this time that Rodriquez had some indirect knowledge of the Peters' home and she believed there were expensive items inside the house,"" Elliott said, while declining to elaborate.

Rodriguez has said another person was with her outside the home, but would not identify the person.

Mahoney said investigators have found and questioned that person, but have made no arrest."
fox143,['Perry Chiaramonte'],2015-03-30 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/03/30/powerful-3d-printed-rifle-fires-nato-rounds.html,"A group of gunsmiths just 3D printed a bigger, better caliber rifle.

PrintedFirearm.com , a website devoted to 3D printing of guns, announced that one of its members successfully developed a lower receiver for a Colt CM901 rifle. The receiver for the CM901—which is considered to be a much stronger brother of the popular AR-15 assault rifle—was crafted on a XYZ Da Vinci printer, which normally costs around $500 - considered cheap in the 3D printer world. While they were not the first to 3D print a lower receiver, it seems as if Printed Firearm has taken an evolutionary step.

“This is the FIRST EVER 3d Printed AR-10 (CM901/LE901) lower receiver by JT,” reads a blog post on PrintedFirearm.com. “OH YES WE DID!!!!!!! Yes people its pure awesome sauce and it has been tested, fired with little to no issues.”

The CM901 has a similar design to the AR-15 but can fire a heavier and more powerful 7.62 millimeter round, which results in higher range and stopping power. The standard NATO rifle cartridge has a 7.62 mm diameter and a 51 mm case length.

“Is it as strong as metal, no, is it as strong as wood, probably not, is it strong enough to work, yes and it has proven just that.” - PrintedFirearm.com blogger who asked that his name be withheld

The rifle is also a modular weapons system, which allows for multiple modifications, so it is also capable of firing lighter 5.56-millimeter rounds as well.

Printed Firearm posted a five-second GIF of the lower receiver in action at a firing range. Like most 3D printed objects, the part is made from a plastic-like filament so it is not clear how many shots could be fired before it breaks or becomes damaged.

“This receiver is durable enough to work,” The Author of Printed Firearm’s blog, who asked that his name be withheld, told FoxNews.com. “The reality is the lower receiver in an AR style weapon does not need to be that strong.

Expand / Contract Schematics for the lower receiver. (printedfirearm.com)

“Is it as strong as metal, no, is it as strong as wood, probably not, is it strong enough to work, yes and it has proven just that.”

The blogger adds that the creator of the part claims to have fired over 100 rounds of ammunition without any issues of visible wear and tear.

Blueprints for parts like a lower receiver for the AR-15, have been available on the web to download for several years but this is the first instance where it has been drafted with an affordable printer and has raised the question among some in the community that an affordable rifle — from barrel to stock — will eventually be as simple as hitting the print button.

Others say it will be a long while before that is a reality.

“It’s good for the narrative for the improvements in 3D printing,” Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed, another group that made what was considered the first working 3D printed handgun back in 2013, told FoxNews.Com “But it’s going to be a long time before a rifle can be made on an affordable 3D printer.”

Makeshift gunsmiths have focused mostly on printing lower receivers because it is the only part of the rifle that has federal regulations. Every other part, such as the barrel or the handgrip can be purchased without any sort of permit.

Under current law, there are no federal restrictions on making a gun for personal use - so long as it is under the parameters of both the Gun Control Act and the National Firearms Act.

Officials for the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco,Firearms and Explosives told FoxNews.com that they are monitoring developments in 3D printing technology.

“[The] ATF routinely collaborates with the firearms industry and law enforcement to monitor new technologies and current manufacturing trends that could potentially impact the safety of the public,” Dannette Seward, a spokeswoman for the ATF said in a written statement.

Printed Firearm says that the reaction of this latest lower receiver and the low cost will increase the number of hobbyists but would do little in terms of advancing technology.

“At $500 it is something a hobbyist like myself can potentially own,” The blogger said. “The reality is most of us involved in this area of technology are doing it simply to understand what is possible.

“If one wanted to create a stronger, more reliable, item 3D printing would not likely be the best tool to use.”

Gabrielle Giffords, after Kelly said he had intended the purchase to make a political point about how easy it is to obtain the kind of firearms he's lobbying Congress to ban.

Kelly's March 5 purchase of an AR-15-style rifle and a 45.-caliber handgun at Diamondback Police Supply sparked a frenzy of reaction from both sides of the debate after he posted to Facebook a photo of himself shopping.

A background check took only a matter of minutes to complete, Kelly said in the Facebook post, adding that it's scary to think people can buy similar guns without background checks at gun shows or on the Internet.

But Kelly couldn't immediately take possession of the rifle because the shop had bought it from a customer. As a result, the store is required by a Tucson ordinance to hold the gun for 20 days to give the city enough time to make sure the weapon wasn't used in a crime.

Store owner Doug MacKinlay said Monday in a Facebook post of his own that he ""determined that was in my company's best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store.""

""While I support and respect Mark Kelly's 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use,"" MacKinlay said in the statement.

He added that the store will return Kelly's money, donate the rifle to the Arizona Tactical Officers Association to be raffled as a fundraiser and make an additional contribution of $1,295 -- the value of the rifle -- to the Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program.

Kelly's purchase of the guns sparked accusations of hypocrisy from gun-rights supporters, with many on Facebook focusing on his motivations and the rules for purchasing such guns. Kelly, a former astronaut, said he intended to eventually hand in the rifle to Tucson police but planned to keep the handgun.

Kelly and Giffords started a gun control advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, amid the wave of recent mass shootings. They have been touring the country in recent months in support of expanded background checks for gun purchases.

Kelly bought the guns at a Tucson shop the day before he appeared with his wife at the supermarket where she was wounded during a shooting rampage that left six dead and 12 others injured two years ago. Giffords resigned from Congress last year as she continues to recover from her injuries.

fox145,[],2017-10-24 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/24/north-koreas-perfect-weapon.html,"North Korea is capable of unleashing a chaotic attack on Australia or the United States without launching a single missile.

Instead the secretive nation could potentially unleash chaos with a cyber attack targeting critical infrastructure such as an electricity grid.

That’s according to Dr Greg Austin, a professor in the Australian Centre for Cyber Security at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, who said North Korea’s cyber capabilities could have a big impact.

He said the possibility of Pyongyang shutting down Sydney’s electricity grid through cyber power remained highly unlikely but protecting key infrastructure against such an attack was something the government should be prepared for.

Dr Austin stressed North Korea didn’t have the technology to launch a sustained cyber war against our critical infrastructure.

“If North Korea decided to launch an attack against Australia, it could shut down the Sydney power grid for a couple of days, but that’s about it,” he said.

“This remains highly unlikely, but for the same reason we have 12 submarines in the event that we go to war, the government must also plan to protect key infrastructure.”

His comments come as aNew York Times editorial describes hacking as “the perfect weapon for a small, impoverished, isolated, totalitarian state”.

While the world is concerned over North Korea’s missile program, the editorial highlighted that if Kim Jon-un actually used them it would mean the end of his country.

Instead Kim could target his enemies in cyberspace often without fear of reprisal.

“Cyber weapons, by contrast, offer a degree of stealth and deniability and a broad range of uses,” the Times editorial read.

“Mr Kim’s total control over his country gives him his pick of the best young brains to train as hackers; the cost is relatively low, and effective retaliation has so far proved very difficult.”

North Korea has used it for digital bank robberies, score settling and even assaults including the WannaCry ransomware attack, it noted.

Such attacks could also be carried at low cost and without the possibility of sanctions with many taking place outside of North Korea’s borders.

“North Korea represents a different sort of threat, more akin to terrorist networks, which are less susceptible to counter-attacks and sanctions that might deter a conventional government,” it said.

Dr Austin said North Korea didn’t possess the technology or resources for a sustained cyber attack.

“It’s important not to overplay North Korea’s cyber power,” Dr Austin said. “The relationship between a country’s ability to create a cyber weapon and execute cyber power is a complex one.”

UNIT 180

If North Korea does launch such an attack, chances are it stems from the secretive unit known as 180.

The unit, which forms part of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) and its main overseas intelligence agency, and was widely blamed as being behind the WannaCry attack which affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries in May this year.

Speaking after delivering the seminar Korea’s Cyber War Vortex in Canberra, Dr Austin said Unit 180 was just one number given to the North Korean spy agency’s cyber cell.

He said Pyongyang knew it couldn’t get into a direct war with the West, yet it could attack via a series of smaller wars.

North Korea had around 6000 cyber warriors on home soil and other cells known as Units 110 and 1232 and even had some active personnel in northern China.

Trump was restating a long-standing U.S. position but suggested that China now concurred with Washington that a ""freeze-for-freeze"" agreement was unacceptable.

China and Russia have proposed that as a way to restart long-stalled negotiations: that the North could freeze its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for the U.S. and its close ally South Korea stopping regular military drills that Pyongyang considers as preparation for invasion.

China has not made a public disavowal of the proposal. China said Wednesday that it would send a high-level special envoy to North Korea amid an extended chill in relations between the neighbors.

Trump was speaking a day after he returned from a 12-day trip through Asia that included a state visit to China, where he was hosted by President Xi Jinping.

""President Xi recognizes that a nuclear North Korea is a grave threat to China, and we agreed that we would not accept a so-called freeze for freeze agreement, like those that have consistently failed in the past,"" Trump said.

He said that Xi pledged to implement U.N. sanctions that aim to deprive North Korea of revenues for its weapons programs ""and to use his great economic influence over the regime to achieve our common goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.""

China is North Korea's traditional ally and accounts for about 90 percent of the isolated nation's external trade — including virtually all its oil supplies.

Speaking at the White House, Trump cast his Asian sojourn as a ""tremendous success,"" saying the United States was feted by foreign leaders and asserted its strength in the world.

""America's renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now,"" Trump said, detailing his stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump said he had three goals on the trip: to unite the world against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, to strengthen alliances in the region and to insist on ""fair and reciprocal trade.""

Trump pledged to work ""as fast as possible"" to eliminate sizable trade deficits with U.S. trading partners. He said it was ""unacceptable"" that the U.S. trade deficit with other nations stands at about $800 billion a year and promised to ""start whittling that down as fast as possible."" He did not say how he planned to achieve that goal.

Earlier, Trump used social media to spar with media coverage of his trip.

He tweeted criticism at The New York Times. He said the paper ""hates"" that he has good relationships with world leaders and ""they should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing."" He called the paper ""naive (or dumb)"" on foreign policy.

The president also tweeted Wednesday that he was ""forced"" to watch CNN during the trip and ""again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is.""

While North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un has a reputation for bizarre behavior, the nuclear arsenal and aspirations of the Republic are being taken seriously.

North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the past 11 years, the last several being the most destructive – and now they are threatening a sixth.

North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper also said in a front-page editorial that its military is prepared ""to bring to closure the history of U.S. scheming and nuclear blackmail.”

The editorial said, ""There is no limit to the strike power of the People's Army armed with our style of cutting-edge military equipment including various precision and miniaturized nuclear weapons and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.”

It is that miniaturized nuclear weapon that is the biggest concern to the United States, and the rest of the world.

“They have expressed the intent to [miniaturize a nuclear weapon],” Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News. “It raises the stakes and increases the risk of missile threats to the region and the U.S. homeland.”

North Korea would need that smaller nuclear weapon to deliver it long-distance. According to the New York Times, “As Dr. [Siegfried] Hecker, a man who has built his share of nuclear weapons, noted last week, any weapon that could travel that far would have to be 'smaller, lighter and surmount the additional difficulties of the stresses and temperatures' of a fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. By most estimates, that is four or five years away. Then again, many senior officials said the same four or five years ago.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats are expected to update senators on the North Korea situation Wednesday afternoon.

President Trump told a meeting of United Nations Security Council ambassadors on Monday they must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korea. “This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,” Trump said.

Obtaining reliable intelligence on North Korea has always been difficult. Kim Jong-un rules the country with an iron fist. The nation is so cut off from the world that is has been dubbed the ‘hermit kingdom.’

In March of last year, North Korea released photographs of Kim Jong-un inspecting what appears to be a miniaturized implosion device, but that photo op was met with skepticism. “No reason to believe that is true, or to disbelieve it. No reason to dismiss it or to panic,” Karako said. He added, “I think that our insight into these programs is relatively modest. I think the posture of our military is to assume the worst.”

This has the U.S., and the world, on high alert. The Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, published an editorial on Tuesday stating, “The game of chicken between Washington and Pyongyang has come to a breaking point. If North Korea carries out a sixth nuclear test as expected, it is more likely than ever that the situation will cross the point of no return.”"

The Latest on the situation in Syria (all times local):

2:35 p.m.

The global chemical weapons watchdog says it is investigating recent allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said its fact-finding mission is ""investigating all credible allegations"" and reporting its findings to the organization's member states.

The mission, however, does not have a mandate to apportion blame for chemical attacks in Syria.

Earlier Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told BFM TV that ""all indications show us today that the Syrian regime is using chlorine gas at the moment"" in attacks on rebel-held areas.

On Tuesday, a U.N.-mandated investigator said his team was probing reports that bombs allegedly containing weaponized chlorine have been used on two recent occasions in Syria

11:25 a.m.

France says the Syrian government is likely using chlorine gas in its latest attacks on rebel-held areas.

Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told BFM TV on Wednesday that ""all indications show us today that the Syrian regime is using chlorine gas at the moment.""

The government and its ally Russia have been pounding a besieged rebel-held area outside Damascus for the last two days with airstrikes, killing dozens of people.

A U.N.-mandated investigator said Tuesday his team was probing reports that bombs allegedly containing weaponized chlorine have been used on two recent occasions in Syria.

""An investigation has been opened on that matter by the United Nations,"" Le Drian said. ""The threat of using chemical weapons remains, this is a very serious situation."""
fox149,['Cody Derespina'],2016-02-03 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/02/03/pentagons-secret-weapon-maker.html,"A department deep inside the Pentagon that officials “don’t often talk about” is churning out 3D-printed micro drones, self-driving boats and an electromagnetic railgun that can shoot a projectile at 4,500 mph – all in the name of combatting the growing global threat from Russia and China.

Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Tuesday unveiled some of the latest contraptions developed by the Strategic Capabilities Office during a preview of the DoD’s budget proposal. Carter, who created the SCO in 2012 when he was deputy secretary, described the department’s aim as reimagining existing fighting systems “by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.”

The man currently responsible for doing the confounding is an Oxford-trained physicist who admitted to “reciting digits of pi when waiting in line,” according to a 2002 profile after he was named a Rhodes Scholar.

SCO Director William Roper said then that he knew 1,000 digits of the unending strain.

“But I don’t wait in lines that long,” he said.

Roper’s resume reads like character backstory from “The Big Bang Theory.” He graduated summa cum laude from Georgia Tech with a master’s degree in physics and earned a doctorate in mathematics at Oxford. He was a Rhodes Scholar, Truman Scholar and received a presidential commendation for founding and directing a tutoring program that served 400 Georgia schools.

Roper started at the Missile Defense Agency in August 2009 and by May 2010 he was the agency’s chief architect. He won an award for Contractor of the Year, a Technology Award for unmanned airborne systems and an Innovation Award for European Phased Adaptive Approach. As the SCO's director since August 2012, he has added another Innovation Award and an Award for Excellence.

Oh, and Roper is a published poet and essayist, second-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and has performed in a chamber choir.

At SCO, however, the renaissance man leads a crew developing systems that sound straight out of a science fiction flick, such as the “swarming” micro drones that can either “fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9” or be “thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert,” according to Carter.

“And for the water, they’ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk,” he said.

Carter’s comments could have been aimed at numerous U.S. antagonists. For one, Iran captured 10 Navy sailors last month when their boats drifted too near to Farsi Island. They were released after a day, but not before being videotaped kneeling with their hands on their heads and apologizing. Another future consideration could be the wariness with which the U.S. is viewing China’s construction of an artificial island in the South China Sea. Sending unmanned ships near the mass could be a safer method to monitor its development.

The railgun also is being viewed as an answer for “gun-based missile defense,” Carter said. The hypervelocity railgun projectiles would be fitted onto guns already in the Navy’s inventory.

SCO has “grown from this little hobby shop into this major defense organization,” a source familiar with the organization told USNI News. “They have money and can spend it without a lot of red tape.”"

The KCNA news agency said glitches detected in an earlier test have been ""perfectly overcome,"" paving the way for the weapon to be mass produced and deployed nationwide, according to SkyNews.

State media reported the new weapon system is designed to ""detect and strike different targets flying from any location.""

The latest test was attended by Kim Jong Un, in addition to three men believed to be the top officials in the reclusive country's missile program.

The three men were identified by Reuters as Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of the Academy of National Defense Science, a weapons development and procurement center.

North Korean state media said the weapons system would stop hostile nations ""boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty.""

On Friday, officials said the Pentagon will try to shoot down an intercontinental-range missile for the first time in a test this week. The goal is to more closely simulate a North Korean ICBM aimed at the U.S. homeland, officials said.

North Korea is now the focus of U.S. efforts because its leader has vowed to field a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching American territory. He has yet to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, but Pentagon officials believe he is speeding in that direction.

Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said last week that ""left unchecked,"" Kim will eventually succeed.

The Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, which is responsible for developing and testing the system, has scheduled the intercept test for Tuesday.

An interceptor is to be launched from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and soar toward the target, which will be fired from a test range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. If all goes as planned, the ""kill vehicle"" will slam into the ICBM-like target's mock warhead high over the Pacific Ocean.

The target will be a custom-made missile meant to simulate an ICBM, meaning it will fly faster than missiles used in previous intercept tests, according to Christopher Johnson, spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency. The target is not a mock-up of an actual North Korean ICBM.

""We conduct increasingly complex test scenarios as the program matures and advances,"" Johnson said Friday. ""Testing against an ICBM-type threat is the next step in that process.""

The program included a feature nicknamed ""Greyball"" internally that identified regulators who were posing as riders while trying to collect evidence that Uber’s service was breaking local laws governing taxis.

To stymie those efforts, Uber served up a fake version of its app to make it appear the undercover regulators were summoning a car, only to have the ride canceled. The San Francisco company mined the data that it collects through its real app to pinpoint the undercover agents.

The New York Times revealed Greyball's existence in a story published Friday based on information provided by four current and former Uber employees who were not named.

Uber acknowledged it has used Greyball to counter regulators working with the company's opponents to entrap its drivers.

Greyball is part of a broader program called VTOS, shorthand for ""violations of terms of service,"" that Uber says it developed to protect its service.

""This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service — whether that's people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret 'stings' meant to entrap drivers,"" Uber said.

Although Uber is becoming more widely accepted than in its early years, the company says it still uses Greyball as a tool in some cities that it declined to identify.

The Times reported that Uber has targeted regulators in Boston, Paris and Las Vegas, among other cities, as well as a litany of countries that include Australia, China, Italy and South Korea.

The cat-and-mouse game with regulators is the latest example of the aggressive tactics that Uber has adopted while upending the heavily regulated taxi industry. In doing so, Uber has built a rapidly growing company valued at more than $60 billion by its investors that is frequently accused of bending the rules.

Among other things, the company has faced lawsuits for classifying its drivers as independent contractors to save money and allegedly stealing the technology for a fleet of autonomous cars that it is currently testing. In the past two weeks, a former female engineer alleged Uber routinely ignores claims of sexual harassment and a video surfaced of CEO Travis Kalanick profanely berating a driver who confronted him about steep cuts in its rates for a premium version of its service.

Uber’s rise also has raised tensions in cities that have sometimes gone to extreme measures to crack down on a service that they contended was operating without the proper permits. In Las Vegas, local taxi regulators confronted an Uber driver while wearing ski masks. And in Florida, Hillsborough regulators coordinated with taxi and limousine companies on an undercover operation that lured out Uber drivers so they could be assessed $700 fines."

North Korean soldiers shot at the unidentified North Korean soldier when he ran from the guard post at the northern side of the village, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.

He suffered gunshot wounds to his elbow and shoulder and was taken to the hospital when South Korean soldiers found him about 25 minutes later on the southern side of the Joint Security Area, a strip of land where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face, the military said, according to the South’s Yonhap News Agency.

""He crossed from a North Korea post towards our [South Korean] Freedom House,” the South said in a statement.

It’s unclear what the soldier’s conditions are or why he decided to defect to the South. The South Korean military said he was unarmed and was wearing a combat uniform for a law ranking soldier.

South Korean military said there was no armed conflict after the incident, but they are “increasing alertness” for a possible provocation from North Korea.

""Currently, there are no unusual signs in the North Korean military, but we are increasing alertness against the possibility of North Korean provocations,"" officials told Yonhap News Agency.

About 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the Korean War, but most travel through China. An estimated 1,000 people flee Kim Jong Un’s volatile regime each year, but going through the DMZ — fortified with land mines, barbed wires and machine guns — have been extremely rare because of the dangerous conditions. This year, North Korean defectors successfully escaping the regime fell by 12.7 percent, according to the Telegraph.

The soldier’s successful escape makes only the fourth defection by a North Korean soldier through the DMZ in the last three years, the BBC reported. Yonhap News agency said Kim’s military officials reportedly “cherry-pick” loyal soldiers who are stationed at the DMZ.

At Panmunjom, once an obscure farming village inside the 2 1/2-mile-wide DMZ that separating the rivaling countries, North Korean soldiers wearing lapel pins with the images of late North Korean leaders often use binoculars to monitor visitors from the South. They stand only several yards away from tall South Korean soldiers wearing aviator sunglasses and standing motionless like statues.

Panmunjomis where an armistice was signed to pause the Korean War. Jointly controlled by the American-led U.N. Command and North Korea, the DMZ is guarded on both sides by hundreds of thousands of combat-ready troops, razor-wire fences and tank traps. More than a million mines are believed to be buried inside the zone.

The defection came during escalated tensions between the North and the South and nearly a week after President Trump visited Seoul for his five-country Asia tour. American presidents often visit Panmunjom and other DMZ areas during their trips to South Korea to reaffirm their security commitment to the South. Trump planned to visit the DMZ to underscore his stance against North Korea's nuclear program when he came to South Korea last week as part of an Asian tour, but his plans were thwarted by heavy fog that prevented his helicopter from landing at the border area.

Areas around Panmunjom were the site of bloodshed and defection attempts by North Koreans in the past, but there have been no such incidents in recent years.

The most famous incident was in 1976, when two American army officers were killed by ax-wielding North Korean soldiers. The attack prompted Washington to fly nuclear-capable B-52 bombers toward the DMZ in an attempt to intimidate North Korea.

In 1984, North Korean and U.N. Command soldiers traded gunfire after a Soviet citizen defected by sprinting to the South Korean sector of the truce village. The incident left three North Korean soldiers and one South Korean soldier dead. In 1998, a North Korean solider fled to South Korea via Panmunjom.

Rosemary Billquist, a 43-year-old hospital worker, hospice volunteer and marathoner, was killed Thanksgiving eve while walking her two yellow Labradors, Stella and Sugar, behind her home in the town of Sherman about 5:30 p.m., under an already dark early evening sky.

Hunter Thomas Jadlowski told police he fired a single round from his hunting pistol at what he thought was a deer the length of two football fields away. He heard Billquist cry out, ran to her and called 911. Jadlowski was applying pressure to Billquist's wound when first responders arrived in the field.

Billquist's husband, Jamie Billquist, told reporters he was inside his house when the barking of his dogs, who had come home on their own, stirred the first signs of dread.

He rode with his wife in an ambulance to a hospital 30 miles (48 kilometers) away in Erie, Pennsylvania, where she died.

""She was like an angel,"" Jamie Billquist told WIVB-TV. ""She would help anybody and do anything you know for anybody before she would do anything for herself.""

The rifle hunting season was not yet a week old when investigators from the state Department of Environmental Conservation and Chautauqua County Sheriff began investigating the death. One key factor is timing, since the shooting happened about 40 minutes after sunset.

It is illegal to hunt big game after sunset or before dawn in New York state.

Chautauqua County District Attorney Patrick Swanson said his office would ask a grand jury to consider charges of criminally negligent homicide or reckless conduct that resulted in Billquist's death. Either felony charge could result in several years in prison.

""Two lives were lost at that moment,"" Sheriff Joseph Gerace said.

Jadlowski could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A telephone listing was not in service.

The sheriff said it is not uncommon, nor illegal, for hunters to use the type of higher-power pistol Jadlowski had. Some of the weapons are holdovers from before rifle hunting of deer and bear became legal in the county in 2011, he said. He described the gun as ""like a rifle without a stock.""

While noting the majority of hunters are responsible, Gerace said he and neighboring counties in the rural westernmost corner of the state see their share of hunting incidents.

Two days after Billquist's death, Gerace's office charged an Ohio man with reckless endangerment for opening fire on a brown pick-up truck he believed was a deer. One round from a high-powered rifle struck the truck but missed its two occupants.

""Occasionally we have people use horrible judgment and negligence and it ends up in tragedy,"" the sheriff said.

In the days since Billquist's death, her husband and others have recalled acts of kindness they said were typical, recounting for reporters how she brought pets to hospice patients and placed a bench outside a local hospital where she worked after seeing a man laboring to stand. She stenciled on it: ""In a world where you can be anything, be kind.""

A funeral was scheduled for Wednesday at Sherman Community Church, following a wake Tuesday.

At a vigil on Thanksgiving, dozens of neighbors left their homes to sing ""Amazing Grace"" at a vigil.

""She could've really made a difference in a lot more people's lives,"" Jamie Billquist said. ""In just the short time she was here, obviously she touched a lot of lives."""

After several assault rifle development-dominated years, companies large and small have unveiled a more balanced spectrum of new options for the upcoming year at the 2018 SHOT Show.

From better fits for young hunters to enhanced power for big game, outdoorsmen will have a wide crop of exciting new rifles with different focuses and features to choose from.

Here are six of these new options from Weatherby, Mossberg, Winchester, Browning, Savage and Wilson Combat.

Weatherby - Mark V CarbonMark

Family-run Weatherby is one of the younger companies in the field, but the Mark V’s extraordinary craftsmanship and performance immediately made it a family heirloom that has already passed from generation to generation during the past six decades or so.

This year, Weatherby has enhanced this Mark V classic with some high-tech additions. The carbon fiber-wrapped barrel made by Proof Research is designed to provide supreme accuracy, reduce weight by a remarkable 64 percent to comparable steel barrels, and dissipate heat faster than all-steel barrels.

The nine-lug magnum action and signature LXX trigger are two more key advantages on the hunt with the 7.75-pound Mark V CarbonMark. With Weatherby or premium factory ammo, these rifles are guaranteed to shoot .99-inch or less 3-shot groups at 100 yards.

The suggested retail price for this American beauty is $4,100.

THE BEST GIFTS FOR CAMPERS, HIKERS AND OUTDOORSY TYPES

Mossberg - Patriot Synthetic Cerakote

For rugged durability and lightweight accuracy, the new bolt-action Mossberg Patriot Syntetic Cerakote hunting rifle is a great new option at an easy-on-the-wallet price.

Mossberg launched the Patriot three years ago and it became an instant hit. Find yourself hunting in tough weather? With this model, the Sythetic Cerakote's stainless finish will provide protection so you don’t need to worry about damage to your rifle.

Like the other Patriot rifles, this latest version includes Mossberg’s bladed Lightning Bolt Action trigger, which is adjustable from two to seven pounds. It also measure 42.25 inches long and weighs just 6.5 pounds.

The optic mounting process is easy since it ships with two Weaver bases installed, giving you a stable platform for your scope.

The suggested retail price is $440.

Fit is so important, and this new Winchester XPR Hunter Compact is an excellent new option for younger shooters and women. The shorter barrel and shorter length of pull will deliver a better fit and better accuracy, while the low weight (6 pounds, 12 ounces) will make long hunts easier for someone of smaller stature.

Winchester has incorporated their “inflex technology recoil pad.” This helps reduce felt recoil by directing energy down and away from your cheek.

Their M.O.A. trigger system is specially designed to give hunters excellent accuracy by preventing factors like creep, over-travel and take-up.

The Mossy Oak Break-Up Country camo and Permacote matte surface help reduce glare, too, preventing game from spotting you and getting spooked — but it also looks fantastic.

There’s a range of calibers to suit your needs. Suggested retail prices start at $599.99.

PODCAST: INSIDER’S GUIDE TO SHOT SHOW 2018 WITH A MARINE RECON TURNED HUNTER

Hunting predators? Or big game, like moose? For long range performance in high mountain and big game hunts, Browning launched the X-Bolt Pro Long Range.

The X-Bolts were first introduced about 10 years ago, and this latest addition that adds a rotary magazine and Browning’s crisp, feather adjustable trigger for 2018. A muzzle brake also delivers reduced recoil.

This new X-Bolt rifle features a carbon-fiber stock, stainless steel receiver and a 26-inch heavy-sporter fluted threaded barrel with a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish.

Browning’s barrel lapping process is designed to improve accuracy. And as an added bonus, cleaning is easier because it also reduces fouling.

This lightweight rifle weight just over 6 pounds, too.

Available in a wide range of chamberings, the X-Bolt Pro Long Range comes with a suggested retail price of $2,099-$2,179.

Savage - 110 Predator With AccuFit

From coyotes through to squirrels, the Savage 110 Predator can tackle a wide range of hunting with an enhanced fit. Better fit helps to handle recoil, improves trigger control and should, in theory, give a shooter better accuracy.

The new Savage 110 Predator AccuFit stock allows users to customize their Predator for the best fit with several interchangeable combs and pull spacers.

The 8.25- to 8.69-pound rifle has a synthetic stock is covered in Realtree MAX-1 camo and heavy-contour carbon steel fluted barrel with a threaded muzzle.

Other key features include an oversized bolt knob for fast cycling with gloved hands, as well as an adjustable bladed AccuTrigger, the AccuStock, and two-piece Weaver bases, so scope mounting is fast and easy.

Suggested retail for the Predator is $899.

For hunting any big game found in North America, one new option for 2018 is the Wilson Combat .458 HAM'R Tactical Hunter.

Wilson Combat built the rifle to be the hardest-hitting and most powerful AR-platform on the market with the .458 HAM’R designed to exceed the energy of common big-bore cartridges like the .50 Beowulf.

The Tactical Hunter measures 34.25 inches long when the stock is collapsed, and weighs 7 pounds, 11 ounces.

The suggested retail price on the Tactical Hunter starts at $2,905."

The M4 is an updated version of the M16, which was designed for close quarters combat in Vietnam. But while the weapon is better suited for the kind of urban warfare common in Iraq, some have questioned whether it is deadly and accurate for Afghanistan – where U.S. troops often find themselves in long-range combat.

An Army study found that the 5.56mm bullets fired from the M4s don’t retain enough velocity past 1,000 feet to kill an enemy. In Afghanistan, forces are often up to 2,500 feet apart.

“It just makes no sense,” said Maj. Gen. Robert Scales Jr., a Fox News military analyst.

Scales said the M4 is “unsuitable” for Afghan terrain and “notoriously unreliable” in the first place. The Army Times reported on an Army weapons test three years ago that found the M4 performed worse than three other newer carbines when subjected to an “extreme dust test.”

Problems with the M4 locking up were also cited in a study last year on a July 2008 firefight that left nine U.S. soldiers dead in eastern Afghanistan.

The Taliban are meanwhile using heavier bullets that allow them to fire at U.S. and NATO troops from distances that are out of range of the M4.

To counter these tactics, the U.S. military is designating nine soldiers in each infantry company to serve as sharpshooters, according to Maj. Thomas Ehrhart, who wrote the Army study. The sharpshooters are equipped with the new M110 sniper rifle, which fires a larger 7.62mm round and is accurate to at least 2,500 feet.

As for what could ultimately replace the M4, the Army’s center for small-arms development is trying to find a solution.

Col. Douglas Tamilio, program manager for U.S. Army firearms at the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, said the M4 has the advantage of more-rapid firepower.

“The 5.56 caliber is more lethal since it can put more rounds on target,” he told The Associated Press. But he acknowledged the weapon is much less effective at 2,000 feet out.

A possible compromise would be an interim-caliber round combining the best characteristics of the 5.56 mm and 7.62 cartridges, Tamilio said.

Scales said the U.S. military simply needs to engineer a better weapon – he said the M8, a weapon that was under development before being halted several years ago, could be revived and improved for Afghanistan.

“We’re the world’s largest superpower. Why don’t we just make one,” Scales said. “This isn’t rocket science. We’re not putting a man on the moon here.”

Callaway, who grew up around guns and is president of the school’s Students for the Second Amendment club, first sensed the campus-wide opposition to her hobby when the group applied for an extracurricular grant for ammunition. They were denied, then appealed and eventually received a $500 stipend. The victory was short-lived, however, as outraged students successfully pressed school officials to explicitly prohibit ammo funding going forward.

“The majority of our student body does not support our group,” Callaway told FoxNews.com, adding that classmates perceive members of the club as “crazy gun kids” who intend to “shoot up the school.”

The purpose of campus clubs like Callaway’s is to promote safe and responsible handling of firearms. Once a staple of collegiate athletic departments and intramural scenes, pistol and riflery clubs and competitions have come under fire in recent years.

Mass shootings and increasing politicization of the gun debate have left the activity marginalized, especially at eastern schools “staffed by liberals who have never touched a firearm in their lives,” according to the Young America’s Foundation spokeswoman Emily Jashinsky.

“[As gun issues] become a hotter topic and the more conservatives voice their opinions, the more liberals will try to stifle them,” Jashinsky said, adding that universities are “the most insulated bubbles of leftist thought.”

Expand / Contract Members of the Colorado State University Shotgun Sports Club at the National Shooting Complex in San Antonio, Texas.

Members of student shooting teams may turn to off-campus sources of financial help when university officials withdraw ammunition funding. The NRA, which provides funding to nearly 70 universities, saw an 8 percent increase in requests between 2015 and 2016 for programs including shooting sports teams and clubs.

“Funding from the [NRA] Foundation often fills the gap when school budgets are not able to do so,” NRA spokesman Jason Brown told FoxNews.com in an email.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation has provided about $1 million in funding to shooting teams to alleviate travel and ammunition costs. That also has prompted criticism from students and faculty, who say groups that lobby against gun control should have no influence on campus.

Organization officials insist its student grant program is entirely separate and non-political.

“This has nothing whatsoever to do with concerns about campus carry or unfortunate, tragic incidences that have occurred on university campuses,” said NSSF spokesman Michael Bazinet.

Bazinet insists the sole intention of the NSSF, which provides $100,000 per year to universities, is to increase student participation in recreational shooting sports, which are present at the Olympic Games and the “polar opposite” of criminal activity.

Expand / Contract Members of the University of Delaware Students for the Second Amendment Club state their case on campus

A former shotgun club president, whose team was awarded $7,500 from the NSSF in 2009 and continues to receive financial support from the NRA, declined to be named out of fear his university would punish the group.

“Our school is not fond of our team because of guns,” he told FoxNews.com of his state university, which prohibits the group from spending school funds on ammo and refuses to provide the same scholarships allotted to other programs.

“It’s sad that we must worry about repercussions because of talking about our Second Amendment rights,” he said, adding pro-gun organizations have never imposed political opinions on the team and provide funds solely for sport, since a single event costs the team about $120.

The NSSF also provided $5,000 to Oklahoma State University’s shotgun club in 2012. Without outside funding, the team’s practices and competitions would be prohibitively expensive, club president Cody Sutton said.

“The health of these shooting programs is extremely important for the development of responsible firearms enthusiasts and competitors,” he told FoxNews.com.

Ernest Eckenrode, captain of the trap and skeet team at Washington College, in Chestertown, Md., agreed, stating his group uses grant money to educate new shooters about gun safety.

“Every gun club has safety as a top priority,” he told FoxNews.com, insisting the NSSF has never attempted to politicize the team. “The fund money in no way funds harmful actions with weapons.”

A ban on financial aid from organizations like the NSSF is a typical strategy utilized by universities to obstruct conservative clubs from obtaining funds, according to Jashinsky.

Yale University’s Pistol Club and Skeet and Trap Club each received $5,000 from the organization in 2012. The pistol club credited the NSSF in a report, saying its “generous grant money was vital in [our] ability to participate” for the first time in the National NRA Intercollegiate Pistol Championships.

But Yale now prohibits lobbying organizations like the NSSF from providing funding to student groups.

“I can assure you that club funding from shooting or firearm-related organizations is not permitted,” Yale spokesman Thomas Conroy told FoxNews.com in an email.

Conroy reasoned that accepting funds from such organizations requires a vetting process and that internal funding to the team is sufficient.

Politicizing university shooting clubs is a “great disservice to society as a whole,” according to Bazinet, who stressed students learn important life skills when participating in an organized team in a safe environment.

“It’s not as if they take their firearm to class with them,” he said."

World Peace and Unification Sanctuary in Newfoundland said it planned the Feb. 28 ceremony months ago, well before last week's massacre at a Florida high school. Authorities say the alleged gunman used an AR-15 in the attack that killed 17.

Tim Elder, the Unification Sanctuary's director of world missions, said Tuesday the church believes the AR-15 symbolizes the ""rod of iron"" mentioned in the Bible's apocalyptic book of Revelation.

The church website directs couples to show up to the ceremony with an AR-15 ""or equivalents such as an AK semiautomatic rifle, representing both the intent and the ability to defend one's family, community ... ""

The church is down the road from Wallenpaupack South Elementary School, and some parents expressed alarm at the planned ceremony.

""It's something I would consider keeping my child home. It's scary,"" parent Liz Zoccola told WNEP-TV.

""I wish they wouldn't have it at all. I don't think there's a good time to have it, especially this close,"" Kendra Hanor, another parent, told the station.

Elder told the AP that the weapons will be unloaded, secured with zip ties and checked at the door. He said the church did not consider canceling or moving the ceremony.

""Now more than ever, good people need to stand up and claim for themselves the tools that can be used to stop that kind of evil,"" he said.

State police are aware of the event but do not plan to send any troopers to it, since the church is breaking no law, Trooper Mark Keyes said Tuesday.

The Unification Sanctuary's leader, the Rev. Sean Moon, is the son of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, a self-proclaimed messiah who founded the Unification Church, which is often described as a cult.

The Pennsylvania offshoot is a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment. Unification Sanctuary operates a group called Rod of Iron Ministries, which is hosting a ""President Trump Thank You Dinner"" on Saturday — a fundraiser for Gun Owners of America.

The Rev. Sean Moon's brother founded Kahr Arms, a gun manufacturer."

""The number one myth is these are machine guns. They're not machine guns. They're semi-auto, meaning I pull the trigger one time, I get one bullet,"" said Jeff Serdy of AJI Sporting Goods near Phoenix.

Serdy is among those who claim the features that allow these guns to qualify as ""assault"" weapons have little to do with how deadly they are. They include ""a telescoping stock, pistol grip, ability to accept a magazine, and a flash-hider.""

He said: ""This AR-15 is no more dangerous than this hunting rifle which is used for woodchucks all across the East.""

A bill similar to what Obama is calling for is expected to be introduced soon by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who also helped author the last assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004. The National Academy of Sciences determined that effort had ""no clear impact on gun violence,"" though groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence say the ban did have some impact on crime.

But Feinstein's new bill reduces the allowable number of ""military characteristics"" from two to one and does not allow gun makers to include cheap work-arounds like flash suppressors and bayonet lugs. The result is a proposed ban that could be more sweeping.

It also bans any magazine whose capacity is greater than 10 rounds and 'bullet buttons"" -- which are simple devices used to allow an owner to quickly change magazines.

Gun control advocates say those changes will make the new bill more effective.

""The combination of improved and expanded background checks, effective bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and stronger anti-trafficking laws will work together to prevent another Newtown and to stem the daily gun violence that tears apart too many families and communities,"" according to a statement released Wednesday from the Violence Policy Center.

The new Feinstein bill will also specifically ban 120 weapons, including the popular AK-47 and AR-15, often called the Barbie Doll of guns because it is so easily accessorized. The AR-15 is the most popular gun sold in the U.S. today, with almost one-half of users saying they use it for target shooting.

Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, took to Twitter on Friday to say that he and other residents in the Cornhusker State “love our constitutional rights” and welcome the convection in their state.

Kansas' Secretary of State Kris Kobach has also invited the group.

“I’ve already reached out to the @NRA and urged them to bring the #NRA convention to #KS.,” Kobach tweeted Friday. “Kansans love our right to keep and bear arms. Kansas is the most pro-gun state in America. Our right to keep and bear arms const. amendment passed by greater margins than any other state.”

Their remarks follow Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway, who in the aftermath of the deadly Valentine’s Day shooting at a Florida high school, said the NRA should “reconsider” coming to his city because “there will be marches and demonstrations.”

Seventeen people died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., when accused gunman Nikolas Cruz, 19, opened fire with an AR-14 rifle.

The NRA has been criticized in the aftermath of the massacre by those who say the gun rights group is keeping lawmakers in Washington and across the country from passing measures that would curb gun violence.

Since the shooting, several companies have severed tied with the group, including Delta Airlines, Enterprise Holdings, First National Bank of Omaha, Symantec and MetLife. The First National Bank of Omaha said it would no longer issue NRA-branded VISA credit cards.

The annual NRA convention, which features meetings and exhibits over three days, routinely draws thousands of gun enthusiasts. This year’s event is set for May 4-6 at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center in Dallas.

Following Caraway’s remarks, the NRA said after Caraway’s remarks that it will not consider moving the convention.

“Our members work in fire stations and police departments,” the group said. “They save lives in local hospitals and own businesses in communities urban and rural throughout this country. No politician anywhere can tell the NRA not to come to their city. We are already there.”

At the Conservative Political Action Conferences outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday, the gun right group’s chief executive Wayne LaPierre slammed critics.

“They don’t care about our schoolchildren,” LaPierre said Thursday. “They want to make all of us less free,” adding that Democrats are pushing a “socialist” agenda to deprive gun owners of their weapons.

“Socialism is a movement that loves a smear,"" he added.

For a range of budgets and objectives, here are five highlights of the best rifles unveiled for 2017.

Browning BAR Safari Rifle

Considering investing in a rifle with some meaningful military history behind it? Then Browning has a special limited-edition option for you. Unveiled at SHOT, the rifle will be tough to nab because they are only producing a mere one-hundred pieces.

Before World War I, the US Army commissioned John Browning to design a next-level rifle. He created the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) in a remarkable three months – such a brilliant design that it withstood the test of time. The BAR continued to be used by the military through World War II until Vietnam. John Browning’s grandson then introduced a sporting twist on this iconic weapon and teamed up with FN to leverage their expertise as well.

JOHN WAYNE GUNS FOR BEGINNERS REVEALED AT SHOT SHOW

In honor of the 100th anniversary, Browning is introducing the BAR Safari 100th Anniversary model with some special features. The stock is high-end Grade V Turkish walnut with oil finish. And military and hunting scenes will be engraved on the steel receiver and highlighted with gold.

It weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces, and is 44 inches long including the 22 inch barrel length. This semi-automatic sporting classic BAR rifle will be available for around $2,699.99.

Remington Model 700 American Wilderness Rifle

Speaking of anniversaries and safaris, another iconic American company, Remington, has reached 200 years and revealed their new big game rifle – the Model American Wilderness Rifle (AWR).

It is designed to be very durable and performs extremely well in tough outdoor conditions while looking good at the same time.

The Model 700 AWR has a stainless steel action and a black Cerakote coated 24-inch free-floated 5R barrel to withstand any abuse your remote adventures might throw at it.

SHOT SHOW 2017: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

The rifle also has a very robust Grayboe stock with high fiberglass content to provide further durability against weather you may come up against in the wilderness.

And the trigger? There’s an X-Mark Pro that is externally adjustable.

The AWR will be on sale in 2017 for about $1,225.

Ruger 10-22 Takedown Lite

Whether you need to react and move quickly or are just keen on a highly capable, accurate rifle that you can store and carry easily, the new 10-22 Takedown Lite is a big reveal at SHOT for 2017.

The 10-22 Takedown Lite is a rapid takedown separating the action from the cold hammer-forged barrel. And where does the Lite come in? This new rifle weighs 4.5 pounds, making it a great option for long days at the range, for women who prefer a lighter weight, and for professionals who want to stay light, fast, and agile.

Just how easy is it to takedown? Thanks to the very smart design it is incredibly easy. You just lock the bolt back, push the recessed lever and twist the subassemblies pulling it apart. That’s it. It is literally that fast.

The design incorporates a threaded muzzle with a thread cap that can be easily removed to use muzzle accessories. It also features the Ruger Modular Stock System with a standard pull length and low comb.

There’s a detachable 10-round rotary magazine with a cutting-edge rotor that enhances feeding reliability. The 10-22 Takdown Lite comes with the option of a high comb standard pull length module too and will be available for about $659.

Winchester XPC

Another new chassis-based precision rifle for this year is the Winchester XPC. Designed for extreme accuracy, the action is based on their popular XPR, and there’s a threaded muzzle with target crown.

The free-floating barrel features a Permacote black finish. The design incorporates a cerakote fully machined alloy frame chassis and the Magpul PRS Gen 3 fully adjustable butt stock. There’s an M.O.A. trigger system and two-position thumb safety.

The ten-pounder, bolt-action XPC is very accessory friendly. There’s a 20-MOA scope base, full-length top Picatinny rail and an M-LOK accessory rail.

This new rifle is expected to be available for about $1,599.99.

Saint shines at SHOT Show

The Saint made by Springfield Armory is definitely another standout. It was introduced at the very end of last year and made its first appearance at SHOT, drawing a whole lot of buzz.

Fit for fighting and for the range, this new AR-15-style rifle has a mid-length gas system, Bravo Company’s slim contour Polymer KeyMod handguard, an enhanced trigger, well-balanced weight, excellent accuracy and much more.

At Range Day, while testing this rifle out, folks raved about Springfield's Accu-Tite Tension system that tightens up the space between the lower and upper receivers. The new Saint retails for about $899.

Spike’s Tactical in Apopka etched its new $1,395 AR-15 with a Bible verse that says “Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle,” MyFoxOrlando reported.

Company spokesman Ben Thomas, a former Navy SEAL, said the scripture is something of an insurance policy to keep it out of the hands of terrorists. The idea came to him during the weapon's development. At the time, the U.S. government was preparing to arm rebel groups in Syria.

“When you make a rifle, you have to understand that it could be used for ill deeds if it got in the wrong hands,” Thomas told the station.

“Sadly, this manufacturer’s fancy new gun won’t do anything to stop the real threat in America: the escalating problem of gun violence,” the council told the station. “This is just another shameful marketing ploy intended to profit from the promotion of hatred, division, and violence.”

Thomas defended the Crusader, saying he would like to take a weapon with scripture etched on the side into battle and that the gun is not meant to be racist.

“We didn’t say ‘No Muslims,’” he said.

The scripture is etched on one side of the magazine. Etched on the other is a symbol of a cross that dates from the Crusades of the Middle Ages.

Thomas told the Orlando Sentinel the company's owners did not intend to insult or antagonize Muslims.

He told the paper the owners believe America and much of the world is threatened by Islamic terrorism and the weapon is a symbol of shared Christian values and the right to defend themselves.

Thomas also told the paper the safety selector that controls the Crusader's trigger has three settings: Peace, War and God Wills It.

“Let’s make a deal DO NOT come to Florida for spring break unless gun legislation is passed. These [politicians] won’t listen to us so maybe [they’ll] listen to the billion dollar tourism industry in FL,” tweeted David Hogg, a 17-year-old senior and student reporter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida.

Hogg — who has been a major player in the student-activist movement staging protests in Florida calling for stricter gun laws — sent the tweet to his followers, which now number more than 300,000.

Hogg — whose Twitter bio describes him as a “film maker, entrepreneur, surfer” — co-founded the student mobilization group Never Again MSD, creating the #neveragain hashtag online and calling for a ban on certain weapons and improved care for the mentally ill since a shooter slaughtered 17 people at the Parkland high school on Valentine’s Day. “MSD” refers to his Parkland school.

Alleged teen gunman, Nikolas Cruz, used an AR-15 and had a history of emotional problems, according to investigators. Cruz was arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.

Wendy Glaab, 60, of Fonthill, Ontario, Canada, was among the first to respond to his tweet. “I like many Canadians travel to Florida from time to time to escape our winter. I can’t speak for others but I will not be returning until meaningful gun control legislation is in place.”

Glaab told The Associated Press on Saturday that her sister owns property in Fort Lauderdale and she is able to visit any time she chooses.

“Better Idea: Spend your spring break in Puerto Rico, it’s a beautiful place with amazing people. They could really use the economic support that the government has failed to provide,” Hogg followed up in a separate tweet.

It’s too soon to tell how significantly the aftermath of the massacre might sway the country’s wider gun debate.

National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference that people advocating for stricter gun control were exploiting the Florida shooting.

President Donald Trump has suggested some teachers could be armed so they could fire on any attacker. However, Trump also has called for raising the minimum age for purchasing semi-automatic rifles, a move the NRA has opposed.

In the aftermath of the Valentine’s Day school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead, the president has pledged to make schools safer and reduce gun violence. After raising the idea of banning “bump stocks” and curbing young people’s access to guns, he has spent much of the past week endorsing the arming of some trained teachers and school officials to stop ""savage sicko"" shooters, an approach the gun lobby supports.

In a tweet on Saturday afternoon, he reiterated that position: “Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept & have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.”

But some gun owners, who supported Trump in a big way in 2016, want to make sure their viewpoint is heard, too.

""Out in the firearms community there is a great feeling of betrayal and abandonment because of the support he was given in his campaign for president,"" Tony Fabian, president of the Colorado Sports Shooting Association, said Friday, according to The Associated Press.

The comments highlight the deft maneuvering needed by Trump and the GOP to act decisively while also paying attention to a politically potent constituency.

Just the preliminary act of floating proposals that defy the National Rifle Association and other groups drew threats of political retribution and legal action. This, despite the fact that in recent days, the NRA has come over increasing pressure, with several companies ending their ties to the group in the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre in Florida. Four major companies, Enterprise Holdings, First National Bank of Omaha, Symantec, and MetLife are among the first to call it quits after a #BoycottNRA hashtag started to pick up steam online late Thursday.

The confrontation presents Trump with a special opportunity, some say.

""The president has a unique ability right now to maybe

really do something about these school shootings,"" said Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., told The AP ""Nobody is more popular in my district — and I know in a lot of other people's districts — than Donald Trump. He's more popular than the NRA. ... So it's up to him whether or not anything happens with guns.""

Gun Owners of America issued an alert earlier this past week urging its 1.5 million members to call the White House and ""Tell Trump to OPPOSE All Gun Control!"" The organization said anti-gun activists aided by congressional Democrats are trying to convince the president he should ""support their disastrous gun control efforts,"" the message said, as reported by the wire service. ""And sadly, it may be working.""

Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for the Virginia-based

group, told The AP the organization doesn't hesitate to oppose Republican incumbents and candidates whom it deems not sufficiently ""pro-gun."" Motivating gun owners to go to the polls is the source of the gun lobby's strength, according to Hammond.

""When they feel gun ownership is threatened, then

they're going to respond as if that's the pre-eminent issue,"" he said.

Benjamin McDowell, 30, pleaded guilty Monday to being a felon in possession of a weapon, according to reports by multiple news outlets. He also could be fined $250,000 when he's sentenced at a later date.

Authorities first began investigating McDowell in December 2016 when he threatened a Myrtle Beach synagogue on Facebook. Local officials were already keeping tabs on him because he made friends with white supremacist groups and got tattoos associated with racist groups while in prison on a felony burglary charge, according to the FBI.

McDowell then said he wanted a gun and told an undercover FBI agent who offered to get him one that he planned to attack somewhere in the name of white power and write on the building ""in the spirit of Dylann Roof,"" according to court records. Roof was sentenced to death last year for a racist shooting that killed nine black worshippers at a Charleston, South Carolina, church.

""I seen what Dylann Roof did and in my heart I reckon I got a little bit of hatred,"" the undercover agent recalled McDowell saying.

McDowell, who couldn't legally own a gun because of the burglary conviction, was arrested after the purchase. Agents said McDowell bought the gun — which had the firing pin shaved down so that it would not work — and ammunition for $109, which he had borrowed from his grandfather."
fox177,['Matt Finn'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/22/ohio-school-districts-train-teachers-to-handle-guns-are-our-safety.html,"Two school districts near Dayton, Ohio have trained a confidential team of teachers and staff to fire back at an active shooter.

""Our staff members are trained to go to the threat and address the threat. Not to run away,” said Mad River Schools Superintendent Chad Wyen.

The Sidney and Mad River school districts have guns hidden in safes throughout its schools which can be opened only by staff on the armed response team. Each member of the team is vetted, selected by the district, and must have a license to carry. The team goes through “rigorous” monthly training.

“These teachers are trained and trained as well in the use of firearms as the average police officer,” said Sidney Middle School armed guard and veteran tactical officer, Rick Cron. “I made sure that that would happen. I didn’t want someone who wasn’t trained to come to my aid. I wanted people who understood tactics.”

As the gun debate plays out across the country following the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. – and many arguing over whether teachers should be trained and armed – some school districts are already taking bold steps to prevent a tragedy on campus. Schools in Texas, Indiana and even California started arming up after the fatal shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

The state of Ohio currently offers funding for schools to train their staff to respond in emergency situations. There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff who are trained to fire back, or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds.

In Ohio, many of the students seem to agree with some of their teachers being trained to use firearms.

“To have people inside the school who know what they are doing and who can protect us, I mean, that's amazing and I don't think there's really any room for complaints,” said Liberty Flynn, a 10th-grade student at Stebbins High School in Riverside, Ohio.

“When we are inside those four walls, they are our safety. That's our safety for the day,” said Stebbins High School sophomore, Will Rodriguez.

The school’s programs are not without controversy. It took years for the programs to get off the ground and be finalized. There are parents and members of the community that still disagree with armed staff.

“There’s a lot of pressure on teachers already. We got to get these kids into college and ready for life. Being trained with weapons and stuff like that is just not something they are prepared for,” said David Herzog. “Let the teachers teach and let the law enforcement take care of the laws.""

Sidney Police Chief William Balling said he’s not against the armed staff but worries it could interfere with his first responders.

“Because now you take away a possibility of one or two people with guns to six or seven people with guns without us having assurance who's the good guy or the bad guy,” Balling said.

The Shelby County Sheriff told Fox News he developed the plan for Sidney schools while watching the Sandy Hook tragedy unfold. He realized his schools were not prepared and took action.

""We cannot depend on the state or federal government,” said Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart. “We can't depend on psychologists to figure out why people hurt each other.""

Cron says he considers each trained staff member a certified backup and said they can significantly reduce critical response time.

“I would not do this job by myself,” Cron said. “Without the teachers, the response team teachers, I wouldn’t do it.”"

He has introduced the bill annually since he was elected in 2014, The Washington Times reported. Previous attempts have been turned down.

Neville, a Republican, told The Times the current law “creates a so-called gun free zone in every K-12 public school.”

Under Colorado law, concealed-carry permit holders may bring firearms onto school property, according to The Times, but must keep them locked inside their vehicles.

“Time and time again we point to the one common theme with mass shootings, they occur in gun-free zones,” Neville told The Times.

He added law-abiding citizens should be able “to defend themselves and most importantly our children from the worst-case scenarios.”

The massacre on Valentine’s Day of last week in Florida has renewed a nationwide debate about gun violence and how to prevent mass shootings.

Nikolas Cruz, 19, was suspected of opening fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where he was a former student, killing 17 people and injuring more than a dozen others.

Neville has contended, according to The Times, that more of his classmates would have survived the attack if faculty had been armed. In April 1999, two teens killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves inside Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colorado.

fox179,['Joseph Weber'],2018-02-19 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/19/florida-school-shooting-gun-law-changes-attract-renewed-gop-interest.html,"The massacre at a Florida high school has revived an all-too-familiar national debate on gun control – but this time, public pressure combined with fresh presidential interest could spur at least some changes in the country's gun laws.

Most recently, the White House said President Trump backs efforts to improve the country's background check system. His abrupt involvement could be the nudge for action in a Congress divided on virtually every issue.

“We want to make sure that the background check process is fully staffed and that all information gets in,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said Monday on ""Fox & Friends,"" describing the current system as a ""patchwork.""

Trump specifically has taken interest in bipartisan Senate legislation that would bolster the National Instant Criminal Background Check System -- a nationwide database for gun sellers that helps prevent the purchase of guns by criminals, the mentally ill and others considered too dangerous to own a firearm.

The Republican-controlled House already passed a measure to strengthen or fix the so-called NICS system, as part of legislation approved in December 2017 that also would allow gun owners more freedom to take a firearm across state lines.

“The House passed legislation to enforce existing law, improve compliance with the federal background check system, address the bump stock issue, as well as strengthen the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,” North Carolina GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, whose gun-reciprocity plan was included the measure, told Fox News on Monday.

The reciprocity provision is a conservative priority that might not attract bipartisan support in the Senate.

The Senate version, as originally introduced last fall, mostly focused on the background check system. Trump spoke last week with Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican and co-sponsor of that ""Fix NICS"" measure.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that their discussion focused on efforts to “improve federal compliance” with criminal background check legislation. She said the president is “supportive” of such efforts but cautioned that “discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered.”

Cornyn has been working on a version of the bill since at least last year and suggested well before the Florida massacre that it had “good bipartisan support.” The plan also tries to ensure that federal and state authorities submit critical information like criminal convictions to the database.

The National Rifle Association, considered the country’s most influential gun-rights group, also is backing congressional efforts to improve the system.

Whether this leads to congressional action, or political point-scoring, remains to be seen.

Both the NRA and Trump were hammered by gun control advocates in the wake of last week's massacre, where the shooter had an AR-15-style rifle. Trump took heat for his initial comments focusing largely on the issue of mental health.

He, in turn, has hammered the FBI after the bureau admitted it failed to follow up on clear warnings about the shooter.

“Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable,” he tweeted, accusing agents of being distracted by the Russia probe.

Other presidents have put their support behind efforts to stop gun violence, only to see such initiatives fail in Congress, most notably after gunman Adam Lanza killed seven adults and 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012.

“As a country, we have been through this too many times,” then-President Barack Obama said afterward. “We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.”

However, the Senate, then controlled by the president’s fellow Democrats, couldn’t pass any proposals to change gun laws.

The gun control debate has played out after virtually every mass shooting since April 1999, when two teens killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves inside their Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colo.

But the most-recent calls for action could escalate the pressure -- including nationwide rallies planned next month by students who survived last week’s shooting in Florida. Seventeen people were killed in the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla.

Trump is scheduled Wednesday to host students and teachers at the White House to talk about school safety. And he plans to meet Thursday with state and local officials on the issue.

A frequent Trump critic, Ohio's moderate Republican Gov. John Kasich, has publicly urged Trump to lead efforts to curb gun violence.

“Mr. President, America needs real leadership. We need to take common sense steps NOW to protect our kids. From one father to another, let’s protect them,” he tweeted over the weekend.

Kasich says he remains a strong Second Amendment supporter but is calling for changes – perhaps at a state or local level – such as improving background checks and increasing attention on the connection between mental illness and gun violence. (A pro-gun section on his political website reportedly was scrubbed amid his new calls for changes to the law.)

While Kasich's view is unlikely to shape presidential policy, other factors are at play. Al Hoffman Jr., a prominent Republican political donor, reportedly has vowed to withhold contributions from candidates who don’t support a ban on the sale of assault weapons. And he suggested he would rally other GOP donors to follow his lead.

Such an ultimatum would be an unexpected turn in the Washington debate over guns laws, and it's unclear how much support Hoffman might get from fellow donors.

A major argument from Second Amendment advocates is that tougher laws won’t keep guns away from potential mass killers and others committing or trying to commit crimes.

Another reason why gun legislation in difficult to pass in Congress is that Republicans, particularly from rural or other conservative districts, could face tough primary challenges if they vote for stricter laws.

As for Cornyn's plan, Hudson said he’s yet to see the text of the legislation but encouraged senators to consider his Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017.

Hudson submitted his measure after 25 people were killed in November 2017 at a Texas church by a former Air Force member.

The Air Force later admitted it had failed to enter into a federal database that the killer had been convicted in 2004 of domestic violence, a charge that could have prevented him from buying a gun."
fox180,['Howard Kurtz'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/trumps-early-move-on-guns-could-bridge-partisan-gap.html,"Donald Trump could be the president who pushes Congress to do something about gun control, even if those steps are modest.

Perhaps only a Republican president—and one elected with the full backing of the NRA—would be positioned to take such steps.

But rather than welcoming Trump's move in their direction, gun control advocates are initially dismissing his efforts as inadequate.

For a quarter century, virtually any effort at regulating the sale of guns has fallen victim to Washington gridlock. Ever since Congress let Bill Clinton’s assault-weapon ban expire in the 1990s, the issue has been seen as politically radioactive, not just by Republicans but by moderate Democrats as well.

Even after the school shooting in Newtown, even with Barack Obama and Joe Biden mounting a sustained push for some gun-control measures, Congress did nothing. There was no way the Republicans were going to give Obama even a minor concession on the issue.

Then came last year's Las Vegas massacre, and an outcry over the shooter's use of bump stocks to boost the speed of his attack. But nothing happened.

And yet the Florida school shooting, and the gruesome spectacle of children being gunned down, seems to have brought the issue to a potential tipping point.

When the conservative, pro-Trump New York Post is running such banner headlines as ""MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE ACT"" and yesterday’s ""HOPE FOR GUN CONTROL""—with a photo of protesting Florida students--it's clear that the national mood is changing.

Even Pat Robertson, the onetime GOP presidential candidate, said on his ""700 Club"": ""I am a gun owner. I have hunted. I have shot skeet,"" Robertson said. ""But for heaven's sakes, I don't think that the general population needs to have automatic weapons.""

Trump has ordered the Justice Department to speed up an existing review and issue regulations banning bump stocks. He has also signaled he is open to arguments about tighter background checks and raising the age limit for purchases of such weapons as an AR-15 rifle, the one used in Parkland.

This comes from a president who embraced the Second Amendment during the campaign and said of the group that backed him financially: ""To the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.""

Of course, after yesterday's gut-wrenching session with students, teachers and parents who went through mass shootings, Trump also said that arming people in schools could be part of the solution--an approach favored by the NRA.

A Quinnipiac poll out yesterday said that 97 percent (!) of Americans favor universal background checks for gun purchases. Some 66 percent favor stricter gun laws, and 67 percent favor a ban on assault weapons.

There is a partisan divide, with only 34 percent of Republicans supporting stricter gun laws, but 43 percent back an assault weapons ban.

Washington's paralysis on these issues speaks to more than the clout of the NRA. Many lawmakers are just afraid of alienating gun owners, who are passionate and highly motivated voters.

Now it's true the NRA doesn't oppose some of these measures, such as regulating bump stocks (though it doesn't want legislative action on the matter).

But Trump does have a Nixon-goes-to-China opportunity here. He could detoxify the issue for many Republicans, bringing enough along to join with liberal Democrats in passing modest legislation.

It's just as possible that, like immigration, this issue will become embroiled in partisanship and the moment will pass.

Trump has already remade the Republican Party in his image, drawing considerable criticism from those who don't like him or his policies. But what if, in the wake of the Florida tragedy, he moved the party toward a more centrist and popular position?"

Authorities responsible for protecting the school, Dalton High School, where Jesse Randal Davidson worked, said they were not aware of the episode until this week, The Associated Press reported.

Davidson was taken to the hospital for a mental evaluation and his rifles were seized for safe-keeping after he torched the Mitsubishi Outlander on Aug. 13, 2016.

The report also showed Davidson has been hospitalized at least three times in recent years as people worried about his state of mind.

GEORGIA TEACHER WHO FIRED GUN IN CLASSROOM PREVIOUSLY TOLD POLICE HE HIRED HITMEN, REPORT SAYS

Davidson, 53, did not hit anyone when he allegedly fired a handgun out his classroom window Wednesday but it caused chaos and immediate calls to abandon the idea of arming teachers as a solution to school shootings. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have endorsed arming teachers following the killings of 17 people at a Florida high school last month.

Davidson faces six charges including aggravated assault; terroristic threats and acts; and having a weapon on school property.

The additional details about Davidson's past run-ins with law enforcement emerged as the school reopened Friday.

A deputy saw heavy smoke and flames pouring from the Mitsubishi as he pulled up to Davidson's home in the small community of Rising Fawn, Georgia, the sheriff's report said. The deputy told Davidson's wife Lisa and their daughter Megan to seek safety in his patrol car.

Davidson's adult son, Johnny, told the deputy that his father ""was not acting like himself and was sitting down with a rifle in the back yard watching the vehicle on fire.""

GEORGIA TEACHER IN CUSTODY AFTER ALLEGEDLY OPENING FIRE IN CLASSROOM, POLICE SAY

Davidson’s son was able to talk his father into giving up the gun and two other weapons were also seized.

In another incident, Davidson reportedly walked into the lobby of the Dalton police headquarters and allegedly made up a story about someone who was murdered. Detectives could not verify Davidson’s claim and he was taken to the hospital after he expressed thoughts about killing himself.

In another incident, school employees and a police officer began searching Dalton High in January 2017 after Davidson went missing. He was later found sitting on the curb along a street a few blocks from the campus, being propped up by two school staff members, police said.

Davidson’s family faced financial hardship recently, federal court records showed. The family filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in late 2015. As part of that case, the teacher listed six rifles and one shotgun on a list of assets he owned.

School officials say they can't talk about mental health issues of specific staff members. But Dalton High Principal Steve Bartoo told reporters that ""as far as I know he was fit to be at work.""

""We don't allow anyone in a classroom unless they are capable of doing their job and fit for their position,"" school system spokeswoman Pat Holloway said.

But school officials might not have been aware that his guns had been taken the day his family car was burned.

""I very seriously doubt that they knew about that incident,"" Dade County Sheriff's Sgt. Chad Payne said Friday.

""It resulted in him being transported for a mental evaluation,"" Payne said. ""Once he's in that ambulance and on the way to the hospital, his medical care becomes private so I doubt that they would know anything about it.""

Thousands of students, parents and teachers attended rallies over the weekend in support of stronger gun control legislation. And many of them blamed politicians – particularly those who have accepted donations from the National Rifle Association (NRA), a nonprofit that supports gun rights.

Here’s a look at what 15 Republican senators have said about gun control in the aftermath of the deadly shooting on Feb. 14.

John Boozman, Arkansas

When Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., was a student in Arkansas, he said it wasn’t uncommon for “young people to actually bring their rifles to school during deer season.” But, he told KARK-TV, “nobody at that time entertained the thought of doing such a horrendous thing” as shooting individuals in a school.

Boozman says the ""heart of the problem"" facing the U.S. is a mix of drugs, gangs, mental health and the “break-up of the family,” which, he argued, can be the catalyst behind these recent tragedies.

""Throwing money at the problem or passing a law that simply would not make any difference is not the answer – even though it might make us all feel better."" - Sen. John Boozman

“My understanding is, if you look at all the instances like these that have happened in recent history, that all of the things that have been proposed in Congress to counter them would not have made any difference,” Boozman told KARK. “Throwing money at the problem or passing a law that simply would not make any difference is not the answer – even though it might make us all feel better.”

He said he wants to see the country be able to more easily identify “these young white males that are definitely mentally ill, very unstable,” and be able to “somehow restrain them.”

Susan Collins, Maine

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told the Bangor Daily News that she’s sponsored several bills in Congress that would prohibit people on a no-fly list from purchasing guns as well as strengthen background checks.

“What happened [in Florida] is not only so horrific a tragedy, but it also has happened far too many times in this country,” she said.

John Cornyn, Texas

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has spoken to President Trump about a bipartisan bill designed to strengthen the FBI database of prohibited gun buyers, according to the White House.

The bill, which he introduced last year alongside Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., would penalize federal agencies that fail to provide the necessary records and reward states that comply with federal grant preferences and other incentives.

Ted Cruz, Texas

Appearing on Fox News, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, criticized Democrats for what he said was their attempt to “politicize” a tragedy – including by advocating to “take away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.”

Cruz mentioned the mass shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017 and said the survivors told him “gun control is not the answer.”

“The answer is to focus on criminals, to focus on violent criminals,” Cruz said.

The former presidential contender has also battled CNN in the wake of the shooting. The cable news network accused Cruz, along with other Republicans, of being “unwilling” to appear on CNN to talk about gun control.

Cruz pushed back on Twitter, saying he did a 15-minute interview with CNN “about proactive solutions to prevent gun violence,” but said the network “aired NONE of it.”

Joni Ernst, Iowa

After the shooting, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said there should be a balance between supporting existing gun laws and not restricting Second Amendment rights.

“While we must enforce current federal gun laws to prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands, we can and must do so in a way that respects our Constitution,” Ernst told KCCI-TV.

""The root cause is not that we have the Second Amendment; it is that we’re not adequately addressing mental illness across the United States."" - Sen. Joni Ernst

She also told reporters on a conference call that the problem isn’t guns, but societal issues that can be helped with better access to mental health services, the Des Moines Register reported.

“The root cause is not that we have the Second Amendment,” Ernst said. “It is that we’re not adequately addressing mental illness across the United States. We need to focus on that, and we need to focus on substance abuse.”

Cory Gardner, Colorado

Like other Republicans, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., has said the school shooting should serve as an example for lawmakers to better improve mental health initiatives.

“Now is the time to have a discussion about what we can do to break down the barriers that prevent help going to people who need it – whether that’s a substance abuse issue or whether that’s a mental health concern,” Gardner said, according to the Denver Post.

Gardner called for a probe into whether authorities took earlier complaints about the alleged gunman seriously enough.

“We need to understand why those reports weren’t investigated or further action wasn’t taken,” he said.

Chuck Grassley, Iowa

After the shooting, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told fellow lawmakers he planned to sit down with some of them to discuss gun legislation, CBS News reported.

The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman responded to a request from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and said he would to talk to her and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.

Both senators have introduced legislation pertaining to gun control. Feinstein, in particular, is seeking to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase rifles.

Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., accused gun control advocates of attempting to “take a tragedy and try to capitalize on it.”

“Every time there’s an incident, people somehow think if you take away guns from law-abiding citizens, the criminal element will give up their guns voluntarily,” Inhofe told WJLA-TV. “It doesn’t make sense to me.”

John Kennedy, Louisiana

According to Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., the “first way to stop a shooter is to shoot back.”

Kennedy is advocating for active shooter drills and trained security personnel on hand in schools. He told WVUE-TV he's not going to support ""more gun control.""

“I don't think gun control keeps guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have guns,” Kennedy said. “I think criminals and those who are mentally ill obey gun laws pretty much like politicians keep promises.”

“I think our problem is not gun control; it’s idiot control,” he quipped.

James Lankford, Oklahoma

While he’s not on board with a ban of so-called assault weapons, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called for stronger background checks in the wake of the Florida school shooting.

“The problem is not owning an AR-15, it’s the person who owns it,” Lankford told NBC News, adding that he doesn’t believe the AR-15 should be more difficult to buy.

He pushed for reform to strengthen background checks on individuals purchasing firearms, especially in some “rural departments or federal entities.”

Lankford strongly advocated for the “Fix NICS Act,” from Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn. The bill ""penalizes federal agencies who fail to properly report relevant records and incentivizes states to improve their overall reporting,"" Cornyn described in a post on his website.

Lisa Murkowski, Alaska

Like some of her Republican colleagues, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, focused on mental health efforts in the wake of the shooting.

“I think we all know that there is no one single initiative that is going to be able to stop what happened in Florida or what has happened in — unfortunately — far too many other areas, where, again, you think there’s a level of safety and security and there’s not,” Murkowski told Vox.

She added that Alaska has a “very serious deficiency when it comes to mental health providers.”

Mike Rounds, South Dakota

In an interview with NPR, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., encouraged people not to get too caught up in the type of firearm used in the school shooting.

“You can call any type of a series of different types of guns assault weapon, and suddenly then they become a demonized item,” Rounds said. “And then suddenly it sounds like we've done something. The reality is there's a whole lot of different types of weapons that can be utilized whether you're talking about a handgun, or you're talking about a shotgun, or you're talking about a rifle…”

Rounds said Congress “could do a better job,” but added that he supports the Second Amendment.

“All we have to do is take away one particular type of weapon – that suddenly becomes the discussion point. And suddenly we all feel good about having done something. And in reality, we haven’t done something,” he said.

Marco Rubio, Florida

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has borne the brunt of criticism in the wake of the school shooting in his state, given his positions on gun control. He said the issue is ""complicated,” but “not unsolvable.”

“If a bill makes things better, we should vote for it and keep working,"" Rubio told WFOR-TV. ""But we’re in an era now where everybody wants to get 100 percent of what they want or they’ll just walk away.""

""There’s this false narrative out there that says just because you want to deal with mental illness means you don’t want to deal with the gun part."" - Sen. Marco Rubio

Rubio said it should have been “impossible” for the alleged gunman in Parkland to have been able to obtain the firearm he did, though he added that he respects law-abiding citizens who want to own a weapon like an AR-15 for sport or protection.

“There’s this false narrative out there that says just because you want to deal with mental illness means you don’t want to deal with the gun part. I’m willing to deal with the gun part. I don’t think people like this guy or people like him should be able to have any gun, not an AR-15, any gun. We need to create a system that keeps them from getting it,” Rubio said.

Rubio also embraced a Democratic bill in the Florida legislature to allow courts to temporarily prevent people from having guns if they are determined to be a threat to themselves or others.

Tim Scott, South Carolina

After the deadly Florida shooting, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said the “system in place simply was not followed.""

“We all say, ‘If you see something, say something,’” Scott told CBS News. “In [the] Parkland community, we saw people reporting there were 20 calls to the sheriff's department, they responded. The FBI received a legitimate, credible tip and it was not followed up upon.""

Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania

On social media, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., assured the public of his commitment to “improving our federal background check system.”

“I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them – criminals, the dangerously mentally ill and terrorists,” Toomey said.

After all, if you can print solid objects that work in three dimensional space, the possibilities seem endless – and those come with a huge responsibility. What if you make a mistake in your designs, and what you had intended to be a table ends up as some kind of arcane killing device?

Maybe you were trying to make something relatively innocuous like a shoe, but end up adding in a trigger, targeting scope, and place to insert bullets? Well, that last worry is a thing of the past, thanks to a 3D printer company that has invented a “firearm component detection algorithm.”

According to a press release by Danish company Create It REAL, the company’s new software will “prevent 3D printing of guns” by recognizing not designs for specific guns, but instead specific components that would be used in the construction of the firearms.

“There have been debates in the media on how to stop people from printing guns on their 3D printers,” the release explains. “Banning the technology would mean a huge regression towards what The Economist called the ‘third industrial revolution,’” the release continues, adding that “Banning the files which contain the 3D information of a gun does not seem to be possible in the times of digital file sharing.”

Instead, the company announced, it has created “smart software” that “upon opening a 3D file… scans the model and tries to match its characteristics with the characteristics of a firearm. If certain features align, the software will not allow the user to view and print the model.”

There are, of course, some obvious drawbacks to this model of 3D printing control (or censorship, as a harsh way to put it). For one, it relies upon specific characteristics of a weapon to be present before the design gets blocked, which is a somewhat scattershot – pun only slightly intended – way to go about things. What if someone designed a 3D printer gun that lacked traditional characteristics? Or, on the flip side, what about other non-gun objects that may match the characteristics by accident? Will those objects be similarly blocked by the software? For what it’s worth, Create It REAL CEO Jérémie Pierre Gay said that “printing other, non-firearm models is of course still possible.”

The new software is, at best, a well-meaning development that could give concerned parties some relief. Whether it can truly prevent someone determined to make their own 3D-printed gun is less obvious. After all, the only way around this barrier is to use a printer that doesn’t already have this software pre-installed."
