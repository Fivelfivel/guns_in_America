What happened?  According to law enforcement officials, a local Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident confronted 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley after he opened fire on parishioners in the town's First Baptist Church.    CNN reports that when Kelly opened fire on the church with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, a local resident grabbed his own rifle and engaged Kelly, causing him to stop firing on the church, get into a vehicle and run. From there, a chase ensued and Kelly ended up dead. It's not clear if the resident shot Kelly or if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot.

What happened?  According to law enforcement officials, a local Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident confronted 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley after he opened fire on parishioners in the town's First Baptist Church.    CNN reports that when Kelly opened fire on the church with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, a local resident grabbed his own rifle and engaged Kelly, causing him to stop firing on the church, get into a vehicle and run. From there, a chase ensued and Kelly ended up dead. It's not clear if the resident shot Kelly or if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot.    The resident who engaged Kelly ran into a man's truck to chase him. That man, Johnnie Langendorff, told his story to local news stations.    What did Langendorff say?

What happened?  According to law enforcement officials, a local Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident confronted 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley after he opened fire on parishioners in the town's First Baptist Church.    CNN reports that when Kelly opened fire on the church with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, a local resident grabbed his own rifle and engaged Kelly, causing him to stop firing on the church, get into a vehicle and run. From there, a chase ensued and Kelly ended up dead. It's not clear if the resident shot Kelly or if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot.    The resident who engaged Kelly ran into a man's truck to chase him. That man, Johnnie Langendorff, told his story to local news stations.    What did Langendorff say?

What happened?  According to law enforcement officials, a local Sutherland Springs, Texas, resident confronted 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley after he opened fire on parishioners in the town's First Baptist Church.    CNN reports that when Kelly opened fire on the church with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, a local resident grabbed his own rifle and engaged Kelly, causing him to stop firing on the church, get into a vehicle and run. From there, a chase ensued and Kelly ended up dead. It's not clear if the resident shot Kelly or if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot.    The resident who engaged Kelly ran into a man's truck to chase him. That man, Johnnie Langendorff, told his story to local news stations.    What did Langendorff say?

The New York Daily News, a notoriously liberal newspaper, pushed the claim on its front cover on Saturday. \"Trained By The NRA: School shooter excelled in marksmanship program sponsored by gun group,\" the cover said.    https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/964678174612234240    Meanwhile, progressive outlet Think Progress further claimed: \"The NRA donated $10,000 to help train the Parkland shooting suspect  to use a rifle.\"    At face value, the outlets appear to position the National Rifle Association as culpable in the horrific shooting. But in reality, the NRA had nothing to do with the shooting or the shooter.    What's the truth?  What the stories don't mention is that NRA monies helped fund a program for the JROTC program the shooter was a member of when he attended high school. \u2026", "og:type": "article", "og:url": "http://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/17/debunked-mainstream-media-claims-florida-shooter-trained-by-the-nra-but-heres-the-truth", "og:site_name": "TheBlaze", "og:image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-159576904-1-1280x720.jpg", "article:published_time": "2018-02-17T16:00:21-05:00", "article:tag": "Florida school shooting", "msapplication-tilecolor": "#e92500", "msapplication-tileimage": "https://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/themes/theblaze/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/themes/theblaze/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#e92500", "fb:pages": "140738092630206", "ia:markup_url_dev": "https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/02/17/debunked-mainstream-media-claims-florida-shooter-trained-by-the-nra-but-heres-the-truth?ia_markup=1", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-17 16:00:21", "sailthru.guid": "theblaze/1497242", "sailthru.tags": "florida-school-shooting, jrotc, mainstream-media, media, media-bias, nra, author-christopher-enloe, site-theblaze, post, channel: News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-159576904-1-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-159576904-1-1280x720.jpg", "sailthru.channels": "News"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "https://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-159576904-1-1280x720.jpg"}]}}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "Decorated Vet Who Was Arrested After 'Rudely Displaying' His Rifle ...", "htmlTitle": "Decorated Vet Who Was Arrested After &#39;Rudely Displaying&#39; His <b>Rifle</b> ...", "link": "https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/05/03/decorated-vet-who-was-arrested-after-rudely-displaying-his-rifle-on-hike-with-teen-son-gets-a-huge-shock-at-the-nra-convention", "displayLink": "www.theblaze.com", "snippet": "May 3, 2013 ...
